 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the effort here today. Now it  is a gun problem. I believe we are moving illegal immigrants into  national parks in New York, and I suppose around the rest of the  country, because we have a numbers problem. No, it isn't a gun problem.   It isn't even that the immigration system is so broken, it is just  not being enforced. We have laws in place that would actually work if  they were enforced. It is crazy. No wonder people think Congress is out  of its mind with some of the stuff that goes on because we, oh, are  going to fill up the parks, starting in New York and other areas of the  country, and it will end up in the West because we don't have enough  space.   There is a green light at our open border. We have had sanctuary  cities inviting them in, and now they are seeing the results, finally,  of Democrat policies that have put us in this place.   Indeed, this is not a long-term problem, so much as it has been  intense the last 3 years during the Biden administration. This is not a  commonsense solution I hear on the other side about guns or filling the  parks with illegal immigrants. It is about controlling the border where  the root cause is and not trying to gloss over it with this sort of  policy.   Mr. Chair, this is a good policy to get started in the right  direction.    Mr. Speaker, as the conversation has been, we know that  border security actually is national security.   President Biden's open border policies have incentivized a historic  surge in illegal immigration at our southern and northern borders and  the impact we are seeing lately on our national parks.   Since President Biden taking office, there have been over 6.4 million  illegal crossings of our southern border and 1.7 million known got- aways who evaded U.S. Border Patrol.   Every State is now a border State. Every town is now a border town.  Democrats are using the national parks to house illegal immigrants-- think how absurd that is--which only further encourages this crisis.   Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned Biden's border crisis.  We must stop incentivizing further waves of illegal immigrants by  providing them with free housing--again, the latest scheme being  housing them in our national parks.   We will continue to fight to secure our border and eliminate the  financial burdens these illegal immigrants are putting on American  taxpayers and our towns.   That is why earlier this year we passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border  Act, which is the strongest border security package in American  history.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from Hawaii  for yielding.   I would chime in as well on the importance of improving and expanding  rural health and the challenges faced in the most rural areas of our  country, including my own northern California district.   We have several high country hospitals that are out on their own  pretty much. The connectivity that they need and the challenges that  pertain to some levels of equality on reimbursements is extremely  important, so I would be happy to join with Representative Tokuda's  efforts and that of the Rural Healthcare Caucus.   Indeed, as we expand and get more and more telehealth opportunities,  something that has worked pretty well for us in our district is  teaching health centers; getting young folks as students, and maybe  young doctors, interested in working in our communities here, as well.   It just helps extend the opportunities for people that do live in  these rural areas and don't have nearly the choices. That is part of  the cost, I guess, of living in a rural area.   We have done a lot of good work with the USDA, expanding fiber optic,  getting more and more connectivity. We need to keep doing that in order  to be more successful for rural America.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this effort, and a bipartisan effort it is.    Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join my colleague from Utah in  this role here tonight. I appreciate his stepping forward to take this  on.   It is very important to help communicate what we are up to here. We  have had much discussion this afternoon on the border and the effects  of a nonborder policy since the Biden administration has been in  charge. It has been difficult enough as it is over several years when  President Trump very strongly attempted and had some level of success  in securing our border with more fencing and more personnel. Since then  it has been completely undone by the Biden administration.   We have personnel going down there and actually welding the gates  open and doing everything they can, suing the State of Texas to remove  barriers in the river there that would normally help deter this illegal  immigration, this massive wave that is coming in, indeed, it is called  an invasion by many. I will echo that.   Why is it?   It is not because we don't have enough laws or, oh, we need  immigration reform. Maybe there is something that we could be doing.   H.R. 2 that we passed earlier this year in this House would actually  help supplement the laws that are already on the books and funding and  some of the other measures that would help modernize what flaws there  might be, but make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, this is a flaw in the  enforcement of our border.   We already have immigration policy on the books. In the good old days  you might say that we welcomed people to this country, but under our  rules. We had rules as to who the new immigrants are going to be here,  whether they are to be citizens or folks just seeking permits for work  or for tourist visas or student visas or this or that. The rules are  pretty much out the window.    Mr. Speaker, how do you have a country and how do you have  sovereignty if you don't have any rules and the laws are not followed  that are presently already in place?   It is not that tough.   What has changed has been the Biden administration to make what  already has been kind of difficult many times worse, and that is where  the problem lies.   Our border could be enforced within a short amount of time by  building the barrier and having the personnel be able to do their  actual job instead of horrific accusations of what they have done. We  saw that false narrative put out that the mounted border personnel were  somehow whipping people with the reins and the whips or something while  horseback. It was a complete lie. That is part of the whole problem  with this administration is that they don't get the truth out to the  American people. They hide and distort what it is their horrific  policies have been doing.   The same applies to the Hamas situation and our friend and ally  Israel. The barbaric attack by Hamas on October 7 on Israel didn't  actually come out of nowhere. It was a planned attack funded by Iran  which is, of course, we know the largest sponsor of terrorism.   Biden's failure to put pressure on Iran for the last 3 years has  emboldened Iran and enabled Hamas to launch its deadly assault. Indeed,  they go back to the Obama administration where that horrific policy and  that agreement was put in place.   President Trump tried to peel it back and take it back. Indeed, he  did get a pause on that situation. We are right back at it again,  empowering Iran to do what they do.   So the latest was unfreezing $6 billion worth of assets in this  country to help foster and fund the cause of Iran's doing. It was very  reckless. It just gives more incentives to foreign adversaries. It also  gives weird messages and weird signals to our allies, of course,  Israel, and also others with whom we are forming the Abraham Accords  alliances with including in process with Saudi Arabia.   Now, what are they supposed to think is America's position on all of  this?   So when we have an opportunity, as we do in this House with this  Republican majority, to say ``no'' to unfreezing $6 billion worth of  assets to Iran, we need to do that. So we will consider a No Funds for  Iranian Terrorism Act which imposes immediate mandatory sanctions on  any financial institution that engages in a transaction with the Qatari  banks holding the $6 billion of Iranian funds which will effectively  freeze the money.                                time  1700    Of course, the Biden administration needs to get this idea through  their head already without us having to do this.   Whether it is the Middle East situation in Israel or our own border  here, they need to get their act together. They need to put some  commonsense goggles on for a moment and just really look at what the  problem is.   Politically, how they go into 2024 thinking this is good with the  lack of energy policy, the driver of inflation, mass amounts of  government spending, and the horrific energy policy, shutting down the  pipeline, shutting down the ability to drill, and forcing people into  electric cars. It is just a well-rounded discussion here what the Biden  administration has put upon the American people and our allies around  the world.   We can do a lot to improve the situation and help Israel bring  stability back to the Middle East, bring stability to our border by  just simply enforcing our border and putting those things in place and  not having a green light to come across our border and get all the  benefits of being a U.S. citizen without having to be a citizen,  including putting them into the national parks in New York City and  others. It just an unbelievable policy or lack of policy, lack of  foresight.   It rests in the Biden administration and there is really lot of  incompetence. Let's take step A with the No Funds for Iranian Terrorism  Act and also a very important step on the border with finishing the  fencing. We have material laying around that we are paying for storage.  Let's allow the border personnel to do their job instead of running a  welcome wagon. Wouldn't that be something?
