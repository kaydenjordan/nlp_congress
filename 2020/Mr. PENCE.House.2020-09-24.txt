 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sixth District hero  Greenfield Police Officer Blake Crull.   Officer Crull was on a routine patrol when he saw a flipped car on  fire. He sprang into action and ran toward the danger. With no regard  for his personal safety, Officer Crull saved a woman from the burning  car, which exploded mere moments later.   Brave acts such as Officer Crull's are the very reason I will always  back the blue and never defund the police. I thank Officer Crull for  his courageous and brave service to our community.                     Fighting for Conservative Principles     Mr. Speaker, as Indiana's Sixth District Representative,  it is my duty to fight for the conservative Hoosier principles on which  my constituents sent me to Washington.   My Republican colleagues and I are committed to the American people.  We will renew the American Dream. We achieve this by making sure  students can attend a great school, no matter their ZIP Code, by  honoring the service of our veterans with good healthcare and job  opportunities, and by supporting technical education.   We will restore our way of life. We achieve this by defeating COVID- 19, by defending our police and not defunding them, and by upholding  our constitutional rights.   We will rebuild the greatest economy our Nation has ever seen. We  achieve this by getting Americans back to work, by ending our  dependence on China, and by upgrading America's infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, America is worth fighting for. This is our commitment to  America.                   American Soybean Association Centennial     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the American  Soybean Association centennial celebration.   One hundred years ago, the American Soybean Association was started  in my home State of Indiana at Soyland Farms in Camden. Today, the  association advocates for our great soybean farmers while promoting the  growth of the U.S. soybean industry, a thriving Hoosier asset and  industry.   Congratulations to the association on its 100th year. As a supporter  of the ag industry, I wish them the best of luck in the next 100 years.                          Recognizing Future of Work     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Future of Work  initiative in Muncie, Indiana, for its leadership in the 21st century  workforce development.   The Future of Work organization includes Innovation Connector, Ivy  Tech Community College, Ball State University, Purdue Polytechnic,  Muncie-Delaware County Economic Development, Muncie Community Schools,  Eastern Indiana Works, Ball Brothers Foundation, and East Central  Indiana Regional Partnership.   It is paving the way for students and jobseekers to prepare for  careers in technology, engineering, and manufacturing. I thank Future  of Work for helping young Americans develop skills to join the 21st  century workforce.                         Supporting Second Amendment     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my proud support of the  Second Amendment.   The Constitution affords the right of the people to keep and bear  arms, and that shall not be infringed.   As a lifetime member of the NRA, I understand what it is like to have  your constitutional rights attacked. We take a look at the riots,  looting, and danger right here on our own front doorsteps, and we see  that the ability to protect our families and ourselves has never been  more important.   As the Representative from Indiana's Sixth District, I promise to  uphold the Constitution.             Applauding Trump Administration's Support of Farmers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the Trump  administration's commitment to our great American farmers.   This week, the USDA announced $14 billion for agricultural producers  who continue to face market disruptions and associated costs due to  COVID-19.   President Trump made a promise to put American farmers first, and he  is doing just that. This commitment to farmers has helped the  hardworking Sixth District Hoosier farmers who have been impacted by  this pandemic. Our ag community feeds this Nation, and I applaud the  Trump administration's unwavering support.                            ____________________
