 Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today  to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour with my esteemed colleague from  Texas (Mr. Veasey). For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak  directly to the American people on issues of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent,  and all Americans.   This evening, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), my friend and colleague, I  first thank him for his continued leadership of the caucus and on  issues impacting Black America and other minority communities across  this great Nation.   I would also like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my  colleague, for joining me in chairing this evening's Special Order  hour, and my other CBC colleagues who are joining us to speak on  important issues.   Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to address the first 100 days of the  Trump Presidency and its impact on minority communities like the  district I represent and those of my fellow CBC colleagues.  Specifically, we will highlight 100 actions taken by this  administration in the last 100 days with less than positive impact to  the communities we represent.   The President hails his first 100 days as the most successful in the  history of the United States. These actions, however, do not spell  success for low income and minority communities. Actions that, in turn,  roll back Department of Justice protections designed to ensure police  accountability; actions that threaten to further restrict voting rights  and undermine the public education system; actions that threaten  [[Page H2996]]  access to quality affordable health care for millions of Americans,  including children, seniors, and those with preexisting medical  conditions; actions that propose gutting programs, HUD, and others that  provide housing assistance for extremely low-income families and the  homeless; mean-spirited actions that break up families and make  immigrant communities less safe; and actions that roll back important  environmental protections which serve to, among other things, ensure  safe air and drinking waters in communities like Flint, Michigan, and  mitigating the effects of climate change in vulnerable coastal  communities like my home district of the United States Virgin Islands.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus has reached out to  President Trump and is willing to work with his administration to  continue to build upon the greatness of this country--and not just for  the privileged few but for all.   As representatives of a congressional district that is home to the  only HBCU outside the continental United States, I take exception to  the administration's Education Secretary viewing HBCUs as pioneers for  school choice, even though these institutions were founded because  White colleges and universities refused to admit Black students.   This statement illustrates a lack of understanding of the history of  the African Americans and the Black community. President Trump's  proposed budget for the Department of Education plans to eliminate  afterschool and teacher-support programs, as well as slashing funding  for Federal supplemental education opportunity grants, Pell grants, and  instead divert Federal funds to private school vouchers. This plan  would be devastating to communities like my home district where almost  one-third of the children live below the poverty line and where public  schools are already struggling to make the best with limited funds and  resources.                                time  2015    President Trump's budget proposal would also cut the Department of  Health and Human Services' budget by $12.6 billion, a 16 percent cut.  In my home district of the United States Virgin Islands, HHS funds  critical early childhood education; and nutrition programs provide  assistance to seniors, low-income families, and funding for mental  health programs.   Mr. Speaker, these and other actions that my colleagues will speak  about are not to criticize the President, but more to highlight the  importance of funding of these programs and, more importantly,  highlighting how important these programs and government functions are  to American families and to the safety and progress of our communities.  America, stay woke. There are still more than 1,300 days to go.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).    Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Veasey) is correct about staying focused and, in the lexicon of the  young people, to stay woke about what is happening.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey) gave some great examples about  some of the things that happened in this first 100 days that should  make us aware how this is, in some ways, an assault on distressed  communities, on minority communities. The gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Veasey) spoke to some of them.   One of the things I wanted to highlight is a booklet that the  Congressional Black Caucus has put out about 100 actions that have  taken place in these 100 days:   President Trump's proposed budget would eliminate the Economic  Development Administration at the Department of Commerce. In 2015, EDA  invested 38 percent of its funds in highly distressed areas, including  communities with high minority populations, such as the gentleman from  Texas' and mine.   President Trump's proposed budget would eliminate the Community  Development Financial Institutions Fund. People ask, What is that? This  is an organization which channels investments into communities in need  of capital for housing, small businesses, and community facilities.  That is its sole function.   President Trump said that the private sector already did a good job  making investments in these communities, which demonstrates how out of  touch and ill-informed he and his administration are. His  administration needs to tell him and give him the facts about what is  going on in minority and underdeveloped communities.   As we will hear from our colleagues, there are areas in which  environmental protection and climate change, social justice for  environmental justice needs to take place. President Trump's proposed  budget would cut environmental protection agencies, environmental  justice programs that work to ensure the fair treatment and meaningful  involvement of all people regardless of race, color, and national  origin or income with the respect to the development, implementation,  and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. It  would simply cut it out of place.   The proposed budget would cut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration's coastal programs, which would affect populations,  including minorities living along the Gulf Coast and other coastal  areas.   At this time, we have other members of the Congressional Black Caucus  that are here to talk about environmental justice.   This freshman Member has really stepped in and just taken a hold of  actions and demonstrating a love for his constituents in coming here  this evening and wanting to address environmental justice areas.   I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin).   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, every Monday, Representatives Plaskett and  Veasey lead our Caucus' discussion on issues of great importance to the  American people, and I am glad to be joining them this evening to  discuss a critical priority that is often overlooked: environmental  justice.   Our country is built upon ideals like liberty, justice, equal  protection for all Americans, yet we still fall short on those goals in  important ways. While I believe we are making progress, this is a  critical moment.   Over the last 100 days, we have seen how eager the new administration  is to undo our recent achievements, from selecting EPA Administrator  Scott Pruitt, a man who does not believe in climate change, to  overturning critical antipollution protections.    The Trump administration has shown a dangerous contempt for proven  science. The administration has even favorably discussed pulling the  United States from a global climate change prevention pact, a move that  could have disastrous, unknowable consequences for every generation to  come.   Mr. Speaker, the list goes on and on and on; but at this point, Mr.  Speaker, before I continue, I want to bring forward my good friend--he  has got a fabulous first name like I do--Congressman Donald Payne, Jr.  He is from the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey. He is a  fierce advocate for environmental justice in his hometown of Newark. I  thank the Congressman. His voice and advocacy will help us move toward  sounder policies and more just outcomes, and I look forward to working  with the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), from the great city of Philadelphia.    I thank the gentleman, Congressman Evans, for keeping  us focused and giving us the information we need to understand what  real communities are going through and the environmental justice that  we need to be fighting for in this administration. I appreciate that so  much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin),  who has been the person who was at the forefront of this evening,  bringing issues of environmental justice to our minds and exposing and  explaining to the American people the assault on environmental justice  that is taking place right now, and appealing to President Trump to be  mindful of those communities who are going to be affected by the cuts  and by other interest groups that are going after the basic needs that  Americans have to stay healthy and stay alive.                                time  2045    Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman.   As has been demonstrated tonight, on nearly every facet of  environmental policy, we are in danger of backsliding irreparably. I  want to talk about an area where that danger is especially great and  where stakes are especially high. Today, and for much of our history,  certain communities have been the victims of profound environmental  injustice. Lower income, rural, tribal, and especially minority  communities are at an increased risk of exposure to the negative  impacts of pollution and climate change.   For far too long, communities of color have been on the front lines  of environmental and economic injustice, shouldering the health burdens  of living in areas with higher rates of dangerous fossil fuel pollution  and lower rates of income and employment.   Mr. Speaker, an African-American child born in the United States has  twice the chance of developing asthma than a White child and is four  times more likely to die from an asthma attack. This is not a  coincidental statistic ginned up for shock and awe but the day-to-day  reality that African-American families across the United States have  been dealing with for decades.   Rooted in America's legacy of segregation and redlining communities  of color while simultaneously restricting their government services,  employment opportunities, and environmental protections, African- American families have historically borne the brunt of the worst health  impacts of polluting industries and have received dwindling economic  opportunities due to systemic racism. This is why we see coal plants,  oil refineries, and natural gas plants, which spew some of the most  toxic substances around into the air and contaminate water supplies,  are frequently located in communities of color--communities that have  little political or economic power to protect themselves.   These disparities, Mr. Speaker, are unacceptable, and they did not  arise in a vacuum. In many cases, they have been the avoidable results  of government action or inaction. For example, according to the FY 2015  Annual Environmental Justice Progress Report, ``Many low-income,  minority, and tribal communities are disproportionately impacted by air  pollution and are not able to participate in environmental decisions  due to barriers preventing them from meaningfully engaging in the  political process.''   These voices deserve to be heard. Their silence--particularly their  enforced silence--is unacceptable, and it is incompatible with our,  small D, democratic values. The practical consequences of that silence  are dire: poorer public health, diminished economic opportunity, and  decreased quality of life.   To address these grave human and civil rights issues, the  environmental justice movement was born--a movement grounded in the  belief that all citizens, regardless of race, ethnicity, or  socioeconomic class, should share fairly in the benefits of  environmental resources and the burdens of environmental hazards.   As policymakers, Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility to embrace  that vision--to correct and prevent environmental injustice. We can and  we must do better. It is not enough to avoid repeating past mistakes.  True equity requires a recognition that some communities have been hurt  much more and, as a result, need more resources and targeted  assistance. If we succeed--if we achieve equitable policies that  promote environmental justice--our world will become a more fair, more  liveable, and more sustainable place. But if we fail, public health  will suffer. People will lead shorter and harder lives. None of us  should be willing to accept that outcome.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is worth noting that the environmental  justice movement began in 1982, when North Carolina established a toxic  waste landfill in Warren County--a poor, rural, majority African- American locality--over the objections of the residents. In the more  than 20 years since, many environmental justice organizations have  formed. During the Clinton administration, the pursuit of environmental  justice became a Federal priority.   Sadly, though, these improvements have not been enough to fix  longstanding problems, and, again, the progress we have made is under  grave threat. Left unchecked, this administration would devastate  communities of color and many other vulnerable groups as well.   Today, the Trump administration is rolling back budgets, cutting  offices, obscuring scientific information, and attacking legislation  aimed at curbing environmental justice. That is why, on March 7, we  witnessed the resignation of Mr. Mustafa Ali from his post as leader of  the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Justice Program.  For more than two decades, Mr. Ali helped lead our Nation's efforts to  secure justice and positive change for vulnerable communities that have  seen their public health threatened and the quality of their air,  water, and land degraded.   In his letter, Mr. Ali said: ``Communities of color, low-income  communities, and indigenous populations are still struggling to receive  equal protections before the law.   ``These communities, both rural and urban, often live in areas with  toxic levels of air pollution, crumbling or nonexistent water and sewer  infrastructure, lead in the drinking water, brownfields from vacant  former industrial and commercial sites, Superfund and other hazardous  waste sites, as well as other sources of exposure to pollutants.   ``Despite the many challenges we face regarding the impacts of  pollution and a changing climate, we have just as many effective tools  and programs with long track records of assisting vulnerable  communities in meeting their goals of improving public health and  enhancing the environmental quality of their local communities.''   Mr. Speaker, I know my Democratic colleagues are eager to use these  tools to secure just outcomes and better lives for the people we  represent. Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends in the majority to join with  us.   Mr. Speaker, in concluding, I would like to thank my colleagues for  joining me this evening to discuss environmental justice.   Together, we have amplified a simple truth: regardless of the color  of your skin, how much money you make, or where you live, every  American is entitled to clean air, clean water, and access to our  public lands. Again, when we fail to achieve those goals, public health  suffers, quality of life suffers, and people lead shorter and harder  lives.   We know that climate change is real. We know that it is being caused  by human activity. If we fail to act, we know that there are going to  be terrible consequences for the entire human community. We also know  that vulnerable populations and marginalized communities are poised to  suffer the most--just as they have in the past. That kind of  environmental  [[Page H3000]]  injustice has a long history, and it must stop.   That is why, this past week, I announced the creation of the United  for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force alongside my  colleagues, Congresswoman Jayapal from Washington State and  Congresswoman Barragan from California. We are going to fight every day  to prevent climate change and to mitigate its worst effects. We are  going to advocate for policies that correct and prevent environmental  injustice. We are going to defend every American's right to clean air,  safe water, and healthy communities. I think I can speak for all three  of us when I say that we look forward to working with you all.   Millions of working families are counting on us, Mr. Speaker, as  their Representatives in the House and the Senate to serve them and to  make wise decisions to improve their lives. We must confront  environmental and economic injustices through fierce participation in  the planning processes in at-risk areas moving forward. That means  demanding more stringent environmental compliance and enforcement that  protect communities of color from fossil fuel pollution and demanding  greater investments in clean energy deployment in historically African- American communities that will create union and family-wage jobs with  upward mobility.   I know my colleagues on this side of the aisle are committed to  making this change, and I challenge our friends in the majority to join  us. I urge them to support greater transparency, objectivity, and  outreach in environmental policymaking. I urge them to support  processes that improve two-way communication between decisionmakers and  the people their decisions affect. I urge them to help ensure that the  decisionmakers are confronting the full effects of their choices-- including how consequences are distributed and by whom they are borne.   Protecting the environment, Mr. Speaker--creation care--is my  passion. I commit to you that I will continue fighting each and every  day to address climate change and sea level rise, push for renewable  energy and green technologies, and do everything I can to leave this  planet a better place for future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I am an Eagle Scout, and I know that we are supposed to  leave the campground better than the way we found it. The time is now  to continue fighting for perhaps the most important issue of the 21st  century--the environment.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms.  Plaskett) for her indulgence.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McEachin for his passion and  for his commitment to these issues of environmental justice.   Particularly in the Virgin Islands, we know that climate change is  real. We feel it, and we see it in how we operate and how our  environment is changing, whether it be mosquitoes and Zika, before that  chikungunya and dengue. We know that the effects of climate change are  impacting our health and impacting the livelihoods of our environment.   The Congressional Black Caucus supports policies that ensure that all  Americans also have access to a clean and healthy environment. Studies  have long shown an unsettling correlation between race and the location  of hazardous waste facilities. For example, a 1983 Government  Accountability Office study found that 75 percent of hazardous waste  landfills in eight southeastern States were located in predominantly  poor and minority communities.   The places where minorities live, work, and learn are significantly  compromised by air, water, land, soil, noise, and light pollutants.  Black Americans and other minorities are predisposed to health issues  directly linked to environmental and toxic waste. We cannot take away  funding to support the eradication of these health hazards. We must  continue to push for that.   We are not here as the Congressional Black Caucus simply to disparage  our President. We are not here to point out his fallacies. But we would  be doing a grave disservice to the people that we represent, not just  minorities but all Americans, if we do not stand up and discuss the  issues that are of grave concern to us, to ask for support and funding,  to ask that there not be a rollback on many of the gains that we have  had that have supported and helped our community.   At the beginning of the 115th Congress, the Congressional Black  Caucus launched: ``What Did Trump Do?'' It was a rapid-response  messaging document we used to inform our external stakeholders. This  ``What Did Trump Do?'' is a special #staywoke edition. We are listing  100 actions President Trump and his administration have taken over the  last 100 days. It was developed by 78 million Americans that the CBC  collectively represent, including 17 million African Americans, as well  as millions of Americans we do not represent.   We want this information to be before the American people to show  that work must still be done. We talked about environmental areas. I am  going to list some of the things that have happened in the 100 days  that we need to be cognizant of, that we need to make sure that these  things do not take place, and that they not become embedded in this  great America in which we live.   On February 28, Attorney General Sessions said that the DOJ would  pull back from using its legal authority to monitor police departments  responsible for repeated instances of police misconduct and abuses by  backing away from legal commitment first enacted into law by  Representative John Conyers as part of the 1994 crime reform  legislation. Sessions sent a signal to the African-American community  that the police misconduct laws will not be equally and fully enforced.  On that same day, the President signed a bill that rolled back a  regulation restricting gun purchases by the mentally ill through a use  of background checks.    Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Obama-era order to reduce the  use of privately operated prisons. The use of privately operated  prisons creates a financial incentive to lock people up using African  Americans, Latinos, and poor people. In addition, in comparison to the  government-operated prisons, privately operated prisons are less safe  and secure for both staff and inmates, don't provide the same level of  rehabilitative services like educational programs and job trainings  which increase the likelihood that those who are released from prison  will return to a life of crime.   Finally, although privately operated prisons are said to be more cost  effective than government prisons, they are not because those that are  in those prisons will continue to, in many instances, come back causing  a burden not just on the American people and taxpayers but on the  families and the communities in which those individuals reside.   Other things that have happened in these first 100 days: President  Trump appointed Candace E. Jackson as Acting Assistant Secretary for  civil rights at the Department of Education. Ms. Jackson once said that  affirmative action promotes racial discrimination and claims she was  discriminated against for being White. Secretary DeVos hired Robert  Eitel, an official with deep ties to the for-profit college industry,  to be a Special Assistant to the Department of Education. This hire  presents a serious conflict of interest and raises questions about  whether Eitel can put students' needs above the interest of his former  colleagues.   President Trump's proposed budget for the Department of Education  hurts low-income students from pre-K through college by undermining  public education through the elimination of afterschool and teacher- support programs and diverting Federal funds to private school  vouchers, eliminating support for college students, gutting Federal  workstudy, and slashing critical funding for Federal Supplemental  Educational Opportunity Grants and Pell grants.   All of these cuts would have severe consequences for our Nation's  students--not just African Americans but Latinos and students in large  urban areas. No afterschool programs, no support for teachers--what  will our children do?                                time  2100    What will those families do that need those children and that  support?  [[Page H3001]]    On March 9, EPA Administrator Pruitt said that he did not think that  carbon dioxide was the primary driver of global warming even though  that is the public position of EPA, NOAA, and NASA.   We can go on and on. We have a document with over 100 actions that  have been taken in the last 100 days.   In housing and homeownership, President Trump's proposed budget would  cut the Department of Housing and Urban Development by $6 billion. HUD  is responsible for providing housing assistance to extremely low-income  families and the homeless and reinvesting in American cities and  counties.   Those same proposed budgets would end the Low Income Home Energy  Assistance Program, which assists families with energy costs, including  home energy bills, energy crises, weatherization, and energy-related  home repair.   These are some of the many examples of what has happened. We give  these examples not merely to degrade what has happened with this  administration, but to show that work must still be done and that we,  as Americans, must stay woke to what is happening in this country. We  must keep our eyes vigilant and on the prize and ensure that Americans  will see what is really happening and not be moved by the media, by the  tweets, but see actual facts.   We are working in real facts here to let you know what needs to be  done and that we, the Congressional Black Caucus, as Members of  Congress, are asking our colleagues across the aisle and in the  Democratic Caucus to support us and to support the issues that are  relevant not just to African Americans, but to all Americans this day.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lewis of Minnesota). Is there objection  to the request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to expose the  cavalier disregard of environmental justice by our President during his  first 100 days in office. In a short period of time, President Donald  J. Trump made clear his agenda--anti-climate, anti-science, and anti- fact. The current administration has already taken significant steps,  in lock-step with Congressional Republicans, to roll back and erase the  progress made by the Obama Administration to protect our health, our  public lands, and our precious environment.   Since taking office, President Trump has signed a number of executive  orders reversing many of President Obama's environmental protections-- promoting cleaner air, cleaner water, and more sustainable energy  production. The current White House is on a fast-track to derail  decades of progress and set our nation back in the effort to combat  climate change. The Clean Power Plan, which established comprehensive  carbon emission standards and put the United States at the forefront of  global environmental stewardship, was one of Trump's first targets.  Instead of investing in technological and scientific innovation to make  America a leader in greener, cleaner, sustainable energy production and  consumption, President Trump has used his office to support the  interests of corporations and interests in big oil and dirty coal on  the backs of hardworking Americans.   Furthermore, the current administration has promulgated efforts to  expand environmentally detrimental offshore drilling, allow the dumping  of mining waste, and potentially force an exit from the 2015 Paris  Agreement which brought the world's powers together in agreement to  curb our collective carbon emissions.   The proposed budget goes even further in rejecting evidenced-based  policy-making. From proposals to cripple the Environmental Protection  Agency and zero-out critical programs at the Department of Energy like  ARPA-E, this administration has abandoned our nation's effort to  protect our planet and be a global leader.   Our administration's blatant disregard toward the health, economic,  and national security risks associated with global climate change is  shortsighted and will only further endanger Americans' health,  security, and economic stability. While we will all suffer from the  consequences of short-sighted federal policy, the heaviest burden is  bound to fall on those already marginalized.   Minorities and working class families are already struggling to make  ends meet, but study after study shows that they are the most  vulnerable to environmental injustices. Subject to downwind and  downstream pollution, children and families who are economically  disadvantaged often lack the political voice to keep industries from  polluting their communities and frequently bear the brunt of  deregulatory regimes. Take Flint, Michigan for example, where young  children have been exposed to toxic levels of lead from their drinking  water. That is wrong and should be unheard of in the world's most  powerful nation.   I urge my colleagues to consider the kind of country we want our  children to live in. Where is the freedom in living in a community  where there is no access to clean drinking water, or a city where  children are forced to stay inside because the air is so polluted? We  can and must do better, Mr. Speaker. The actions the President has set  forth thus far do nothing to Make America Great Again; rather, his  first one hundred days has only made America more polluted, less safe,  and less secure.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to stand firm in their resolve to hold this and future  administrations accountable to keeping our air clean, our water safe,  and our environment sustainable for future generations. We have far too  much to lose, Mr. Speaker, and future generations deserve our better  judgement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 3 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, May 2, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
