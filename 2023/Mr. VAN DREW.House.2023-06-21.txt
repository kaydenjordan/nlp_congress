 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I feel like a broken record talking about  the invasion of our southern border over and over again, but it  continues to get worse day by day.   When we have a President and an administration that do not take the  crisis seriously, someone has to talk about it. We need to talk about  it. We need to speak about it until we get it fixed.   From day one, Joe Biden has completely and utterly neglected his  duties as President of the United States to enforce our rule of law and  protect the national security of our great Nation. It is truly  shameful.   From day one, Joe Biden abandoned strong and effective border  policies put in place by President Trump that had our border nearly  totally under control.   From day one, Joe Biden and his administration created this crisis.  This is a crisis of their own doing, and Democrats have no one to blame  other than themselves as to why thousands of illegal migrants come to  our border daily. Ironically, some of them actually wear Biden T- shirts.   To make the border crisis even worse, and it is hard to believe that  you could make it even worse, the radical Democrats are now using  elementary and secondary schools to house these illegal immigrants. It  is shameful.  [[Page H3055]]    There is absolutely no way to know the backgrounds of the  individuals, yet Democrats find it appropriate to provide shelter for  these migrants in children's gyms, auditoriums, and school spaces. Why  do Democrats continue to put our children at risk?   As if trying to indoctrinate our children in the classroom isn't  enough, as if it is not enough to see what they are doing in trying to  affect the relationship of parents and their children in the school  when parents are concerned about education, God knows how long they  will be sheltered at these school campuses.   Democrats show time and time again they are not committed to  protecting the American public and that they care more about the  illusion of appearing compassionate when in reality they are neither  compassionate nor competent.   Democrats cry that it is a political stunt when 40 migrants get flown  to a sanctuary city or their luxury vacation island, yet when our  border States and towns are overrun by this engineered crisis, there is  no concern on their part. It is completely okay. It is okay for you. It  just isn't okay for us.   It is also okay to Democrats that migrants are being held in places  where there are virtually no bathrooms or sanitation facilities--so  much for compassion, so much for caring, so much for the good of the  country. This is hypocrisy at an astronomical level.   Unlike Democrats, Republicans are committed to protecting your  children and will be voting this week to highlight and condemn this  insanity. Once again, we will fight the fight.   Enough is enough. It is time to protect our children. It is time to  take our country back.   I thank my fellow colleagues for being here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Obernolte for his concern and  his commitment to our veterans and his concern and commitment to all  those who serve our country.                                time  1945     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rose for his care and love for  our children, both born and unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller- Meeks), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Miller-Meeks for the work she  does and the difference that she makes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. LaMalfa's focus on what  is a very important issue and it is a fairness issue. I appreciate the  time and trouble he put into that. Well done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Langworthy),  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Langworthy for his focus on  this. I spoke about it earlier. We need to talk about it over and over  and over again until we have policies that make sure our American  people are number one and are safe.   Certainly, we can have immigration but in a legal and appropriate  way. Our President has been shameful in this.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that concludes my Special Order, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
