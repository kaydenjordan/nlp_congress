 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to be recognized and  address you here on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives.   I come before you this morning to remind this House and to speak  about the procedure that is pending in the Senate and some activities  that need to take place in this House before that is likely to happen,  and that, of course, is the impeachment of the President of the United  States.   It took place December 18, and we will have been waiting nearly a  month before the Articles of Impeachment would be transferred over to  the United States Senate which would then begin the enactment of a  trial--hopefully a fair trial--with an opportunity for the President to  defend himself over in the United States Senate.   I was here in this city for 3 days of the impeachment hearings before  the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 and I was able to observe the  activities here in this House and how people acted. I will say the  people who were defending Bill Clinton were not serious outside the  camera and in the House Judiciary Committee.   Here we have an impeachment that has been brought forward on two  different charges and we have watched as from the beginning, from clear  back in November of 2016, this discussion about impeaching the  President of the United States began. It began on November 9 when the  first Democrat stepped up and said: We are going to impeach this  President.   We had people who ran for office to get into this Congress who  announced: We are going to impeach the--I can't put those words into  this Congressional Record, Mr. Speaker.   So this has been a driven agenda and it began as soon as the other  side realized that Donald Trump was the duly elected and legitimate  President of the United States.   There are two reasons that this impeachment is taking place here. One  of them is because there is a deep, visceral hatred for Donald Trump  among the hardcore left in this country that is driving the caucus on  that side.   Another reason is because the investigations came about because of  the weaponization of the executive branch of the United States. I mean  particularly the Department of Justice and within it the FBI, some of  the State Department, and much of the intelligence community working  together to surveil President Trump's campaign operations and then  President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration activities and  communications before that and surveillance afterwards.    Also I mean the circumstances that came about when James Comey took  information that was proprietary and many say classified and leaked it  to a professor of Columbia University with directions to leak it to The  New York Times with the objective of creating a special counsel that  needed to be Robert Mueller who couldn't have been changed differently  by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions because he had recused himself  from Russia.   This is the backdrop of this. Impeachment puts a cloud up in front of  the activities that took place that should appall this Nation at the  highest level.   So what I ask, Mr. Speaker, is this: Let's get these Articles of  Impeachment done in this House this week, let's send them down across  the rotunda to the United States Senate, and let's ask the Senate then  to go ahead and work your will under your rules.   But my ask is this: having lived through this as a witness back in  1998, we didn't get a clean verdict in the United States Senate. I am  going from memory here, I didn't look up these articles and the actual  vote, but I remember this: the public never knew from each Senator  whether they believed that President Clinton was guilty of the various  charges that were brought before him. All wrapped in one question was:  If he is guilty, is he worthy of being removed from office?   When you package those things together and you had Democratic  Senators defending Bill Clinton, they said: Well, I didn't have to  wonder if he was guilty because if he was, it didn't rise to the level  to remove him from office.   I would like to know, I think the public wants to know, and I think  it is  [[Page H214]]  the constitutional duty of the United States Senate to give us a  verdict:   Did the President actually obstruct Congress?   Did he actually abuse power?   What were the definitions of those things?   They are not crimes.   What were the definitions?   Let's find out the judgment of these Senators, yes or no, guilty or  not guilty, and then the next question is: Should he be removed from  office?   I say not. I didn't see the evidence here. I don't see any crimes,  and there have been no crimes.   All it amounts to also is in delaying these Articles of Impeachment  if the Speaker can block a majority action from the House of  Representatives, then the Speaker can block every action from the floor  of the House of Representatives. It is not a sustainable position for  the Speaker to refuse to message and have a de facto veto because that  would make the Speaker of the House all-powerful with a veto for any  piece of action that would come through the floor of the House of  Representatives.   Let's get this done this week, and I encourage the Senate to get it  done quickly. I would like to see the President stand here before us at  the State of the Union address February 4 and be able to announce to  the world that he has been exonerated by the United States Senate.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   I rise in opposition to this rule and primarily in opposition to H.R.  1230, that is one of the subjects of this combined rule that we have.   The legislation that is coming before, the Protecting Older Workers  Against Discrimination Act, reaches way too far. I am one of the people  in this Congress that has met payroll clear back to 1975. I haven't  kept track of all the people we hired, but we hired them across the  full range that we had the opportunity of their age, whether it was on  the young side or whether they stopped showing up on the other side. We  want people that can do the job, and we want to take good care of those  folks. We want to build a reputation that we are a good place to work.  I want to have all of those workers come together at the Christmas  party and join together like family, and that is what happened just  this past week with King Construction.   I think about what the impact of this proposed legislation does, and  it works in the reverse of what many of the proponents would like to  have it do. Certainly, when you take the definition of age  discrimination and you expand it to mean if it is only the  preponderance of the evidence--what we have in current law is a  preponderance of evidence and the but-for language.    In other words, if an employee alleges they have been discriminated  against because of age, there could be multiple other factors that were  involved in that decision. Yet, as long as age is a component and it  could be asserted effectively that that age was a but-for component,  then that would be satisfactory as far as the legislation is concerned.   I think what happens instead is employers make prudent decisions, and  when they do the hire, they are going to think, I have this applicant  before me that is 62 years old. Picking an age, it could be 72 or 75 or  less. That employer is going to have to make the calculation, what if  this person is just setting me up? Or what if this person can't do the  job and I have to remove them or terminate them? You are setting  yourself up as an employer for potential liability, and that decision  gets made at the hiring end, which means there will be a lot of seniors  that don't have an opportunity to work because of the concern about the  litigation that could be brought forward.   We have protection now, Mr. Speaker, in law and in state law, and  that is where it needs to stay. It is a problem that doesn't exist and  doesn't need to be solved.                                time  1300
