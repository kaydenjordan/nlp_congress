The AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter weapon system       contains communications and target identification equipment,       navigation equipment, aircraft survivability equipment,       displays, and sensors. The airframe itself does not contain       sensitive technology; however, the pertinent equipment listed       below will be either installed on the aircraft or included in       the sale. The highest classification of the AH-64E Apache       Helicopter is CONFIDENTIAL, and the highest classification of       data and information is SECRET.        a. The AN/ASQ-170 Modernized Target Acquisition and       Designation Sight/ AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision Sensor       (MTADS/PNVS) provides day, night, and limited adverse weather       target information, as well as night navigation capabilities.       The PNVS provides thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the-      earth flight to, from, and within the battle area, while TADS       provides the co-pilot gunner with search, detection,       recognition, and designation by means of Direct View Optics       (DVO), EI2 television, and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)       sighting systems that may be used singularly or in       combinations. Hardware is UNCLASSIFIED. Technical manuals for       authorized maintenance levels are UNCLASSIFIED.        b. The AN/APG-78 Fire Control Radar (FCR) is an active,       low-probability of intercept, millimeter-wave radar, combined       with a passive AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency       Interferometer (M-RFI) mounted on top of the helicopter mast.       The FCR Ground Targeting Mode detects, locates, classifies       and prioritizes stationary or moving armored vehicles, tanks       and mobile air defense systems as well as hovering       helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft in normal flight. If       desired, the radar data can be used to refer targets to the       regular electro-optical Modernized Target Acquisition and       Designation Sight (MTADS). The content of these items is       classified SECRET. User Data Module (UDM) on the RFI       processor, contains the Radio Frequency threat library. The       UDM, which is a hardware assemblage, is classified       CONFIDENTIAL when programmed.        c. The AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency Interferometer       (M-RFI) is an updated version of the passive radar detection       and direction finding system. It utilizes a detachable UDM on       the M-RFI processor, which contains the Radar Frequency (RF)       threat library. The UDM, which is a hardware assemblage item       is classified CONFIDENTIAL when programmed. Hardware becomes       CLASSIFIED when populated with threat parametric data.       Releasable technical manuals are UNCLASSIFIED/Restricted       distribution.        d. The AGM-114R is used against heavy and light armored       targets, thin skinned vehicles, urban structures, bunkers,       caves and personnel. The missile is Inertial Measurement Unit       (IMU) based, with a variable delay fuse, improved safety and       reliability. The highest level for release of the AGM-114R is       SECRET. The highest level of classified information that       could be disclosed by a proposed sale or by testing of the       end item is up to and including SECRET. The highest level       that must be disclosed for production, maintenance, or       training is up to and including SECRET. Vulnerability data,       countermeasures, vulnerability/susceptibility analyses, and       threat definitions are classified SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL.       Reverse engineering could reveal SECRET information.        e. The Hellfire M36E9 CATM is a flight-training missile       that consists of a functional  [[Page S6710]]       guidance section coupled to an inert missile bus. The M36E9       CATM does not have a functional rocket motor or warhead, and       cannot be launched. The missile has an operational semi-      active laser seeker that can search for and lock-on to laser-      designated targets. It functions like a tactical missile       (without launch capability) during captive carry on the       aircraft, making it suitable for training the aircrew in       simulated Hellfire missile target acquisition and lock. The       missile comes in a reusable aluminum container designed to       protect the missile from shock, vibration, and other       environmental conditions encountered during shipment,       handling, and storage. The highest level for release of the       CATM is SECRET, based upon the software. The highest level of       classified information that could be disclosed by a proposed       sale or by testing of the end item is SECRET; the highest       level that must be disclosed for production, maintenance, or       training is CONFIDENTIAL. Reverse engineering could reveal       confidential information.

The Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial       Navigation System plus Multi Mode Receiver (EGl+MMR). The       aircraft has two EGIs which use internal accelerometers, rate       gyro measurements, and external sensor measurements to       estimate the aircraft state, provides aircraft flight and       position data to aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity-      aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based inertial unit. The       EGI unit houses a GPS receiver. The receiver is capable of       operating in either non-encrypted or encrypted. When keyed,       the GPS receiver will automatically use anti-spoof/jam       capabilities when they are in use. The EGI will retain the       key through power on/off/on cycles. Because of safeguards       built into the EGI, it is not considered classified when       keyed. Integrated within the EGI is an Inertial Measurement       Unit (IMU) for processing functions. Each EGI also houses a       Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR). The MMR is incorporated to provide       for reception of ground based NAVAID signals for instrument       aided flight. Provides IMC I IFR integration and       certification of improved Embedded Global Positioning System       and Inertial (EGI) unit, with attached MMR, with specific       cockpit instrumentation allows Apaches to operate within the       worldwide IFR route structure.

Jay has covered the news from KIFI  since 1984 and has become a trusted, familiar face to east Idaho  residents. Viewers have come to know him as a dedicated professional  who gets to the bottom of important stories, while treating all people  with dignity and respect.   Motivated by his conviction to share positive stories, Jay leaves  behind an inspiring legacy through the uplifting segments he produced  over the past four decades. In one such weekly segment titled  ``Wednesday's Child,'' Jay introduced children in need of a big brother  or sister figure, a foster home or an adoptive family. Jay produced  this segment for 28 years, and many children found permanent homes as a  result. In recognition of his advocacy, the Congressional Coalition on  Adoption Institute honored him and his wife Sally as ``Angels in  Adoption.'' In addition to this heartwarming segment, Jay also  highlighted hundreds of high-achieving local high school seniors  through his ``Distinguished Student'' weekly report. In 1990, Karole  Honas  [[Page S6711]]  joined Jay at the anchor desk. Their contrasting perspectives and  reporting styles created a compelling synergy that kept viewers  watching for over 29 years.   When he isn't reporting the news, Jay is an active volunteer in his  community. His service includes participation on the Governor's  Children's Trust Fund Board, Region VII Health and Welfare Advisory  Board, and the Safe Place Advisory Board. He also serves his community  as an adjunct professor in the communications department at Brigham  Young University-Idaho, where he passes along his expertise, reporting  philosophies and lessons that can only be learned through experience to  the next generation of journalists.   I would like to commend Jay for over 40 years of bringing the news to  Idahoans and congratulate him on his retirement. He will surely stay  busy with his wife Sally, their five grown children, and 15  grandchildren. His many dedicated years on the air have left a record  of a kind and gentle individual, demonstrating positivity in words and  actions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month, I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your U.S. Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure  to recognize Leisureland RV Center in Boise as the veteran-owned Idaho  Small Business of the Day for November 20, 2019.   Leisureland RV Center is owned and operated by U.S. Air Force veteran  John DeHoff and his wife Carina. John DeHoff served in the U.S. Air  Force for 25 years, and now, he and his wife travel across the United  States hand-selecting preowned recreational vehicles--RVs--to restore  and resell at their Boise location. The DeHoffs opened Leisureland RV  Center in 2014 to combine their passions for using recreational  vehicles and renovating cars.   The company has a 10,000-square-foot maintenance facility on-site  where experienced technicians restore high-end RVs and resell them at  market value. In addition to selling refurbished RVs, Leisureland RV  Center offers basic RV maintenance services and large-scale RV repairs.  Leisureland RV Center's top priority is customer satisfaction.  Employees assess the needs of each customer to ensure new buyers select  an RV that will fit their lifestyle. This dedication to exceptional  customer service is one reason many people travel from across the West  to purchase an RV from Leisureland RV Center.   Congratulations to John and Carina DeHoff and all of the employees at  Leisureland RV Center for being selected as the veteran-owned Idaho  Small Business of the Day for November 20, 2019. You make our great  State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign Relations I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these  nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators  .
