 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding,  and I rise today to express my strong support for this bill, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act.   Since the Brady law was enacted in 1994, many American lives have  been saved, murders have fallen by at least 32 percent, and our  community streets are safer and stronger as a result. But our work is  not done. In Houston alone, we see an average of 550 acts of gun  violence per year.   Too many of our loved ones are lost to senseless gun violence that  could be prevented by keeping firearms out of dangerous hands. We know  expanded background checks work.   States requiring background checks on all handgun sales see half as  many mass shootings as States without the expanded requirements. That  is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 8. This commonsense bill will  prevent private firearm sales to prohibit purchasers and close online  and gun show loopholes.   While this bill does not cover everything, it is a step in the right  direction that will make my district--Houston, Texas--and this country  safer.
