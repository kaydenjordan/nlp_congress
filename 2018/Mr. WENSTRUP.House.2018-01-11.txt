 Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment and support the  underlying bill.    I served a year in Iraq, and every day we got foreign intelligence  information to us. Why? Because it helped us prepare. It helped us  plan. It helped us deter. It helped us save American lives--not only  the lives of our troops in theater, but the lives of people at home.   I am all in favor of protecting American citizens and their privacy;  do not get me wrong. I hope that, in the information we collected in  theater, there were no Americans involved.   But guess what this amendment will do. It will virtually guarantee  that terrorists are going to make sure that they have an American,  complicit or otherwise, involved with every one of their  communications, email, or through a phone call. Why? Because that  protects them. That will protect terrorists.   That is what this amendment would do. That is why I oppose the  amendment and stand in favor of the underlying bill.
