 Madam President, I was unable to attend the rollcall  vote No. 227 on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of  Aileen Cannon to the United States Southern District of Florida. Had I  been able to attend, I would have voted to oppose cloture.   I was unable to attend the roll call vote No. 228 on the motion to  confirm the nomination of Aileen Cannon to the United States Southern  District of Florida. Had I been able to attend, I would have voted to  oppose confirmation.                            ____________________
