 Madam Speaker, there is only one word that goes through  my mind when I think about what this White House is doing to children  right now. It's ``shame.'' Shame on them.   For years, we saw Republicans try to attack Democrats for having the  gall to give millions of Americans healthcare or to address global  warming. Your leaders stood up on this floor and said shame on us.   Shame on you for letting this happen, for being willing to let kids  be kept in warehouses because you can't stand up to this President.   These are children, children who deserve the love of a mother and a  father, not cages and concrete floors. These are children, babies in  some cases. They need someone to comfort them when they can't sleep, to  cool their food when it is too hot, to give them those basics of love  and kindness that these children need.   What they don't need is to be used as hostages for President Trump to  get his anti-immigrant wish list and a wall. They don't need to be  demonized when their families are seeking refuge.   If President Trump and the Republicans don't think these families  deserve asylum or protection, if they don't think these people deserve  a chance of a life of safety, they are wrong. But these are matters  that we can debate.   But you mean to tell me you don't think these children deserve the  love of their mother and the comfort of their father? You mean to tell  me that the Bible puts law above keeping families together? Absolutely  not.  [[Page H5290]]    Shame on this White House and on everyone who stands with them. Shame  on our country if we let this continue.
