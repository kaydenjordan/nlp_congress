 Mr. Speaker, indeed, we do have an extraordinary  country. Down through the last 230 years, this Congress has met, has  discussed, decided, voted upon, and set in place policies that advanced  our country. And we are so very fortunate, all of us Americans, to be  living here with all the promise that this incredible history has given  us.   But at this period of time, we also have some profound questions  about where this country is going. We wake up and we say: What is  happening here? What is happening in the international scene? What is  all this about Russia hacking? What is all this about trying to  influence the American election? Did they really, and did it really  happen, and was it effective?   Well, we know it really happened. The American public is scratching  their head and they are saying: What is it?   And then all this talk about change, all this talk about we are going  to change things; we are going to repeal ObamaCare, and we are going to  replace it with something great. Hmmm. I wonder what that might be. And  I suspect all across this Nation there are men, women, families that  are also wondering: What do they mean it will be great? What is it that  is great?    Well, if you were to go around the Capitol, if you were to talk to  Members in the House of Representatives or over in the Senate and say:  So it is gonna be great; what is it?   Well, we will tell you tomorrow or we will tell you later, but it  will be great.   Maybe, maybe not.   Right now, the Senate is working on a piece of legislation that will  set the stage for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act--and some would  derisively call it ObamaCare. Repeal it.   Oh, yeah, get rid of that thing. But not to where it is going to be  great as soon as it is gone.   Really? I don't think so.   I know that in my part of California, a lot of people--in fact, more  than 20,000--don't think it is great at all. They are going to lose  their health care. And there are a whole lot of seniors in my community  that are going: Wow, it is going to be great.   Really?   But I will lose my annual check-up. And that awesome drug doughnut  hole that was so frightening just years ago is going to come back? That  is not so great.   I drove into town or into the Capitol today. I don't live so far  away, but it is 20 degrees, and I decided I would rather drive than  freeze. So I drove in and an advertisement came on the radio, and it  said: You are going to get a trillion-dollar tax cut. Wonderful. The  middle class will have a trillion-dollar tax cut. I said: Well, that is  not what I saw last night when I read the statistics about the great  repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, I read something quite  different from the tax committees, from Americans, various people.   Let me put something up here. Here it is. Who gets that trillion- dollar tax cut? Who is it? Is it the middle class? Well, I don't think  so, because when you look at the numbers, it goes to the very wealthy.  They are the ones who are going to get the tax cut with the repeal of  ObamaCare.   When the Affordable Care Act is repealed the way it is presently  going, the bill that is over in the Senate will require that the taxes  that were put in place to support the Affordable Care Act and to  provide insurance for 20 million people--that is both the government  insurance, the Medicaid, Medi-  [[Page H291]]  Cal in California, and the subsidized insurance from the various  programs that exist State by State--that money was raised from the  wealthy.   When the tax cuts come into place, here is the real story. The top 1  percent--do you remember the 1 percenters? Do you remember all that  discussion about the 1 percenters and the 99? The 1 percenters get 57  percent of that trillion dollars, and everyone else gets to split the  remaining 43 percent. The top one-tenth of the taxpayers in  California--we are talking about the superwealthy. We are talking about  the folks that are actually going to be in the President-elect's  Cabinet, you know, the billionaires that he is going to put in the  Cabinet. We are talking about those guys--oh, roughly a $200,000-a-year  tax break. But after all, they are hurting. They need a few more  hundred thousand dollars along the way.   So the trillion-dollar tax break that is the foundation of the  repeal, if you eliminate the money, the program is not working. There  will not be annual visits for seniors so that they can stay healthy, so  that they can control their blood pressure, diabetes, mammograms, and  all the rest that go with it. There won't be money for the 3.7 million  Californians that presently are able to get coverage under the Medi-Cal  program. There won't be money for the almost 2 million Californians  that are in the subsidized pool called Covered California. That money  won't be there. Those folks are going to be out.   And by the way, the repeal will remove the insurance for 30 million  Americans all across the country. But who gets the real benefit here?  The superwealthy, the top 1 percent will get 57 percent of that  trillion-dollar tax break, and the rest of us will share in the 43  percent remaining.   Another way to look at it, folks. It will be great, but for whom?  Well, if you break the American public into the five sectors, the first  20 percent, next 20, next 20, next 20, and then the top 20--so these  are the real poor down here in the lower 20 percent, and these are the  superwealthy in the top 20 percent.   So what happens? When you repeal the Affordable Care Act, as is now  happening in the Senate--and it will be over here either this week or  early next week; and then this House will take it up and it, too, will  vote on that very same budget bill that will create a trillion-dollar  tax cut over the next decade--who will get the money? There you go. The  top 20 percent will wind up with a full 74 percent of that.                                time  1930    Despite that little advertisement that I heard on the radio, which  said, ``Oh, the poor and the middle class are going to get it,''  really?   Let's see. Of the bottom 20 percent--6.7--oh, and the next will get  5.9 percent of it--do you have any idea what they are going to lose?   They are going to lose the subsidies on their insurance programs.  They won't be able to afford it. They will lose their insurance. For  some of them, they are on the Medicaid or the Medi-Cal program in  California, and they will be out of luck unless, of course, the State  of California can find $16.8 billion to replace the money that just  disappeared with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and that money  is then transferred to the top 20 percent.   These folks down here, the bottom 20 percent--actually, the bottom 60  percent of the American public are the losers.   Who are the winners?   The ones who are already able to buy insurance. I love this trick. I  was the Insurance Commissioner in California. I loved this little  trick: ``Not to worry. We are going to give an opportunity for people  to buy their own insurance and give them a tax break.''   Do you mean these people down here have enough money jingling around  in their pockets that they are going to be able to go out and buy the  insurance and get the tax break?   Uh-uh. It is the folks up here on top who will, once again, benefit.   This really is a massive shift of $1 trillion from those people who  are now insured, for those people who are now able to get care in the  clinics that have been established across America--in outlying areas  and in rural areas in my district. It is a massive shift from the  ability of those people to get health care, for those people who are on  the exchanges and are able to get subsidized insurance so that they can  afford it, for those people who are seniors and are able to get their  free annual checkups and have their drug costs reduced as the doughnut  hole shrinks. It is a massive shift of money being taken directly out  of their benefits and their pockets and going to the wealthy of  America. That is what is happening. That is what this repeal of the  Affordable Care Act is.   Then you look at the implications of that. What about the hospitals  that have been able to ramp up their services? What about the reforms  that were in the Affordable Care Act--the insurance reforms--that said  to the insurance companies: ``Oh, no, no, no, you can no longer  discriminate because that person happens to be a woman or has a  preexisting condition''?   This is important, Mr. Speaker. If you are scratching your head and  wondering what is going on here, listen carefully because this super  rapid train is about to come into the House of Representatives and  sweep through here, wiping out the healthcare benefits of 30 million  Americans. For those who are not directly affected, they, too, are  going to wind up in a very precarious situation because the reforms  will also be repealed.   Joining me tonight to discuss this and Social Security--oh, by the  way, Social Security is also on the chopping block--are two of my  colleagues: Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, who has been an extraordinary  leader on the issues of manufacturing, of making it in America, of  looking out for seniors, and for people who are in need of help and  support.   Congresswoman Kaptur, would you care to join us and share with us  your thoughts on what is happening in Washington?    Thank you very much, Ms. Kaptur.   I loved your talk of the history and how it came to pass that we have  Social Security and Medicare and what happened when we did not. It was  really profound. It reminded me of my own history.   I remember, as a young kid, that my father took me to the county  hospital where the neighboring rancher was--we were out on a ranch in  California--and it was horrible. That is where he was sent to die  because there was no Medicare.     Thank you very much, Ms. Kaptur.

Your grandfather.    I was just thinking that I have got more stories to  tell, but I really want to turn to our colleague from New York. Mr.  Tonko and I are often on the floor--with you also--to discuss jobs in  America, how to enhance our American economy with research, economic  development of all kinds, transportation infrastructure, Make It In  America.   Mr. Tonko, tonight we are on a somewhat different subject, but I know  it is one that you are very familiar with, one that you have spent your  entire career addressing in trying to help seniors and others who have  been on the short end of the stick. Thank you so much for joining us,  Mr. Tonko.                                time  1945     Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure for me to be on  the floor with Representative Tonko because of his passion, his  knowledge, his ability to articulate with clarity, in this case, the  importance of the Social Security program, Medicare, as well as the  Affordable Care Act. The gentleman makes a compelling argument.   I want the public of America to really grasp the importance of what  is happening here in Washington. Yes, we are going to have a new  President, and there will be an inaugural and all of the celebration  that goes with that.   Let me put it this way: When that is done, there is a majority of the  Congress and the Senate, together with the President, that fully intend  to embark on unraveling the very critical safety net for more than 30  million Americans. And for everyone else who has insurance at every  age--Medicare all the way down who has insurance--they will also see a  dislocation and an unraveling of their insurance benefits because this  market could seriously unravel. So as the gentleman said so clearly, be  academic, study the facts, and study the pros and the cons of the  various alternatives that are out there.   I know, as an insurance commissioner and having been dealing in the  issues of health care for many years now, that there are improvements  needed in the Affordable Care Act. There is no doubt. We have been  saying that since shortly after it became law. And even when it became  law, I said this should be done this way or that way a little  differently. We are 8 years into this and, as you say, millions, tens  of millions actually--around 30 million directly--are involved and  benefiting from the program, either through Medicaid, through the  exchanges, or through the various benefits that are out there. So it is  really, really important.   I want to also pick up on something that Representative Kaptur  brought to our attention. I am going to put one more chart up here. I  was surprised and a little bit appalled, just before we broke for  Christmas, that the new chairman of the subcommittee of the Ways and  Means Committee who deals with Social Security introduced a piece of  legislation. We looked at it.   It was just before the Christmas holidays, so I picked it up and  started looking at it. I go: whoa, wait, wait, wait. This is a major  step to unravel the Social Security system. Remember, back in the  George W. Bush administration, in the first 3 years of his  administration, he tried to privatize Social Security. He failed  miserably at that. Thankfully, he failed. Congress wouldn't stand for  it. At least, the Democrats in Congress wouldn't stand for it.  [[Page H294]]    I see this piece of legislation introduced in the last session, in  the last days, and I am going: Whoa, what does this mean? This man  becomes the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with Social  Security, and I am going: oh, no, they wouldn't; they wouldn't go after  Social Security again. But the bill does. It does it in a way that,  once again, gives enormous benefits to the wealthy and not so much for  the others.   This is a little chart about what happens if that piece of  legislation by Mr. Johnson actually becomes law. These are the benefits  that would be received today. In 10 years, these would be the benefits.  This is the top 20 percent rather, and right here is the middle. That  is about a $3,000 a year reduction.   Keep in mind that, I think, well over 50 percent of the seniors in  the United States depend upon Social Security as their principal source  and, in many cases, their only source of income.   So you get a decline. What do they want to do? They want to increase  the age to 69 before you could apply for full Social Security. They  want to radically change the cost-of-living index. I know what I heard  from my constituents when there was no cost of living over the previous  2 years--and a very small one this last year--the cost of care for  seniors continues to rise because they are on the expensive side of  things. There are some other provisions in it. So this is a wake-up  call. This is a wake-up call.   Clearly, the majority party here in the House and in the Senate have  promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which we have talked about.  They have also made it clear that in the past--and we believe in the  months ahead--they will attempt to privatize a large portion of the  Medicare program. So Medicaid will be largely gutted, and the increases  that we have seen through the Medicaid program will be wiped out.   The Medicare program will have significant benefit reductions, and,  if they intend to voucherize it, which they have talked about, then as  Representative Kaptur said, they will throw the seniors to the mercy of  the insurance companies.   My basic point tonight was to raise the alarm and to begin to discuss  here amongst our colleagues the reality of what is being planned for  America. Don't look at this as a partisan issue, Republican or  Democrat. Look at this as a personal issue.   Look at this as an issue that was given to me by a woman who is a  farmer in the community I represent north of Sacramento who never had  insurance. She was an entrepreneur, a self-employed farmer. She never  had insurance. If she needed care, she would go to the emergency room.  That worked when she was young, but then she became a little older, and  then cancer.                                time  2000    The treatments for her cancers were unaffordable. She would go  bankrupt. The Affordable Care Act came along with guaranteed coverage  and an insurance policy through the exchange in California that she  could afford that would provide her with unlimited medical services for  the rest of her life. No cap, no annual cap, no lifetime cap. She got  her cancer treatments, and she has moved along. She said: I still need  care. And if they repeal the Affordable Care Act, I won't get it and I  will die.   That story is repeated across America. It is repeated in my district.  I can give many more examples. So this really is, in her case and in  many others, a life-or-death situation. So, yes, we will be academic as  Mr. Tonko has said. We should be. We should understand the implications  of one policy versus another. We should understand when you start with  repealing a trillion dollars of taxes, that will have a profound impact  on health care in America. And the benefits will go to the wealthy.  That is academic.   But it is also this woman, a small farmer who developed cancer. She  had no hope. The Affordable Care Act comes along, and she is able to  get insurance and she is able to get the chemotherapy necessary to save  her life. She is back on the farm.   Repeal the Affordable Care Act and this woman, along with millions of  Americans, are in serious jeopardy. So be aware. Social Security on the  chopping block; Medicare on the chopping block; the Affordable Care Act  is on the chopping block. Tax reductions for whom? Yes, mom and pop  would get $130 a year from the tax cuts. The billionaires in the Trump  administration would get $200,000 a year in tax cuts. Mom and pop are  likely to lose their insurance.   I now yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Tonko very much. It is always  a pleasure and learning experience to be on the floor with Mr. Tonko.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur). We are about  to wrap it up as we are nearly out of time.    As we look at this issue, this conversation puts  before us and the American people really two paths to travel. The  President-elect recently said: We're going to repeal ObamaCare, and  it'll be great. And our Republican colleagues have bought into that and  are now processing legislation to do that.   The discussion today from my two colleagues here indicates another  path, and that is, make it better. Make the Affordable Care Act better.  The drug issue, there is no reason in the world that the pharmaceutical  companies should be prevented from price competition. They are. It is  the law of the land that prevents the government and other purchasers-- the government from negotiating prices. That is a law that can be  changed.   There are many things that we could do to improve the health care of  America. But two paths: one, working together to improve the Affordable  Care Act and Medicare and Medicaid, and the Veterans Administration,  the programs that provide the health care and the insurance for  Americans; or another one, a path that is going to be extraordinarily  destructive.  [[Page H296]]    The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is already underway in  the Senate and will soon be over here in the House, promises Americans  not just the 30 million that have insurance but all Americans with a  very serious health problem in the future.   Final comments, and then we will be out of time.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    Very briefly.    I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) and the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) for joining us. I can assure you,  we will be back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
