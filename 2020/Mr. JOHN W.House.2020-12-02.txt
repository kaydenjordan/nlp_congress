 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  opposition to H.R. 7995, the Coin Metal Modification Authorization and  Cost Savings Act of 2020.   I first want to thank the bill's sponsor for his willingness to amend  the bill to address some of the concerns both Members and stakeholders  have raised. I believe that, as a result, we have a better bill before  us today. However, I do not think these changes went far enough.   This legislation still cedes congressional authority and represents a  radical shift in the balance of power.   Section 8, Clause 5 of Article I of the Constitution grants Congress  the power ``to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign  coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.''   I am having trouble understanding why we would willingly hand over a  duty specifically given to the Congress in the Constitution.  Historically, Congress has been reluctant to relinquish that power to  fix the standard of coin weight and measure to the executive branch and  has balked at similar pieces of legislation over separation of powers  concerns.   We continue to cede congressional authority to the executive branch,  and history reveals disastrous results from doing so. I, too, believe  we should look for efficiency in government as well as opportunity to  save taxpayer dollars. However, it should not come at the cost of  willfully handing over specific duties to us in the Constitution in the  process.   Mr. Speaker, although well intentioned, I believe this is an  important issue that deserves a thoughtful discussion and debate,  something a hearing would have provided, and its consideration should  not be expedited without that debate.    ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
