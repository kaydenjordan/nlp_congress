 Madam President, I was on the floor earlier listening to  Senator Portman's farewell address to his colleagues in the U.S.  Senate, and I must tell you, it brought back some very fond memories-- over three decades of friendship between Rob Portman and myself as  colleagues, as partners, and as friends.   Earlier this week, we had a chance in the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee to express our appreciation to Senator Portman for his  service on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His wife Jane was  there, and I made an observation that the sacrifice that Jane has made  and that his three children--Jed, Will, and Sally--we thank them for  sharing Senator Portman with us and with public service.   I think back about three decades. I first got to know Congressman  Portman in 1993, when he was elected to the U.S. House of  Representatives. An introduction came from former Congressman Bill  Gradison. Bill Gradison was a Congressman from Ohio that Rob Portman  succeeded in the U.S. House of Representatives.    I knew Bill Gradison from my days in the State legislature. We were  friends. We had done some business--some bills--together in the House  of Representatives, and he told me: You know, you are going to like  this Rob Portman. He is the type of guy you are going to be able to  work with. And, by the way, I have an issue I would like the two of you  to take up.   It was a legacy issue for Bill Gradison, and it dealt with hospice  care. There wasn't a lot of interest in hospice care in the 1990s, but  Congressman  [[Page S7060]]  Portman and I got together and we worked on a bill, and we followed in  Bill Gradison's footsteps to get that legislation accomplished. That  was the beginning of a three-decade relationship that the two of us  have had in pursuing legislation.   Perhaps our best known legislation is the Portman-Cardin pension  reform legislation. For many years, people thought my first name was  Portman because of the association with Congressman Portman at the  time.   And I must tell you, we got amazing things done to expand retirement  savings opportunities.   We are very proud that several bills were enacted and signed into  law, but we are equally proud of the process that was used in order to  put that legislation together.   We invited all stakeholders to join us. It was truly bipartisan. We  wanted to get the best policy, and it was that process that led to the  successful passage of the first Portman-Cardin bill that dramatically  expanded retirement savings opportunities. Even though it was not in  either the Democrat or Republican leadership package, we were able to  get it into the Balanced Budget Act.   I mention the process because that is the process that Senator  Portman--Congressman Portman--has always used. He has used the  bipartisan process to try to bring us together to get the very best  possible solutions to problems. It has been the bedrock of his career,  and that is why he has been so successful here in the U.S. Senate, and  so many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed our  gratitude for his public service.   Now, I must tell you, he used that relationship sometimes to move  issues that were not necessarily his partner's top priority. As he  mentioned on the floor, he got me engaged in the IRS reform bill that  dealt with the nuts and bolts of the IRS.   Now, I ask you: How many people want to be known in their district  for improving the IRS services for collecting their taxes?   But Rob Portman was the leader on this, and he needed a Democrat in  the House, and he was very persistent, and we were able to get  significant reform done in the IRS when we were both Members of the  House.   Well, as you know, Rob Portman moved on to become the USTR, to become  the budget director, and then returned to the U.S. Senate. And I was so  pleased to be able to partner with him again when he returned to the  U.S. Senate.   On the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we talked about some of  his major accomplishments. The two of us have worked together to  promote the U.S.-Israel special relationship, to fight against anti- Semitism and the BDS movement, and there has been no stronger advocate  in the U.S. Senate for the defense of Ukraine.   His record has been an unbelievable amount of accomplishments of  getting solid legislation accomplished because he has that ability to  work across party line. He is very engaged on the issues. He knows the  issues. He knows the substance. He knows your concerns. So we can work  it out and reach a common level of agreement so we can get a bill to  the finish line.   So that is why he has such a remarkable record in getting retirement  legislation enacted into law, getting trade legislation enacted into  law, dealing with our National Park Service enacted into law, fighting  drug addiction, which has been one of his major passions, making a huge  difference on our war against drugs.   And as was pointed out earlier, and I just really want to underscore  that, his values of promoting human rights.   In so many cases, he has been the key supporter, initiator, and had  the ability to reach the finish line on bills that affect the basic  rights of Americans going against such issues as human trafficking and  so many other areas.   So I just really wanted to take this time to say to my friend Rob  Portman, through the Presiding Officer, thank you so much for your  many, many years of public service.   We wish Jane and you and your entire family only the best going  forward. You have left the legislature once before and returned. Maybe,  you will return again. We will see. But I wish you only happiness and  success in what follows your Senate career. Thank you for sharing your  talent with the American people.
