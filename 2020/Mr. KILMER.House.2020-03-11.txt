 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my sympathies for  lives lost due to the coronavirus and to offer my gratitude to the  first responders, healthcare professionals, and others working to  respond to this public health emergency.   Now is the time for action.   Last week, Congress approved $8.3 billion in funding to ensure the  Federal Government steps up to the scale and seriousness of this  growing crisis: public health funding, support to State and local  health agencies, investments in R&D for vaccines, and a measure I led  to help our small businesses that are already feeling the impact.   This week, the Federal Government should go further to help workers  and families across the country. I am proud the House will be moving to  ensure paid sick days and economic assistance for impacted workers, to  increase capacity of the medical system, to protect first responders,  to make testing more widespread and free, and to ensure access to food  for the most vulnerable Americans.   There is no time to waste. The House should act now to ensure the  safety and security of the American people.                            ____________________
