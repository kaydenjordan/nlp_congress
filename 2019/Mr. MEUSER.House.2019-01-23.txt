 Mr. Speaker, I am new here, but I am almost speechless.  We just had, moments ago, a vote that would have provided pay to the  Federal workers who have not received their paychecks this year.   Americans agree that we must provide for our border security, reopen  the  [[Page H1162]]  government, and end this shutdown. But since House Democratic  leadership has refused to come to the table and negotiate in good  faith, the least we could do is ensure our Federal workers don't suffer  because of Washington's dysfunction.   Last week, only six Democrats joined every Republican to vote to pay  our workers. This vote took place moments ago, and 10 Democrats joined  us again. We have heard speeches today on the floor, in the media, and  all over the news by Democrats who claim to empathize with Federal  workers who have gone unpaid. But when they had the chance today to pay  them, for the most part, they have declined.   We need to listen to the people, pay our Federal workers, secure our  borders, and end this shutdown.                            ____________________
