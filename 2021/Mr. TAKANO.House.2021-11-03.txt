 Madam Speaker, I thank my neighbor and very good friend,  Dr. Raul Ruiz, for holding and hosting this Special Order hour on toxic  exposures.   Madam Speaker, tonight I rise to talk about the urgent need to  finally recognize toxic exposure as a cost of war and pass the Honoring  Our PACT Act.   Every day I hear from more and more veterans who have been exposed to  toxic substances while serving our Nation. Whether it is exposure to  burn pits, contaminated water, radiation, or other toxins, the health  effects are often severe from chronic multisymptom illnesses, to  cancers, birth defects, infertility, and respiratory conditions.   This problem isn't new, and neither is the need for congressional  intervention. As chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  I was proud to lead the effort last Congress to pass the Blue Water  Navy Vietnam Veterans Act and get long-overdue justice for our Vietnam  veterans exposed to Agent Orange. But that took more than 40 years. We  cannot let our post-9/11 veterans suffer the same fate. And, yes, we  are in danger of having burn pits become this generation of veterans'  Agent Orange.   We cannot allow this generation of veterans to go the 40 years that  our Vietnam veterans had to wait for their justice.                                time  1830    When we send our servicemembers into harm's way, we do so with a  promise to care for them and pay for that care. We haven't been keeping  up our end of the deal. Hundreds of thousands of veterans have signed  up for VA's burn pit registry. However, with 70 percent of burn pit  claims denied, it is clear that VA's current claims process isn't  working. No veteran should be forced to prove that their government  exposed them to toxic substances. The Honoring our PACT Act fixes that  and finally makes good on our promise.   With our bipartisan legislation, we can deliver VA benefits and care  to up to 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn pits and airborne  hazards. We can establish a presumption of service connection for 23  respiratory illnesses and cancers, the most comprehensive list out  there. Additionally, we can streamline VA's review process for toxic  exposure presumptions, so Congress doesn't have to keep intervening.   With the exit from Afghanistan still fresh in our minds, we cannot  forget that the true cost of war is so much more than the tanks,  planes, and weapons used on the battlefield. Veterans living with toxic  exposure are still in the heat of battle, and they are paying for the  cost of war that our Nation should be paying. That is why we need to  pass the Honoring our PACT Act into law. With 60 cosponsors, bipartisan  support, endorsements from nine veteran services organizations, and a  VA Secretary and President who are committed to addressing this issue,  we have the momentum to get this done.   With every day that passes, more veterans get sick and, sadly, die  waiting for the care and benefits they have earned. We must act now. I  want to thank Dr. Ruiz and the Congressional Burn Pits Caucus for  partnering with my committee to share the stories of toxic-exposed  veterans today and showcase how transformative passing the Honoring our  PACT Act will be.   With Veterans Day right around the corner, we can honor our veterans'  service with action. I urge all Members to consider sponsoring our  legislation.
