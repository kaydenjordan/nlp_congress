 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Res. 489,  the  [[Page H5849]]  latest legislative attack on the President. Much like most of the ideas  and comments coming from the leading members of the socialist left,  yesterday's press conference was, at best, political theater.   In the last few days, Democratic Members of this House have attacked  the President with claims of racism. Some have even said and then  walked back similar comments referring to the Democratic House Speaker.  None of those accusations are based in fact.   As the representative of the people of the Ninth Congressional  District of Pennsylvania, I feel it is most important to address this  matter and then move on to engage in the work and the matters of real  substance and importance to the people of our country, rather than  baseless name-calling and offensive lectures.   The ongoing policy debate across the country will continue to be  socialism versus American exceptionalism. The people will decide our  direction. What has really happened here is that the President and his  supporters have been forced to endure months of allegations of racism  and ``concentration camp'' accusations.    Mr. Speaker, this ridiculous slander does a disservice to  our Nation and to the American people, and I, like many, am tired of  it. I urge a ``no'' vote on the resolution aimed purely at harassing  the President of the United States.
