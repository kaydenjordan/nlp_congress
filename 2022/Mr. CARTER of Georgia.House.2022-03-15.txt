 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  tremendous season of the Savannah State University men's basketball  team.   The upset-minded Tigers have won their first Southern Intercollegiate  Athletic Conference championship title since 1981.   Topping off a four-game win streak with a conference championship  victory, the Tigers went into the SIAC championship game as the  underdog against Benedict College.   This historic team struggled throughout the season, entering the  post-season 11-13, but came together as a team and found a way to win  when it mattered most.   I am so proud of the team that Head Coach Horace Broadnax has put  together at Savannah State University. He is helping these young men  unlock their full athletic potential.   The season is not over, as the Tigers are now preparing for their  shot at the NCAA Division II National Tournament. This has not been an  easy season by any means, but the Tigers have momentum and drive to  keep them moving forward.   Gentlemen, good luck in the tournament.                            ____________________     I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, President Biden wants to build back better. What he  doesn't realize is that first, we must be able to build. Many otherwise  shovel-ready infrastructure projects get trapped in bureaucratic  gridlock for years.   Developers routinely find themselves navigating environmental reviews  that require up to over 60 authorizations from as many as 13 different  Federal agencies.   Projects starting today with new funding from the infrastructure deal  won't be realized for 5 to 7 years, if not longer. After years of  project design, engineering, planning, and financing, the 2 to 4-year  permitting process commences. This pushes orders for new windmills,  solar panels, transmission lines, charging stations, construction  equipment, steel, concrete, labor contracts, and whatever else a  project may need years into the future. Only after all of that can the  2 to 3 years of construction begin.   The Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council analyzed 69 major  projects and found that bureaucratic delays cost developers $100  billion.   New wind and solar projects take 2.3 years, on average, to receive  Federal permits; 3.3 years for electricity transmission projects, and  4.7 years for major new road projects.   This contrast with the ambitious and radical climate goals Democrats  have set, calling for a 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. In  that case, a 7 to 10-year development timeline is entirely too long or  realistic.   Permitting challenges have resulted in extended delays and creating a  chilling effect on new infrastructure investment. This isn't just a  sacrifice of time. Perhaps worse, it costs money, a lot of money.   Twenty to 30 percent of total project funding is wasted on  unnecessary red tape. We are wasting millions of dollars a year by just  waiting. Instead of fixing that well-known issue, Democrats chose to  throw more money at the problem. Now we see how this has brought on  record inflation.   Sadly, the cost of these unnecessary delays is ultimately passed down  to taxpayers, either through taxes, tolls, or increased rates in usage  fees. It is no wonder that the U.S.' infrastructure is falling behind  other developed nations.   What is curious is, why did Biden's so-called infrastructure bill do  nothing to speed up the process, and, instead, doubled down on delays  and bureaucracy?   Republicans and Democrats alike are struggling to build around these  roadblocks, and it is high time Congress did something about it.   I thank the gentleman again for yielding.
