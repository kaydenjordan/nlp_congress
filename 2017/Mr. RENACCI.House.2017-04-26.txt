 Mr. Speaker, today I want to congratulate my colleague,  my friend, and fellow Buckeye, Congressman Steve Stivers, on his  promotion to brigadier general. I am thankful to be joined by my  colleagues in the House and our Senators, Senator Brown and Senator  Portman, as we applaud our colleague.   He is the first Ohio National Guard officer in more than 100 years to  concurrently serve as a Member of Congress and one of the few people in  U.S. history to have held both positions simultaneously. Congressman  Stivers joined the National Guard in 1985, and has served for over 30  years.   I, and many other Ohioans, appreciate his years of service, both in  the military and in the United States Congress.
