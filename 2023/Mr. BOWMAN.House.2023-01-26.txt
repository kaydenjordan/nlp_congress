 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 92.    Mr. Chairman, according to my friends across the aisle,  the purpose of this bill is to promote energy security and lower costs  for consumers. I hope they will agree that if our goal is to protect  Americans, then we cannot allow price-gouging corporations to  participate in any increased drilling on Federal lands under this bill.  That would defeat the entire purpose.   My amendment to H.R. 21 simply says that if you price gouged the  American people last year, you should not be allowed to participate in  a plan whose goal is to reduce prices and promote the public interest.   Nobody can deny that Big Oil and Gas engaged in price gouging in  2022. They raked in record profits--$343 billion in the first three  quarters of last year--at the same time that historically high gas  prices were pummeling American workers across the country. Inflation  gave these companies cover to jack up prices even higher. Supply chain  disruptions and a refinery crunch gave them cover to keep supply  restricted and to engage in market manipulation.   This is not my interpretation. This is what they broadcast to their  investors. Exxon and Chevron executives, for example, bragged about  maintaining capital discipline and about funneling billions back to  shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.   We should not accept that behavior. Let's come together on a  bipartisan basis and protect the American people from corporate price  gouging.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
