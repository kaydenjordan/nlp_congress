 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of  Tippecanoe County Council President Bryan Metzger. Originally from  Milltown, Indiana, Bryan lived a life full of love and service to his  community.   Bryan first gained an appreciation for public service when he joined  4-H at just 10 years of age. Always an energetic member, Bryan knew he  wanted to continue his work with 4-H. After graduating from Purdue  University, Bryan accomplished just that, serving for decades with the  4-H Extension Services in White and Lawrence Counties, before settling  in Tippecanoe County.   His selflessness extended to other youth organizations in his  community, having worked with the Court Appointed Special Advocate  Association, the Cary Home for Children in Tippecanoe County, and  countless other advocacy organizations. My friend and former colleague  cared immensely about the growth and development of our young people,  and any number of lives are better for his time and generous spirit.   Bryan was also a devoted member of the Greater Lafayette Rotary Club,  and he continued to work for his community through the Tippecanoe  County Council following his retirement from the Extension Service in  2012 after 33 years of faithful service. Inexhaustible as ever, Bryan  most recently served as president of the county council.   Those who were fortunate enough to have known and worked with Bryan  admired and respected his endless civic engagement. Described by his  peers as dedicated and focused, Bryan embodied the 4-H pledge of head,  heart, hands, and health in service to others, and he will be missed  dearly by his community.   Thank you for your service, Bryan.                            ____________________
