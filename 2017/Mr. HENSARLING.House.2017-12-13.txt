 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Davidson). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 658 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1638.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1456                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1638), to require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a  report to the appropriate congressional committees on the estimated  total assets under direct or indirect control by certain senior Iranian  leaders and other figures, and for other purposes, with Mr. Mitchell in  the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1638, the Iranian  Leadership Asset Transparency Act, introduced by my colleague and dear  friend from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).   This legislation requires the Treasury Secretary to report to  Congress on the assets held by the Islamic Republic of Iran's most  senior political and military leaders, and on the probable sources and  uses of those assets.   A classified version, if necessary, would be available, as  appropriate, to Congress, and a public version of the report would be  posted on the Treasury Department's website in English and in the major  languages used within Iran that could easily be downloaded.   The genius of this latter point is that it will allow the average  Iranian to understand and circulate information of how their leaders  are, in a phrase, robbing them blind, as well as aiding and abetting  terrorists.   Iran's top political, military, and business leaders, if there is  much of a distinction between those roles in Iran, fund terrorist- related activity, we know this, and through intricate financial  arrangements that give them great flexibility in moving their money.   According to the nongovernmental organization Transparency  International, Iran's economy is characterized by high levels of  official and institutional corruption, and there is substantial  involvement by Iran's security forces, particularly involving the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.   Unsurprisingly, then, members of Iran's senior political and military  leadership have acquired significant personal and institutional wealth  by using their positions to secure control of major portions of the  Iranian national economy.   Some estimates put their iron grip at a third or more of the  country's economy, and some individual holdings in the billions of  dollars; all at a time when the average Iranian citizen earns the  equivalent of about $15,000 a year.   The unwise sanctions relief provided through the Obama  administration's nuclear deal with Iran resulted in the unwarranted  removal of many Iranian entities that are tied to government corruption  from the list of entities sanctioned by the United States.                                time  1500    Thankfully, however, the Trump administration has, in recent months,  levied a number of needed new sanctions on Iranian individuals and  entities. Still, the Transparency International index of perceived  public corruption in Iran is higher than ever.   As well, the Treasury Department has identified Iran as a country of  ``primary concern for money laundering.'' Separately, the State  Department has continually identified Iran as the world's foremost  state sponsor of terrorism. Iran is, the State Department tells us, a  country that has ``repeatedly provided support for acts of  international terrorism,'' and ``continues to sponsor terrorist groups  around the world, principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps.''   The bill before us today, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency  Act, requires the Treasury Department again to list the known assets of  senior Iranian officials in a form that is easily understandable and  accessible to individual Iranians, as well as to those in the financial  or business sector who might be concerned--hopefully concerned--about  inadvertently doing business with a corrupt Iranian entity.   The bill also requires the Treasury to evaluate the effectiveness of  existing sanctions against Iran and make any appropriate  recommendations for improving the effectiveness of sanctions.   The bill passed the Financial Services Committee last month with a  bipartisan support vote of 43-16. The House approved a nearly identical  bill just 18 months ago by a very strong vote of 282-143.   As passed by the committee, this year's version has an important  addition, a sense of the Congress section, that urges the Treasury  Secretary, in addition to other sources, to seek information for the  report from private sector sources that search, analyze, and, if  necessary, translate publicly available, high veracity, official  records overseas, and provide methods of searching and analyzing such  data in ways useful to law enforcement.   These source of services provide information that could augment  information that is gathered, often by classified means, and provide a  final public report that helps give the world a better picture of the  true nature of Iran's economy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge immediate passage of Mr. Poliquin's thoughtful  and bipartisan bill. I appreciate his leadership to bring us here  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 1638, the Iranian       Leadership Asset Transparency Act.        I agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee may be       discharged from further action on this bill so that it may       proceed expeditiously to the Floor, subject to the       understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish       or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee,       or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek an appropriate number of conferees       to any House-Senate conference involving this bill, and would       appreciate your support for any such request.        I ask that you place our exchange of letters into the       Congressional Record during  [[Page H9869]]       floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2017.      Hon. Ed Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for your December 6th letter       regarding H.R. 1638, the ``Iranian Leadership Asset       Transparency Act'', as amended.        I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on       H.R. 1638 so that it may move expeditiously to the House       floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on       the bill, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is in no way       waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar       legislation. In addition, if a conference is necessary on       this legislation, I will support any request that your       committee be represented therein.        Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this       letter in our committee's report on H.R. 1638 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the same.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,                                                          Chairman.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us now, H.R. 1638, the Iranian  Leadership Asset Transparency Act, represents what the Republican  majority has become very good at doing, advancing bad public policy  while claiming to advance the public interest.   H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, would  require the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on the  estimated total assets under direct or indirect control of certain  senior Iranian leaders and other figures, along with a description of  how these assets were acquired and are employed, regardless of whether  such individuals are subject to U.S. sanctions.   Although increasing transparency into corrupt regimes is a laudable  goal, H.R. 1638 works counter not only to its own stated objectives,  but also U.S. national security interests.   First, the level of scrutiny that would be needed to produce a  credible report would place a very real strain on the Treasury  Department, diverting significant resources away from Treasury  investigators who are tasked with targeting conduct that is actually  sanctionable; implementing existing U.S. sanction programs; and  uncovering illicit conduct across the globe, including, importantly,  efforts to identify the web of business interests that continue to  enable North Korea to evade U.S. and international sanctions.   In addition to diverting scarce and critical resources, the bill's  required report will have little use as a compliance tool, given that  the most important parts would be classified, undercutting the  legislation's own stated objective to help make financial institutions'  required compliance with remaining sanctions more easily understood.   In fact, the creation of such a list, which would not be tied to any  prohibition or legal action, would more than likely create confusion  among the Office of Foreign Assets Control's regulated public and also  mislead companies to believe that the Treasury list replaces the due  diligence efforts that they should otherwise be doing prior to engaging  in business in Iran.   Moreover, because the report would be largely classified, the bill  would do little to draw the Iranian public's attention to the  corruption and unjust enrichment of their leaders, which is another  stated purpose of the bill. In fact, any classified portion would  inevitably be rejected by both the Iran regime and its people as U.S.  propaganda, and a predictable attack on the country's government by the  United States.   The true purpose of this legislation is to create reputational risk  for companies that might seek to do legitimate business with Iran. For  this reason, the bill would be a strategic mistake, as its report would  undoubtedly be seized upon by Iran as an intentional effort to  discourage international investment in Iran, which would be viewed by  Iran and likely by the major world powers who joined us in the JCPOA as  well as a violation of the expressed U.S. commitment under the nuclear  deal not to interfere with the full realization of the relief provided  to Iran under the accord.   When a nearly identical version of this bill was considered last  Congress, the Obama White House threatened to veto the bill, stating  that it would, ``endanger our ability to ensure Iran's nuclear program  is and remains exclusively peaceful.''   Moreover, the Obama administration cautioned that the report called  for in the bill would also compromise critical intelligence sources and  methods. On that score, I would also note that the reporting  requirement in the legislation calls for information about how  sanctions evasion and illicit conduct is practiced, and potential  countermeasures.   It seems far from prudent to give tips to our adversaries about how  we learn about their misconduct and how we plan to respond. This  legislation would have very limited practical utility, despite the huge  diversion of resources it would take to produce. It also fails to meet  its own stated objectives, including serving any usefulness as a  compliance tool.   Finally, the measure would also likely have a negative impact on the  continued viability of the nuclear deal, which is clearly a central  objective. I am hard-pressed to think of a single piece of legislation  that works so strongly against every single policy goal it claims to  advance. Few issues are more important to global peace and security  than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. This bill would do  nothing to advance that goal. In fact, if enacted, it could do grave  damage to the important progress that has been made.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds simply to  remind the ranking member that in the State Department's latest Country  Reports on Terrorism, Iran is labeled the ``world's foremost state  sponsor of terrorism.''   Why we would want less information as opposed to more information on  that rogue state is beyond me.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin), the sponsor of the legislation and a distinguished member of  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maine.                                time  1515     Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maine.                                time  1515     Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maine.                                time  1515     Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maine.                                time  1515     Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), who is a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), who is a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), who is never an apologist for the leading state  sponsor of terrorism in the world. He is a proud member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say  in the time the ranking member was speaking, I went back, yet again, to  read the nine-page bill. Nowhere is the JCPOA mentioned in the bill.   Iran was the leading state sponsor of terrorism before the JCPOA.  They remain the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism after the  JCPOA. We ought to know something about the leadership of this  terrorist nation, and I think the next speaker will tell us even more.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd), another outstanding member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining on my side?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 5\3/4\ minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes again to the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers, and I believe  I have the right to close.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to  how much time I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 6 minutes  remaining.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a statement from J Street that  is in opposition to this legislation.                                                       J Street,                                                  December 12, 2017.      Members of the U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: J Street urges Members to oppose       H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324, which would undermine or violate the       Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran's nuclear       activities.        J Street again urges Members to oppose the ``Iranian       Leadership Asset Transparency Act'' (H.R. 1638). As we noted       in our statement opposing the bill when it was introduced       last year, it risks harming the U.S. Government's ability to       ensure Iranian and third party compliance with the agreement       and to counter Iran's dangerous non-nuclear behavior by       redirecting and tying up the very USG personnel and resources       charged with those tasks.        J Street also urges Members to oppose the so-called       ``Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act''       (H.R. 4324), which is clearly intended to lead to a U.S.       violation of the JCPOA.        This bill would impose additional certification       requirements on the administration in order to carry out       current U.S. obligations related to commercial aircraft sales       under the JCPOA. These new obligations require the       administration to certify that Iran is not engaged in certain       non-nuclear activity, or issue a national security waiver       saying they'll allow the planes to be sold anyway. In other       words, it imposes new, unilateral terms for continuation of       the JCPOA that are unrelated to Iran's nuclear conduct.        It has been widely reported in connection with the       president's recent refusal to make the necessary       certification to Congress under the Iran Nuclear Agreement       Review Act that the president resents having to undertake       official actions to keep the United States in compliance with       the JCPOA. Proponents of this legislation clearly hope to       make use of the president's apparent resistance to taking       such steps by adding a new certification requirement that       they hope he will also fail to meet--thereby blocking the       sale of commercial aircraft and forcing a U.S. violation of       the agreement.        Anyone doubting that this is the point of the bill need       look no further than the first finding, which makes clear       that this bill is a gratuitously anti-Obama, anti-JCPOA       vehicle, and not a serious.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I also include in the  Record a Statement of Administration Policy from the previous Obama  administration, which I read a paragraph from.                     Statement of Administration Policy             H.R. 5461--Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act         The Administration shares the Congress' goals of increasing       transparency and bringing Iran into compliance with       international standards in the global fight against terror       finance and money laundering. However, this bill would be       counterproductive toward those shared goals.        The bill requires the U.S. Government to publicly report       all assets held by some of Iran's highest leaders and to       describe how these assets are acquired and used. Rather than       preventing terrorist financing and money laundering, this       bill would incentivize those involved to make their financial       dealings less transparent and create a disincentive for       Iran's banking sector to demonstrate transparency. These       onerous reporting requirements also would take critical       resources away from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's       important work to identify Iranian entities engaged in       sanctionable conduct. Producing this information could also       compromise intelligence sources and methods.        One of our best tools for impeding destabilizing Iranian       activities has been to identify Iranian companies that are       controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)       or other Iranians on the list of Specially Designated       Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) to non-U.S.       businesses, so that they can block assets or stop material       transfers. This process is labor-intensive and requires the       judicious use of our national intelligence assets.       Redirecting these assets to preparing this onerous public       report would be counterproductive and will not reduce       institutional corruption or promote transparency within       Iran's system.        In addition, this bill's required public postings also may       be perceived by Iran and likely our Joint Comprehensive Plan       of Action (JCPOA) partners as an attempt to undermine the       fulfilment of our commitments, in turn impacting the       continued viability of this diplomatic arrangement that       peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a       nuclear weapon. If the JCPOA were to fail on that basis, it       would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring       of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the       international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a       devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership       and our commitments to our closest allies.        As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program       through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration       remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism,       its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and       destabilizing activity in the region. The United States       should retain all of the tools needed to counter this       activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to       disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and       proliferation-sensitive technologies. This bill would       adversely affect the U.S. Government's ability to wield these       tools, would undermine the very goals it purports to achieve,       and could even endanger our ability to ensure that Iran's       nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful.        If the President were presented with H.R. 5461, his senior       advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, we are opposed to this  bill not because we are not concerned about the security of our country  and security of our allies in the Middle East. The Members on the  opposite side of the aisle don't care any more than we care, but we  respect when our leadership and our country gets involved and  negotiates with another country, such as they have done with Iran, and  they come to some agreements. We would like our country to live up to  the agreement.   When we have included in that agreement a description of the  monitoring that will be done, and when that monitoring is being carried  out, and when it is represented to us by those that we have in charge  of that monitoring that that country, Iran, is in compliance, we  believe them. And when we trust our negotiators, when we trust our  country, when we trust our leadership, and Iran is in compliance, there  is no reason to try and undo the deal. There is no reason to come  behind the agreement and what has been negotiated and begin to think of  ways that they believe we ought to expand that agreement. We could, in  the Congress of the United States, come up with a new idea every day.  With all of the Members of this House, with all of the different  thoughts and, possibly, ideas, and everybody thinking they are smarter  than everybody else, we could come up with all kinds of plans to  interfere with that agreement.  [[Page H9875]]    But I would advise the Members of this House and the Members on the  opposite side of the aisle that they do not need to do this. This is a  bad idea. I would advise them to put faith in the negotiations that  have gone on and to accept the representations about compliance that we  are being given. We are being assured that not only is the monitoring  taking place, but Iran is in compliance.   So, again, I am so worried about our role in this country today and  the fact that our leadership is being diminished day by day because of  the way that our President and the White House is handling our  relationships with other countries. As a matter of fact, we see a  President that is endangering us and destroying relationships  constantly.   I mention that we have in this deal Russia, China, Germany, England,  and France. I asked the question: What are our allies in this agreement  saying about our attempts to interfere with the agreement? Do they  agree with them? Are they consulted? Are they unhappy about what is  being done?   I suppose they could do the same in their countries every day. They  could come up with new ways to interfere with the agreement. They could  begin to ask questions about us and why we are doing what we are doing.  They could even ask questions about why are we concerned about the  assets of those who are not sanctionable when we are not concerned  about the assets of our own President.   Mr. Chairman, this is Mr. Poliquin's bill. He wants to know about the  assets of leaders in Iran.   Has he seen his President's tax returns? Does he know about his  assets? Does he know about where they have come from? Does he know  about how they are utilized?   I don't think so.   So I think it is very, very important for us to do everything that we  can to have our allies trust us, to live up to the deals that we make,  not to ask more of others than we are willing to do ourselves, no.   We are not sponsors of terrorism. We are a people who have always  tried to avoid war. Unfortunately, we have engaged in it, and we know  that it is not the best answer to trying to deal with the problems that  we encounter around the world. I do believe that we honestly try to  avoid war and that we work for peace.   This is working for peace, and peace in the Middle East is one of the  most important goals that we should have. I see the opportunities for  that eroding every day.   So I would ask Mr. Poliquin to think about what he is doing. I  believe that his intentions are good, but I think it is a bad bill.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this bill. It is not needed.  I think it creates problems with our allies, and they begin to wonder  whether or not they can trust us. We are an honorable people and we are  leaders in the world, even though it is being questioned more and more.   Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The Chair reminds  all Members to address their remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3\3/4\ minutes  remaining.                                time  1600     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I find it fascinating how often the ranking member  criticized our own President and didn't have one critical comment for  the President of Iran, the nation which our State Department, including  the Obama State Department, has labeled as the world's foremost state  sponsor of terrorism. But yet, in the last almost hour we have not  heard one single critical word.   We hear much about the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, perhaps one of  the worst arrangements, international agreements that has ever been  entered into by our country, but look as I may, in the legislation--and  it is 9 pages long, not 900--you will not see the JCPOA in it.   Mr. Poliquin's bill, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act,  is just that. It is seeking to have greater international transparency  for the leaders of this rogue nation, regardless of the JCPOA.   Let's remember what the gentleman from Ohio reminded us, that it was  because of information, including radio-free Europe, that went across  the Iron Curtain that ultimately brought that curtain down and freed  millions. We want to make sure the Iranian people know about their own  leadership.   Our own State Department has said the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary  Guard Corps' Quds Force along with Iranian partners, allies, and  proxies continue to play a destabilizing role in military conflicts in  Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, but the ranking member says: Oh, let's not say  anything about their leadership because we might hurt their feelings.   The State Department goes on to say: Iran continued to recruit  fighters from across the region to join Iranian-affiliated Shia militia  forces engaged in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and has even offered a  path to citizenship for those who heed this call. And yet the ranking  member says let's not report on the leadership of this rogue regime  because they are very sensitive people.   The State Department goes on to say: Hezbollah continued to work  closely with Iran in these conflict zones, playing a major role in  supporting the Syrian Government's efforts to maintain control in the  territory and providing training and a range of other support for  Iranian-aligned groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Yet we continue to  hear from the ranking member that we shouldn't learn anything about  their leadership. Again, we might step on their toes after the JCPOA,  and we wouldn't want to do that. We wouldn't want to be insensitive to  international terrorists.   In 2016, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, boasted: ``We are open  about the fact that Hezbollah's budget, its income, its expenses,  everything it eats and drinks, its weapons and rockets are from the  Islamic Republican of Iran.''   I mean, how much more do we need to know? Why do we continue to have  Members of the United States Congress come to the floor of this  institution and somehow want to seemingly protect the leaders of this  rogue regime?   We want to know more information. We want to disseminate this  information. We want the whole world to know about the leadership of  the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. It is exactly what the  gentleman from Maine is trying to. I salute him for his leadership.   I encourage all Members to vote ``aye'' for his bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.   In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by  the Committee on Financial Services, printed in the bill, it shall be  in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment  under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute  consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-47. That amendment  in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.   The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as  follows:                                 H.R. 1638         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iranian Leadership Asset       Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Iran is characterized by high levels of official and       institutional corruption, and substantial involvement by       Iran's security forces, particularly the Islamic       Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in the economy.        (2) Many members of Iran's senior political and military       leadership have acquired significant personal and       institutional wealth by using their positions to secure       control of significant portions of Iran's national economy.        (3) Sanctions relief provided through the Joint       Comprehensive Plan of Action has resulted in the removal of       many Iranian entities that are tied to governmental       corruption from the list of entities sanctioned by the United       States.        (4) The Department of Treasury in 2011 designated the       Islamic Republic of Iran's financial sector as a jurisdiction       of primary money laundering concern under section 311 of the       USA PATRIOT Act, stating ``Treasury has for the  [[Page H9876]]       first time identified the entire Iranian financial sector;       including Iran's Central Bank, private Iranian banks, and       branches, and subsidiaries of Iranian banks operating outside       of Iran as posing illicit finance risks for the global       financial system.''.        (5) Iran continues to be listed by the Financial Action       Task Force (FATF) among the ``Non-Cooperative Countries or       Territories''--countries which it perceived to be non-      cooperative in the global fight against terror finance and       money laundering.        (6) Iran and North Korea are the only countries listed by       the FATF as ``Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories''       against which FATF countries should take measures.        (7) The Transparency International index of perceived       public corruption ranks Iran 130th out of 168 countries       surveyed.        (8) The State Department identified Iran as a ``major       money-laundering country'' in its International Narcotics       Control Strategy Report (INCSR) for 2016.        (9) The State Department currently identifies Iran, along       with Sudan and Syria, as a state sponsor of terrorism,       ``having repeatedly provided support for acts of       international terrorism''.        (10) The State Department's ``Country Reports on       Terrorism'', published last in July 2017, noted that ``Iran       continued to sponsor terrorist groups around the world,       principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-      Qods Force (IRGC-QF). These groups included Lebanese       Hizballah, several Iraqi Shia militant groups, Hamas, and       Palestine Islamic Jihad. Iran, Hizballah, and other Shia       militia continued to provide support to the Asad regime,       dramatically bolstering its capabilities, prolonging the       civil war in Syria, and worsening the human rights and       refugee crisis there.''.        (11) The Iranian Government's tolerance of corruption and       nepotism in business limits opportunities for foreign and       domestic investment, particularly given the significant       involvement of the IRGC in many sectors of Iran's economy.        (12) The IRGC and the leadership-controlled bonyads       (foundations) control an estimated one-third of Iran's total       economy, including large portions of Iran's       telecommunications, construction, and airport and port       operations. These operations give the IRGC and bonyads vast       funds to support terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah       and Hamas.        (13) By gaining control of major economic sectors, the IRGC       and bonyads have also served to further disadvantage the       average Iranian.       SEC. 3.

The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in part A of House  Report 115-463. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order  printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be  considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the  report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,  shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand  for division of the question.                   Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Schneider    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in part A of House Report 115-463.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  New York for her amendment. I note that she was a supporter of H.R.  5461, a nearly identical bill that passed the House in the last  Congress. I think that her amendment is a valuable addition to H.R.  1638. Indeed, we should always know the effectiveness of the programs  that we promote. In this case, we do need to understand how effective  economic sanctions may be. So I appreciate her leadership.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge all Members to vote ``aye'' on the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 658, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4324) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to  make certifications with respect to United States and foreign financial  institutions' aircraft-related transactions involving Iran, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 658, in lieu of  the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the  Committee on Financial Services printed in the bill, an amendment in  the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee  Print 115-48 is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read.   The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                                 H.R. 4324         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Oversight of       Iran's Access to Finance Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),       informally known as the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama       administration agreed to license the sale of commercial       passenger aircraft to Iran, the world's foremost state       sponsor of terrorism and a jurisdiction of primary money       laundering concern.        (2) In April 2015, prior to the adoption of the JCPOA,       Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew, in publicly advocating       for its provisions, stated: ``Make no mistake: deal or no       deal, we will continue to use all our available tools,       including sanctions, to counter Iran's menacing behavior.       Iran knows that our host of sanctions focused on its support       for terrorism and its violations of human rights are not, and       have never been, up for discussion.''.        (3) In March 2016 remarks to the Carnegie Endowment for       International Peace, Secretary Lew, in reference to U.S.       commitments under the JCPOA, stated: ``While we have lifted       the nuclear sanctions, we continue to enforce sanctions       directed at support for terrorism and regional       destabilization, and missile and human rights violations.''.        (4) In an April 2016 forum at the Council on Foreign       Relations, Secretary Lew stated that, under the JCPOA, the       U.S. committed to lifting its nuclear sanctions, ``but the       U.S. financial system is not open to Iran, and that is not       something that is going to change''.        (5) In September 2016, the Department of the Treasury's       Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued licenses       permitting the export of up to 97 aircraft for use by Iran       Air, the Islamic Republic of Iran's flagship state-owned       carrier. These licenses included authorization for U.S.       financial institutions ``to engage in all transactions       necessary to provide financing or other financial services''       in order to effectuate the sales. In November 2016, OFAC       licensed an additional 106 aircraft for purchase by Iran Air,       which are also eligible for financing authorized by OFAC.        (6) The Department of the Treasury had sanctioned Iran Air       in 2011 for its use of commercial passenger aircraft to       transport rockets, missiles, and other military cargo on       behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and       Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, both       of which had been designated under Executive Order 13382 for       weapons proliferation-related activities. In October 2017,       the IRGC went on to be designated under Executive Order 13224       for its support of the IRGC-Qods  [[Page H9881]]       Force, which has provided support to terrorist groups such as       Hizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban.        (7) Among Iran Air's sanctionable activities, the airline       delivered missile or rocket components to the Assad       government in Syria, which like Iran is classified as a state       sponsor of terrorism.        (8) The Assad regime is responsible for a civil conflict       that has claimed an estimated 400,000 lives, including       through the government's deployment of chemical weapons and       barrel bombs against unarmed civilians and children.        (9) Despite being delisted in 2016, Iran Air has continued       to fly known weapons resupply routes to government-controlled       areas of Syria. According to research by the Foundation for       Defense of Democracies, between Implementation Day of the       JCPOA on January 16, 2016, and May 4, 2017, Iran Air operated       at least 134 flights to Syria, which included stops in       Abadan, Iran, a suspected IRGC logistical hub for airlifts to       the Assad regime.        (10) In November 2016 correspondence to the Chairman of the       House Committee on Financial Services, the Department of the       Treasury noted that the commitment to delist Iran Air under       the JCPOA ``does not affect our ability to designate, or re-      designate, any Iranian airline that engages in sanctionable       activity. The United States retains the ability to designate       any individual or entity that engages in sanctionable       activities under our authorities targeting conduct outside       the scope of the JCPOA, including Iran's support for       terrorism, human rights abuses, ballistic missile program,       and other destabilizing activities in the region.''.        (11) In April 2017, Iran announced a deal for Aseman       Airlines to purchase up to 60 commercial aircraft, a       transaction that would require authorization by OFAC. Aseman       Airlines' chief executive officer, Hossein Alaei, has for       decades served as a senior member of the IRGC.       SEC. 3.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                time  1730                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 4324, which is a  commonsense piece of legislation sponsored by my good friend and fellow  Texan, Mr. Williams. His work as a member of the Financial Services  Committee and as vice chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee has been invaluable.   Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues know, under the Iran nuclear bill,  also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the  Obama administration committed the U.S. to license the sale of aircraft  to Iran.   In addition to authorizing the sales, these licenses have authorized  banks to engage in financing, even though Iran remains classified by  the Treasury Department as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering  concern. On top of that, the State Department continues to label Iran  as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism.   The recipient of these aircraft would be Iran Air, the state-owned  airline that was sanctioned as recently as 2011 for supporting the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which itself has been designated by  the Trump administration as a terrorist organization. So, Mr. Speaker,  so far, so bad.   And yet, while I and many of my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle find these aircraft sales and their financing deeply disturbing,  Mr. Williams' bill is about something far, far simpler. All  [[Page H9882]]  his bill would do is bring about the implications of the aircraft  finance for Iran out into the sunlight. In other words, Mr. Speaker, it  is a reporting requirement--nothing more, nothing less.   It would simply require Treasury to help Congress understand who is  involved in these transactions. If it is an airline, has that airline  stopped supporting terrorists or other sanctioned persons. If it is a  bank, does that bank have the due diligence in place to guard against  the immense illicit finance risk endemic to Iran.   All this legislation does is have Treasury certify this information  for Congress. And, if Treasury can't make those certifications, it  simply has to notify us what plans it has in response, even if it has  no plans in response.   So, when we hear today from the other side of the aisle how this bill  may impose new conditions on Iran or somehow stand in the way of  commitments under the JCPOA, I suggest, again, everyone read the bill.  It is simple. It is common sense. In fact, we should be considering  this under the expedited process of the suspension calendar.   This legislation provides, again, for a simple reporting requirement,  Mr. Speaker; that is it, a reporting requirement.   If my friends who oppose this bill don't care enough to even request  the information from the executive branch, especially information that  may reveal the use of their constituents' bank deposits for the benefit  of enablers of terrorism, well, Mr. Speaker, that is a sad, sad day for  congressional oversight and a sad day for the United States Congress.   But there are people who have read the bill, if everybody in this  institution hasn't, people, for example, associated with the Foundation  for Defense of Democracies, who wrote recently in a November 22 policy  brief for the Foundation's Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance:  ``The proposed bill supports Treasury's robust licensing approval  process by codifying steps that are likely already central to the  Department's evaluation process.''   They go on to write, Mr. Speaker: ``While not imposing any new  standards for the approval of sales to Iran, codifying the existing  standards in law through this bill makes the licensing process more  transparent and gives the American people--through their elected  representatives--a clear picture of a significant component of the  sanctions relief provided to Iran under the nuclear agreement.''   Mr. Speaker, I include this report in the Record.      [From the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Nov. 22, 2017]     Congress Supports Financial Transparency for Iranian Transactions                     (By Annie Fixler, Tyler Stapleton)         The House Financial Services Committee approved last week       the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act,       which codifies in law a set of conditions that the U.S.       Treasury must use to evaluate licenses for the sale of       commercial aircraft to Iran.        The bill requires the secretary of the Treasury to report       within 30 days whether transactions related to the export and       re-export of aircraft to Iran pose a ``significant money       laundering or terrorism financing risk to the United States       financial system.'' The secretary must also determine whether       the transactions benefit any Iranian person that has       knowingly transported or otherwise supported the       proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or provided       material support to persons included on Treasury's sanctions       lists. If the secretary cannot certify that the transaction       meets these conditions, he must explain whether the licenses       authorizing the transaction will be revoked, modified, or       remain valid despite the potential for illicit transactions       or benefits going to sanctioned persons.        Under the July 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint       Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the United States       committed to allowing the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran       provided the planes are used ``exclusively for commercial       passenger aviation.'' The JCPOA specifically states that if       aircraft are either used for a prohibited purpose or       transferred or re-sold to individuals or entities on       Washington's sanctions lists, the U.S. would view this as       grounds to cease its approval of aircraft sales--but, by       implication, not abrogate the nuclear deal in full.        Upon the implementation of the JCPOA in January 2016,       Treasury issued a Statement of Licensing Policy (SLP) and       additional guidance reiterating and expanding on the relevant       language from the nuclear deal. The SLP and related guidance       indicate that Treasury would view license applications       favorably but would review applications on a case-by-case       basis and ``include appropriate conditions to ensure'' that       no sanctioned persons were involved in the transaction.        The SLP and related guidance are clearly consistent with       the JCPOA, which does not require the United States to issue       licenses for aircraft sales without conditions. Accordingly,       the SLP does not guarantee that all applications will be       approved. If Washington determines that certain criteria are       necessary in order to ensure that commercial aircraft are       used appropriately, it is permitted to reject an application       that does not meet those criteria.        The proposed bill supports Treasury's robust licensing       approval process by codifying steps that are likely already       central to the department's evaluation process. First, for       more than two decades, Treasury has been at the forefront of       efforts to implement global anti-money laundering and       counter-terrorism financing standards. The bill emphasizes       that these standards should be a critical component in the       evaluation of licenses vis-a-vis Iranian aircraft       transactions. Second, the bill's requirement that no persons       knowingly supporting proliferation benefit from the deal       mirrors Treasury's statement that no persons on sanctions       lists be involved in the transactions.        While not imposing any new standards for the approval of       sales to Iran, codifying the existing standards in law       through this bill makes the licensing process more       transparent and gives the American people--through their       elected representatives--a clearer picture of a significant       component of the sanctions relief provided to Iran under the       nuclear agreement.        The most novel component of the bill is that it requires       the secretary of the Treasury to issue a report listing all       U.S. or foreign financial institutions that have conducted       authorized transactions in connection with the export or re-      export of commercial aircraft to Iran. While not classified,       this information is not currently part of the public record.       Objections to the publication of a list of companies and       banks involved in aircraft sales revolve around exposing       businesses to reputational risks for transacting with Iran.       Yet it is unavoidable for there to be reputational risk for       doing business--even legal business--with the world's leading       state sponsor of terrorism.     In closing, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman, my fellow  Texan, has given all Members an opportunity, no matter what their views  on the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, to simply support transparency and  Congress' right to basic information. I hope that my colleagues will  seize that opportunity.   And, again, I thank Mr. Williams from Texas for his leadership and  his excellent work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), my friend, the sponsor of this legislation, and a  great member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), an outstanding member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of its Subcommittee on the  Middle East and North Africa.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed leader for this  time, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening  Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act, authored by our good friend  Mr. Williams of Texas, who is swinging for the fences.   When the Obama administration signed this terrible Iran nuclear deal,  in addition to the lifting of sanctions and sending billions of dollars  to this hideous regime, it also authorized licenses for the export of  commercial passenger planes to Iran.   After selling the world a bill of goods, the administration then  turned around and agreed to allow the sale of planes to the world's  biggest exporter of terror. Not only that, but U.S. financial  institutions would be needed to finalize these sales, meaning American  taxpayers' dollars could be used to finance these sales.   The results were predictable, Mr. Speaker. Iran has been using its  commercial planes to transport fighters, to transport weapons, to  transport material to Hezbollah in Syria, just to mention one. The list  could go on and on, many illicit activities.   This is not something that Americans would be supporting, let alone  underwriting. That is why Mr. Williams' bill is so important, and I  thank Mr. Hensarling for bringing it to the floor. It protects the U.S.  financial system, and it protects the taxpayers by giving us in  Congress greater oversight. That is what this bill is about: oversight  over business that the Treasury authorizes with Iran.   As we have heard speaker after speaker, Iran is the number one  leading state sponsor of terror. It is responsible for the deaths of  countless brave American men and women fighting overseas. It is the  destabilizing force in Syria, to name just one of the countries.   The Supreme Leader calls for the destruction of our most trusted  ally, the democratic Jewish State of Israel; and the calls for ``death  to America,'' Mr. Speaker, they go on and on, and it is written on  walls.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, the JCPOA was flawed. We all know  that. It was weak and it was dangerous.   Let's ask our constituents, our taxpayers, if they want their dollars  to fund the purchase of planes for the number one state sponsor of  terror. I think that the answer would be ``no.''   We are actually being asked to supposedly support American jobs by  helping Iran, the number one terror state, to buy planes so this horrid  human-rights abuser of a country, this killer of Americans can use  these very planes to continue exporting its terror activities  throughout the world.  [[Page H9888]]    This is preposterous. It is a false choice.   Mr. Speaker, this bill protects the American consumer; it protects  our constituents; it protects the taxpayer; and it gives us in Congress  the proper oversight. Let's pass what this is: a commonsense bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 4  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 5\1/2\ minutes  remaining.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   On October 13, 2017, the Director General of the International Atomic  Energy Agency--that is, the IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that, since  January 2016, has been monitoring and verifying Iran's implementation  of its nuclear-related commitments--released a statement noting that,  ``At present, Iran is subject to the world's most robust nuclear  verification regime,'' confirming that Iran remains in compliance with  its JCPOA commitments.   The same day, President Trump announced that he had refused to  certify the national security value of the Iran nuclear deal, which  gave Congress 60 days to fatally undermine the agreement by re- introducing some or all of the suspended sanctions; although, Congress  did not do so.   Despite the fact that the President did not withdraw from the nuclear  accord, his disdain for the agreement has always been clear. In a  highly confrontational speech, President Trump forcefully denounced the  Islamic republic and attacked the deal for failing to curb Iran's  destabilizing regional activities, despite the fact the accord was  never meant to address every aspect of Iran's maligned activities. It  was always intended to focus on Iran's nuclear program.   As an arms control agreement, the deal has, so far, been successful.                                time  1830    Trump has threatened to upend the nuclear deal unless Congress amends  it to make its terms more restrictive. The President is looking to find  any rationale he can to walk away from the deal without having to take  the blame. This legislation is precisely what he has been looking for.   But American unilateralism, at this point, would be a disaster and  would make forging a common front against Iran nearly impossible in the  future. That is one way of ensuring failure at the outset of a  diplomatic effort to pursue a new multilateral agreement, would be to  violate an existing one with the same partners.   The President's insistence on renegotiating the JCPOA to extend the  duration of several of its constraints make inspections more intrusive  and expand its coverage to missiles. It is dangerous and unrealistic,  given that every other signatory of the agreement has objected to  changing its terms while Iran remains compliant.   If Congress passes this bill, it would give the administration the  path it needs to rip up the nuclear card without the constraints placed  on Iran by the deal. The administration's hostile attitude towards Iran  and stark absence of diplomacy will inevitably put the United States on  a path of escalation with Iraq. There is an obvious link with North  Korea here as well. Hopefully, at some point, the President may  determine that diplomacy has a role in managing the North Korean  nuclear missile challenges.   But America's ability to offer a credible, diplomatic path will be  seriously undermined if we cannot be trusted to stand by our agreement  dealing with Iran to destabilize regional activities. Its ambition to  remake large swaths of the Middle East in its image entails a broad  range of challenges. Without the JCPOA, however, those challenges  become even more daunting.   I urge my colleagues not to give up on our best chance of containing  Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons through peaceful means and to join me  in rejecting this terrible bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), a member of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 4 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 4 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, from time to time in my Congressional career I come to  the House floor, and I have a surreal moment. Iran is the world's  foremost state sponsor of terror, and we have Members on the other side  of the aisle saying: Well, we shouldn't learn anything about them. We  shouldn't learn about who is financing their aircraft. We shouldn't  learn whether or not aircraft will be converted for military purposes.   Iran is a regime where every day the leadership wakes up shouting:  ``Death to Israel, Death to America.'' Yet I have friends on the other  side of the aisle who say: Well, we shouldn't have any reporting on  Iran because it might hurt their feelings.   This is a surreal moment, Mr. Speaker, an absolute surreal moment. We  have been told over and over that somehow this stops the JCPOA, the  nuclear deal with Iran. I wish it did, but it doesn't. I would suggest  to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if they actually read the  bill, it is 10 pages long, 6 pages of findings. You can put the  findings aside and read the 4 pages. It is a reporting bill.   It has certifications. And guess what the implications are if the  administration can't give the proper certifications? Nothing. The deal  continues to go on. It is perhaps the single worst foreign policy  agreement in the history of America that legitimizes Iran's nuclear  program and, on its best day, slows up their nuclear weapons by maybe a  few years, at best, on its best day.    When the JCPOA was sold to us by the previous administration, we were  told: This would be for civilian aircraft use only. Don't worry about  it. This is not going to exacerbate terrorism in any way. But we know  Boeing itself says their aircraft, which are being sold to Iran, can be  used for combat purposes, and, in fact, have been. Iran Air was cited  in 2011. It was sanctioned for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary  Guard Corps, which has been designated as a terrorist organization.  [[Page H9889]]    This isn't just theory, Mr. Speaker. It is a fact. Then we had my  colleague, the gentleman from Washington, say: Well, it is important  that we sell aircraft to Iran so companies can make profits. Well,  using his logic, maybe we ought to sell weapons to North Korea if some  company can make a profit. I think not, Mr. Speaker.   There are some things that are more important. Our security is even  more important than the profit of any one particular company. So,  again, this is a simple reporting requirement.   I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) for his  leadership here. It is incredibly important that we understand from  those who sold us this terrible Iranian deal, they need to make good on  their promises.   We need to make sure that civilian aircraft are being used for  civilian purposes. We need to make sure that the banks who are  financing these deals are not financing terrorism. Yet those on the  other side of the aisle say: No, let's put our heads in the sand. Let's  just trust--let's trust the world's foremost state sponsor of  terrorism. They will do the right thing. Let's just ignore this  terrorism thing.   No. No, Mr. Speaker. That is why it is so important that we enact  H.R. 4324, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for it. It is important  to America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act,  introduced by my friend Roger Williams. This bill is critical to  Congress' sustained effort to roll back the most egregious concessions  from the Obama Administration's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I have spoken many times about how the Iran deal  endangers our national security, namely by acquiescing to Iran's  ambition to become a nuclear threshold in less than a decade. As if  this concession--and the woefully inadequate inspections regime  President Obama agreed to--were not troubling enough, the deal came  with dozens of additional sweeteners for Iran that were folded into the  main text of the agreement and an unknown number of side-deals.   These inducements were wrong on principle and they are downright  dangerous in practice. On principle, Iran should not be gently  incentivized to come clean about its nuclear program--it should be  strictly compelled to comply with international norms. In practice,  these numerous U.S. concessions to Iran effectively handed the world's  largest sponsor of terrorism more resources to advance its campaign for  regional hegemony. By providing $115 billion in sanctions relief, a  $1.7 billion ransom payment, and an $8.6 million payment for excess  heavy water that violated the terms of the deal, the Obama  Administration's calamitous deal generated a windfall for the Iranian  regime.   Mr. Speaker, one especially troubling concession was the Obama  Administration's agreement in the text of the deal to sell commercial  passenger aircraft to Iran while at the same time lifting sanctions on  Iran Air, a national carrier notorious for ferrying Iran's military  manpower and materiel around the region. Iran Air was sanctioned by the  United States in July 2011 under Executive Order 13382 for ``for  providing material support and services to the Islamic Revolutionary  Guards Corps and Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces  Logistics.'' Lest we believe Iran Air has straightened up its act since  2011, the Washington Free Beacon reported in August on images from this  summer showing Iranian militiamen flying Iran Air to join the civil war  in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, it's also clear that Iran has never had a greater  incentive than it does today to double down on its hegemonic schemes as  it expands its footholds in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere  in the region. We have long known of Iran's genocidal intentions toward  our critical and democratic ally, Israel. For years Iran has poured  money and resources into Hizballah and Hamas to develop proxies that  can threaten Israel on its borders. Today, however, Iran is closer than  ever to achieving its own toehold near the Israeli-controlled Golan  Heights from which to menace Israel and terrorize its people.   Why, in this context, would the United States knowingly furnish Iran  with aircraft it needs to move its military assets around the region?  Yet, as we speak, a sale of 80 Boeing aircraft to Iran Air, worth as  much as $16.6 billion, is on track to proceed unless the Administration  wisely intervenes or Congress hits the brakes.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324 is crucial to applying necessary and thorough  scrutiny to this deal or others like it. This bill will require the  Department of the Treasury to certify that the beneficiaries of any  such deal do not include Iranians known to be involved in transporting  materiel or other resources for designated individuals or groups. Given  Iran Air's sinister past, it is only logical to demand this sort of  certification.   Furthermore, the bill would require the Treasury to certify that any  such transaction does not pose a ``significant money laundering or  terrorism financing risk to the U.S. financial system.'' Again,  considering that Iran remains the world's largest financier of  terrorism and on the Financial Action Task Force's blacklist of  countries that pose a high risk of money laundering, it is only  responsible to establish this sort of standard for major U.S.  transactions with Iranian companies.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to support H.R. 1638, the Iranian  Leadership Asset Transparency Act, introduced by my friend Bruce  Poliquin. This bill requires common sense reporting to Congress on the  terrorism financing and money laundering threat posed by Iran to help  us address it more effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these timely and  critical measures.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.                     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Gaetz     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the  aisle seem to be schizophrenic. They can't seem to figure out whether  they want to coddle Iran or to ``stand up to'' Iran. We were also told  that H.R. 4324 was designed to ``blame and shame'' financial  institutions, and now they offer a motion to recommit to blame and  shame financial institutions.   So here is what is going on, Mr. Speaker: What we have is a regime  that wakes up every morning shouting ``Death to America; death to  Israel,'' and yet we have a motion to recommit trying to relitigate the  2016 Presidential election.   We have a regime which has been certified as the world's foremost  state sponsor of terrorism whom we are trying to hold accountable and  from whom we are trying to get information, and our friends on the  other side of the aisle are trying to relitigate the 2016 Presidential  election.   We know that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps supports the Assad  regime in Syria. According to the U.N., the Assad government, with the  help of Iran, has now carried out 27 chemical weapon attacks since the  start of the Syrian conflict, including an April 2017 sarin gas attack  that killed more than 80 people, including scores of women and  children, and my friends on the other side of the aisle want to  relitigate the 2016 Presidential election.    Mr. Speaker, Iran continues to imprison foreign nationals, including  Americans--including Americans--including 81-year-old Baquer Namazi,  who has lost his teeth in prison due to malnutrition. We have had  another American prisoner, a student at Princeton, who has suffered  health problems, and yet my friends on the other side of the aisle,  with their motion to recommit, want to relitigate the 2016 Presidential  election.   This is a serious moment, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4324 by the gentleman  from Texas is an important piece of legislation to ensure that civilian  aircraft sales to Iran remain civilian aircraft and that our financial  institutions are not unwittingly helping to finance this rogue  terrorist regime, and it is no time to relitigate an election that my  friends on the other side of the aisle lost.  [[Page H9891]]    We need to reject the motion to recommit, and we need to enact H.R.  4324.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
