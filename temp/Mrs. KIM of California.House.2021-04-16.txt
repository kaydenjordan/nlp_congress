 Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer some  words of appreciation to someone in my 39th Congressional District in  California who deserves special Congressional recognition.   For 30 years, La Habra Chief of Police Jerry Price has unselfishly  served and protected our community in the La Habra Police Department.   Chief Price joined the La Habra Police Department in 1991 and quickly  rose through the ranks across multiple bureaus, most recently serving  as chief of police for the past 8 years.   Chief Price always set an example for other officers and the  community, always having a positive attitude and serving with pride. He  also has actively mentored and prepared others for success in law  enforcement.   It is because of these admirable qualities that Chief Price has  earned many awards and accolades, not only from the La Habra community,  but also from other outside law enforcement agencies.   I thank Chief Jerry Price for his 30 years of service and the past 8  years as chief of police, and I offer my sincere congratulations on his  retirement.                            ____________________
