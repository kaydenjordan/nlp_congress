 Mr. Speaker, while I will be unable to support the  NDAA if it includes a provision that would derail offshore wind  production, I thank the Chair for crafting a bill that continues to  orient our military strategy toward the Indo-Pacific and for including  three of my amendments.   The first amendment requires an independent evaluation of the  Pentagon's procurement practices to ensure that, in keeping with the  law, it drives a harder bargain with the commercial sector. The  Pentagon's price tag is too high in large measure because the  bureaucracy too often pays for process, not performance.   My second amendment would encourage the DOD to use innovative housing  production companies to build multifamily homes for Active  servicemembers. This will bring down housing and energy costs for  military families while also spurring innovative housing development  models that will benefit the wider economy.   My third amendment would help establish a process for alerting  servicemembers about exposure to PFAS so that they may get the care  they need. Again, it is my hope that this spurs best practices for  wider adoption as Americans in Massachusetts and beyond grapple with  the fallout from PFAS exposure.
