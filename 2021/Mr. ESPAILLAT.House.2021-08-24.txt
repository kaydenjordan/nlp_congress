 Madam Speaker, we are living through a 21st century  assault on the right to vote--the likes of which we haven't seen since  Jim Crow.   Without a doubt, it's the most significant test of our democracy  since the Civil War--and future generations will never forgive us if we  don't meet this moment.   Meeting this moment requires us to act--and we need the John Lewis  Voting Rights Act.   The right to vote is sacred, the cornerstone of our Republic. But  like Franklin Roosevelt warned--our Republic, if we can keep it.   Today's vote is a referendum on how willing we are to stand by our  oath--the oath we took to protect our democracy.   We must keep it.   Our democracy depends on how we vote today.   Vote to protect the future of this country.
