 Mr President, I support the nomination of Mr. Kevin Allen  Hassett to serve as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. His  nomination received wide bipartisan support, not only in the Banking  Committee, but also from other esteemed members of his profession.   Mr. Hassett was voted out of our committee on a voice vote with  widespread support. We received a letter in favor of his nomination  signed by a bipartisan group of 44 economists, including 14 former  Chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers and two former Federal  Reserve Chairmen. At Mr. Hassett's confirmation hearing, he expertly  fielded questions on a wide range of economic issues and provided  insights on progrowth policies that would support all members of the  economy. In my office, we discussed at length his extensive experience  in economic and tax policy modeling.   Mr. Hassett brings a wealth of relevant experience in academia,  government, and policy. His counsel, insight, and expertise will be  invaluable as the administration addresses initiatives like tax reform,  which undoubtedly will have a large impact on the macro economy.   Thank you.
