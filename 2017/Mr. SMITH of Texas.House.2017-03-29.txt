 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 229, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1430) to prohibit the Environmental Protection  Agency from proposing, finalizing, or disseminating regulations or  assessments based upon science that is not transparent or reproducible,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1430.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment  Act of 2017, or HONEST Act, requires the Environmental Protection  Agency to base its regulations on science that is publicly available.   Why would anyone want to hide this information from the American  people?   I thank former Science Committee member and former Environment  Subcommittee Chairman David Schweikert for his longtime commitment to  this issue, and for sponsoring the Secret Science Reform Act in the  113th Congress. In the last Congress, a similar bill passed the House  with bipartisan support. Our goal is to help advance not just any  science, but the best science.   The HONEST Act is a nonpartisan bill: a change in administration does  not affect the public's right to know and see the science behind the  EPA's regulations.   This legislation ensures that sound science is the basis for EPA  decisions and regulatory actions. The days of ``trust-me science'' are  over. In our modern Information Age, Federal regulations should be  based only upon data that is available for every American to see, and  that can be subjected to independent review. That is called the  scientific method.   We can all agree that the government should rely on the best  available science. Unfortunately, the government does not always hold  to this standard. Looking at the EPA's past record, it is clear that  the Agency has not followed an open and honest process. For example,  many major air-quality regulations from the previous administration  were justified by data that the EPA said they had not seen, even though  they proposed the regulation.   This means that the EPA's claims about the cost and benefits of its  regulations and the real risk they are meant to address cannot be  independently verified by unbiased experts. If the EPA's mandates  really are based on sound science, then the American people should be  allowed to see the data. The EPA's past refusal to cooperate, leads to  the question: What have they been hiding?   Americans have a right to be suspicious.   Mr. Speaker, we all care about the environment, but if policies are  not based on legitimate science, regulations will result in economic  hardship with little or no environmental benefits. In other words, the  regulations would be all pain and no gain.   This bill strengthens the previous House-passed legislation of the  last Congress, the Secret Science Reform Act. That bill also required  the EPA to base its decisions on information fully available to  scientists and the American people.   You may hear from opponents of this legislation that it costs too  much money. That is based on a CBO estimate from 2 years ago that  misinterprets the implementation requirements of the bill. CBO has not  reissued that misinterpretation this year after consulting with the  EPA.   All the HONEST Act requires is that the EPA use science that is  publicly available, not make all science public itself. So the cost is  negligible.   Some critics may claim that it puts personal data at risk. This is  false. The HONEST Act specifically requires  [[Page H2537]]  redactions of personally identifiable information and confidential  business information.   It is also misleading to assert that the bill tells scientists how to  conduct science. The opposite is true. The bill reinforces the  scientific method and its tenets of observing, hypothesizing, testing,  gathering and sharing data, and analyzing and challenging the resulting  theories. It allows independent researchers to evaluate the studies  that the EPA uses to justify its regulations.   The HONEST Act promotes sound science and restores confidence in the  EPA decisionmaking process.   Finally, the HONEST Act ensures that the EPA is not promoting a one- sided ideological agenda. The legislation provides for the type of open  and accountable government that the American people want and deserve.   You are either for an open and honest government, or you are not. If  you are, then support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to alleviate the ranking member's unfounded  concerns and remind her that the National Academy of Sciences itself  has explained that transparency in science is possible without any risk  to confidentiality or privacy.   This is what the National Academy of Sciences said: ``Nothing in the  past suggests that increasing access to research data without damage to  privacy and confidentiality rights is beyond scientific reach.''   So I hope that will alleviate her concerns. Really, it comes down to  whether you are for an open and honest government or not. That is what  this bill is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), who is the chairman of the Space Subcommittee of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is the vice chairman of the Science,  Space, and Technology's Subcommittee on Environment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I don't see how we can make it more clear to anybody who  brings up the privacy arguments. If they go to lines 17 through 21 of  page 2 of the bill, it states:   `` . . . any personally identifiable information, trade secrets, or  commercial or financial information obtained from a person and  privileged or confidential, shall be redacted prior to public  availability.''   Any misconstruing of that is unfortunate, and it is not an accurate  description of that provision.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  LaHood), who is also the chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology's Subcommittee on Oversight.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to keep up with all the misstatements about  this bill, but I am going to try. The immediate past speaker on the  other side talked about the cost of the bill; and I am sure he didn't  do it intentionally, but he was using a 2-year-out-of-date cost.   We have an email from the CBO as of this past Monday that says the  CBO estimates this legislation would not affect direct spending or  revenues, so there is no cost, despite what Members might hear  otherwise.   Also, it is just hard for me to understand how any Member of Congress  [[Page H2542]]  could oppose open and honest government. All this bill does is to say  that the data has to be transparent, the data has to be publicly  available.   If they want more government control, more environmental regulations  that can't be justified, that is one thing; but don't oppose the bill  for the wrong reasons. The bill does nothing more than require open,  transparent, and honest government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar), who is a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a couple of times today that the bill  prevents the EPA from using the best available science.   I hope that Members who are listening to this debate, and others,  will take the time to actually look at the language of the bill. Here  is the exact language, page 2, line 13. The first requirement of the  bill is that the EPA ``use the best available science.'' I don't know  what more we can do and how better we can spell it out.   The bill is only a little over three pages long. I really do  recommend that the folks who oppose it read the bill itself and  actually look at the language and the usual understanding and  definition of the words, and I hope they will be satisfied.   We have also heard that the scientific community opposes the bill,  but let me quote from a couple of Obama administration officials. Dr.  John Holdren, the President's science adviser, said that: ``Absolutely,  the data on which regulatory decisions are based should be made  available to the committee and should be made public.''   The same was said by the chair of the EPA's Science Advisory Board.  This is the EPA's Science Advisory Board. They testified before the  committee that literature and data used by the EPA be made available to  the public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall), who is the vice chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from Colorado attended the hearing  we had this morning on the scientific method and climate change, but I  am not sure he was listening, because not a single witness on either  side denied the facts around climate change.   I also want to reassure him--he is worried about Colorado, and I  understand that--that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  found that there was low confidence in any connection between climate  change and extreme weather events. So I hope there will not be any  unusual extreme weather events in Colorado.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), a member of the Natural Resources Committee and the  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), who is the chairman of the Environment  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?  And I would like to know if the other side, the minority, has any more  speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a former member of the Science  Committee, who is still missed, a former chairman of the Environment  Subcommittee, and the author of a very similar bill to this in a  previous Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, costly environmental regulations should only be based  upon data that is available to independent scientists and the public  and that can be verified.   H.R. 1430, the HONEST Act, gives independent scientists an  opportunity to validate the studies the EPA uses to make new  regulations. What this bill does not do is roll back the laws that  protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. It simply requires  the EPA to base regulations on science that is publicly available.   This is a nonpartisan bill. A change in administration does not  change the need or justification for it. This is the same bill,  virtually, introduced in the last administration, and that is evidenced  by my introduction of this good-government legislation with my  Democratic colleague Henry Cuellar. That shows it is a good, bipartisan  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  promote a more open and honest Federal Government. We should not be  afraid of letting the American people see the data that the EPA or  other agencies say justifies their regulations.   So let's vote for an open and honest government and support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
