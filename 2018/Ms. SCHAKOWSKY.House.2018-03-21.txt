 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his generosity  and time.   I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that I rise in opposition to H.R. 5247  because it creates a dangerous back door for modern-day snake oil  salesmen, a back door around the FDA approval process for people who  may or may not be preying on desperate people, and it ignores that  there actually is a safe pathway for terminally ill patients to get  treatment.   This bill failed to pass last week and it should fail again. It is a  harmful policy that both Republican-and Democratic-appointed former FDA  Commissioners concluded there is ``no evidence'' that this bill ``would  meaningfully improve access for patients, but would just remove the FDA  from the approval process and create a dangerous precedent that would  erode protections for vulnerable patients,'' the most vulnerable  patients. People whose lives are in danger feel that they will try  anything, and there are people out there who will prey on that.   This bill denies patients what they really need, which is safe and  effective treatments. This bill strips away important safeguards in the  name of helping patients, but it does not, and that is why 78 patient  groups and doctors, groups like the American Cancer Society, the Cystic  Fibrosis Foundation, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, oppose this  bill. In total, there are now 110 groups opposing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record a multipage list  of opponents to this bill.

Mr. Speaker, it opens the door for bad actors to take  advantage of terminally ill patients. It is the FDA's job to ensure  that drugs are safe and effective, and we can't trust manufacturers to  act as this gatekeeper.   There is already a safe process for terminally ill patients to access  experimental treatments. Under what is called the expanded access  program, 99 percent of applications are approved. The expanded access  program plays a vital safety role.   I am very troubled by what can happen to patients in some States who  undergo treatment from right-to-try companies. In 19 States, patients  using an investigational drug could actually lose their hospice  coverage; in 6 States, they could be denied home care coverage. These  are the very people who are dependent on hospice and home healthcare,  and this bill would cause them to lose that coverage.   This is not a humane, patient-centered bill for people who are facing  death; it is just a dangerous pathway for bad actors to exploit those  very people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5247, and, again, I  thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak against this piece of  legislation.
