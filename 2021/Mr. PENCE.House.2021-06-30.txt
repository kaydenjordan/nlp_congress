 Madam Speaker, I am going to get straight to the point  since infrastructure is fundamental to a Hoosier's way of life back  home in Indiana and across America.   I rise today in support of my amendment to codify the Rural  Opportunities to Use Transportation for Economic Success, or the ROUTES  initiative.   The ROUTES initiative, first introduced in 2019, works to ensure that  rural communities like mine get their fair share of federal funding for  infrastructure.   This amendment would provide much-needed technical assistance for  [[Page H3538]]  local municipalities, strengthening their ability to be competitive in  applying for Federal funds.   Indiana is the ``Crossroads of America.'' We see billions in commerce  come through our State via airports, highways, and railways.   My home State, and countless other parts of the country are just as  dependent on reliable, safe, and updated infrastructure.   That is why in April I introduced this bipartisan legislation with my  colleague from Texas, Congressman Henry Cuellar.    Madam Speaker, in short, this means rural America will  have the ability to improve critical infrastructure that will drive  economic competitiveness and improve safety.   Madam Speaker, I am thankful this issue has remained a bipartisan  priority, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so  Congress can continue to recognize the infrastructure needs of our  rural communities across America.
