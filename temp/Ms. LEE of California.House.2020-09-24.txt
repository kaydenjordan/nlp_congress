 Mr. Speaker, yesterday a Kentucky grand jury  indicted one--just one--of the three officers involved in the tragic  shooting of Breonna Taylor.   Rather than being held accountable for this murder of an unarmed  young Black woman, the indicted officer, instead, received a slap on  the fist while the others responsible remain free.   Mr. Speaker, this shows, again, how our broken, racist criminal  justice system cares more about damaged property than Black lives. If  this court were concerned about endangering others, how can they ignore  the life that was taken in plain sight?   401 years of white supremacy and oppression have rotted our criminal  justice system. If there is any doubt that systemic racism exists, look  to this decision.   The Senate must take up the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,  which would finally put an end to no-knock warrants.   Breonna Taylor deserves better than this. Her family deserves better  than this. We cannot give up until there is true justice. We deserve a  justice system that recognizes that Black lives matter.   Say her name.                            ____________________
