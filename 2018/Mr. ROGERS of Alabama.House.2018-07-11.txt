 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome our guest  chaplain, Reverend John Hill. Reverend Hill lives in Alexander City,  Alabama, and is the pastor of Flint Hill United Methodist Church.   In 2010, Reverend Hill had his ordination as elder in the United  Methodist Church; and in 2017, he achieved senior chaplain status with  the International Conference of Police Chaplains, certification in  critical incident stress management, and became a certified instructor  for group crisis intervention.   Reverend Hill has done chaplain work with several police departments  across the State as well as with the Alabama Department of Public  Safety. He also was selected to serve as a volunteer chaplain for the  United States Secret Service.   Reverend Hill is joined today by his wife, Jill, and their three  children, and it is my honor to welcome him to the House of  Representatives and our Nation's Capitol.                            ____________________
