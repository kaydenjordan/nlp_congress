 Mr. Speaker, it is only day 13 into the Donald Trump  administration and we are already faced with yet another round of  questions about President Trump's potential conflicts of interest over  his business holdings.   The most recent issue to raise questions is President Trump's Muslim  ban executive order. At face value, this action looks like yet another  harmful step in his divisive agenda. Trump's hateful scapegoating of  refugees will make us less safe, and it goes against our country's  moral fiber and small ``d'' democratic values. It is hard to believe  that these seven countries were targeted based on a serious threat that  was posed by their citizens who were traveling to the United States.   The people responsible for some of the most egregious attacks on  American soil in recent decades, including 9/11, the Times Square  bombing, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Pulse nightclub shooting, and  others did not come from these seven countries. In fact, refugees from  these countries already face a lengthy and rigorous vetting process led  by our security intelligence agencies. This 20-step process involves  multiple background checks, interviews, and screenings, and it  frequently takes between 18 and 24 months for approval.   However, these seven countries do have at least one thing in common.  According to Bloomberg News, The Trump Organization does not have  business or has not pursued business deals in any of them. President  Trump does, on the other hand, have business ties to other countries in  the region that were excluded from the ban. His FEC filings indicate  The Trump Organization has development projects in Saudi Arabia and  business projects possibly related to Egypt. These countries were  excluded from the executive order despite their being home to many of  the terrorists who carried out 9/11. In Turkey, President Trump has a  licensing deal for two luxury towers to use his name--a deal he  received up to $5 million for just last year. He also has licensing  agreements with businesses in other countries in the region.   I am not saying that we should ban people from these countries. I  firmly oppose any ban that is based on nationality or religion, but it  is unacceptable that business interests have played potentially a role  in such a destructive policy that also makes our country less safe in  the long run. This move will likely damage relationships with our  Muslim allies who are fighting ISIS militants, and be used as a tool by  the Islamic State to increase their recruitment and radicalization  efforts.    Of course, my friends in the majority and in the White House claim  that the seven countries under this order were similarly targeted by  our previous administration. In reality, President Trump's  discriminatory ban is drastically different than President Obama's  specific changes to the State Department Visa Waiver Program, in which  the changes focused on expedited visa privileges for dual nationals and  did not target all citizens from specific countries; but I will bet you  didn't hear Sean Spicer make that distinction. Instead, the  administration is busy downplaying the number of people who were  impacted by this decision and is claiming that only 109 people were  affected--aka alternative facts. At least 700 people were denied  boarding after the order was issued, and 90,000 people in these  countries already have visas but will not be able to travel to the  United States.   It is time for the President to stop defending his divisive and  unconstitutional executive order and start being transparent about his  business interests. Every President who has been elected in the modern  era has released his tax records to ensure the American people that his  actions will not be impacted by financial holdings. After promising  throughout the campaign to release his tax returns, President Trump's  advisers recently announced that he will indefinitely hide this  information from the public. These holdings potentially put President  Trump in direct violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution  on day one.   The safeguard is designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence  over policy decisions by not allowing Federal officials to take money  from a foreign entity without there being congressional approval; but  we have seen report after report of foreign leaders and diplomats  choosing to stay at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.,  in order to gain favor with the administration. They stand to profit  from foreign governments, including a big paycheck from a Chinese bank,  which is a large tenant at the Trump Tower. These are just tip-of-the- iceberg examples of direct conflicts in both domestic and foreign  policy under this President.   Mr. President, it is time for you to fix this. One, divest your  business holdings immediately to remove any suggestion of there being a  conflict in your decisionmaking. Two, show us your tax returns so that  your business and financial interests are transparent to the American  people. Three, get rid  [[Page H884]]  of your unconstitutional executive order, which will make us less safe  and only serve to embolden our enemies.   Short of that, we will have to take other actions, including  legislative directives, resolutions of disapproval, even exploring the  power of impeachment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin) and the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. Jayapal) for the  Progressive Caucus' Special Order hour.   I was on the floor earlier today talking about my concerns very  specifically around this, as it relates to the countries that were  selected and the fact that these were not countries that were selected  for any reason other than the fact that they are Muslim countries and  that Mr. Trump has decided that they should be included.   What I want to talk about tonight is my district and how this affects  it. We saw the crowds in New York, California, Chicago, Boston, and  other big cities that have international airports and the activities  this weekend; but in Madison, Wisconsin, we have had a very direct  impact. We have 115 faculty, students, and staff, right now, impacted  by this decision. In fact, there is one joint national Canadian-Iranian  student who is in Brazil who has been advised not to come back.   What I want to do is read into the Record this statement. We are  working on a case of someone who is an Iraqi national, and this is a  letter written by someone who served with him in the military. I want  to read this very quickly:         I am contacting you regarding John, an Iraqi national who       earned a special immigration visa for his work with the U.S.       Army over two different 3-year periods in Baghdad and another       region of Iraq.        My personal acquaintance with him, where he is a translator       in a small 12-man military training team I led. The recent       executive order curtailing immigration from Iraq, along with       six other countries, has halted his plan to emigrate with his       family.        He and his fellow translators provided an invaluable       service to the team. They braved the same dangers we all       faced. They rode in the same vehicles, walked the same       streets, met with the same people. The only difference is is       they were unarmed and, after missions when we returned to       secure FOBs, they had to return to live in their communities       unprotected.        John was wounded while working with the U.S. Army, and he       provided honorable service to the country for years.    This is who is the target of President Trump's executive order  banning Muslims. This is wrong, and we need it to stop.   President Trump, rescind your order.
