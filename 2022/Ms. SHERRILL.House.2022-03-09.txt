 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I would like to engage in a colloquy with Chair DeLauro regarding the  Strategic Long-Range Cannon.   I ask my friend from Connecticut, is it the intent of the committee  that a portion of the funds provided under the Technology Maturation  Initiatives line be used to invest in the development of the SLRC  program, should the program supply a spend plan?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.
