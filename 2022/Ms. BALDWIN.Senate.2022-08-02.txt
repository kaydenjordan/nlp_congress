 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, today I rise to recognize the  reclamation of Wisconsin Point from the city of Superior to the Fond du  Lac Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. Wisconsin Point, a narrow strip of  land separating Allouez Bay from Lake Superior, is a small portion of  the Tribe's ancestral home and also an indigenous burial ground dating  back 400 years. At least seven generations were laid to rest at the  Wisconsin Point cemetery, including the Tribal community's leader Chief  Joseph Osaugie.   The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior--or Wayekwaa-gichigamiing  Gichigamiwininiwag--Lake Superior Men at the far end of the Great  Lake--is an Anishinaabe--Ojibwe--band located near what is now known as  Cloquet, MN. The Fond du Lac Band are one of six Tribes who comprise  the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which was organized  in 1934 with a new constitution under the Indian Reorganization Act.   In 1918, approximately 180 Ojibwe graves buried on Wisconsin Point  were exhumed by the U.S. Steel Company and reburied in 29 plots south  of the St. Francis Cemetery to make way for industrial development.  Living Tribal members were also uprooted and removed.   Now, more than 100 years later, significant work has been done by the  city of Superior and Tribal leaders to acknowledge the trauma of the  lives and culture lost.   On August 18, 2022, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe and  the city of Superior jointly host a celebration of the return of  Wisconsin Point's sacred burial ground, as well as the mass grave near  St Francis cemetery to the Tribe.   Please join me in celebrating this historic moment, where once again  the Wisconsin Point lands return back to Lake Superior Ojibwe.                            ____________________
