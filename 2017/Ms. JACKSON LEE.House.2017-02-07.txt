 Mr. Speaker, let me again repeat my concern, when  the United States is compared to the thuggish behavior of Russian  leadership, the attempt to poison individuals who are activists and  opponents to that kind of oppression.   But I want to speak today to what is impacting our neighbors, Mr.  Speaker, and that is the executive order that has been issued by the  President of the United States. I want to dispel any myth that Members  of this body who oppose the executive order are against security for  this Nation.   I am a years'-long member of the Homeland Security Committee, the  Transportation Security Committee, the Border Security Committee, and  work hard to write a stiff border security bill. But, frankly, this is  a Muslim ban, and when a 17-year-old, 16-year-old from my community,  from Jordan, was stopped and held for 48 hours and shipped to Chicago,  that is a Muslim ban.   What I say to those who have executed it is that you have to realize  that the order that you tried to copy from President Obama was not the  same. It was stringent review; it was not rejection. You are rejecting  Muslims and allowing others.   As a Christian, I know that Christians are not being subjected to the  same kind of scrutiny. This is a Muslim ban. I ask the White House, as  we go to court this evening: Why don't you reconsider and pull that  Muslim ban down?                            ____________________
