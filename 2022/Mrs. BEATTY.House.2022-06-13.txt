 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,  the chair of our Special Order, executive board member, a person who  you want to be out front. Whether it is an issue on civil rights,  criminal justice, reparations, voting rights, or domestic violence,  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has earned this day and this right. I could not  think of a better person to stand here as we talk about commemorating  Juneteenth. We know the history all too well of what happened in Texas.  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee hails from Texas.   Today, as we talk about Black excellence, as we talk about the  members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Madam Speaker, we speak to  America tonight. We want America to know that as we commemorate  Juneteenth, it is about our work; it is about our scholarship; it is  about our fight. You will hear a broad range of issues that we are so  proud to stand up for and let America know we are there.   I could not think of a better issue to weave into Juneteenth than  reparations, H.R. 40. Sheila Jackson Lee, if you have been in the room  with her, you have heard her say it at the White House, you have heard  her say it at caucus, you have heard her go in the Halls of Congress  talking about H.R. 40. I could stop there, but I can tell you that  piece of legislation has her fingerprints on it and the signatures of  200-plus Members. What a great way for me to start and to stand here as  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.   Tonight, we commemorate a day in our Nation's history that can only  be described as a celebration of freedom, Juneteenth.   On June 19, 1865, enslaved African Americans in Texas received the  joyous news of emancipation and that they were finally free.   Despite that, we are still enslaved in many ways, so it is critical  for America to know of our fight and our progress.   Tonight, you will hear Members discuss our work on criminal justice,  reparations, uplifting of our Black men and boys, racial equity, fair  housing, and so much more. We are leading the charge and laying the  foundation to deliver on voting rights, student loan debt, and gun  control. Tonight, we tell our story of Black excellence.   Nearly 1 year ago, on June 17, 2021, the Congressional Black Caucus  went to the White House and joined with President Joe Biden and Vice  President Kamala Harris as he signed the historic legislation that made  Juneteenth the 11th national holiday and the first new Federal holiday  since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983.   Now, more than a century-and-a-half later, I stand here as chairwoman  of the largest Congressional Black Caucus in the Nation's history.   Every day, 58 Black members of the Congressional Black Caucus  legislate in these Halls built by our enslaved ancestors. Six full  committee chairs, chair of the Democratic Caucus, the House majority  whip, former senior adviser to the President, and Vice President of  these United States are all active and former members of the  Congressional Black Caucus.   Madam Speaker, we have come so far, but we realize there is still  work to do. Yes, from being considered one-third of a person, we want  the American people to know that we continue fighting.   It was the Congressional Black Caucus that brokered the $1 trillion  infrastructure law for our roads and bridges and provided little  children a broadband network. It was the $1,400 in the pockets of  everyday Americans, the $300 a month for working families with  children, the historic funding for HBCUs, and each Congressional Black  Caucus member bringing community dollars to their district.   We have seen one of the most consequential civil rights legislations  aiming at interrupting the school-to-prison pipeline and uplifting  Black men and boys, the U.S. Commission on Social Status of Black Men  and Boys, created and birthed by our very own Congresswoman Frederica  Wilson, a sojourner for our Black men and boys.   Tonight, you will hear other members of the Congressional Black  Caucus commemorate our successes in the spirit of Juneteenth.   But, Madam Speaker, in the immortal words of Dr. Maya Angelou:  Bringing the gifts that our ancestors gave, we are the dream and the  hope of the slave.   I am proud to proclaim on this floor tonight: Happy Juneteenth Day.  Our power, our message.    Madam Speaker, tonight we have heard from leadership in  the Congressional Black Caucus and leadership in the Democratic Caucus  of the United States Congress.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for threading  the needle, for reminding us of the history of how we started; 1863.  And then 2 years later in 1865 when it was announced that Juneteenth  would exist because Black people were free. Juneteenth, independence  day, freedom day, all of it makes a difference for us because we know  freedom is never given, it is won.   Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure now--another colleague from  the great State of Ohio. Someone who knows the value and importance of  fighting because she is a fighter. She is a sojourner who understands  that her voice speaks for thousands of individuals, especially Black  individuals.   It is a great honor to have a colleague that hails from the same  State that I hail from, the great State of Ohio. She walks in the  footsteps of Congresswoman Marsha Fudge, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs  Jones, and a Congressman--one of the founders of the Congressional  Black Caucus--Congressman Lou Stokes.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Brown), from  the 11th District.    Madam Speaker, we stand here listening. We stand here  revisiting our history. We stand here thinking about our ancestors.                                time  2030    As members of the Congressional Black Caucus 50-plus-1-years-old, we  understand that the fight must continue.   We understand when we walk in these hallowed Halls of justice that we  carry that torch--that torch, freedom, that torch, justice and liberty  for all. It is that responsibility that we acknowledge.   It is that responsibility when I think about the 173 Black people in  the history of this Congress who have served out of some 12,000 people  who have served in these Halls--173 Black people.   When I think about being the ninth Black woman to serve as chair of  the Congressional Black Caucus, I think of the other women: the  sojourners and the truth tellers who served as chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus.   I think of people like Congresswoman Karen Bass, whom I followed.   I think about Congresswoman, and now Secretary of HUD, Marcia Fudge.   I think about Congresswoman Maxine Waters--who is one of six Black  Members of Congress--serving as chair of the Financial Services  Committee.   I think about Congresswoman Barbara Lee from California who is always  out in the forefront and reminding us of the words of Shirley Chisholm.   I think about Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, another colleague  from the great State of Texas. She is a woman who reminds us about  equality and justice and reminds us about the value of collaboration  and standing together in unity. She is the founder of the Tri-Caucus.  She is another fighter for justice, someone who mentors us and stands  back and gives us enough room so we can lead and follow in her  footsteps.   There are so many strong, Black women in the Congressional Black  Caucus.   Then there are the men. There are 29 Members who are female and 29  Members who are male serving now in the Congressional Black Caucus.   So tonight, Madam Speaker, I say, thank you. The two most powerful  words that one can say. I say thank you to our chair of our Special  Order hour, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.   As we begin to bring this night to a close, I am reminded of so many  things that great leaders have said. Someone said that liberty, when it  begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.   We have begun to take root as members of the Congressional Black  Caucus. And we, too, have that same rapid growth of all the things in  this Chamber we have brought to the floor, in this Chamber that we have  voted out and sent to the Senate and to the White House to be signed  into law. So often people will come up to us on the great streets of  America, and they will say: Tell me, what is it that the Congressional  Black Caucus is doing?   But, Madam Speaker, I say no more. No more will you question who we  are. Because our power and our message of Black excellence, of lifting  up and elevating our message and power has reigned through the United  States of America because you see, Madam Speaker, when you talk about  an executive order or police reform, it was the Congressional Black  Caucus that was there when the President signed it.   When you talk about our dealing with student debt, it is the  Congressional Black Caucus that just finished a 2-day issues  conference. We brought before our Congressional Black Caucus issues  forum 10 of the top civil rights leaders in America. They didn't bring  or send a designee. They came themselves before us.   So I want to say, Madam Speaker, that tonight was about Juneteenth.  But tonight was also about letting Americans know that we are fighting  for them, that we stand with them, and that we understand that we must  continue to fight against systemic racism, and we must continue to  fight for our children and our families.   That is what we do because we are the Congressional Black Caucus. Our  power and our message is Black excellence unapologetically strong.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
