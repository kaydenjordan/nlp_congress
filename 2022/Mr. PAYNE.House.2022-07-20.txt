 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great mayor from my  district, Robert Bowser, after his passing recently.   Mayor Bowser served as mayor of East Orange, New Jersey, from 1998 to  2014. He was the first African American to win a third and fourth term  in office in the history of East Orange, and he founded the New Jersey  Conference of Black Mayors and served on the board of the National  Black Conference of Mayors.   But his legacy in East Orange is more than his time as mayor. He  started a small engineering firm that became one of the largest  minority-owned consulting firms on the East Coast. He was a board  member for the local Girl Scouts organization and was active with the  Lions Club and the Kiwanis Club. He even founded a local touch football  league.   As we mourn his passing, we remember Mayor Bowser as a dedicated  public servant, great businessman, and strong community leader.                            ____________________
