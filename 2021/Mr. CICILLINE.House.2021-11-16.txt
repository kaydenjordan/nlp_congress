 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  for convening this Special Order hour.   The impact of this legislation is significant in my home State of  Rhode Island and all across our country. The United States has the  largest economy in the world, yet our roads and bridges are crumbling,  our ports and airports are in disrepair, over 10 million households do  not have safe drinking water. This is unacceptable.   We cannot compete in a global economy unless we can move goods,  services, and information to compete in the 21st century.   The bipartisan infrastructure bill which President Biden signed, and  we worked hard to pass, invests $550 billion in new funding to bring  America's infrastructure into the 21st century so that we cannot only  improve the quality of life, grow our economy, create millions of good- paying jobs, but also to ensure that we can compete globally.   This legislation, which the President signed yesterday, includes the  largest ever Federal investments in public transit, clean drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure, and clean energy transmission and  electric vehicle infrastructure. It includes the largest investment in  passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak, and the largest dedicated  bridge investment since we built the Interstate Highway System.   This legislation will create millions of good-paying union jobs while  also addressing the critical infrastructure needs of our country and of  my home State of Rhode Island.   This monumental investment in infrastructure is the first part of a  plan to not only create good-paying jobs but to ensure Americans have  the support they need to succeed in those jobs. Combined with the Build  Back Better Act, these two historic bills will create 1\1/2\ million  good-paying jobs each year over the next decade and accelerate  America's path to full employment.                                time  1645    For Rhode Island with this bill enacted into law, we will see $2.5  billion coming straight to Rhode Island to help fix our roads and  bridges, replace lead pipes, improve our public transportation system,  and increase broadband access. And that is not to mention the billions  of dollars in dedicated funding for Amtrak's Northeast corridor, which  will certainly benefit Rhode Islanders and all of us in New England.   Our State has the highest percentage of structurally deficient  bridges in the country. In 2019, 22.3 percent of our bridges were  structurally deficient. In 2020, our State's infrastructure was given a  C minus by the American Society of Civil Engineers.   This is unacceptable and unsafe.   The funding streams that this legislation will provide are the  following: $1.5 billion for Federal aid highway apportioned programs;  $242 million for  [[Page H6304]]  bridge replacement and repairs in Rhode Island; $272 million to improve  public transportation in Rhode Island; $23 million to support expansion  of the State's electric vehicle charging network in Rhode Island; $100  million to expand broadband connectivity, including providing access to  the 14,000 Rhode Islanders who currently lack it; and 247,000 Rhode  Islanders, 24 percent of Rhode Island, will be eligible for the  Affordable Connectivity Benefit to help working families afford  internet access; $2 million to protect against wildfires; $10.9 million  to protect against cyberattacks; $378 million to improve water  infrastructure; and $45 million for our airports.   These are significant, historic investments in rebuilding the  infrastructure of our State, and the same thing is happening in States  all across America.   I salute the President for his strong leadership. I salute my  colleagues that worked so hard on this legislation. It is going to help  ensure that America can compete again in the global economy.   And most importantly, it will improve the quality of our lives for  our constituents. It will improve our economy. It will grow good-paying  jobs. And it will make America proud of the quality of its  infrastructure once again.   I want to end by particularly acknowledging the men and women in the  building trades who are going to do this work; and do it with such  pride that they are not only going to improve our economy, but also  improve our quality of life. I salute all of the men and women in the  building trades.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the question.   I think when you look at particularly what we experienced during  COVID, we saw some of the difficulties that families--particularly  families with young children--had in accessing the internet so they  could receive school instruction. And the reality is you need internet  connections to access the world and to be able to communicate and be  able to learn in the 21st century.   And there were young people who were actually going to parking lots  of McDonald's and other places that might have internet to do their  homework. That can't happen in America.   And so we want to ensure that rebuilding our infrastructure provides  opportunities for every single young person in this country to realize  their full potential. Because we are not just competing with the kid  next door, we are competing with kids in China, Japan, and all over the  world.   We want to ensure that we have an infrastructure to support the  economic growth we need. We also want to ensure that we can deliver  goods, services, and information in the 21st century and that we are  training young people and educating young people and training workers  to compete successfully. You can't do that without infrastructure to  support that development, that knowledge, and the work that needs to be  done.   You think of the experiences we saw during COVID. It made it very  clear that we needed to move quickly. Our competitors around the world  are investing tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure. They are  competing directly with us.   This is a race for the 21st century and a race we are going to win in  large part because we are finally investing in America's  infrastructure.    Absolutely.
