 Madam Speaker, this administration's rogue attempt to  start a war with Iran endangers countless lives around the world and  was a wake-up call for Congress that we must reclaim our constitutional  role as a check on executive power to wage endless wars.   Repealing the AUMF of 2002 is an important step toward reasserting  that Congress alone has the authority to declare war. The 2002 AUMF was  passed to wage a war ultimately deemed to be based on lies, and the  United States military operations pursuant to the 2002 AUMF ended in  2011.   Iraq is a sovereign nation, and passing today's amendment is an  important measure of respect for our key ally.   The 2002 AUMF is an outdated relic whose only function is to provide  this administration with cover to claim that Congress has authorized  attacks on Iran or whichever country draws its attention. Leaving it in  place makes us less safe in our country.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Lee, my mentor, for her  leadership on repealing the 2002 AUMF and ending our forever wars so  that we can better serve our constituents at home.   Madam Speaker, I know Ms. Lee was alone at one point. She is not  alone anymore. We stand with her in pushing back against this very much  unconstitutional measure by the President of the United States.
