 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a father, an American, and  a Congressman in support of H.R. 1425, the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   I rise today as a father because healthcare is personal. I know the  pain of caring for a sick child. My daughter, Pia, was diagnosed with  Hodgkin's  [[Page H2988]]  lymphoma when she was just 14 years old.   Parents and children who have been through the fear, the  hospitalizations, the chemotherapy, and the years of anxiety-evoking  follow-ups know the nightmare all too well because they have lived it.   But Pia and our family are among the lucky ones. She survived cancer  and is now a thriving 20-year-old pursuing her college studies.   And I know how lucky I was to be at Pia's bedside during the toughest  days and to do so without worrying about how I was going to pay her  medical bills.   I know, in fact, we all know that this is not the case for too many  American families throughout our country.   We need this legislation because it will lower healthcare costs,  costs that are the very highest in the entire world, yet our outcomes  are mid-pack.   In the United States of America, we should have the highest quality  care in the world, the most efficient delivery of care in the world,  and the best value in the world. In the United States of America, the  wealthiest nation in the entire world, no one should have to choose  between seeing their doctor or seeing food on their table--no one.   I rise today as an American because healthcare is patriotic. I am  sick and tired of Americans paying more money for less quality than  other nations. And I am sick and tired of Americans paying more money  for the very same lifesaving medications than patients in other  countries.   Americans are getting ripped off, and we, every single one of us in  this Chamber, can do something about it. Ensuring that every American  has access to high-quality and affordable healthcare and medications is  indeed a moral decision, but it is also an economic decision.   Let's not kid ourselves. We do not have a healthcare system in our  country; we have a sick care system. And it is not even a system, which  has made the epic failure of our Nation's COVID response even more  glaring.    You see, we tolerate, even condone, incentives for procedures over  prevention and profit over people. It is costing us billions of dollars  and bankrupting thousands of families and, surely, costing American  lives.   We need this legislation because there is meaningful economic and  societal value in ensuring that every American enjoys healthcare  coverage no matter their age, their race, their gender, their ZIP Code,  their income, or their condition.   I rise today as a Congressman because finding common ground, building  consensus, and fixing our broken healthcare system is my job. I am on a  mission to inspire collaboration in this Chamber and restore Americans'  faith in government, and I cannot imagine a better place to begin than  healthcare.   Let's rise to this moment and improve it together.   Mr. Speaker, we need this legislation because it will help all  Americans, not red State or blue State Americans, but all Americans.   We need this legislation because no one in this country, Republican,  Democrat, independent, or otherwise, thinks that our healthcare system  is working.   We need this legislation because healthcare is collective, and this  pandemic presents an extraordinary opportunity to build a true health  system in this country. COVID-19 has taught us that one's health and  well-being are directly dependent on the health and well-being of one's  entire community.   We are in this together, and we must take care of one another  together.   We need this legislation because whether it is my daughter, Pia, a  cancer survivor, or Cindy with diabetes in Eden Prairie or Nikki with  MS in Brooklyn Park or every single mother in our country who has ever  given birth to a child, preexisting conditions are part of being human  and should never be a barrier to care.   We need to pass this legislation because it is personal, it is  patriotic, and it is our job.   I am grateful to my colleagues in this House for doing so yesterday,  and I call on our colleagues in the Senate to join us in ensuring a  healthier and more equitable future for every single American.                            ____________________
