 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 508 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 508         Resolved, That during further consideration of the bill       (H.R. 3684) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways,       highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other       purposes, pursuant to section 6 of House Resolution 504--         (a) after debate, each further amendment printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution       not earlier considered as part of amendments en bloc pursuant       to subsection (b) shall be considered only in the order       printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may       be withdrawn by the proponent at any time before the question       is put thereon, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question; and        (b) it shall be in order at any time after debate for the       chair of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure       or his designee to offer amendments en bloc consisting of       further amendments printed in the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution not earlier disposed of,       and such amendments en bloc shall be considered as read,       shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure or their       respective designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and       shall not be subject to a demand for division of the       question.        Sec. 2.  All points of order against the further amendments       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules or amendments       en bloc described in subsection (b) of the first section of       this resolution are waived.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order without intervention of any       point of order to consider concurrent resolutions providing       for adjournment during the month of July.        Sec. 4.

Sec. 5.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 403, agreed to May       18, 2021), is amended by striking ``July 1, 2021'' each place       it appears and inserting (in each instance) ``July 30,       2021''.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Committee on Rules met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 508, to provide for further  consideration of H.R. 3684, the INVEST in America Act under a  structured rule.   The rule makes in order 149 amendments and provides en bloc authority  to the chair of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.   The rule also allows for consideration of concurrent resolutions  providing for adjournment during the month of July, and provides that  the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act shall not  apply for the remainder of the 117th Congress to a joint resolution  terminating the national emergency declared by the President on March  13, 2020.   Lastly, the rule provides for recess instructions, suspension  authority, and same-day authority through July 30, 2021.   Madam Speaker, our roads and bridges are crumbling before our eyes,  and our public transportation systems are suffering drastically from  reduced ridership during the pandemic. With these challenges comes a  great opportunity. Our country can use this unique once-in-a-generation  opportunity to reimagine and rebuild our community in America's  transportation systems and build back better.   As a former member of the California Air Resources Board and a former  chair of both the State Assembly Transportation Committee and the State  Senate Transportation Committee and a former member of the Bay Area's  MPO, I have spent my career focused on the transportation sector and  reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants to help fight  against climate change.                                time  1245    In my 30 years of public service, never has the time been more ripe  to seize this opportunity to reimagine and reinvest in America's  transportation infrastructure.   The INVEST in America Act offers a new approach to Federal  transportation policy by emphasizing fixing our existing roads and  bridges first and making record investments in passenger rail, public  transit, cycling and walking infrastructure, and zero-emission options  while creating safer, more connected communities for all Americans.  This bill would also help create millions of jobs that cannot be  exported.   Thanks to strong Buy American provisions and labor protections,  including Davis-Bacon, the work will be fueled by American workers,  manufacturing, and ingenuity, with targeted investments in rural and  underserved communities.   Madam Speaker, our country badly needs the investments outlined in  this bill. Over 40 percent of America's roads are in poor or mediocre  condition, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. In  fact, our roads have a D rating, and American motorists are forced to  pay over $1,000 every year in wasted time and fuel as a result of our  failure to act.   In my own State, California's infrastructure does not fare any  better. We have a C-minus rating overall, with a D rating for roads and  a C-minus for bridges and transit, in spite of California voters voting  over and over again to tax themselves to invest in our infrastructure.   Not only is the problem of crumbling infrastructure a detriment to  our economy, but it is dangerous to public safety. Over 36,000  Americans die on our Nation's roadways every year. The INVEST in  America Act directs $343 billion to roads, bridges, and safety  programs, with record levels of investment in walking and cycling  infrastructure, complete streets planning and smarter road design, and  safe routes to schools.   This transformative bill also directs Federal investments in transit  and rail and reimagines our national transportation policies. Public  transit is essential to everyday living in communities across the  country, providing access to jobs, schools, healthcare, and childcare.   Currently, there is a $176 billion transit backlog, and transit  ridership, of course, is declining because of COVID-19. These issues,  if not addressed, stand to further increase congestion, hamper the  economy, worsen air quality, and disproportionately affect underserved  communities.   The INVEST in America Act provides $109 billion for transit to create  a safe and reliable transit system that ensures every American,  including those  [[Page H3317]]  in economically disadvantaged and underserved neighborhoods, can get to  essential services, as I have said, like jobs, healthcare, and  childcare.   Importantly, this effort takes every opportunity to meet the  challenges of the climate crisis. Climate change is the defining  challenge of our time, and transportation is the number one source of  greenhouse gas emissions. The INVEST in America Act takes bold steps to  build the clean infrastructure and transportation sector of the future  by reforming existing programs and launching new initiatives to reduce  carbon pollution.   For example, it invests $8.3 billion in highway, transit, and rail  projects that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it holds States  accountable for their performance by measuring annual progress.   Moreover, under the Clean Corridors program, a program that I was  proud to author, it invests $4 billion in electric vehicle charging and  alternative fueling stations. This infrastructure along designated  corridors will help reduce range anxiety and help America shift to the  next generation of clean vehicles.   To further address climate change and equity, this bill increases  funding and incentives for transit-oriented development, ensuring that  more Americans have access to walkable and transit-supportive  communities, thereby reducing vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas  emissions and, most importantly, improving their quality of life and  their ability to be at home with their family.   Finally, this bill invests in safe drinking water infrastructure by  replacing dangerous lead piping and treating PFAS in our water supply.  It will also help ensure that all families can afford a safe and  reliable water supply.   Madam Speaker, we cannot allow this opportunity to slip through our  fingers. Now is the time for transformative investments in our  transportation systems and our infrastructure to improve our roads,  bridges, railways, and transit systems to support American workers, to  address equity and environmental justice, and to fight boldly against  the climate crisis.   That is why I proudly support the INVEST in America Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I look forward to continuing this  dialogue respectfully.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle), a very distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania on his  kind observation about my own personal health.   Just in regards to this debate, as somebody who went into the ICU on  the first date in the State of California that the Governor of  California actually required shelter in place, and I was then put on a  ventilator for 4 weeks at the same time that the country was dealing  with this pandemic, maybe I have a little unique perspective.   So evidence-based research maybe is in the mind of the beholder. I  trust my doctors. I know they are human, and I know evidence-based  research is the reason I stand here in front of you, Madam Speaker, by  following the doctors.   I think of what the Speaker is doing and what the President is doing,  and that is following evidence-based research and statistically  protecting Americans. We know if Americans get vaccinated, we know if  we are sensitive to distances around us and masking, we still have  challenges. And for somebody like myself, who has an underlying health  condition, I am particularly sensitive to this. Not everybody is in the  same position vis-a-vis their medical risks.   So with all due respect, the debate is always a good one, but from my  perspective I wish that people would keep in mind that this pandemic is  not done until the evidence-based research indicates that it is done. I  know everybody wants to get back to normal. I know I do too, as well,  but I would like to be able to enjoy this wonderful existence that we  all are allowed to do as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just briefly on the points that were just brought up. As somebody who  represents a county that has four refineries in it, those four  refineries produce much of the refined CARB-certified fuel on the West  Coast and in California. Also, a county that is headquarters to the  second largest energy company in the United States, Chevron, this isn't  about ending the fossil fuel industry.   It is about the transition from that energy source to a new, cleaner,  renewable, alternative fuel energy source. It is about being  independent and being mindful about what our global competitors are  doing; what the Chinese are doing to get ahead of us in this energy  source.   So with all due respect, as someone who knows the benefit and also  the dangers and the opportunities to the fossil fuel industry, as we  have experienced it in this country, those four refineries only employ  people, as required by State statute, who have graduated from State- approved apprenticeship programs, the best apprenticeship programs in  the world. Each one of those jobs have a multiplier of 14. We like  those jobs. We want to keep those jobs.   But we want to meet the reductions we have to have to be leaders in  this country on climate reductions, and prepare for a future that isn't  dependent on the fossil fuel industry; both for our public health, and  our environment, and for our economy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   A couple of points. I appreciate the attention to the Clean Corridors  Program. Again, this is about preparing for the future, from my  perspective. This bill prepares for the future, and it prepares  American workers to transition to that future and future generations.   On the Clean Corridors Program, Chinese are already doing this. In  December, they produced 100,000 new charging and alternative fuel  stations to prepare for the future. The Chinese have over a million of  these stations. The U.S. has less than 50,000.    So if we want to talk about energy independence, right on. That is  what we want to talk about. We want to prepare America for the future,  while we protect the planet.   The State of California gets more venture capital for research and  renewables and alternative fuels than the other 49 States combined.   Why is that?   Because we are preparing for the future. We want to be competitive,  and we want our workforce to continue to be the best in the world when  it comes to energy. And we want to compete against the Chinese so that  we are ready to capture these new energy sources. And we are doing it.   It is not only good for the environment, it is good for the economy.   And I would say, as a Californian who has been in the middle of  this--and I will agree to being a liberal. I was once described as a  liberal Republican under former party affiliations. I don't think there  is any such thing anymore, probably.   This is about preparing for the future. And mostly it is about  preparing our American workforce to continue to be what they have been  for so long, the best workforce, the best workers in the world. But you  give them the tools to do that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Sires), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Takano).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania. I do  appreciate his comments about my personal health and also his  collegiality.   His comments about being bipartisan, I completely agree with. But  compromise requires, from my perspective--and granted, we do have a  different perspective about how we get there and who is giving and how  much is given.   I really think this bill is an incredibly important bill for the  future of America and American workers and innovation.   As far as changing to renewables and alternatives, that electrical  system has to be upgraded. We have seen what has happened because of  climate change in the Gulf. We see the struggles we have on the West  Coast with fires, all because, as evidence-based research tells us,  what we have done with the environment and the benefits we have gotten  from fossil fuels over the course of the last decades and century.   But now is the time to change and prepare for that change--not  mindlessly. This isn't a radical proposal. This is about preparing for  the future.   In terms of the infrastructure that gets those new alternative fuels,  hydrogen fuel cell cars, battery electric cars, in California, we have  acknowledged that we need to get these cars to be available to  everyone, including people from disadvantaged communities. That is why  we have changed the tax code to make it easier for everyone to get an  alternative fuel car, not just wealthy people, and get the benefits of  that.   I want to read a quote from Forbes magazine about infrastructure and  electric cars: ``These vehicles use a different kind of fuel and plug  into our electricity system, and the good news about that is there are  a number of cost-benefit studies,'' numerous ones, ``that are showing  this can be really beneficial to all ratepayers, not just the drivers  of the vehicles.''    The critical mass of changing helps everybody. It brings down the  cost of energy. So, for those rising costs at the pump, there is a bend  in the arc that will come sooner rather than later that will help  everyone, as opposed to the opinions by my colleague and some of his  other speakers today.   Matt Stanberry, the managing director for the advanced transportation  program at the trade group Advanced Energy Economy, says: ``As you  increase electricity sales for charging the vehicles, it has the effect  of driving down rates for all ratepayers because it spreads the fixed  cost of the system out across a larger volume of sales.''   Madam Speaker, this is about preparing for this new energy future.  Whoever gets there first, as a country, as always in our history, has a  predominant role in foreign affairs and the leadership on this globe.  The Chinese are trying to beat us to that. We can't let that happen. We  talk about global competitiveness. We need to get the infrastructure  in. Yes, they need to do a better job at reducing pollution,  traditional pollutants and carbon.   The Clean Air Act, originally signed by Richard Nixon, and then  changed and amended by Ronald Reagan, two Republicans, and the waiver  that, unfortunately, previous administrations gave to California  through multiple generations, have fueled, pardon the expression, the  benefits we have gotten in public health and traditional pollutants. It  is fueling today the States that join California, like Colorado, which  are pushing this innovation.   Madam Speaker, this is about the future of America and America's  excellence and its energy independence and its workforce, staying at  home and providing for this energy independence for future generations.   Madam Speaker, in a moment, I will offer an amendment to the rule to  make in order the amendment offered by Ms. Slotkin, which amends the  underlying bill to prohibit using transit funds for artwork and  nonfunctional landscaping.                     Amendment Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier     Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the amendment and the resolution.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
