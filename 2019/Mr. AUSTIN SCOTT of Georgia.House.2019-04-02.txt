 Mr. Speaker, on October 10, 2018, a  Category 3 storm, Hurricane Michael, entered my State of Georgia with a  devastating force.   It was harvest time for the 2018 crop, and it was the best yield,  especially for cotton, that we had seen in years. Farmers who had been  suffering in the midst of low commodity prices, unfair trade prices,  labor shortages, and consecutive years of storms now had relief in  sight. Then entered Hurricane Michael, and it was all gone in a matter  of hours. Not just the commodity crops like cotton, but the orchards,  too.   Since day one post-Hurricane Michael, I have worked side by side with  my friend and my colleague, Congressman Sanford Bishop. Hurricane  Michael didn't discriminate between our district lines. I want to thank  him for his help and his support of our State and our agricultural  producers in Georgia.   Soon after the storm, the President, Vice President Pence, and  Secretary Perdue met with the two of us, our farmers, and our community  leaders and promised to help them rebuild. Members of both parties, in  both Chambers of Congress, echoed the same support. Six months later,  and those promises of support have been broken. Never before have we  seen communities that were wrecked with catastrophes neglected like  this.   Those votes in the Senate yesterday showed a lack of honor and  dignity and how truly ugly and partisan politics have become. The truth  is, if Hurricane Michael had hit Americans who weren't farmers or  farmers who aren't Americans, the stories of yesterday's cowardice  would be the front page of every paper.   Whether the press likes it or not and whether the Senators from New  York or Vermont like it or not, we are Americans, too. And what  happened yesterday was cowardly, partisan politics and truly un- American.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my  colleague from Oregon for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this debate as it has gone on, and  the bottom line is, if you listen to the Democrats, you would think  that they had stuck it to the insurance industry with all of the rules  and all of the laws that they passed.   As we talk about values, I thought I would give you a few values.   Aetna in 2010 was trading at $27.39 a share. In 2018, it was $187 a  share.   You know who you stuck it to? You stuck it to the American citizens.  You took the money out of our pockets and you put it into the hands of  the insurance industry.   If you don't want to talk about Aetna, let's talk about United  Healthcare: $29 a share in 2010; in 2018, $246.54 a share. How did that  happen?   If the American citizens were getting a square deal before the  legislation that you passed, that you could only pass if the insurance  industry didn't object, how did United's stock go from $29 a share to  $246 a share?   If that's not enough, how about Humana: $29 a share in 2010 to $246 a  share in 2018. How did this happen?   This happened because you left the insurance industry exempt from the  antitrust laws of the country.   Now, how did that work out for the American citizen? We got a mandate  by the Democratic Party to purchase a product from an industry that is  exempt from the antitrust laws of the country.   Now, there are flaws in the legislation that you passed. I am amazed  at your refusal to accept that.   You can't even buy an Affordable Care Act contract today. Do you  realize the next time you can buy it is January 1 of next year?   If you are uninsured right now--you all have been telling the  American public, if you are uninsured and you go to the doctor and the  doctor says you have got cancer, you can get a contract the next day.  It is just not true. You can't get it until January 1 of 2020.   It is a poorly worded piece of legislation. Regardless of the intent,  it is a poorly worded piece of legislation that moved money from the  individual citizens of this country to the pockets of the insurance  industry, and it needs to be rewritten.
