 Madam Speaker, I rise today to make clear that the motions  to recommit that will be offered by our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle are procedural. They are not motions that are sending back  the legislation with instructions. It is a procedural move. I want to  be clear and read literally what the motion to recommit says.   Motion to recommit H.R. 8, offered by Mr. Jordan of Ohio, moves to  recommit the bill, H.R. 8, to the Committee on the Judiciary. That is  it.   Motion to recommit H.R. 1446, offered by Mr. Hudson of North  Carolina, moves to recommit H.R. 1446 to the Committee on the  Judiciary.   These are fake attempts to recommit these bills and to stop them from  moving forward. They are sensible pieces of legislation that will save  lives.                            ____________________
