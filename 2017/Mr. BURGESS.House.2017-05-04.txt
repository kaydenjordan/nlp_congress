 Mr. Speaker, how did we get to this point?  [[Page H4118]]    The Affordable Care Act is simply not working for the American  people. It is limiting choices. It is raising costs. It is leaving  millions without access to care. And unfortunately, these are not just  talking points but very real issues affecting very real Americans.   The Affordable Care Act has left the individual market in shambles  and has driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing  one-third of all counties in the United States of America with only a  single insurer. And among the plans that have chosen to remain in these  markets, there have been widespread, double-digit premium increases. In  Texas, premiums have jumped 29 percent a year, on average, from 2014 to  2017.   The markets are in difficulty. They are failing to live up to the  promise made 7 years ago, that Americans would be able to receive  ``affordable care.''   As we knew then, and we still know now, this was an empty promise and  has priced over 19 million Americans out of the market. What is worse,  these individuals are forced to pay the individual mandate penalty or  seek a hardship exemption because of the cost to purchase and use their  health insurance.   Mr. Speaker, 11 months ago, Speaker Ryan released the Better Way plan  to save the Nation's healthcare system and to bring relief to the  American people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the  American Health Care Act, laid out policies to stabilize the markets  damaged by the Affordable Care Act, repeal the burdensome Affordable  Care Act taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited  access to care. So let's take a look at what the American Health Care  Act does.   First and foremost, the American Health Care Act provides immediate  relief to the State insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that  one-size-fits-all works for no one, and certainly did not work for the  individual markets. The States should have the flexibility to support  their insurance markets and ensure that plans can continue to provide  options for coverage.   To do this, we relax two of the more egregious market regulations  that were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that  premiums cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3- to-1 ratio and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans.   The mandate limiting a plan's ability to set premiums by age has  driven up the cost of coverage for younger and healthier Americans and,  subsequently, pushed them away from seeking coverage by the millions.  Of the over 19 million Americans who have sidestepped the individual  market, it is estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals  are under the age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking  coverage, the markets have plunged, as insurers have hiked up premiums  year after year to compensate for unhealthy risk pools.    To change this, there is relaxation of the 5-to-1 ratio. It will  lower premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize  markets. We also give States the option, the choice to go higher or go  lower, which honors the spirit of federalism.   Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to  provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage  options. The requirement for insurers to offer specified Bronze,  Silver, and Gold level tiers has limited consumer choice, driving even  more individuals away from seeking coverage and further contributing to  the collapse of the healthcare markets.   To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient  and State Stability Fund. This fund provides States access to a total  of over $140 billion over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to  lower costs and increase access to health care for their unique patient  populations.   Mr. Speaker, the goal is simple, to provide States with maximum  flexibility in how they address the cost of care for their citizens.  The American Health Care Act provides States with options for how to  use funds, including providing financial assistance for high-cost  individuals, incentivizing insurer participation in those markets,  reducing the cost of insurance, promoting access to preventive  services, and reducing out-of-pocket costs for patients.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the  Stability Fund and other proconsumer changes would reduce premiums by  10 percent below current projections of 2026.   We want patients to have access to high-quality, affordably priced  health coverage. The Patient and State Stability Fund can help States  lower costs and can increase access to high quality health care for  their citizens.   In addition to supporting the insurance markets, the American Health  Care Act creates needed reforms to the Medicaid program itself. Without  any changes, the current Medicaid expansion is expected to cost $1  trillion in 10 years' time--$1 trillion a year in 10 years' time.  Medicaid needs reform so that States can continue to provide coverage  to children, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, the  very populations that this safety net program was created to serve.   To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases  out the Medicaid expansion, not traditional Medicaid but Medicaid  expansion. The expansion has hurt State budgets and limited States'  abilities to ensure that resources will continue to be available for  the vulnerable populations for which Medicaid was designed. By phasing  out expansion, we are providing States with greater budget autonomy.   Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by  shifting the program toward a per beneficiary allotment. Per  beneficiary allotments set limits on the annual growth for per capita  expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the  Federal Government. Per beneficiary allotments create greater fiscal  accountability and ensure that the program can continue to exist for  years to come.   This is not a new idea. This was an idea put forward by President  Bill Clinton and, at one time, supported by every Democratic Member of  the Senate in 1995.   Second, the American Health Care Act increases the amount of  flexibility that States have in managing their Medicaid program. The  bill scales back the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a  State's ability to tailor plans toward the needs of beneficiaries.  States can and States should be trusted to effectively manage the needs  of their Medicaid beneficiaries. The American Health Care Act will  allow them to do so.   Additionally, the American Health Care Act furthers the goal of  providing the States with greater flexibility in managing their  Medicaid programs by providing States with the option to implement two  additional opportunities: work requirements and block grants for  Medicaid.   When the Affordable Care Act was being debated, some of the most  consistent complaints that we heard throughout the discussion came from  Governors and State representatives expressing concerns about the  negative consequences that they saw on the horizon.   This time around, we chose to engage our State counterparts in the  discussion and listen to their input as we designed the bill; and at  the top of their list was a desire to see the work requirements built  into the Medicaid and the expansion populations, and the opportunity to  work with Medicaid as a block grant.    Republicans trust that States know what works for their respective  populations, and we are not going to stand in the way of States seeking  to design Medicaid programs that work for them.   Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources  to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases to  the Community Health Center Fund, offers enhanced funding to support  the safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and  ends the cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, cuts that  are going to occur under current law on October 1 of this year.   We are committed to ensuring that our local providers can continue to  deliver lifesaving care and that the American Health Care Act turns  this commitment into action. For the millions of Americans in rural and  medically underserved areas, these actions  [[Page H4119]]  will provide needed relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care Act  and will allow these Americans to continue to have access to care.   Moving forward, together, these efforts will provide meaningful  reform and relief for the States and for the individuals seeking health  care. We are stabilizing the markets, reforming Medicaid in the most  substantive and consequential way in its 52-year history, and ensuring  that all Americans can maintain access to care through local safety net  providers.   We do recognize there is still more work to be done in health care,  and that is why we only consider the American Health Care Act to be the  beginning. It is the key that gets us through the door into additional  health reform. From here, we will work with Secretary Price at the  Department of Health and Human Services to further deregulate the  marketplace and increase consumer choice in the healthcare markets, and  we will enhance the American Health Care Act with additional  legislative efforts to further the goal of lowering healthcare costs.   Mr. Speaker, this should be a very exciting time in health care. With  all of the knowledge that has been gained over the years in the  practice of medicine, I am humbled to be here today speaking in support  of this legislation.   It will begin the much-awaited process of unwinding the Affordable  Care Act and will finally return patients to the center of health care.                                time  0945    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, wow. I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and to rebut the gentleman from Texas, let me include in the  Record a letter from the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes  Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung  Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes  Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, and the National  Coalition for Women with Heart Disease.   Leading Patient Advocacy Groups Remain Opposed to the American Health                                  Care Act       Eight Organizations Issue Statement Criticizing Upton Agreement         Washington, May 3, 2017.--Earlier today, House Energy and       Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR) issued a press       release stating that an amendment proposed by Representative       Fred Upton (R-MI) to the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       provides ``protection and certainty for patients with pre-      existing conditions.'' Eight leading patient groups, listed       below, issued the following statement in response:        Despite the Upton amendment, we remain strongly opposed to       the American Health Care Act and urge Congress to consider       the people at the heart of this decision. The various       patchwork solutions offered by lawmakers would still leave       the millions of patients we represent, who have serious and       chronic health conditions, at risk of not being able to       access life-saving treatments and care.        There is no substitute for fundamental, unequivocal       protections for people with pre-existing conditions.        The AHCA, including the potential amendment, would       undermine vital safeguards against being charged more for       insurance based on health status. Increasing funding for risk       sharing programs and consumer financial assistance does not       address the legitimate challenges built into these proposals.        The other equally important problems with the AHCA remain,       including:        Allowing states to waive the guarantee of essential health       benefits, which would:        Segment the market into plans for sick people and plans for       healthy people, driving up the cost of plans for people with       serious health care needs        Undermine the protection against annual and lifetime       coverage caps, a critical safeguard for patients        Eliminating Medicaid expansion coverage for millions of       Americans and altering the program's financing structure in a       way that jeopardizes coverage of new and innovative       treatments        Increasing out-of-pocket costs for many Americans,       including some of the sickest and elderly among us        Given the numerous shortcomings of the American Health Care       Act in serving the patients we represent, our organizations       have no choice but to oppose this legislation and urge all       Representatives to vote against it, with or without the Upton       and MacArthur amendments.

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement  from the American Medical Association in opposition to this bill.            [From the American Medical Association, May 3, 2017]  AMA Warns that Proposed Changes to the American Health Care Act Do Not                         Remedy Bill's Shortcomings     Despite amendments to bill, millions of Americans would still lose                         health insurance coverage         Chicago.--American Medical Association (AMA) President       Andrew W. Gurman, M.D., issued the following statement today       about proposed changes to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA):        ``None of the legislative tweaks under consideration       changes the serious harm to patients and the health care       delivery system if AHCA passes. Proposed changes to the bill       tinker at the edges without remedying the fundamental failing       of the bill--that millions of Americans will lose their       health insurance as a direct result of this proposal.        ``High-risk pools are not a new idea. Prior to the       enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 35 states operated       high-risk pools, and they were not a panacea for Americans       with pre-existing medical conditions. The history of high-      risk pools demonstrates that Americans with pre-existing       conditions will be stuck in second-class health care       coverage--if they are able to obtain coverage at all.        ``Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance       coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in       many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with       underlying medical conditions vastly more for their       coverage.''        ``America should not go backward to the time when our       fellow citizens with pre-existing health conditions faced       high costs for limited coverage, if they were able to obtain       coverage at all. The AMA urges congressional leaders and the       Administration to pursue a bipartisan dialogue on alternative       policies that provide patients with access and coverage to       high quality care and preserve the safety net for vulnerable       populations.''                        Background on high-risk pools         A January report from the American Academy of Actuaries       notes that ``enrollment has generally been low, coverage has       been limited and expensive, they require external funding,       and they have typically operated at a loss . . . Removing       high-risk individuals from the insured risk pools reduces       costs in the private market only temporarily. Over time, even       lower-cost individuals in the individual market can incur       high health care costs, which would put upward pressure on       premiums.''        According to the Kaiser Family Foundation:        State high-risk pools featured premiums above standard non-      group market rates--with most states capping them at 150%-      200% of standard rates. Many also featured high deductibles,       some $5,000 or more.        Despite the fact that many individuals were forced into       high-risk pools because of a pre-existing condition, nearly       all states excluded coverage for these conditions for 6-12       months.        Almost all high-risk pools imposed lifetime limits on       covered services, and some imposed annual limits.        Some states capped or closed enrollment.        Combined net losses for the state high-risk pools totaled       more than $1.2 billion for 2011, or $5,510 per enrollee, on       average.        Furthermore, a 2010 paper by James Capretta and Tom Miller       that appeared in National Affairs estimated that the cost of       adequately funded high risk pools would be $15 billion to $20       billion per year.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from  the American Academy of Family Physicians in opposition to this bill.                                                 American Academy of                                               Family Physicians,                                                        May 3, 2017.      Jim McGovern,      Representative, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Jim McGovern: Despite recent activities and       amendments, the American Health Care Act (H.R. 1628) remains       a highly flawed proposal that will destabilize our health       care system, cause significant loss of coverage, and allow       for the discrimination against patients based on their       gender, age, and health status. For these reasons, the       American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) continues to       oppose the AHCA and  [[Page H4120]]       encourages the House of Representatives to reject this failed       policy.        The fact remains that the AHCA will:        Cause more than 24 million people to lose their health care       coverage, including more than 7 million with employer-      sponsored coverage.        Destabilize the individual health insurance market.        Create a race to the bottom by eliminating any standards       with respect to minimum insurance benefits.        Enact draconian cuts in the Medicaid program that will have       an immediate negative impact on low-income individuals,       children, and millions of senior citizens who rely on the       program.        Eliminate community rating and return to medical       underwriting, thus allowing insurers to discriminate against       individuals based on their gender, age, and health status.        Deny individuals protection against annual and lifetime       spending caps, thus threatening the financial stability of       millions of individuals and families in the future.        Over the past few days there has been an effort to advance       policies that seek to protect individuals with pre-existing       conditions from facing discrimination in insurance       underwriting as a result of their health status. Despite a       willingness to spend more money on these proposals, the       current efforts on pre-existing conditions fail to accomplish       their goal. High-risk pools are inherently flawed and       expensive. The proposals under consideration provide       inadequate funding for an inadequate period of time, thus       creating an under-funded and temporary solution for the       millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. We find       it regrettable that Congress would seek to relegate       individuals with high health care needs to a program that has       a questionable history and would face uncertain financial       stability in the future.        By removing critical consumer protections that collectively       ensure that the millions of individuals with pre-existing       conditions can continue to purchase affordable health care       coverage, the AHCA would result in higher premiums and higher       deductibles for millions. Additionally, the negative impact       of the AHCA is not limited to the individual insurance       market. These policies also may impact the more than 130       million people with employer-sponsored insurance.        Thank you.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement  from the AARP in strong opposition to this bill.                                                           AARP,                                                        May 3, 2017.        Dear Representative: Older Americans care deeply about       access to and affordability of health care. With the addition       of the Upton Amendment, as reported, we once again write to       share our opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       and urge you to vote NO. Changes under consideration that       would allow states to waive important consumer protections--      allowing insurance companies to once again charge Americans       with pre-existing conditions more because they've had cancer,       diabetes or heart disease--would make a bad bill even worse.       This would be devastating for the 25 million Americans 50-64       who have a deniable pre-existing condition. The Upton       amendment would do little to reduce the massive premium       increases for those with pre-existing conditions.        Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been       expressing serious concerns about the impact that this       legislation will have on older Americans. The Congressional       Budget Office (CBO)'s last estimate further demonstrates the       harmful impact of this bill on older Americans and some of       our most vulnerable. Specifically, the American Health Care       Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of Medicare;       dramatically increase premium and out-of-pocket costs for 50-      64 year olds purchasing coverage on the individual insurance       market; allow insurance companies to once again discriminate       against those with pre-existing conditions; substantially       increase the number of Americans without insurance; and put       at risk millions of children and adults with disabilities and       poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access       long-term services and supports and other benefits.        Our members and others 50 years of age and older care       deeply about health care and want to know where their elected       leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming       vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform       our members, and others over age 50, how their elected       officials voted. We'll communicate the results of the vote in       our widely-circulated publications, in e-mail alerts, in our       online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all       Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in       its current form.                                   Medicare         The American Health Care Act repeals provisions in current       law that have strengthened Medicare's fiscal outlook,       specifically, the repeal of the additional 0.9 percent       payroll tax on higher-income workers. Repealing this       provision would remove billions from the Hospital Insurance       trust fund, hasten the insolvency of Medicare, and diminish       Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.                     Individual Private Insurance Market         Currently, about 25 million Americans age 50-64 have a pre-      existing condition, about 6.1 million purchase insurance in       the non-group market, and nearly 3.2 million are currently       eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage       through either the federal health benefits exchange or a       state-based exchange (exchange). Since passage of the ACA,       the number of 50-64 year old Americans who are uninsured has       dropped by half. We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would       be a significant step backwards and result in millions of       older Americans who cannot afford their health care,       including many simply losing their health care. Based on CBO       estimates, approximately 14 million Americans will lose       coverage next year, while a total of 24 million Americans       would lose coverage over the next 10 years.        Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical       to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access       health care. A typical 50-64 year old seeking coverage       through an exchange has a median annual income of under       $25,000 and already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for       health care. We have serious concerns--reinforced by the CBO       estimate--that the bill under consideration will dramatically       increase health care costs for 50-64 year olds who purchase       health care through an exchange due both to the changes in       age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires       uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than       younger individuals) to 5:1 (or more) and reductions in       current tax credits for older Americans. CBO concluded that       the bill will substantially raise premiums for older people       and force many into lower quality plans.        Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable       age tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change       showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by       up to $3,200 for a 64 year old. In addition, the bill reduced       the tax credits available for older Americans to help       purchase insurance. We estimate that the bill's changes to       current law's tax credits alone could increase premium costs       by more than $5,800 for a 64-year old earning $15,000.       Overall, both the bill's tax credit changes and 5:1 age       rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older       Americans. In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old       earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by       $12,900--758 percent--from $1,700 to $14,600 a year.        Current law prohibits insurance companies from       discriminating against individuals due to a pre-existing       condition. The bill would repeal pre-existing condition       protections and would once again allow insurance companies to       charge Americans more--we estimate up to $25,000 more--due to       a pre-existing condition. As a result, the 40 percent of 50-       to 64-year-olds (about 25 million people) who have a deniable       pre-existing condition risk losing access to affordable       coverage. The Upton Amendment, which would add funds to       address the impact of premium increases for those with       pre-existing conditions, would do little to mitigate the       massive premium increase for some of the most vulnerable       Americans. AARP strongly opposes any weakening of the       law's pre-existing condition protections which benefit       millions of Americans.                 Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports         AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act       that create a per capita cap financing structure in the       Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions       could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of       individuals who depend on the essential services provided       through Medicaid. CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid       funding by $880 billion over 2017-2026, about 25 percent less       than what it projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital       safety net and intergenerational lifeline for millions of       individuals, including over 17.4 million low-income seniors       and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the       program for critical health care and long-term services and       supports (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such       as eating, bathing, dressing, managing medications, and       transportation). Older adults and people with disabilities       now account for over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and       cuts of this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and       services for this vulnerable population.        Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65       and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly       Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults       living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor       or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and       Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost       33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a       relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a       disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid       spending.        Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults       rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and       community-based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home       modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as       hearing aids and eyeglasses.        In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,       this approach to financing would likely result in       overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and       families unable to shoulder the costs of care without       sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to       program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming       some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens.  [[Page H4121]]         The bill also repeals the six percent enhanced federal       Medicaid match for states that take up the Community First       Choice (CFC) Option. CFC provides states with a financial       incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and people with       disabilities live in their homes and communities where they       want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want to remain       in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.       HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in Medicaid, the       cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost of       institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could       disrupt services for older adults and people with       disabilities in the states that are already providing       services under CFC and would result in a loss of about $12       billion for HCBS over ten years.                              Prescription Drugs         The AHCA would repeal the fee on manufacturers and       importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is       projected to add $24.8 billion to the Medicare Part B trust       fund between 2017 and 2026. Rather than repeal this fee for       Medicare, AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce the       burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and       taxpayers, and we urge action on bipartisan solutions.        AARP remains willing to work with you to ensure that we       maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust       insurance market protections, controls costs, improves       quality, and provides affordable coverage to all Americans.       However, the AHCA does not accomplish these goals, and we       continue to urge you to vote NO.            Sincerely,                                                  Nancy A. LeaMond,                                 Executive Vice President and Chief                                   Advocacy and Engagement Officer.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if this bill were so great, these  organizations would be supporting the Republican bill, not opposing it;  and they are strongly opposing it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 308, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2192) to amend the Public Health Service Act to  eliminate the non-application of certain State waiver provisions to  Members of Congress and congressional staff, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. (Mr. Simpson). Pursuant to House Resolution  308, the bill is considered read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2192         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF NON-APPLICATION OF CERTAIN STATE                     WAIVER PROVISIONS TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND                     CONGRESSIONAL STAFF.         If the American Health Care Act is enacted, effective as if       included in the enactment of such Act, section       2701(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       300gg(b)(5)(A)(ii)), as added by subsection (a) of section       136 of the American Health Care Act (relating to permitting       States to waive certain ACA requirements to encourage fair       health insurance premiums), is amended by striking       ``1312(d)(3)(D),''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 308, the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) and the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2192.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2192.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, after 7 years, we have heard the stories from our  constituents, from our patients, from our friends, from our families  who have suffered under the Affordable Care Act. Today, we will have a  chance to vote on a plan that will rescue and revitalize the market and  lower costs and increase flexibility for patients to choose and keep a  health insurance plan that works for them and their family. However,  before we can do that, we have to pass a bill that will ensure that  Members of Congress and their staffs are treated the same way as the  rest of America.   So let's be clear. We firmly believe that Members of Congress should  live by the same rules as everyone else, period. The bill we are  considering now will make a simple technical correction to ensure that  the American Health Care Act and its amendments apply equally to  everyone when signed into law.   Over the last several months, we have worked thoughtfully and  thoroughly with our colleagues in the Senate to achieve our shared goal  of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Throughout these discussions, we  have come to better appreciate and better understand the other  Chamber's reconciliation limitations. As a result, we have drafted the  American Health Care Act with constant awareness of what the slightest  misstep may mean for the legislation's privileged status or that 51- vote threshold in the other body.   Some might say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a  needle than to draft House policy to Senate procedure, but we are  confident that we have achieved that challenging feat.   One of the limitations we have come to respect is that no committee  other than the Senate Committee on Finance or the Senate Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions can receive a jurisdictional  referral. For example, if we were to cross-reference multi-State plans  established by the Affordable Care Act, we would get a referral to the  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee because  those plans are under the Office of Personnel Management.                                time  1115    So let's be clear, congressional healthcare operates as a small group  plan within the District of Columbia's SHOP Exchange. This was a  decision that was made by the Obama administration.   So for waivers impacting the essential health benefits of age rating,  which impacts both the individual and small group markets, Members of  Congress and our staffs would be treated the same. As far as community  rating, this impacts only the individual market, so no group plans,  including Members of Congress or our staffs, would be impacted.   Even so, in an attempt to be crystal clear, today we are passing a  bill, out of fairness and transparency, to ensure that Congress  operates under the same laws as private citizens, a principle that both  Republicans and Democrats should support.   My thanks to Representative McSally for her leadership on this issue.  Her bill helps deliver us a step closer to fulfilling our promise.  Today we will fulfill our promise to provide relief from the higher  costs and the dwindling choices for patients under the Affordable Care  Act. Today we will repeal and replace ObamaCare with a better solution.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. McSally), the author of the bill.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  2192, a measure that eliminates double standards by preventing Members  of Congress from being exempt from the State waiver provisions of the  American Health Care Act, as amended.   Due to very arcane Senate procedural rules within the budget  reconciliation process, the MacArthur amendment to the American Health  Care Act does not and cannot apply to Members of Congress. To address  this, I have introduced this simple, standalone, two-page bill that  would appeal the exemption for Members of Congress should the American  Health Care Act become law.   In the military, the same code of conduct and standards apply to the  entire chain of command. Now, in my role as a lawmaker, I believe that  any law we pass that applies to our constituents must also apply  equally to Members of Congress. Individuals who are stewards of the  public trust must abide by the rules that they make. My bill, H.R.  2192, will ensure that Congress abides by the laws they pass and is  treated no differently than other hardworking Americans.   Regardless of your vote on the AHCA, this is a bill that each and  every single Member of Congress should support.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee  on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to now speak to the underlying MacArthur  amendment that the McSally bill is here to modify. The MacArthur  amendment specifically would allow States to waive three of ObamaCare's  costliest mandates. Let me stress that again. It would allow States-- not require States; it would allow States to waive three of ObamaCare's  costliest mandates, essential health benefits, age ratings, and  community rating.   In waiving these Federal mandates, health insurers would not be  allowed to discriminate by gender or preexisting condition, and no one  would be denied coverage, period.   Here is how it works: a State may apply to waive essential health  benefits or to increase the age rating ratio from the bill's underlying  5-to-1 ratio. They may also change the way individuals who have not  maintained continuous coverage are charged for their healthcare plan,  but only if the State has a risk-sharing program in place, like the  Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program established by the Palmer- Schweikert amendment.   In order to receive a waiver, a State must explain to the Secretary  of Health and Human Services how the program will reduce average  premiums for patients, increase enrollment for residents, stabilize the  State's health insurance market, stabilize premiums for individuals  living with preexisting conditions, or increase the patient's  healthcare options.   It is important to note that in providing assistance to reduce  premiums or other out-of-pocket costs, for individuals who may be  subject to an increase in their monthly premiums because they reside in  a State with an approved waiver, have a preexisting condition, are  uninsured because they have not maintained continuous coverage and they  purchase health insurance on the individual market, there will be $138  billion to assist with premium assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that within the State of  Illinois, there were eight plans in 2015. There are five plans in 2017  with a 57 percent increase in premiums.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson), a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, directed to the Chair, I would just make  note of the fact in North Carolina, there were three plans offered in  2015, down to two plans in 2017, premium increase of 82 percent.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), another member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), another valuable member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and a member of the Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that, in the State of  Florida, there were 10 insurance plans available in the individual  market in 2015, down to 5 plans in 2017, with a 24 percent premium  increase.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Collins), who is a very valuable member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, for the past 7 years, the  American people have pleaded with their Representatives in Washington  to repeal ObamaCare. Today, every Member of this body has the  opportunity to do just that. We have the chance to eliminate  excruciating mandates and taxes that are suffocating our economy and  marketplaces.   Under ObamaCare, premiums have increased by over 37 percent since  2014, one-third of counties in this country have only one insurance  provider, and 4.7 million Americans were kicked off the insurance  coverage they wanted to maintain despite President Obama's promise  that, if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.   But today we have the chance to lower premiums, increase competition  among insurance providers, and improve access to health insurance for  all Americans. We finally have the chance to formally reject an  unprecedented government overreach into health care and take the first  step towards giving patients control over their own health.   In western New York, this bill will have even more profound benefits.  The amendment that I authored with Representative John Faso will  relieve county governments in New York of a $2.3 billion unfunded  mandate forced onto county taxpayers by the Governor of New York and  will substantially reduce the tax burdens of property owners across New  York State. This one provision of the American Health Care Act will  save taxpayers in the eight counties that I represent over $470 million  a year.   This is a game-changer for local New York governments and restores a  fundamental tenet of representative democracies that the level of  government that makes the decision about spending should be responsible  for raising those funds. I am proud to stand up for western New Yorkers  whose voices have been silenced for too long, and I am proud to vote  for the freedom, fiscal responsibility, and local decisionmaking this  bill guarantees.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn), who is a very valuable Member of Congress and a  fellow physician.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn), who is a very valuable Member of Congress and a  fellow physician.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 13\3/4\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 11\1/4\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith), who is a valuable member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith), who is a valuable member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), who is a fellow physician and the chairman of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black), the chairman of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black), the chairman of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee on  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 20 seconds to the gentleman from  Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 20 seconds to the gentleman from  Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on  Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Rice).   Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the  American people today who are being dragged down by this failing  disaster called ObamaCare. Since I first got to Congress, I have  consistently heard from people across the Seventh District of South  Carolina who have been negatively affected by ObamaCare.   We were told: If you like your plan, you could keep it.   We were told: Your premiums would go down by $2,500 per family.   We were told it would provide more choice. But what we have seen is  exactly the opposite. 232,000 South Carolinians' plans were canceled,  premiums have increased by double digits every year and are up by 28  percent this year. There is only one insurer left in South Carolina,  and they are threatening to pull out. The law is failing miserably and  getting worse.    This bill repeals harmful ObamaCare taxes across the board that drove  up healthcare costs and transitions health care to a more competitive,  patient-centered insurance market. There are still fixes that need to  be made to further improve health care, but this is a dramatic move  forward from where we are today and the first step in moving America's  health care from an unsustainable system to a sustainable one.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 1\1/2\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has \3/4\ minute remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I do want to take a minute today to thank the superior team we have  in the House Legislative Counsel. They have put in many man hours and  woman hours to draft this bill that is being considered here in the  House today. Specifically I want to thank Ed Grossman, Jessica Shapiro,  Michelle Vanek, and Jesse Cross for their devotion to the people of the  United States in helping us draft this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to correct a technical problem that  exists with trying to draft to Senate rules with the House legislation.  Recognizing the problem, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) has  introduced a straightforward and practical bill to fix the problem. It  is a simple 2-page bill that, when the American  [[Page H4149]]  Health Care Act becomes law, Members of Congress and congressional  staff will be treated the same way as every other citizen. That is only  right, and it is only proper.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 308, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
