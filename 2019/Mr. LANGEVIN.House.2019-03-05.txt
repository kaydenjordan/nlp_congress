 Madam Speaker, we often hear about the immunotherapy  revolution, medicine's next frontier, which is right now, for extending  or even saving lives. Dr. Sadhak Sengupta and his wife, Sudarshana, two  talented scientists from Rhode Island, are on the cutting edge of this  research.   Dr. Sengupta is the director of brain tumor immunotherapy research at  Rhode Island Hospital and an assistant professor at Brown University.  He has been working as a scientist in the United States since 2002, and  he holds numerous patents.   Despite these achievements, Dr. Sengupta has been unable to get a  green card simply due to the country of his birth, India. For years, we  have reached the per-country cap on employment-based green cards for  India, and the current backlog is, right now, measured in decades.   Sadhak and Sudarshana dream of launching a startup, but 17 years  after moving to this country, they still live in uncertainty. Madam  Speaker, that is why I support the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants  Act, a bill to remove per-country green card caps and treat all  immigrants equally.   It is the right thing to do for the Senguptas and for all Americans  and their families who will benefit from their research and their  greatness of spirit.                            ____________________
