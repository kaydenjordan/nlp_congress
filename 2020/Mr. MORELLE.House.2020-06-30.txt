Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1028, providing for consideration of  H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, under a structured rule.   The rule provides 2 hours of general debate on the bill, equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment offered by Chairman  DeFazio, makes in order six en bloc amendments in total, and makes in  order three further amendments.   Prior to the offering of an en bloc amendment, the chair of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure may designate amendments  that shall not be considered as part of the en bloc and shall be  considered separately.   And, lastly, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or  without instructions.   Mr. Speaker, the Moving Forward Act provides more than $1.5 trillion  to rebuild American infrastructure. The state of disrepair of our roads  cost Americans $160 billion in 2014, and 200,000 of our Nation's  bridges are more than 50 years old.   Our aging water system loses trillions of gallons of treated water  each year and leaves some families without clean water to drink at all.   Children across the Nation are trying to learn in classrooms that are  falling apart, without climate control in extreme temperatures, and  without reliable internet access.   At the same time, more than 200 million Americans are facing  unemployment during a global pandemic.   Our Nation is facing long-term economic repercussions of our  inability to stem the spread of COVID-19. We must do something.   Nearly a century ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt lifted this  Nation up during the height of the Great Depression by putting  Americans back to work. By investing in good-paying jobs and public  works to improve our communities across the Nation, we were able to  provide direct help for working families and invest in much-needed  infrastructure. This shaped the face of America for generations to  come.   The time has come again to invest in desperately needed  infrastructure projects that can put Americans to work right now in  their own communities.   There has been tremendous bipartisan agreement from leaders at every  level of government, from our village mayors to the President of the  United States, that this country must invest in infrastructure that  will carry the next generation. The Moving Forward Act is the first  step in meeting that need.   With H.R. 2, we will be investing not only in transportation,  housing, schools, and broadband, but in families, workers, and  communities across this country. This legislation supports American  manufacturing and ingenuity, and together we will create millions of  jobs right here at home. We will secure the future of our children by  forging a path toward zero carbon emissions, making our streets and  transit safer, and bringing a better learning environment to every  child.   This legislation provides more than $300 billion to repair and  upgrade existing roads and bridges, railways, and ports. We are going  to provide $100 billion to put zero-emission buses on American  roadways, cutting congestion, providing new options for families and  workers. We are working to make roads smarter and safer for all users,  including children, pedestrians, and cyclists.   We will also provide over $100 billion to create or preserve 1.8  million affordable homes, reducing housing inequality, creating local  jobs, and increasing resiliency in the face of natural disasters.   I am proud to support provisions to triple funding for Amtrak to  allow long-awaited upgrades and expansion of our Nation's passenger  rail network. America has long lagged behind in accessible and  efficient rail travel, and this funding will improve safety and assist  local traffic congestion.   The Moving Forward Act represents a true partnership between the  Federal Government and American States and localities.   The bill also permanently reinstates Build America Bonds and advance  refunding bonds as well as increasing the issuance of private activity  bonds, spurring private investment in community projects that our  Nation desperately needs.   We have $70 billion for clean energy and a plan to upgrade America's  electrical grid to make it more efficient and more resilient.   H.R. 2 also delivers affordable high-speed internet access to all  parts of the country by investing $100 billion to  [[Page H2684]]  promote competition for broadband internet infrastructure to unserved  and underserved rural, suburban, and urban communities.                                time  1030    As our Nation battles this global pandemic, and so many of our  hospitals have been stretched to the brink, the Moving Forward Act  invests $30 billion to upgrade hospital facilities to increase  capacity, strengthen care, and prepare for future health emergencies.   This bill invests $25 billion to modernize postal infrastructure and  operations, including a zero emissions postal vehicle fleet, and puts  Americans to work strengthening our coast with a $3 billion grant  program for shovel-ready projects to restore Great Lakes, coastal  habitats, and marine ecosystems.   As we discuss the far-reaching benefits of the Moving Forward Act, I  would like to note the significance of one particular provision that I  was proud to advocate for along with my colleagues in the Education and  Labor Committee, the Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act.   Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, chronic neglect of America's  public schools forced students and educators across the country to  learn and work in outdated and hazardous school buildings. Now the  pandemic is exacerbating this crisis and making abundantly clear how  unprepared and under-resourced many of our Nation's school districts  are.   The Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act takes great strides to  move beyond the traditional brick and mortar school infrastructure to  support schools and designing the types of building and classrooms  needed to serve students, especially those from low income families.  This critical legislation is needed now more than ever.   Today, we can work to not only help teachers and students get back to  school, but commit serious investment in high poverty schools with  facilities that pose health and safety risks to students and staff,  expand access to high-speed broadband to ensure that all public schools  have the reliable and high-speed internet access that students need for  digital and distance learning.   This legislation, the Moving Forward Act, represents a significant  step we must take to invest in the future of American infrastructure  from our highway systems to our classrooms.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the rule and  support H.R. 2.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am always excited to be with my friend from Georgia,  and we do get to sit through long hours of the Rules Committee and  question back and forth our witnesses. And he is right, I am not  particularly media savvy, I have a face for radio, as they say. But we  do find that time to be very informative. I struggle a little bit, I  was not here in 2015, but I do know what has happened over the last 18  months or so.    First and foremost, I just note that in the midst of a pandemic, I  think we can hardly be excused had we just done a closed rule. Put the  bill before us for a vote without a structured rule, which is in front  of us.   I also note, and this is one of the challenges of trying to engage in  bipartisanship, which I am not only a big fan of, but I engaged in in  my previous life as a member of the New York State Assembly where we  had a Republican Senate and a Democratic House, much as we find  ourselves in here today, and we worked across the aisle to find common  ground when we could.   But I will say that I think that the difference between 2015 and now  is the opposition of the minority, particularly as it related to a  number of issues that dealt with climate change, and made it, as I  understand listening to the chair of the Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure, effectively mitigated any chance of having a  bipartisan agreement on this. But that is not to say that there aren't  Republican amendments before us.   I know Ms. Foxx will have an amendment here later. The ranking member  of the Education and Labor Committee on which I serve, as well as the  ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  will advance an en bloc amendment. So there will be, and there  continues to be an effort on our part to work across the aisle. But I  do find it hard to be bipartisan, and I think if it was a voice vote,  then I think there was general agreement. Clearly, there were  differences of opinion here that we could not get past, and we felt the  need very much to advance this.   Mr. Speaker, I also will say, just to note--and I hate to keep  hearkening back to my experience in State government, but I will,  nonetheless, even though I hate it, I will do that, which is to say, I  served under Republican and Democratic Governors. And something that  would have been this important would clearly have engaged the Governor  of either party in discussions with the members of the legislature in  both houses.                                time  1045    And I note that while the President has indicated support for an  infrastructure bill, I think it was over a year ago, back in May of  2019, where the President hosted a meeting at the White House after  having talked about a $2 trillion infrastructure package and broke up  the meeting in anger and left, and as far as I know has not engaged  either House in substantive discussions moving forward.   So I don't disagree with my friend from Georgia. I know that he is  profoundly interested in this institution and in working across the  aisle, but there are times when, unfortunately, for various reasons  that is not the case, and we have it in front of us today. And I feel  compelled that we move forward on the Moving Forward Act because this  is vital to the interests of the American public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui), a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Very briefly, I do note that we certainly could have entered into a  bipartisan agreement if we didn't care about climate change, if we  weren't interested in the greatest impact on our carbon footprint by  transportation and automobiles, and we create a number of provisions in  this bill which we could not get support on, which is why we had to go  on our own way.   I do also note for my great friend from Georgia, 17 bipartisan  amendments are included in this package. So there is bipartisanship,  despite the feelings that the White House has given as it relates to  this bill.   Before I yield, I insert in the Record a May 8 Industry Week article  titled, ``Crumbling Infrastructure is Hurting America's Competitive  Edge.''                            [From Industry Week]       Crumbling Infrastructure Is Hurting America's Competitive Edge                            (By Michael McGarry)         With unemployment rates in the U.S. at historic levels due       to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more       important than ever to invest in areas that help get more       people back to work. Today, lawmakers should prioritize the       passage and implementation of a comprehensive infrastructure       program, as part of a future round of stimulus funding that       would immediately provide employment opportunities for many       Americans.        Even before we started feeling the economic impacts of       COVID-19, our country was in dire need of these upgrades.       Data from the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)       reveals that underinvestment in U.S. infrastructure worsens       by the year, and infrastructure investment before the       pandemic was only one-third of what it was in 1960.        Manufacturers, who today continue to provide essential       resources to the medical community and other front-line       workers, are currently relying on outdated roads, bridges,       waterways, ports, runways and drinking water systems, many of       which are more than 50 years old. More than 54,000 bridges       across the U.S. are rated ``structurally deficient''       according to NAM. Roadways, ports and waterways are in       disrepair. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)       released a report card in 2017 of infrastructure in the       country and gave the nation a rating of D+. According to the       U.S. Department of Transportation, 65% of major U.S. roads       are rated as ``less than good condition.''        In addition to the challenges we will now face due to the       current economic environment, these deficiencies take an       additional toll on manufacturers' bottom lines, causing       unreliable delivery times and increased fleet maintenance       costs. Congested highway networks add $74.5 billion to       transportation costs for manufacturers moving goods and raw       materials by truck, according to the American Transportation       Research Institute.        In order for America to remain globally competitive now and       after this pandemic, our leaders must be committed to       improving our infrastructure. China's infrastructure       investment is almost double the size of the infrastructure       spending in the U.S., and India's infrastructure investments       are growing at a rate that triples the infrastructure outlays       of the U.S., Canada and Mexico combined. Manufacturing       workers in the U.S., and all Americans, should refuse to       settle for infrastructure that lags behind the rest of the       world.        Many have acknowledged that the current economic challenges       bring an opportunity to upgrade the nation's neglected       transportation systems. Stay-at-home orders covering nearly       the entire country in March and April kept Americans off the       road, and gas tax revenues have plummeted as a result.       According to the American Association of State Highway and       Transportation Officials, state and local governments need       $50 billion to ensure that they can continue existing       transportation construction and maintenance programs without       disruption. The nation's airports also need a backstop to       make up for lost user fees. Keeping current infrastructure       projects afloat is only a start.        Our deteriorating national infrastructure is not solely a       state or federal issue. It is not a small or large business       issue. It is not a Democratic or a Republican issue.       Infrastructure is an American issue that directly affects our       ability to compete in the global marketplace and provide       financial security for millions of American families.        Once it is safe to work, the U.S. government should       mobilize to rebuild our nation's infrastructure. It would       ensure that the nation emerges on the other side with a       stronger, competitive economy. Infrastructure projects put       people to work at high wages, create demand for materials and       equipment and generate tax revenues for governments at all       levels. They build systems of lasting public benefit,       improving the safety, convenience and efficiency of commerce,       communication and travel.        Making substantial investments in America's infrastructure       will not only put Americans back to work, but it will improve       the  [[Page H2687]]       lives of workers, while helping all manufacturers better       serve their customers and communities. It will bolster the       security of our nation, and it will strengthen the ties that       bind us together as a country, improving commerce and       communication and paving the way for the success of the next       generation.        Congress must invest now. I urge our elected leaders to       work together to prioritize a bold vision for improving       infrastructure. Congress's next stimulus bill must include       aggressive investments in infrastructure such as highways,       bridges and airports. It's good for our citizens, our       economy, and our country to remain globally competitive. We       cannot afford to wait.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note that bipartisanship is a  two-way street. While some may suggest that the majority is at fault, I  would argue that there was a lack of a good-faith effort on the part of  the minority to engage in meaningful dialogue on things like climate  change and the importance of making sure we have infrastructure  investments in our schools and in our healthcare systems.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do note, while this is certainly a very, very  important issue, cyberattacks on the United States, both on government  and our private sector, I think what is equally troubling are physical  attacks and bounties placed by Russian leaders on U.S. soldiers in  Afghanistan. I don't see any note of that in the resolution.   But the bigger issue here is that we have a $1.5 trillion  infrastructure bill in front of us. I would certainly join with my  colleagues in any resolutions on Chinese and Russian interference in  American activities. The work in front of us, however, is a $1.5  trillion transportation bill desperately needed for American citizens  throughout this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I just note that in the last Congress, the  majority invested $2 trillion in a tax cut  [[Page H2691]]  that 83 percent went to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, and  despite that, we see no lasting benefit of that. It has added  substantially to the deficit of the United States, to the tune of over  $1.3 trillion. We prefer to make these investments in American families  and in American jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking my colleague and friend on the  Rules Committee (Mr. Woodall), who is really one of the thought leaders  in this Chamber and has always committed to bipartisanship, always  committed to what is best for our Nation and for the people blessed to  call this Nation home. I want to thank him, as always, for his  partnership and his hard work in his diligence to the cause.   I take a slightly different view of what we do here today than my  friend because this isn't, in my view, strictly a partisan issue or a  party issue or a platform issue or a messaging issue. This is an issue  of what we value as Americans, what we believe and what the majority  believes is important to the citizens of this country.   We do face, as Mr. Woodall notes, the greatest pandemic this country  has faced in at least a century. We have 125,000 Americans who have  lost their lives to it. So this is an extraordinary time, and it calls  for extraordinary measures and a $1.5 trillion plan to move America  forward to address our transportation crisis, to address our climate  change crisis, to address our healthcare crisis, to address the  challenges brought on by crumbling schools across this country.   One of the learnings of this pandemic, in my view, has been the  digital divide. Whether it is in telehealth, in telemedicine, we know  that those communities of color that already face disparities face even  greater disparities. So the broadband initiative included in this is so  vitally important to all of us.   We see that when it comes to distance learning in our schools.  Crumbling schools, yes, but the inability of schoolchildren to get to  online classes and distance learning because of broadband challenges is  great, as well, and we need to do everything we can to limit those  disparities.   And those are the great learnings, perhaps, of this pandemic and  things we can do about it.                                time  1130    That is why we believe so strongly in investing those dollars in  meeting the challenge of climate change, the defining challenge of our  time. Transportation is the leading cause of U.S. carbon pollution. So  these are the values we embrace.   While certainly I take as an article of faith what Mr. Woodall said,  which is, perhaps it is not likely this bill, every word and every  comma will become law unless, all of a sudden, there is enlightenment  in the United States Senate, which I frankly have some doubt about. But  make no mistake, much of what is in here will become law because it is  important to us as a majority and it is important to the American  people.   We are going to continue to stand and fight for these things in the  midst of these great crises because they are important, we need to put  Americans back to work to build our infrastructure and to build an  infrastructure for the next generation. This isn't about now. This  isn't about digging a hole and filling it back up, digging another hole  and filling it back up. These are great needs. They are needs that we  have, frankly, ignored for decades now. The time has come to address  them.   So this is a question of values. It is a question of what we believe  Americans need, what our families need, and what our communities need.   We will get there. I have faith that we will negotiate a bill, and  much of what is included today, hopefully, will pass, will be included  in the final package, and will be signed by the President because it is  too important for America not to do.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for their words in favor of  H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on  the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1028         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 10. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 1031) condemning the cyber attacks on       American persons and organizations conducting research       related to COVID 19 and expressing the sense of the House of       Representatives that those responsible for perpetrating such       belligerent acts should face consequences. The resolution       shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble to       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall       not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 1031.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
