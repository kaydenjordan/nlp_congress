 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Eagle Scout  Chairman Pete Sessions for his great introduction. It is an absolute  honor to be here.   About a week ago, I said I would like to get the Eagle Scouts  together on the floor of the House of Representatives and talk about  what it means to us to be Eagle Scouts, reflect on our history and our  tradition and how great this institution has been for the United States  of America for all of these years and how we must make sure that this  institution stays strong for the years to come. When I brought that to  the gentleman's attention, he said, absolutely, we will do it. I didn't  talk to him again, and today we are doing it. I didn't have to ask  twice.   As chairman of the Scouting Caucus here in the House of  Representatives, the gentleman has led in a tremendous way. We have  seen so many Eagle Scouts come to the Capitol, and he always gets all  of us together and always has us talk face-to-face with the Scouts--not  just Eagle Scouts--and encourage them from the earliest days of their  Scouting careers.   I want to thank him for his leadership, because a lot of people could  chair this committee, but he hasn't just chaired it; he has led it, and  that reflects greatly on him.   When I think about my days as a Scout, I go all the way back to my  Cub Scout days. In fact, it was even before I was a Scout. My brother  was a year older than me, so he got to be a Cub Scout before I was a  Cub Scout.   He got to participate in this new thing that was going on in the  lives of the Bridenstines called the pinewood derby. He had this little  car--a block of wood with some nails and some wheels--and we watched  that car streak from the very top of the track and come to a screeching  halt where the track leveled out. In fact, this little blue car didn't  even make it to the end of the track.   Of course, all of these other Scouts had all their fancy cars that  had their rounded wheels and graphite on the nails and all of the  weights put in the car. We didn't know to do any of that.   So my brother, John Bridenstine, who was a Cub Scout before I was a  Cub Scout, had to endure the pain of being a Scout and wanting to have  the fastest car, and his didn't even make it to the end of the track.   Well, I will tell you this. There was a Life Scout named Wayne  Bridenstine, who was our dad. He was not going to allow any of our cars  to ever again not make it to the end of the track. So we went to work  trying to learn everything we could about this pinewood derby.   We engineered a couple of what I think are the greatest cars in  American Scouting history. The next year, the Bridenstine boys won  first place and second place going forward. We won first place and  second place in--I don't remember which--but we reversed it going  backwards. So we went from having a car that didn't even reach the end  of the track to winning the pinewood derby.   Many years later, now I have my own son. He is in Cub Scouts and he  does the pinewood derby. I committed to him the same thing my dad  committed to us back in those days: We are going to win the pinewood  derby.   The first year we did it, we had great success. The second year, Dad  got a little, maybe, overaggressive in his engineering. Maybe we put  the weights a little too far back. As that car came down, it got really  unstable and it wobbled. There were a couple of times it barely made it  to the end of the track.   But I will tell you this. The relationship that I had with my dad and  that my brother had with our dad and that was necessary to pull us from  not even finishing the race to winning the race and now the  relationship with my son, Walker Bridenstine, are things that are  important in our family and will be for many years to come.   So those are some of my first ideas.   Of course, Cub Scouts led to the Arrow of Light. The very next  progression is to become a Boy Scout. So we searched a number of  different troops across Arlington, Texas, and Fort Worth, Texas. We  were in the Longhorn Council at the time. We eventually settled on  Troop 83.   I remember some of the leaders of the troop. Coach Wasden was a  football coach at Hutcheson Junior High. That was somebody who was  intense. He was serious about Scouts. Boy, if you were going to move up  in rank, you were going to prove to him that you have done what was  required.   Of course, earning merit badges was important to all of us who were  trying to move up the ranks. I will never forget the first summer camp  that we went on. My brother and I were not able to go to the summer  camp that our troop went on. So we went to this thing called the  Maverick Camp, where we went with a bunch of Scouts we didn't even  know, but we had a great time.   I am not going to lie to you; it was a challenge. I was in fifth  grade. My brother was in sixth grade. It was the middle of August in  Texas. We will just say the middle of August in Texas. It was just as  hot at midnight as it was at the noon hour.  [[Page H4494]]    We sweat a lot. We worked hard. We got seven merit badges that  summer. That was intense. We didn't know you weren't supposed to get  that many. We showed up back at our troop for the court of honor and  people were shocked that we got seven. No wonder it was so hard. Nobody  told us not to get seven merit badges in one summer camp.   These are some of the memories I had. My brother and I were really  challenged and we got that done. The next summer, we did three or four  merit badges and had a lot more fun. These are some of the memories.   I was the chaplain's aid. As the chaplain's aid, one of the things  that I prayed for most was that the chaplain would show up on the  campout so I wouldn't have to do the public speaking in front of  everybody. And here I am now as a Member of Congress who publicly  speaks as a living. That is one of the things the Boy Scouts of America  gave me: the ability to stand before an audience and tell people what  was on my mind.   My leadership experience was as the chaplain's aid. My brother was  the senior patrol leader for Troop 83. I was in the Arrow of Light  patrol. He was in the Bison Patrol. He was the senior patrol leader.    Summer camp after summer camp and all the things we heard, here is, I  think, one of the important things that people need to remember: The  Boy Scouts of America is an institution that trains leaders. You might  not recognize it when you are in it because you believe you are just  having fun, but then there come those moments in life when you really  need to lean on the things that you learned as a Boy Scout, and it  doesn't even dawn on you until later that you actually learned these  things as a Boy Scout.   After I graduated from college, I joined the United States Navy. I  became a pilot. Of course, one of the things we have to do is survival,  evasion, resistance, and escape. In this process, we have to live in  the woods for a period of time. We have to figure out how we are going  to survive and evade for a week. During this time, you have to live  based on the things that you see around you. You have to be able to  start a fire.   Some of these basic things I was able to do that all the peers around  me had no ability to do because they did not have the life experiences  in the Boy Scouts of America.   We had to be able to cook a rabbit, something that I had done before  and something that my peers, also Navy pilots, had not done. We had to  able to land navigate with a map and a compass, which, to me, was  second nature because I had done it for years trying to get to my rank  of Eagle. But for so many people, it was a foreign concept to use a map  and a compass to land navigate from point A to point B.   I remember one group navigated point to point. Our group said: We  don't want to go point to point because if we miss the point, we won't  know we missed the point. So we are going to intentionally offset, hit  the river, and then we are going to know exactly where we are. Of  course, we didn't miss the point. We knew where we were going.   But some of my peers who did not have the experiences I had went well  beyond the point and didn't know they had gone down the point, then  they had to come back. I could have told you that was going to happen  because it had happened to me previously as somebody who was in the Boy  Scouts of America.   These are very real-life experiences that you look back on and say:  Why was I able to do this? I was able to do it because I was in the Boy  Scouts of America.   You also look back and say there are things that are intangible,  things that are not specific. I heard Eagle Scout Jeb Hensarling  today--chairman, Congressman, Eagle Scout--talk about tying a bowline  in one hand and how he doesn't anticipate finding himself at the bottom  of a cliff with a broken arm, but if he did, he would be able to tie a  one-handed bowline and somebody would be able to pull him out.  Certainly, that is exactly the same kind of thing that I learned when I  was going through the same program.   Just a couple of weeks ago, Walker Bridenstine, my son, had to learn  how to tie a bowline. I was trying to teach him how to tie a bowline  the old-fashioned way. I simply couldn't do it. When I tried to tie it  as a one-handed bowline, I was able to do it. It just stuck with me all  of these years.   So, again, these are specific skills. But the leadership, the ability  to lead people are things that the Boy Scouts teach you. You apply  these things every day in your life, and you don't even know you are  doing it.   I will also say that, as employers, we look for leaders when we are  trying to find whom we are going to hire. We see over and over again  employers looking to hire Eagle Scouts from the Boy Scouts of America.   So there might be somebody today who is watching this maybe on C- SPAN, maybe on the internet; and maybe you are a Boy Scout, maybe you  are a Cub Scout, maybe you are not sure if you are going to stick it  out. I will tell you this. Every interview I have ever gone on, I had a  resume. On that resume was included the fact that I was an Eagle Scout.  Even when I was applying for college, I put on my resume and in all of  my extracurricular classes that I was an Eagle Scout. I would highly  encourage anybody that is maybe at a lower rank but working hard to  attain that Eagle, finish your Eagle Scout.   My dad was a Life Scout. He moved when he was a Life Scout. He never  finished his Eagle. His brother, Jim Bridenstine, my uncle, did finish  his Eagle Scout. Of course, my brother and I both finished our Eagle  Scout, and now our kids are in Scouts, and we are going to do  everything we can to help them finish their Eagle Scout.   Not only did I put it on every resume, not only on all of my college  applications, I will tell you, I also ran for Federal office. The first  thing I did in my campaign commercials is tell people: My name is Jim  Bridenstine, and I am an Eagle Scout. Before I told them that I went to  college or before I told them that I was a Navy pilot, I told them that  I was an Eagle Scout.   I think it is important for people to understand that some folks have  a desire from an early age to achieve. When employers look at a resume,  when voters look at somebody running for office, they want to see that.   I will tell you, there was somebody who came into my office not too  long ago wanting a job. I had a number of great candidates. It was  nearly impossible for me to pick which one. We all know this: When you  get to be a Member of Congress, you get hundreds of resumes the next  day.   I was getting down to the end, and I was trying to figure out which  one. I got down to three. When they left my office, one of the three  said this: One other thing I need to let you know; I am an Eagle Scout.   That did it for me. I knew at that point that this young man had  committed himself to something much bigger than himself from an early  age. That person now works in my office.   I look for that. I know employers across this country look for that.  It speaks volumes to the character and the training of the individual.  That will continue.    I will tell you, when you think about all of the astronauts in the  United States of America, the 316 or so of them in the history of the  United States of America, 40 of them were Eagle Scouts. That is not by  accident. I will tell you that is a much higher percentage than the  number of Eagle Scouts who are produced in the Boy Scouts of America,  and it is certainly a much higher percentage than the number of Eagle  Scouts that exist in the population of the United States of America. So  this is something that employers look for.   I took my 11-year-old son to the Air Force Academy just about a month  ago. I took some brochures about what it takes to get into the Air  Force Academy. There is all kinds of stuff in there about being an  athlete and being a great student, but one of the six criteria that  they look for is: Are you an Eagle Scout at the Air Force Academy of  the United States of America?   I would also argue they probably look for the same thing at West  Point and the Naval Academy. These are things that employers look for,  that schools look for, that the military looks for. These are the  character issues that are important.   So if you are in Scouting today, my encouragement to you is to  finish, get your Eagle Scout. If you are below the  [[Page H4495]]  age of 18 and you have still got time, I would encourage you to join  and get your Eagle Scout. It has been important for me. It has been  important for my brother. It has been important for my family.                                time  1845    My uncle Jim's son, Shane, my cousin, is also an Eagle Scout. This is  a tradition of the Bridenstine family, and I would encourage you to  make it a tradition in yours.   Mr. Chairman, I just want to say thank you for your leadership and  thank you for leading this effort.
