 Mr. President, as we continue this historic effort in  Congress to repeal harmful regulations, I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 66.   Due to the aggressive regulatory posture taken by the Obama  administration in its final months, Congress has had to spend a  significant portion of time repealing regulations under the  Congressional Review Act, and our level of success has been  unprecedented.   Before 2017, only one CRA resolution had ever been successfully  passed by Congress and signed by the President. If passed and signed,  H.J. Res. 66 would be the 14th CRA resolution enacted this year. That  is remarkable. It is unfortunate that we are in this situation, no  doubt, but our success in rolling back harmful regulations is a  positive step, in my view and in the view of so many others.   There is a growing consensus here in Washington and throughout our  country that the U.S. economy--our workers, businesses, and job  creators--are horribly overregulated. Regulations promulgated by the  executive branch take hundreds of billions of dollars out of our  economy. The resolution before us will repeal a regulation that  President Obama apparently personally ordered Labor Secretary Tom Perez  to draft as a gift to certain blue States.   The regulation eliminated longstanding Federal protections for the  retirement savings of private sector workers, specifically giving  States a ``safe harbor'' from the protection that workers have had for  decades under ERISA if the State requires employers to either set up a  retirement plan or enroll its employees in a State-run plan.   These State plans do not have to be portable, nor do they have to  permit workers to withdraw their savings at any time. States like  California, Oregon, Connecticut, Maryland, and Illinois are already  using this authority to impose new mandates on both large and small  employers, including startup businesses. Some of the mandates apply  regardless of the size of the business.   The regulation not only encourages States to impose conflicting and  burdensome mandates on private sector businesses, but it also  encourages States to bar private workers' access to their retirement  accounts, and it would let States invest private workers' retirement  assets, ignoring provisions in Federal pension law that require prudent  pension investment practices and that ban kickbacks and self-dealing.   Some States have already made it clear that once they take control of  the private worker assets, they intend to invest them just like they  invest their State pension plan assets.   For anyone who is following our Nation's current public pension  crisis, that is not a pretty picture--and that is being kind. Put  simply, States like California and Illinois shouldn't get a pass on  investing potentially billions of dollars in private worker retirement  assets without having to follow Federal rules requiring prudent  investment practices--rules designed to protect retirement nest eggs of  hard-working Americans.   I am all for increasing coverage for employees and workplace  retirement programs. I have been working with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to address this issue.   For example, last Congress, the Senate Finance Committee, which I  chair, unanimously approved the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act  of 2016, a bipartisan bill designed to increase voluntary retirement  savings.   My bill and others like it provide workable, voluntary solutions to  give more workers access to retirement plans. I emphasize the word  ``voluntary.'' In America, we have a voluntary defined contribution  retirement system for private businesses, and the voluntary approach  with appropriate incentives for workers and employers is far better  than the one taken by the Obama administration and former Labor  Secretary Tom Perez, which  [[Page S2689]]  would take us down the path toward government-mandated and government- run retirement plans. That is not really hyperbole. That is essentially  the stated purpose of these types of regulations.   The current retirement savings system clearly demonstrates the  superiority of the free market over government mandates when it comes  to government savings. Private retirement savings vehicles, like  401(k)s and IRAs that have been encouraged but not mandated by Federal  laws have produced nearly $14 trillion in wealth and savings for the  middle class.   Let me repeat that. Private retirement savings vehicles, with  encouragements and investor protections but not mandates, have produced  nearly $14 trillion in wealth and savings for middle-class Americans.   I agree that we need to enhance this system to give more workers  access and incentives to participate, but there is absolutely no  justification for any effort to reinvent the retirement savings system  in order to give primacy to government-run plans. I can only wonder why  States think they will be able to produce better results than the  private retirement savings system, which has been an unqualified  success. I have to wonder how some of my colleagues who value consumer  financial protection, as I do, would want to see abandonment of rules,  under the guise of a safe harbor, that erode protections for the  savings of workers and future retirees.   We can do our part to undo this harmful regulation by passing H.J.  Res 66. Toward that end, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor  of this resolution.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the epidemic of  suicide--a growing crisis that has devastated millions of families  across our Nation. Over the past 8 years, the rate of deaths by suicide  in our country has tripled. Let me repeat that. It has tripled, and the  problem is particularly severe among young adults.   According to the Centers for Disease Control, for youth between the  ages of 10 and 24, suicide is now the third leading cause of death. In  other words, more of America's youth die each year from suicide than  cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia,  influenza, and chronic lung disease combined.   This crisis shows no signs of abating. Consider that each day in our  Nation, there are an average of over 5,400 suicide attempts by young  people in grades 7 to 12. In my home State of Utah, the statistics are  particularly alarming. Every 14 hours, a Utahn commits suicide,  resulting in an average of 630 deaths each year. The problem is so  acute that Utah now has the fifth highest suicide rate in the Nation.  This troubling trend is particularly pronounced among Utah's youth.  Even though Utahns from ages 10 to 17 comprise only 13 percent of the  State population, they represent nearly 23 percent of all suicide  attempts. Suicide is now the leading cause of death among Utah's  teenagers.   To stem the tide of teenage suicide in Utah, I convened a roundtable  discussion in Salt Lake City last December that included community  leaders, healthcare professionals, high school principals, and parents  from across the State. There we discussed proven methods that  destigmatize mental illness, a critical first step in addressing the  suicide crisis. We also discussed the links between bullying and  depression.   In an effort to prevent teen suicide, the effect of bullying cannot  be overlooked. A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical  Association finds that kids who are bullied are more than twice as  likely to consider suicide. In my home State of Utah, dozens of  community leaders have drawn attention to the pernicious effects of  bullying. The foremost among them is Dr. Greg Hudnall, a nationally  recognized expert in suicide prevention. Dr. Hudnall found that between  8 and 12 percent of all suicides are committed by young people who have  been bullied. To discourage bullying and to help our teenagers who are  suffering most, Dr. Hudnall led in the development of HOPE4UTAH.  HOPE4UTAH is a dynamic peer-to-peer program designed to empower  students in groups called Hope Squads. Hope Squads identify warning  signs of depression in teenagers and offer help to those in need.   Wendy Nelson, principal of Utah's Syracuse High School, recently told  me how Hope Squads have helped students at risk of suicide to connect  with therapists that the school has made available on a regular basis.  The high school has since partnered with a local community health  center for help in addressing the need for help in this particular area  and, of course, the need for mental health professionals in schools.  This shortage of mental health counselors is a serious problem, not  only in Utah but in schools across the Nation. It is a very, very  serious problem.   In our December roundtable discussion, we learned that teen suicide  is something schools, parents, and mental health professionals cannot  address individually. Instead, a continuum of care must exist for each  child from the first day of school to graduation. We must all work  together to ensure that our children feel safe.   Educators play a vital role in maintaining an infrastructure of  support for teenagers struggling with mental illness. Because educators  are often the first to identify warning signs in vulnerable students,  hundreds of teachers in Utah receive training in how to identify and  respond to these signs. Once we know a teen is suffering, parents and  mental health professionals can step in to provide ongoing care.  Building community partnerships that involve everyone and that focus on  evidence-based practices can save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives.   My main purpose in organizing the roundtable discussion was to find  ways I could help prevent suicide on a national level. Increasing  access to mental healthcare has been a fixture of my Senate service.  Nearly 20 years ago, I convened the Senate Finance Committee's first  hearing dedicated to mental health. More recently, I focused my  legislative efforts on fighting prescription drug abuse, an epidemic  that has only accelerated our Nation's mental health crisis. I played a  leading role in passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act  and helped to draft the 21st Century Cures Act, which President Obama  signed into law in December. Both bills take aim at the opioid epidemic  that is ravaging entire communities across the Nation.   As a legislative body, we have set aside partisan differences in  recent months to combat the opioid crisis as part of a broader effort  to address growing rates of mental illness and death by suicide.   But there is more we can do to help. To begin, we need to provide  better and more immediate access to counseling and mental health  services. This is one of the main takeaways from last year's roundtable  discussion. So often we hear that those seeking help are just one  positive interaction away from giving life another chance. As Utah  State Senator Daniel Thatcher said:         If you talk to someone, they live. If you connect them to       support, they live.    Laura Warburton, a Utah mother who lost her daughter to suicide, said  that the day her daughter died, she had attempted to make one last call  to her therapist and could not get through.   While this is a complex problem with no simple, immediate answer,  there are steps we can take to help. Today, we are taking those  critical first steps to prevent future tragedies from taking place.   In response to what I learned during the suicide roundtable in Utah,  I have joined Senator Joe Donnelly in introducing the National Suicide  Hotline Improvement Act, a bipartisan proposal that will make it easier  for Americans of all ages to get the help and treatment they need when  they are experiencing suicidal thoughts. The current suicide prevention  lifeline system and veterans crisis line are in desperate need of  reform. Our bill will require the Federal Communications Commission, in  consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services and the  Department of Veterans Affairs, to study the current national suicide  hotline system and make recommendations to Congress on how we can  improve it.   Across our great Nation, there are millions of people, especially  young people, who are alone and suffering in the shadows of depression.  Many of them are bombarded by suicidal thoughts and have no idea where  to turn for help. To make matters worse, the national suicide hotline  number, 1-800-273-TALK, is not an intuitive or easy number to remember,  particularly for those experiencing a mental health emergency.   Fortunately, the success of the 911 emergency system provides a model  for addressing this problem. My bill will require the Federal  Communications Commission to recommend an easy-to-remember, three-digit  number for the national suicide prevention hotline. I believe that by  making the national suicide prevention lifeline system more user- friendly and accessible, we can save thousands of lives by helping  people find the help they need when they need it most.   In introducing this legislation, I wish to thank my fellow Utahn,  Congressman Chris Stewart. Congressman Stewart has been an invaluable  partner in offering some of the most important measures of this bill.  Additionally, I would like to thank the American Foundation for Suicide  Prevention. I also wish to express my appreciation for the support we  have received from the Utah State Legislature, Utah's attorney general,  and the Utah Department of Health Services, as well as several groups  from the law enforcement community.   This proposal transcends party lines and stands to save thousands of  lives.  [[Page S2724]]  We cannot delay this effort to prevent suicide. So I call on my  colleagues in both the House and the Senate to act quickly to pass this  bill. Your support for this legislation represents your commitment to  preventing future tragedies. I ask all of you today, regardless of your  party affiliation, to cosponsor this legislation. In doing so, you can  help us help those who need our help the most. There is absolutely no  time to lose.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr.          Bennet):   S. 1028.
