 Mr. Speaker, ask Hoosiers in New Albany what LifeSpan  Resources is and they will tell you it is a key part of the community.  Their organization works to support independence and quality of life  for people across southern Indiana through their advocacy and client  services, and they have great leaders, like Lora Clark, leading the  charge.   Happy 50 years of helping Hoosiers in Clark, Floyd, Harrison, and  Scott Counties live independently. That is 50 years of home-delivered  meals, transportation assistance, and numerous in-home services.   I am sorry I missed the big celebration at IU Southeast in New Albany  last week, but I am proud of the work you do.   On behalf of Hoosiers across our district, I congratulate and thank  them for 50 years.                            ____________________
