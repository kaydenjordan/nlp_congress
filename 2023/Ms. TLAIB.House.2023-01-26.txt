 Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of Mother Willa Cash,  a resident of Detroit and community mother in Michigan's 12th  Congressional District, as we mourn her recent passing. She was  lovingly called Willie by those who knew her well.   Ms. Cash's work touched the lives of so many. She worked for the  State of Michigan's Department of Unemployment Services and later the  Michigan Department of Human Services before retiring in 1999 after 26  years of service.   Ms. Cash was a caring, compassionate leader in our community. She  volunteered her time and energy to the Unity Temple Church of Detroit  and Greenwich Park Association block club. She was a proud, lifelong,  engaged voter and a member-retiree of the United Auto Workers Region 1- A.   Ms. Cash's love and compassion for her family were extraordinary.  Willie and her late husband, James, were married 53 years at the time  of his passing, and they were parents of two beautiful twins.   Please join me in recognizing Mother Willa Cash and her contribution  to our community as we honor her memory.                      Detroit's Water Shutoff Moratorium     Madam Speaker, just over 3 weeks ago, the city of  Detroit's water shutoff moratorium ended, terminating vital protection  for Detroit's most vulnerable residents.   We only got the lifesaving moratorium in the first place thanks to  years of determined organizing and advocacy from our community's water  warriors. Many are the mothers of our neighborhoods.   In response to that organizing and advocacy, the city has now created  an affordability plan, but many of the mothers in our community and  advocates continue to highlight shortcomings and a lack of awareness  amongst struggling Detroiters of the resources available, which leaves  thousands still in jeopardy of shutoffs.   For many Americans, water shutoffs are only the beginning. Even after  they pay off outstanding debt or arrange for payment plans,  reconnection fees further penalize them.   We need to move beyond treating missed payments as a moral failing  and acknowledge the reality of families struggling as they try to make  ends meet. The cost of water in our country has gone up 400 percent.   In the wealthiest Nation on Earth, there should not be a single  family without water. We have had enough of punishing people for being  poor. It is time to take our public health seriously and guarantee  water as a human right. We all know water is life. It is time we start  treating it as such.                    In Solidarity with Iranian Protesters     Madam Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the  protesters in Iran. In the streets, they are demanding human rights and  women's equality.   The courageous protesters are risking their lives to stop the massive  policing and security operations hurting women.   No one protesting for human rights in Iran or anywhere in the United  States or anywhere in the world should be met with government violence.  No one should be persecuted or executed for fighting for freedom for  their sisters, their daughters, or their mothers from oppressive and  harmful actions.   Mahsa Amini should be alive today. Countless protesters should be  alive today. I stand, and I know we all do, with all the brave and  courageous Iranians, especially the young women at the forefront of  this movement, who are fighting for liberation and bodily autonomy.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise to offer Tlaib Amendment No. 10 to H.R.  21.    Mr. Chair, this is a simple amendment that requires the  Secretary of the Interior to complete a standard environmental review  of each individual oil and gas lease before it can be issued.   Environmental reviews are standard practices that protect every  single one of our communities. It is transparency. Frankly, these types  of reviews don't even go far enough to protect the health of our  resident but at the very least, we must ensure environmental reviews  are conducted to the highest level.   I urge all my colleagues to stand up for these critical environmental  reviews and support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, I do respectfully disagree with the gentleman.  I do feel like this is very much germane, but I will respect the  decision by the Parliamentarian or the Chair.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer Tlaib Amendment No. 11 to H.R.  21    Mr. Chair, so let's get this straight. When developing  H.R. 21's gross drill baby drill plans, the Secretary of Energy is  required to consult with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, and  Defense, but not with the Administrator of the EPA or the Chair of the  Council on Environmental Quality.   These plans are rigged against frontline communities that I represent  and, really, around our Nation. The message is clear: When making plans  to destroy our environment, don't consult the environmental regulators  because those plans can't be justified.   So my amendment is a commonsense fix amendment. Include the EPA and  CEQ in the process in regard to the impacts on our environment.   I urge my colleagues to, again, please support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 13.    Mr. Chair, our residents elect each of us to represent  them in this body, not special interest groups or well-funded lobbies.   Yet, each year, the oil and gas lobby spends millions of dollars  buying meetings with Members, influencing and writing bills, and  defeating even the smallest efforts to help address our reliance on  oil.   I believe the American people deserve to know just how much their  Member is receiving from the oil and gas lobby to support their  favorite policies, and that is what this amendment would do.   Transparency, Mr. Chair, is paramount to building public trust, and  this amendment would go a long way in restoring the public's faith in  this body.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, although I respectfully disagree with the  gentleman, I also acknowledge the importance of the Parliamentarian  ruling, and whatever rule or decision by the Parliamentarian is made, I  will respect that decision. Again, I respectfully disagree and believe  very much that this is applicable to this bill.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment No. 14.    Mr. Chair, Big Oil is sitting on 9,000 approved, unused  drilling permits on Federal lands. Folks are lying to you when they say  we need more permits and more drilling.   My amendment is simple. It lowers the permissible increase in Federal  lands available for drilling from 10 percent to 0.1 percent.   What we really need, Mr. Chair, are windfall profit taxes on Big Oil  so that they stop price gouging our constituents at the pump.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to please support me on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Tracie  Alexander Golden, who tragically died in the neighborhood that I live  in.   Tracie was somebody that was incredibly loved by her community and by  her SEIU family. She was a respiratory therapist at Sinai-Grace  Hospital in Detroit.   Tracie's mother was known to all of us. She was the chief of staff to  Senator Carl Levin for over 30 years.   Tracie cared deeply about the community and wanted justice for those  who were disadvantaged and impacted by systemic racism.   Her daughter, Bianca Alexander, said: I am the daughter of Tracie,  the victim of a senseless murder just a few days before the new year of  2023. My mother was a loving, hardworking woman who did everything in  her power to provide for our family, and in no way, shape, or form  deserved a death like this one.   On behalf of the 12th Congressional District, I will take a moment to  acknowledge and mourn the loss of Mrs. Tracie Alexander Golden.                            ____________________
