 Mr. Speaker, ``I have felt fear at some of the things I  have seen here. I have seen amazing things and I have seen sad things,  but being in Iraq makes me realize what a great country we have.''   These are the words of Navy SEAL Marc Lee in his last letter home  before making the ultimate sacrifice for our country in Ramadi, Iraq.   My son, Leif, served with Marc on SEAL Team 3 and was with him during  his final act of honor. By all accounts, faith, courage, and  determination were Marc's guiding principles. They carried him  throughout his valiant career.   Thanks to Marc and many men like him, good continues to triumph over  evil. In their violent wake, they leave behind humility, love, and  selflessness, reminding me of John 3:13:         Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his       life for his friends.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, if southeast Texas is going to continue as  the global leader in creating reliable, affordable energy, we must  modernize and improve our water infrastructure.   My district has four ports, including the main terminal of the Port  of Houston, as well as the Houston Ship Channel, which is the busiest  U.S. deep-draft waterway and the top exporting port in the Nation.   The provisions of 2020's WRDA to dredge, widen, and improve two-way  traffic on the Houston Ship Channel is a product of hard work and  collaboration over the last several years. This major accomplishment is  the cornerstone for a more efficient, safe, and productive waterway for  everyone.   However, I recognize that there is still more work to be done. It is  not an exaggeration to say that by spending a million dollars today on  hurricane and flood prevention infrastructure, we are saving a billion  dollars in damages  [[Page H6982]]  down the road from another storm like Hurricane Harvey.   Thankfully, this bill contains numerous provisions for me and my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle that address these critical  needs.   I wish to thank Ranking Member Graves as well as Chairman DeFazio,  Mr. Westerman, and Mrs. Napolitano. Passing legislation like this one  today will bring great benefit to southeast Texas and the entire  country.
