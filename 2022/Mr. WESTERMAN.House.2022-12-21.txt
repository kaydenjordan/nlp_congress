 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in qualified support of S. 3168. I agree with the  goals of this bill, which are to build a water storage project and  provide a Tribe a  [[Page H9939]]  mechanism to develop its legal water rights.   The White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of  2010 intended to meet those stated goals. However, the legislation  before us today is now the third time that Congress has needed to  revisit that 2010 law.   It is not surprising because when Congress considered the underlying  law that this bill amends, the Obama administration testified it had  concerns with the legislation.   Then-Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Michael Connor stated that  his agency ``determined the Tribe's cost estimate . . . is not  sufficiently detailed or comprehensive to provide the necessary  assurance that the project can be constructed for that amount of  money.''   The Democrat majority at the time ignored the warnings of the Obama  administration. As a result, the cost of the dam that would help  deliver water to the reservation has ballooned.   Fast forward 12 years later, and here we are with this settlement in  serious jeopardy due to unworkable timelines. Now we are rushing to fix  mistakes that could have been avoided in 2010.   This bill would extend the settlement's enforceability deadline from  April 2023 to December of 2027. It would also authorize additional  discretionary spending for the construction of the 8,600-acre-feet  water storage dam that the United States Government promised to deliver  in the settlement.   To guarantee that we are not reopening this settlement yet again,  this bill includes language that deems the settlement complete once the  funds are expended. It would also require that any unspent funds be  returned to the U.S. Treasury.   In addition, at my request, the bill would require annual reports to  Congress detailing implementation progress and cost accounting for the  settlement.   Lastly, the bill before us today does not include new mandatory  spending, a positive change from previous versions of the legislation.   Unfortunately, when this bill was heard at the Water, Oceans, and  Wildlife Subcommittee, the Biden administration did not make a witness  available to answer any questions about the legislation at that  hearing. To make matters worse, it was never marked up in the Natural  Resources Committee.   Not only should this bill have gone through regular order, but we  need to look at improving the congressional process for considering  Indian water rights settlements. That starts with more transparency  about what is being proposed.   For example, if Congress authorizes taxpayer funds, the  administration needs to explain why the settlement represents a net  benefit to the taxpayer, and a witness from the administration needs to  be able to explain the rationale for the administration's conclusions.  There needs to be regular order, not a rush to consider a bill by both  Chambers in the ending days of Congress.   Despite my reservations about this bill's process--or lack thereof--I  join my colleagues from Arizona to bring finality to this issue for the  White Mount Apache Tribe and the non-Indian water users who depend on  concluding this settlement once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise again in qualified support of the Colorado River  Indian Tribes Water Resiliency Act. This bill would authorize the  Colorado River Indian Tribes, or CRIT, to enter into agreements with  non-Indian water users to lease, exchange, or store a portion of its  decreed water rights in Arizona.   At a time when Arizona and the West are facing historic drought and  water supply cutbacks, this bill could actually provide some near-term  relief to those in desperate need of water.   In Arizona, for example, agricultural and other water deliveries from  the Colorado River have been reduced. The farmers who feed America are  staring at a bleak water future as a result.   This bill is not a cure-all, but it could help facilitate water  transactions between the Colorado River Indian Tribes and Indian and  non-Indian communities in Arizona increasing availability of water at  no cost to the Federal Government.   Again, it is unfortunate that despite the legislation's potential  benefits, it has not gone through regular order. In fact, this bill was  never introduced in the House of Representatives, and the Natural  Resources Committee did not have an opportunity to discuss the merits  of this legislation or offer amendments at markup. Congress can do  better than this, and the House fully intends to do so in the next  Congress under a Republican watch.   Nevertheless, this no-Federal-cost legislation aims to give the  Colorado River Indian Tribes parity with the authorities granted to  Tribes under various other Indian water rights settlements in Arizona.                                time  1545    Mr. Speaker, despite my reservations over the lack of process on this  measure, I join with my Republican and Democrat colleagues from  Arizona, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3773 would amend current law to authorize the  Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation to lease their land  held in trust for a term of up to 99 years.   Since 1834, land transactions with Native Americans have been  prohibited unless specifically authorized by Congress. This has  continued to apply to lands held in trust by the United States for the  benefit of individual Indians or Tribes.   In 1955, Congress authorized that any Indian lands held in trust or  land subject to a restriction against alienation could be leased by the  Indian owner, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior  for terms of 10 or 25 years.   Today the 10- or 25-year lease length can be a challenge, especially  when Tribes want to engage in economic endeavors requiring longer lease  periods.   To date, Congress has authorized specific Indian land or Indian  Tribes to lease land, subject to approval of the Secretary, for a term  of up to 99 years more than 50 times. This bill would provide the same  authority for the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation,  authorizing the Tribe to lease its trust land for terms up to 99 years.   Granting this authority will allow the Tribe to develop multiple  warehouse facilities on the trust lands to support American supply  chain infrastructure and generate economic opportunity for the Tribal  community.   While I fully support the policy contained in S. 3773, I must, again,  voice my frustration with the way in which the majority is considering  these bills here today just days before Christmas.   This is not how we should be conducting our business in the House.  Though I am frustrated with the process by which this bill came before  us today, I am glad that it hasn't been buried in the omnibus with no  discussions. I can say that about all these authorization bills that we  are considering today. If there is a silver lining, it is that these  haven't been buried into an omnibus--a 4,000-page-plus omnibus.   Mr. Speaker, I am supportive of the underlying legislation before us,  I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, rise in qualified support of the Hualapai  Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act. This bill would settle the Hualapai  Tribe's last water rights claims in Arizona pertaining to the Colorado  River Basin and the Verde River Basin. The first settlement, which only  focused on the Bill Williams River Basin, was completed in 2014.   Unlike the settlements passed in 2010, which often promised to  construct a specific water project for the Tribe to develop its water  rights, this is a fund-based legal settlement meant to provide finality  for all supplement parties. This would allow the Tribe to make its own  decisions regarding how, when, and where to develop water  infrastructure on its Reservation.   I have personally visited the Tribe and have seen firsthand how  important this settlement is to the Hualapai.   Unfortunately, the process by which this bill has moved through  Congress has been flawed from the beginning. During the Natural  Resources Committee's consideration, the Biden administration failed to  provide a witness with any knowledge of the settlement. Instead, it  submitted written testimony which afforded our members no opportunity  to engage in a discussion of the merits or concerns of the bill before  us today.   That hearing was as far as the bill went, as the majority chose not  to mark up the bill thereafter. Instead, we are considering a Senate  bill that was not even sent to the House with a bill report explaining  the reasons for changes the Senate made to the bill.   While the bill lacks a report to provide a legislative history, I am  pleased that the bill was amended to no longer include mandatory  funding, which addresses a principal concern of mine.   With respect to the legislative process, Congress can do better than  this, and the soon-to-be Republican majority will provide a more robust  process to consider these types of settlements, especially legislation  that authorizes Federal expenditures.   Congress needs to have answers from the administration on whether  expenditures will eliminate Federal legal and economic liability and  whether the proposed funding represents a net benefit to the American  taxpayer. Instead, at a hearing on this bill, the committee had a  ``Weekend at Bernie's'' moment, having been presented with scripted  testimony by a witness unable to answer any questions.   It is Congress' responsibility to ensure that any Indian water right  settlement that we enact provides finality for the Tribe, the State of  Arizona, the water and power users, and the American taxpayers.   While the process by which this bill came before us today was deeply  flawed, this bill seeks to provide the finality that should be expected  from such legislation.   Despite my reservations over the process, or lack thereof, I join  with my Republican and Democrat colleagues from Arizona to urge  adoption of this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with  Senator Sinema on important issues like these.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the Don Young Recognition Act honors the legacy of the  late dean of the House, who passed away in March of this year after  serving the people of Alaska in Congress for 49 years.   This bill, led by Senators Murkowski and Sullivan of Alaska, would  designate one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands as  Mount Young.   This bill would also rename two Federal buildings in Alaska in his  honor, the one in Fairbanks as the Don Young Federal Office Building  and the one in Palmer as the Don Young Alaska Job Corps Center.   For those of us who were fortunate enough to count Don Young as a  friend and colleague, there could be no more fitting tribute to the  powerful dean of the House and former chairman of the Committee on  Natural Resources than to rename an active volcano in his honor. Much  like a volcano, Don Young was an active and fiery public servant and  advocate for the great State of Alaska.   He was a brilliant legislator and a leader who delivered landmark  legislation, including the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and  Management Act, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, and the  America Needs Worthwhile Resources Act.   The excellent work he did in his nearly 50 years in Congress  benefited not only the people of Alaska but our Nation as a whole.   It was an honor to serve with Don Young, and I was proud to consider  him a mentor and dear friend. His breadth of experience, his  leadership, and his colorful stories are sorely missed.   He left behind a legacy unlike any other, and it is fitting that we  honor him with passage of this bill today.   I support this bill and someday hope to visit Mount Young and reflect  on my friend's service to Alaska and America.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 5087 would extend by an additional 18 months the  sunset of the Department of the Interior and the Department of  Justice's Joint Commission on Reducing Violent Crime Against Indians.   It would also extend by 18 months the time available for the  commission to submit its findings and recommendations to Congress, the  Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney General.   This bill would clarify that the commission may accept and use gifts  or donations of services or property from Indian Tribes, Tribal  entities, academic institutions, or other not-for-profit organizations,  as needed, to carry out its duties.   Signed into law on October 10, 2020, the Not Invisible Act of 2019  was intended to coordinate efforts to reduce violent crime within  Indian lands and against Indians. The act required the Department of  the Interior to designate a Bureau of Indian Affairs official to  coordinate Federal prevention efforts, grants, and programs related to  cases of Indians that were missing, murdered, or victims of human  trafficking.   The act required the Department of the Interior and the Department of  [[Page H9955]]  Justice to establish a joint commission on violent crime on Indian  lands and against Indians.   Within 18 months of enactment, the commission was required to develop  and make publicly available recommendations to the Secretary of the  Interior, the Attorney General, and Congress on actions the Federal  Government can take to combat violent crime against Indians and on  Indian lands, including recommendations for identifying, reporting, and  responding to instances of missing persons, murder, and human  trafficking.   The Department of the Interior has reported that the commission was  not fully established until April 2022 and has requested additional  time to do its work.   While I believe the findings and recommendations of the commission  are warranted, I am disappointed in the process for this legislation.   S. 5087 has no House companion bill, and Democrats failed to conduct  regular order for this legislation before bringing it to the floor of  the House.   The authorization for the commission expired in October, yet this  majority failed to prioritize extension of this authorization to  address this important issue.   Instead, we are here just days before the end of the 117th Congress,  rushing this and other issues off the floor of the House and to the  President for his signature.   While I support the goals of this legislation, this is not how we  should be conducting our business in the House.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
