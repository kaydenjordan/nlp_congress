 Mr. Speaker, staff are the backbone of this institution.  In fact, the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, over  the course of the last few weeks, has had hearings specifically related  to how this institution can recruit, retain, and have more diverse  staffs.   The staffs who work in Congress are dedicated public servants who are  here because they want to do meaningful work for our country. Today, I  want to rise to say thank you to some very talented and very special  staffers who were instrumental to the success of the Select Committee  on the Modernization of Congress in the 116th Congress: Allie Neill,  Jake Olson, Danielle Stewart, Mariah Harding, and SoRelle Gaynor.   As chair of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, I  was fortunate to have Ms. Neill and Mr. Olson at the helm leading our  staff and guiding our members through an incredibly productive 2 years.  Their dedication to our bipartisan mission along with their  institutional expertise was critical to the committee's success. To  their credit, when they came in to do the work of our committee, they  weren't wearing red jerseys or blue jerseys. They were wearing jerseys  that said: Let's try to make Congress work better for the American  people.   On top of that, Ms. Stewart did an extraordinary job of amplifying  the work of our committee and sharing it with the American people. Ms.  Harding handled the critical behind-the-scenes work like a pro. Under  Ms. Gaynor's direction the committee produced an outstanding final  report for the 116th Congress.   These staffers exemplify public service at its finest, and I want to  rise today to thank them for their contributions.                            ____________________
