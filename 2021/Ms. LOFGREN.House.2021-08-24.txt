 Madam Speaker, I support the John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act.   Congress first passed the Voting Rights Act while Martin Luther King,  Jr. led for civil rights and John Lewis stood by his side. The law made  a difference, defeating racial discrimination in voting.   But the Court, in the Shelby and Brnovich cases, destroyed important  parts of the law. This bill fixes that. With an updated coverage  formula, practice-based preclearance, and rational standards to  challenge racial discrimination, this bill is essential.   Representatives Butterfield and Fudge both chaired the Subcommittee  on Elections, whose hearings established the factual bases for this  bill. All the members of the Subcommittee on Elections worked hard  holding hearings around America. I thank them, and I thank my  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for their work.   As we vote to restore the Voting Rights Act, to protect the rights of  Americans from being denied the right to vote because of their race, we  should remember, honor, and thank those who came before us, and  especially our late colleague, John Lewis.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.
