 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 25) authorizing the use of  Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center for a ceremony as part  of the commemoration of the days of remembrance of victims of the  Holocaust.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 25         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring),       SECTION 1. USE OF EMANCIPATION HALL FOR A CEREMONY AS PART OF                     THE COMMEMORATION OF THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE OF                     VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST.         (a) Authorization.--Emancipation Hall in the Capitol       Visitor Center is authorized to be used on April 20, 2023,       for a ceremony as part of the commemoration of the days of       remembrance of victims of the Holocaust.        (b) Preparations.--Physical preparations for the ceremony       described in subsection (a) shall be carried out in       accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the       Capitol may prescribe.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Every year, the United States joins the world in observing days of  remembrance in connection with victims of the Holocaust.   The United States Holocaust Museum has organized and led the national  Days of Remembrance ceremony in the United States Capitol since 1982.  This event brings together Holocaust survivors, liberators, Members of  Congress, White House officials, and community leaders.   As with previous years, the Museum is again requesting access to  utilize the House's Emancipation Hall.   Today, the House will consider a resolution led by my colleague,  Congressman   David Kustoff, that authorizes the use of Emancipation  Hall for a ceremony on April 20.   As part of the Days of Remembrance of victims of the Holocaust, their  planned programming in our Halls will be dedicated to the millions of  voices, hopes, and dreams that were silenced by Nazi Germany.   Their programming will reflect the struggle to retain dignity and  humanity in the face of unimaginable terror and violence. It will also  highlight their stories of defiance, resistance, resilience, that  remind us of what is possible in moments of unfathomable crisis.  [[Page H1315]]    I hope that today we can unanimously pass this legislation and  approve their use of the Emancipation Hall.   I commend the continuous efforts of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial  Museum, and I can think of no better space to honor the lives lost and  the battles fought than here in the people's House. We must never  forget.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would note to my colleague and the ranking  member on the Committee on House Administration, Mr. Morelle, I  appreciate his work on this.   In regards to the question why we are bringing this to the floor for  a vote, I think it is just a moment in time to reflect on the  importance of the issue at hand and to really appreciate and understand  the horrors that occurred during the Holocaust.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague, the ranking  member. As we see a rise in anti-Semitism, now is the time to remember  how that can take us in this world down a dark path, and no darker path  than the Holocaust.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. D'Esposito).    Mr. Speaker, I urge strong bipartisan and unanimous  support for H. Con. Res. 25 today on the House floor, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
