 Mr. Speaker, I thank the dean, Mr. Calvert, and my  colleagues from California for their kind words. I am so very proud and  appreciative of my friends for coming.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the constituents for giving me this opportunity  to serve them. To America, I loved every single day.   Less than 13,000 people have ever been given the privilege or the  honor to serve in this body.   To those colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I thank them for  the work they have done. We may disagree at times--I disagreed with the  vote on this one, too, but one thing I think we must quite understand  and the advice I can give is, do not be fearful if you believe your  philosophy brings people more freedom. Do not be fearful that you could  lose your job over it.   I knew the day we decided to make sure to choose to pay our troops,  while war was breaking out, instead of shutting down, was the right  decision. I also knew a few would make a motion because somehow they  disagreed with that decision. Do it anyway. I would do it all again.   However, there is so much we were able to accomplish in a short  amount of time. I watched a short clip the other day of a quote of  mine: ``I had the privilege of being leader for 5 years and I think  about did I leave this place better than I received it?''   I remember sitting where Congressman Calvert was and it was the state  of the Union. The Democrats had won the majority. I was elected  minority leader while another colleague from my State, Nancy Pelosi,  was elected Speaker.   I watched the Democrats stand up and they were very diverse. They  looked like America. I watched us stand up. We had lost the majority. I  say we looked like one of the most restricted country clubs in America.  I thought at that moment I could be the leader of a declining party, or  I could focus on what I know brought me to this party: Conceived in  liberty and dedicated to the proposition that we are all equal.   I would take that message to places people didn't think they would  vote for a Republican. The California delegation at that time was  pretty small, and, yes, it was competitive having the Speaker from  California. She would put out that she was going to win a lot more  seats in California. However, I am proud to say in those election  cycles, we picked up five more seats in California. That is larger than  our overall majority. We picked up five more in New York, Oregon, and  Arizona. And in that same timeframe, the party I loved lost in the  Senate, both cycles, lost the Presidency, but we won. What is the  secret? It is the quality of the candidate.   I looked at Young Kim, Michelle Steel,  John Duarte, and  David  Valadao. These are unbelievable seats that that idea wins in. I look at  our party today and it doesn't look like it did 5 years ago. We were  winning in places you haven't seen before. When I look to the future, I  think it is much brighter. Why? Because the ideas are different.   When you look at the time I served as Speaker, we didn't ignore the  border. We actually secured our border with the smallest majority here  to govern. Even when we had a large one, we could not do it, and that  came from the subcommittee of the Chairman   Tom McClintock. We brought  people from all sides of the aisle together.   When I watch the gas prices just skyrocket under the Biden  administration, we didn't sit back. We made it our number one priority  and passed energy independence.   The public sits above, but for those 4 years, they didn't get to. We  opened this place back up because it is the people's House. We created  the select committee on China to make sure America can be competitive.  We put our accountability on the weaponization so the American citizen  would be protected.   We made the largest cut in American history, and this body voted for  it, welfare reform to get people back to work, and the largest  recissions in American history, where money was appropriated, not used.  Only in Washington would you let it still be there.   As we watched crime rise across the country and D.C. want to go the  same way, first time in 30 years, this body stood up; 170 on the other  side of the aisle thought you should decriminalize carjacking, and  others. The President threatened to veto it, but we did it anyway. We  stopped him; and it became law.   We believe in building things in America, but we watched many times  the laws we thought that were passed before to protect us only slowed  us and weakened us. For the first time in 40 years, we reformed NEPA.   We did all this with a slim majority, but what I am most proud of is  what the future holds. The legacy will be about the ones I see who  serve here now, and I know the potential of what they will do. I know  the potential of this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I am so thankful to be given the opportunity to serve. I  will  [[Page H6972]]  be departing, but that doesn't mean I will stop serving. Those across  this Nation should join together to become those citizen legislators.  We cannot let this body fail to do the jobs that are the most basic  that we should do every day. We should never allow this body to stop  doing what is right.                                time  1215    If you come across that question of whether you should do what is  right out of fear of losing your job, do it anyway because it is the  right thing to do, and this is what the Nation requires. I think  putting people before politics is always the right answer.   I thank my friends for their kind words. I thank them for their  friendship that will not end, and I thank this Nation for creating a  body that is represented by the people. I think we should rise to the  occasion one more time. Thank you.
