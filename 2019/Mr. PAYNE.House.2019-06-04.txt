 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Islamic holy  month of Ramadan and the holiday of Eid al-Fitr.   For the past month, Muslims in the United States and around the world  have heightened their spiritual awareness through self-restraint,  reflection, and fasting.   Sundown today marks the end of Eid al-Fitr, or the festival of  breaking the fast. Eid is a major holiday filled with celebration and  festivities for Muslims.   I am honored to represent a religiously diverse district. New  Jersey's 10th Congressional District is a remarkable and vibrant  community filled with people of all faiths.   Across the country, we have seen the rising tide of discrimination  and hate aimed at religious minorities. Just last month, during the  middle of Ramadan, an arsonist burned down a mosque in Connecticut. But  hate will not break the American spirit.   We are made stronger as a people because we are free to live and  worship openly.   So on this holy day of Eid, let us come together as a Nation and  celebrate our diversity.   Eid Mubarak.                            ____________________
