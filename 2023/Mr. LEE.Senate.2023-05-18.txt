 Mr. President, today I rise to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Nancy Abudu to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Eleventh Circuit. Ms. Abudu may well be the most radical judicial  nominee nominated to date by President Biden.   I have had concerns with Ms. Abudu's radical views and her apparent  lack of respect for the rules of the court ever since her nomination.  During her confirmation hearing, I asked her about allegations of  potential judge shopping raised by Judge Burke of the U.S. District  Court for the Northern District of Alabama in a series of cases brought  by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a result of troubling attorney  conduct.   In this series of cases, the three Federal district courts in Alabama  took the extraordinary and joint measure of convening to hear concerns  raised by Judge Burke that Ms. Abudu's litigation team and their  cocouncil brazenly abused the judicial process.   Ms. Abudu is, to be clear, the Director of Strategic Litigation for  the Southern Poverty Law Center. And strategic litigation is what they  do. That is what they are about. She is the director of this division.   When I asked her about her strategic litigation decisions in this  series of cases, she stated:         As Director of Strategic Litigation, my responsibility is       to oversee and provide general management for our cases, but       it is the subject matter experts in the litigation team that       handle the day-to-day, including the filing of complaints,       the briefing, and any oral arguments.    In response to my questioning, she refused to be forthright. She  didn't deny her oversight of these cases. She simply refused to admit  that she was responsible for the strategic decisions the three Alabama  Federal district courts found so troubling.   Her lack of candor and her apparent disregard for the protections  built into our legal system disqualify her for a position on the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.   As I asked her about these--about these cases--pointing out only that  the day-to-day litigation management was handled by other attorneys-- which was obvious--she was openly, directly avoiding a direct line of  inquiry, a line of inquiry that was very relevant to her nomination, to  her confirmation process.   But, unfortunately, my concerns with Ms. Abudu's nomination do not  end--and they didn't begin--with this troubling series of cases that I  just described. You see, the attorneys general in every single State of  the Eleventh Circuit--who are joined, by the way, by the attorneys  general in a number of other States--but every single attorney general  serving within the Eleventh Circuit is part of this letter articulating  concerns and confirming that there are grave dangers in confirming Ms.  Abudu to the Eleventh Circuit.   These attorneys general, along with attorneys general from 15  additional States, including my home State of Utah, recently sent a  letter to the leadership of this body expressing their numerous  concerns with Ms. Abudu's nomination.   The attorneys general of the people who would be subject to coming  before Ms. Abudu in Federal cases are justifiably worried about her  potential confirmation today. These are people who really need to be  able to have the confidence that when appearing before Judge Abudu, she  will not only respect the law, but that she will handle their cases  without any preconceived biases--biases that could lead her off course  as she administers justice in her courtroom. If anyone has preconceived  notions, biases regarding how justice ought to be administered such  that litigants could come to the conclusion that they won't get a fair  shake in front of that judge--not to mention the preconceived  prejudices against the good people living in the Eleventh Circuit--Ms.  Abudu has certainly demonstrated that she does.   Ms. Abudu is a longtime and current member and past leader of an  entity called the National Lawyers Guild. This group identifies itself  as consisting of a radical movement of legal activists--their words,  not mine. After violent protests against Atlanta police officers, the  National Lawyers Guild declared that ``policing is the true threat to  our collective safety.''   Imagine that. It is not crime, it is not other problems that police  deal with; it is the police themselves policing--the act of policing.   They didn't say specific police officers who may, unlike most  officers, not be doing their jobs right. They said policing--policing  itself--is the true threat to our collective safety.   Imagine that.   I agree with these attorneys general that Ms. Abudu's longstanding  and ongoing association with this radical anti-police group is, alone,  grounds for refusing, rejecting her nomination.   I find it very troubling indeed that those who would be subject to  having to come before Ms. Abudu find her track record dishonest and  divisive. Let me quote from the letter outlining their concerns:         We are familiar with Ms. Abudu's work and her willingness       to demonize those with whom she disagrees, and we know well       the importance of the seat on the Eleventh Circuit that she       would fill. Ms. Abudu has proven herself unfit for that role.       She has compared her fellow Americans to Jim-Crow-era       racists. She has aligned herself with self-proclaimed       ``radical movement legal activists'' who view ``policing'' as       ``the true threat to our collective safety.''    And the quote continues:         And she has proclaimed that our criminal justice system is       ``practically the same system as during slavery.'' These       spurious and outrageous statements vividly demonstrate that       she lacks the judgment, fair-mindedness, and integrity       required of a Federal judge.    Now, to be clear, Ms. Abudu chose to associate herself with the  Southern Poverty Law Center, which is itself well known for leveling  unfounded  [[Page S1734]]  charges of ``hate'' against any person or any group with which that  organization happens to disagree.   She became a leader in that organization and fully embraced its  deplorable tactics, which are not intended to foster debate and  understanding but rather to silence opposition.   They are well known for publishing things. Their hate list has  brought about hate. It led to a shooting in Washington, DC, of an  entity here. Someone got shot after believing that the Southern Poverty  Law Center had indicated that that was the appropriate action.   She has made offensive and baseless assertions against the people in  the Eleventh Circuit. Now I want to quote some more from the Attorneys  General letter:         Since becoming a leader [of the Southern Poverty Law       Center], Ms. Abudu has engaged in [the] deplorable tactics       [beloved by that organization] by disparaging those in her       way, including each of the three States within the       jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. For       example, she and her team submitted a ``Report'' to Congress       about Alabama's supposed ``unyielding record of racial       discrimination in voting.'' The Alabama Attorney General's       Office set the record straight in a follow-up report that       went claim-by-claim, documenting the SPLC's many       misrepresentations.    The quote continues:         Each misrepresentation served the overarching theme of Ms.       Abudu's report--that any disagreement over policy is proof       that her political opponents are evil. Indeed, according to       Ms. Abudu, things in Alabama are the same or worse today than       they were in 1965. As she tells it, Alabama's goal--today--is       to--    Now, these are her words--         ``establish white supremacy in this State.''    The letter continues:         While some might see room for good faith debate, for       example, about the merits of Alabama's voter identification       law, (which was upheld by the Eleventh Circuit)--    The Court on which she has been nominated to serve--         Ms. Abudu sees only a ``relentless commitment to finding       new ways to keep . . . Alabamians from making their voices       heard,'' all . . . part of a desperate attempt ``to       perpetuate majority white control.''    Her words, not mine.   The letter concludes:         These assertions are as offensive as they are baseless, and       they are disqualifying for an aspiring Federal judge.    To quote one more time from the letter, another part of the letter  says:         Though Ms. Abudu is surely aware of [the] facts, she       prefers to use her powerful position at [the Southern Poverty       Law Center] to sow division and erode trust among Americans--      declaring that ``Jim Crow is still alive and well [in the       South].'' But as the Supreme Court has recognized (and as any       fair-minded person knows): ``Things have changed in the       South.'' Ms. Abudu's contrary contention doesn't show simple       professional disagreement. It shows, at best, insuperable       bias. It more likely shows dishonesty. And it certainly shows       unfitness for judicial office.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from these  Attorneys General be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   State of Alabama,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                                     March 22, 2023.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       On behalf of the State of Alabama and other concerned States,       we write to warn you of the dishonest and divisive track       record of Nancy Abudu, who President Biden has nominated to       be a United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit       Court of Appeals. We are familiar with Ms. Abudu's work and       her willingness to demonize those with whom she disagrees,       and we know well the importance of the seat on the Eleventh       Circuit that she would fill. Ms. Abudu has proven herself       unfit for that role. She has compared her fellow Americans to       Jim-Crow-era racists. She has aligned herself with self-      proclaimed ``radical movement legal activists'' who view       ``policing'' as ``the true threat to our collective safety.''       And she has proclaimed that our criminal justice system is       ``practically the same system as during slavery.'' These       spurious and outrageous statements vividly demonstrate that       she lacks the judgment, fair-mindedness, and integrity       required of a federal judge. Her nomination should be       rejected.        As you know, Ms. Abudu has been the Director of Strategic       Litigation for the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center       since 2019. The SPLC is infamous for leveling unfounded       charges of ``hate'' against political opponents.        Since becoming a leader in that organization, Ms. Abudu has       engaged in those same deplorable tactics by disparaging those       in her way, including each of the three States within the       jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. For       example, she and her team submitted a ``Report'' to Congress       about Alabama's supposed ``unyielding record of racial       discrimination in voting.'' The Alabama Attorney General's       Office set the record straight in a follow-up report that       went claim-by-claim, documenting the SPLC's many       misrepresentations. Each misrepresentation served the       overarching theme of Ms. Abudu's report--that any       disagreement over policy is proof that her political       opponents are evil. Indeed, according to Ms. Abudu, things in       Alabama are the same or worse today than they were in 1965.       As she tells it, Alabama's goal--today--is to ``establish       white supremacy in this State.'' While some might see room       for good faith debate, for example, about the merits of       Alabama's voter identification law (which was upheld by the       Eleventh Circuit), Ms. Abudu sees only a ``relentless       commitment to finding new ways to keep Black Alabamians from       making their voices heard,'' all as part of a desperate       attempt ``to perpetuate majority white control.''        These assertions are as offensive as they are baseless, and       they are disqualifying for an aspiring federal judge. For       decades, black and white voter registration and turnout in       Alabama has been at or near parity. In 2018, Alabama had the       second highest black voter registration rate in the entire       country.'' Though Ms. Abudu is surely aware of these facts,       she prefers to use her powerful position at SPLC to sow       division and erode trust among Americans--declaring that       ``Jim Crow is still alive and well.'' But as the Supreme       Court has recognized (and as any fair-minded person       knows): ``Things have changed in the South.'' Ms. Abudu's       contrary contention doesn't show simple professional       disagreement. It shows, at best, insuperable bias. It more       likely shows dishonesty. And it certainly shows unfitness       for judicial office.        Ms. Abudu has a similar track record of misstatements when       it comes to Florida. She baselessly accused Governor DeSantis       of ``digging in his heels to ensure poor people in his state       are blocked from voting'' and suggested that Florida is       engaged in a ``war to strip poor and low-income people of all       political power.''        She has also demonstrated marked hostility to the State of       Georgia and especially its law enforcement officers. Without       evidence, she has asserted that Georgia has a ``culture of       law enforcement that still targets Black and Brown people.''       She has derided the entire State, claiming that ``Georgia       continues to be a bad actor,'' and that the state legislature       ``is committed to keeping us in the past and that is scary.''       How could Ms. Abudu impartially adjudicate the many Eleventh       Circuit cases involving Georgia, its statutes, its citizens,       and especially its law enforcement officers, when she already       believes that the State is a ``bad actor'' with a ``culture       of law enforcement'' that ``targets Black and Brown people''?        It's also important to recognize that Ms. Abudu attempted       to leverage misrepresentations and invective to affect this       Chamber's vote on legislation. She derided the supposed       ``anti-voter legislatures . . . in the Deep South'' as       justification for a federal overhaul of State elections. She       even insisted on ``abolishing the filibuster'' to accomplish       her goal, referring to it as ``a legislative tool popular       with pro-Jim Crow senators of the past.'' Fortunately, the       Senate saw through this divisive narrative. But if the Senate       confirms Ms. Abudu to a seat on the Eleventh Circuit Court of       Appeals, she will be empowered to press her radical agenda       from a position of power checked only by the occasional       review of the United States Supreme Court. This Chamber must       not reward her behavior with a lifetime appointment to a seat       where she would decide appeals in important cases involving       the very States she says are irredeemably trapped in 1965.        The SPLC's unethical conduct goes beyond Ms. Abudu's       misrepresentations to this body. Several SPLC attorneys are       currently being investigated by a three-judge federal       district court for attempts to circumvent court rules by       filing and then re-filing litigation against the State of       Alabama. Ms. Abudu protests that she ``was not involved'' in       the conduct under investigation but that's hard to square       with her job directing the SPLC's strategic litigation,       including her self-described role of ``the review and       approval of litigation requests.'' Even if it's true that       Ms. Abudu wasn't involved in the decision to try to       circumvent federal court rules, this conduct occurred on       her watch, which raises further questions about her       judgment.        More recently, another SPLC attorney--presumably someone       under Ms. Abudu's supervision in her role as Director of       Strategic Litigation--was arrested and charged with domestic       terrorism in relation to violent ``protests'' related to       police facilities in Atlanta. The arrested attorney worked in       the same office that Ms. Abudu lists as her work address. In       response to the arrest, the SPLC tacitly approved its       employee's alleged terrorism, choosing instead to put out a       joint statement with the radical National Lawyers Guild       criticizing the supposed ``heavy-handed law enforcement       intervention against protesters.'' It's not clear whether Ms.       Abudu was involved with that attorney or the SPLC's response       to his arrest, but the SPLC's response shows the culture of       its office and its attitude toward the rule of law and law       enforcement.  [[Page S1735]]         Ms. Abudu's status as a current member and past leader of       the National Lawyers Guild is similarly troubling. The NLG is       a self-described group of ``radical movement legal       activists.'' And in response to violent protests against the       Atlanta police facilities mentioned above, NLG declared that       ``policing is the true threat to our collective safety.'' Ms.       Abudu's longstanding and ongoing association with this       radical, anti-police group is yet another ground for       rejecting her nomination.        It would be hard to overstate the importance of federal       circuit courts of appeals. Nearly every federal appeal ends       at the circuit court. Attorneys in our offices regularly       practice before these courts, and we have great respect for       these judges who dedicate their lives to the rule of law and       to ensuring that all litigants before them are fairly heard.        Ms. Abudu's dishonest and divisive record shows that she       would not be such a judge. She is an activist. She has       repeatedly used misrepresentations and hateful rhetoric to       advance her political goals. And she has thus shown herself       unfit for this lifetime appointment. Because our judiciary       needs jurists who will uphold the rule of law, not ``radical       movement legal activists'' in robes, the Senate should reject       Ms. Abudu's nomination.            Sincerely,        Steve Marshall, Alabama Attorney General; Tim Griffin,       Arkansas Attorney General; Chris Carr, Georgia Attorney       General; Todd Rokita, Indiana Attorney General; Daniel       Cameron, Kentucky Attorney General; Lynn Fitch, Mississippi       Attorney General; Ashley Moody, Florida Attorney General;       Raul Labrador, Idaho Attorney General; Brenna Bird, Attorney       General of Iowa; Jeff Landry, Louisiana Attorney General;       Andrew Bailey, Missouri Attorney General; Mike Hilgers,       Nebraska Attorney General; Austin Knudsen, Montana Attorney       General; Dave Yost, Ohio Attorney General; Ken Paxton,       Attorney General of Texas; Alan Wilson, South Carolina       Attorney General; Sean D. Reyes, Utah Attorney General;       Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia Attorney General.     She has shown marked hostility toward Alabamians,  Floridians, and Georgians. She has accused them of suppressing  minorities and poor people from voting. She has accused their police  officers of targeting minorities, and all throughout her accusations is  the threat of racism. It animates her every action, her every assault,  her every view.   She accuses Georgia of being ``committed to keeping us in the past  and that is scary.''   As the Attorneys General appropriately ask, ``How could Ms. Abudu  impartially adjudicate the many Eleventh Circuit cases involving  Georgia, its statutes, its citizens, and especially its law enforcement  officers, when she already believes the State is a `bad actor' with a  `culture of law enforcement' that `targets Black and Brown people'?''   There again, they are quoting her words. Ms. Abudu's record of  hostility toward the people and the laws of the Eleventh Circuit is  nothing short of alarming. When you combine that hostility with her  lack of respect for the judicial system and her ongoing commitment to a  group of self-described ``radical movement legal activists,'' I simply  don't know how any Member of this body can still believe she will serve  the people of the Eleventh Circuit or, even less, our judicial system  well.   But the only way one can justify voting for this nominee is if one  agrees with her hostile views and is comfortable with her activist  approach. I am not, and I oppose her nomination in the strongest  possible terms.
