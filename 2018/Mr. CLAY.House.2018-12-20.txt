 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2652 and its House companion  sponsored by my friend, Representative Cedric Richmond, which awards a  Congressional Gold Medal to Stephen Michael Gleason, whose tireless  work for people living with ALS should be honored.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), the sponsor of the House  version of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have no football team in St. Louis, but we do have the Kansas City  Chiefs, who are doing pretty well.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge Members to vote for  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is taking up S. 2765, a bill  that shows once again that Democrats support investment, job creation,  and the development of wealth in rural areas.   The bill is simple. It extends the exemption from registration in the  Dodd-Frank Act to certain advisers to small private funds known as  Rural Business Investment Companies, which are regulated by the USDA  and are required to provide significant financing to rural area small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
