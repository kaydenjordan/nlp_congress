 Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House passed H.R. 8, the  Water Resources Development Act, which I proudly voted for.   I want to lend my voice in support of this bill and its importance to  the State of Maine, which has critical ports and harbors up and down  our coastline.   In particular, I want to call attention to a previously authorized  WRDA program in Saco, Maine, known as Camp Ellis.   This project is considered remediation from a jetty that was built in  the late 1800s by the Army Corps of Engineers.   The jetty has caused erosion and receding coastline that year by year  and storm by storm has already washed out the ground from nearly 40  homes in the past 50 years.   The Army Corps and local community have been working for years on  getting this project off the ground, and we are finally seeing some  progress.   In the past year, there has been new energy around this, and I want  to commend all the parties for their persistence and determination in  getting this done.   A new WRDA can provide critical support for the storm-ravaged  residents of Camp Ellis and help them rebuild.   As H.R. 8 and the other legislation moves from the House to the other  body, I will continue to work with our chair, ranking member, and  colleagues from Maine and the other body to get this accomplished.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for  yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule for H.R. 3 as  well as the underlying bill. As a member of the House Appropriations  Committee, I do not believe we should be retroactively taking back  already approved funding to pay for tax cuts to corporations.   There are countless ludicrous provisions in this bill to cut rural  housing, conservation, and other programs that support communities,  farmers, and those in need. I would like to focus on one provision in  H.R. 3 that is particularly upsetting because it would rescind over $14  million from USDA's Value Added Producer Grant program, one of the only  USDA grants that go directly to farmers' pockets.  [[Page H4867]]    Let me be absolutely clear. Despite what the administration has said,  these are funds that farmers have already applied for. Those  applications were already under review by the USDA when the rescission  package was introduced. Projects are ready to go and jobs are waiting  to be created with this funding.   It makes me very angry to see that the administration's rescission  proposal describes these grants as wasteful and specifically identifies  a chocolate-covered peanut project as an example of alleged wasteful  spending.   This is not about chocolate-covered peanuts. This is about helping  farmers diversify their businesses and providing consumers with new  products on which they are willing to spend a little extra.   Farmers are facing very challenging economic times, and I think we  should be doing everything we can to support farmers in finding new  markets, whether that is by processing milk to make yogurt, making jam  from wild blueberries, or even coating peanuts in chocolate.   Ironically, on the same day that the administration released its  rescission proposal, the USDA's Economic Research Service released a  report on how successful VAPG has been. The report shows that  businesses that receive VAPG funding provide more jobs for their  communities and were less likely to fail than similar nonrecipient  businesses. VAPG works. In Maine and across the country, a little  support to farmers through VAPG can go a long way.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule for H.R. 3 as well as the  underlying bill.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and I  thank my colleague from California for yielding me this time.   Now, every year, we have this battle. It is a battle to simply  recognize the importance of our oceans and ocean planning. We have  already learned about the fact that ocean planning works, and it is  working already in New England and the mid-Atlantic; and instead of  arguing hypotheticals about things that could happen, might happen, we  should talk about the story of what actually happens in regions like  mine where we live and work on the ocean.   The story of National Ocean Policy isn't national at all. It is about  local control, local stakeholders, local input, and local  decisionmaking.  [[Page H4949]]    In Maine, we have some great success stories of fishermen,  lobstermen, Native American Tribes, local communities, and other  stakeholders developing voluntary regional ocean plans. It is a great  story of coordination among varied interests, all with the same goal of  better understanding our oceans, protecting them, and working with them  and in them.                                time  1945    By including those who work on and near the ocean, we are  coordinating ocean activities for efficiency and coordination.   But the language in today's underlying bill would make it even more  difficult for Federal agencies, for State agencies, and for local  communities to work together on the future of our ocean resources.   Mr. Chairman, this rider has no place in this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to strike it.
