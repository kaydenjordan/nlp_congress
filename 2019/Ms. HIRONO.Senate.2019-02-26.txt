 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my  support for the Child Care for Working Families Act, which I was proud  to introduce earlier this afternoon with Senators Murray, Casey, and 30  of our Senate colleagues.   We know that investments in early childhood programs are foundational  for future academic and social success. Yet child care remains  unaffordable for too many working families in the United States.   For parents worried about how to pay for basic living expenses like  housing, food, education, and transportation, increasing child care  costs can place a heavy burden on family budgets.   As a young immigrant from Japan who was raised by a single, working  mother, I understand the difficult decisions families have to make  every day to survive. I have experienced these challenges firsthand.  Yet, all these years later, for many Hawaii families, child care costs  exceed all other expenses besides housing.   On average, Hawaii parents can expect to pay $8,280 per year, or $690  per month, in child care expenses. These costs are 25 percent higher  than they were just a decade ago, but wages have hardly kept pace. As a  result, Hawaii families will dedicate around 11 percent of their family  budget to child care--exceeding the government's standard for  affordable care.   Unfortunately, even for families that can afford child care, finding  that needed care may be difficult. This is because our early childhood  educators and child care workers are overworked and underpaid. In  addition, there is a severe need for more facilities to accommodate the  families that need them. The need is great, and that is why the Child  Care for Working Families Act is so important. This legislation will  make sure working families have access to high-quality, affordable  early childhood programs.   Specifically, the bill expands the existing Child Care and  Development Block Grant program to guarantee that working and middle  class families have access to affordable child care--ensuring that  these families do not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income  toward care, regardless of how many children they have.   The bill also expands Head Start to promote universal preschool for  young children.   Additionally, the bill also addresses the need to support our early  childhood workers by making sure teachers, care givers, and other  workers responsible for our children are fairly-compensated and fully- supported with training and professional development opportunities.   These are the core provisions of the bill, which represents an  essential investment in the stability and prosperity of working  families in Hawaii and across our Nation. Every family deserves access  to high-quality, affordable early childhood programs, and we will  continue fighting to make child care more affordable for all children.   I thank my colleagues for their continued support in this effort, and  urge support for this important legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my  support for the Child Care for Working Families Act, which I was proud  to introduce earlier this afternoon with Senators Murray, Casey, and 30  of our Senate colleagues.
