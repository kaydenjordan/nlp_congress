 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hilda Beatrice  MacFarland.   Hilda was born in National City, California, in 1949. She was a  pioneer and a trailblazing woman in the 1970s when the Mexican-American  community was still relying on demonstration politics.   Hilda worked for Housing and Urban Development, and she managed the  senior citizen building Horton House in San Diego. She was heavily  involved with countless nonprofit organizations where she fought for  the poor, working-class, and elderly rights in the county.   In 1976, Hilda was the first major contributor to La Gloria Infantil  Orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico, and spent her entire life providing  services to the orphanage.  [[Page H507]]    She was a heroic woman who stood up for education and human rights.  She helped her community with the entirety of her heart and soul. With  her strong and genuine spirit, she stood up for the disenfranchised,  the abandoned, and the injured wherever she was.   Hilda was loved by many and influenced so many of us. Her  accomplishments and contributions to the community were profound, and  she will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
