 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up  amendment No. 3414, as modified with the changes that are at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I very much thank Senator Heinrich for  being down here and talking about what this really means. I know  Senator Moran is also on the floor.   Amtrak is designed to connect our communities. Whether we live in  Raton, NM, Dodge City, KS, or Los Angeles, CA, it connects our  communities. I am pleased to offer this amendment with my friends from  Kansas and Colorado because the Southwest Chief connects our  communities, and we will continue to work together to support this  national service.   There is no doubt we will have a strong bipartisan vote to support  our long-distance rail lines. If Amtrak thinks that replacing railcars  with buses will solve its problems, well, that is no way to run a  railroad. I hope Amtrak's leadership appreciates that we will not back  down in our support of our rail network and that we can work together  to find solutions to their problems.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wish to honor the first Tribal college  established in the United States, Dine College, on its 50th  anniversary.   The college was founded in 1968 by the Navajo Nation as Navajo  Community College. That year marked the centennial anniversary of the  Treaty of 1868 in which the Navajo people negotiated return of their  homeland after their forced relocation by the U.S. government on the  brutal ``Long Walk'' to Fort Sumner, NM. In Fort Sumner, they had  endured inhumane conditions for 5 years, and many had perished. The  treaty was an important historical milestone, but it also contained  certain harsh terms, requiring the Navajo people to send their children  to government and missionary schools where they were forced to abandon  their cultural practices and identity. This tragic and brutal practice  by the U.S. Government threatened the survival of Navajo and other  Native American languages and cultures.   Our Nation finally moved away from forced assimilation by the middle  of the last century, and the Navajo Nation took a historic step toward  educational self-determination when it established Navajo Community  College. As the first tribally chartered and operated postsecondary  institution, Navajo Community College's educational philosophy was  grounded in Navajo cultural traditions. Its mission was to support the  social and economic development of the Tribe.   In 1976, the college was the first Tribal 2-year institution to  receive accreditation. In 1998, it awarded its first baccalaureate  degrees under the Dine Teacher Education Program. In 1994, Navajo  Community College joined 29 other Tribal colleges to become a Land  Grant Institution under the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status  Act. In 1997, the board of regents changed its name to Dine College.   The college's educational principles are based on Sa'ah Naaghai  Bik'eh Hozhoon--the Dine traditional living system--which places human  life in harmony with the natural world and universe. Four principles  undergird the education: Nitsahakees or thinking, Nahat'a or planning,  Iina or living, and Sihasin or assuring.   Culturally relevant education makes a tremendous difference for  Native students. The kids are engaged. They stay in school. They gain  access to opportunities that otherwise might be out of reach. Dine  College's curriculum is replete with Navajo language and culture  classes. It awards certificates, associate degrees, and bachelor  degrees in a wide range of fields, from fine arts to environment  science to business administration to elementary and secondary  education, and many more.   With approximately 1,300 students, Dine College is one of the largest  Tribal colleges in the United States. The school's six campuses serve  the 27,000-square-mile Navajo Reservation. Importantly, Dine College  has played a critical role revitalizing Navajo culture and language,  preparing thousands of young adults to contribute to their communities,  States, Tribe, and the U.S. as a whole.   Dine College's legacy, however, reaches far beyond its own students.  What was once an unassuming community college--with an entering  population of 309 students--ignited a nationwide movement of Tribes  founding their own colleges and universities. The network of Tribal  colleges and universities built up over the last half century has made  significant progress helping Native students break down barriers.  Today, 36 Tribal colleges and universities all across the Nation  educate tens of thousands of Native students. These institutions have  been instrumental in attracting and keeping Native students in college  and helping students maintain and grow ties with their cultures,  languages, and traditional values.   I extend my whole-hearted congratulations to Dine College on its 50th  anniversary. I thank the college and Navajo Nation for all the good  they have accomplished over the years, and I wish them the absolute  best in their next five decades.                            ____________________
