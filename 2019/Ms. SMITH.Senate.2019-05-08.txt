 Mr. President, climate change is the existential challenge  of our time. I know this because this is what the science says. I know  this because I have seen the impacts of climate change in my State. I  know this because it is what our children who will live with the  consequences of a changing climate tell us. In a recent poll, half of  Americans age 18 to 29 describe climate change as a ``crisis that  demands urgent action.''   Today I rise to discuss how the clean energy revolution can be the  way we fight climate change and the way we create jobs and opportunity.  Colleagues, in this global challenge, the United States can lead or we  can follow. I want us to lead.   This morning, as a Senator from an agricultural and high-tech State  from the Upper Midwest, I have joined with Representative Ben Ray  Lujan, who represents the great State of New Mexico, a State with  significant oil and gas resources, to introduce the Clean Energy  Standard Act of 2019. Our legislation would dramatically expand clean  electricity and put the United States on a path to net zero greenhouse  gas emissions from the electric sector by the middle of the century,  including a nearly 80-percent reduction in emissions by 2035 compared  to 2005.   Not so long ago, the United States was a global leader in tackling  climate change. President Obama took strong action to remove carbon  emissions from cars. He advanced the Clean Power Plan to significantly  reduce emissions in the electric sector, and he provided the essential  leadership that led to adoption of the international Paris climate  agreement, which commits the countries of the world to collectively  hold global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.   Unfortunately, our current President has moved unilaterally to undo  these actions, as if we can bury our heads in the sand and ignore the  reality that a warming climate threatens our health, it threatens our  financial stability, and it threatens our very existence. I regret to  say it, but for the most part, the Republican-led Congress has gone  along with President Trump as he has ceded U.S. leadership on climate  and clean energy to our competitors.   The result of this? Our global competitors are happy to dominate in  this field. This is, I think, quite interesting. China has more than  twice as much wind power as the United States, and in 2018, China beat  the United States on new wind installations by more than 3 to 1. Half  of all new solar installations in the world last year happened in  China. Here at home, President Trump's policies caused the solar energy  industry to shed 20,000 jobs as the United States lags in fourth place  on installed solar energy.   Fortunately, while Washington wavers, there is a groundswell of  support for the clean energy revolution at the local level. When  President Trump moved against the Paris climate agreement, Americans  responded with the ``We Are Still In'' campaign. Churches, Tribes,  mayors, county executives, and campus leaders led the way. States  followed and took action. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives  pledged and passed legislation to renew our commitment to the Paris  Agreement.   There are now over 100 cities around the country which have committed  to clean or renewable energy. Four States and the District of Columbia  have policies that will get them to net zero emissions by mid-century.  Several more are moving in that direction. In my home State,  Minnesota's Governor, Tim Walz, has a plan for 100 percent carbon-free  electricity by 2050. That bill passed the Minnesota House by a 74-to-59  vote. Minnesota Senate, it is now your turn. To my colleagues in the  Senate, it is our turn as well.   I believe the best ideas come from people working at the local level  to solve problems, and I also think the best ideas that can get done  are those that bring people together across regional differences,  political ideology, and their own life experiences. That is how our  bill, the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2019, came to be. It builds on  what is already working at the local level.   As a clean energy standard, it has a bipartisan history. Back when  Republicans and Democrats were working together on bills to reduce  carbon pollution--all the way back in 2009 through 2012--clean energy  standard bills like this one had both Democratic and Republican  cosponsors. This bill today is supported by labor groups, by  environmental groups, and by utilities--an unlikely but strong  coalition in these days of divisive politics.   The basics of this plan are simple. First, let's start where electric  utilities are and then improve from there. We know many electric  utilities are shifting to renewables and clean energy because it is the  most cost-competitive thing for them to do and because it is what their  customers want, but we also know that each utility is going to start  from a different place in terms of the amount of clean energy it  already sells.   Let's start there. Our bill recognizes these regional differences and  then asks each utility to improve from where they are. One size does  not fit all. On the one hand, States like Idaho and Washington are  blessed with abundant hydropower and already produce over 80 percent of  their electricity from carbon-free sources. On the other hand, four of  our united States get less than 10 percent of their electricity from  carbon-free generation. Our bill asks each utility to start from where  they are and improve from there.   Utilities that start with a low amount of clean energy are asked to  grow quickly, but they slow down as they reach very high levels of net  zero emission electricity. The plan recognizes also that rural co-ops  and municipal utilities face unique challenges, and we accommodate  that.   The second thing about this plan is this: Let's be ambitious. Science  tells us that we need to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by  the second half of this century if we are to avoid the worst  consequences of climate change. We desperately need some can-do  American spirit and ingenuity here, not nay-saying.   This bill is ambitious. It would result in expected electric sector  emission reductions of nearly 80 percent by 2035 compared to 2005  benchmarks. If the cost curve bends faster and the clean energy  transition turns out to be even cheaper, reductions will happen even  faster.   Third, let's be open to all solutions for a clean energy future.  Addressing the challenges of climate change isn't easy, and there is no  one solution. We need to be open to all ideas and all approaches so  long as they actually reduce carbon emissions. If we want an electric  system that is not only zero emissions but also reliable, resilient,  and affordable, we can't afford to rule out any technologies in  advance.   None of us knows in 2019 what is going to be the best way to run a  reliable, affordable net zero emissions electric system in 2050. What  we do know is that we need to create strong  [[Page S2746]]  clean energy incentives that the electricity market will understand and  respond to and then allow all technologies to compete. That is what  this bill does.   Here is what that might look like. Here is what it could look like.  Most scientific models say that in a net zero emission electric grid,  renewable sources like wind and solar will deliver the bulk of the  electricity we need, but we also know that a reliable grid needs energy  sources that can be turned up or down when we need them. This means  resilient, reliable electric grids that will be built on a combination  of hydropower, nuclear power, long-term energy storage, and fossil  fuels, if they are deployed with carbon capture.   What will be the proportion of these energy sources in 2050? We can't  know that today, but what we do know, based on one leading model, is an  approach like the one in our bill that is open to all clean sources of  electricity will be up to trillions of dollars cheaper than an approach  that relies on handpicking technological winners and losers.  Colleagues, clean, reliable, and affordable energy is important to my  constituents in Minnesota, and I bet it is important to your  constituents as well.   Fighting climate change is a big challenge that requires a lot of  good ideas. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2019, which I introduced  today, will get the electric power sector to net zero carbon emissions,  but it doesn't do everything we need to do to fight climate change.   This bill is only one of the steps that we need to take to move our  country and our world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in a way  that is fair and just and economical, but it is an important piece.   In the electric sector, we already know a lot about how to make  progress to lower carbon emissions. Thanks to innovation and good  policies at the State level, emissions from electricity production have  declined substantially just in the last decade.   Now we need to keep that progress going and going faster. We need to  continue and accelerate progress and expand the use of clean  electricity into other sectors.   Think about this. A clean electric grid can provide the energy to  reduce carbon emissions in transportation, in buildings, and in other  parts of our economy. Electric vehicles can contribute to reduce carbon  emissions when we have a clean energy electric sector. Office buildings  and homes can contribute to reduce carbon emissions when we have a  clean electric sector. That is what progress can look like.   I am grateful that a few of my fellow Republicans in Congress are  moving beyond the President's head-in-the-sand denial of climate  change. These colleagues--and I hope more of them--are looking for ways  to spur innovation in clean energy by providing new funding for clean  energy research.   This is all well and good, but Federal funding for clean energy  research will not work all on its own. What drives adoption and  dispersion of innovation is a strong market signal that low carbon  sources of electricity will be valued by the market, and that will be  happening predictably as big utilities make important capital  investments. Research money provides a really important push to get  innovation started in the lab, but for innovation to move from  technology to be adopted at a scale and pace that we need, we must be  sending a strong, clear signal from the market that low-carbon sources  of electricity are going to be valued.   The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2019 does this. It is a crucial  complement to Manhattan Project efforts to spur technology innovation.  These two are complements but not alternatives. Research without market  incentives will not get us where we need to go.   Colleagues, climate change is real, and we need bold action to fight  it. If we do--when we do--the United States can be the clean energy  leader. This will be good for jobs. It will be good for our health, and  it will be necessary for the survival of our planet.   We can lead or we can follow. I believe we need to lead. This is what  our bill seeks to do by putting the United States in the forefront for  reaching net zero carbon emissions in the electric sector. This is an  environmental imperative. It is an economic imperative, and it is a  jobs imperative. I don't care whether you come from a State that gets  80 percent of its power from clean energy or whether you get 10  percent.   This is why our plan has the endorsement of the Union of Concerned  Scientists, the Clean Air Task Force, and Fresh Energy in Minnesota.  Our plan is supported by the Utility Workers of America and United  Steelworkers. Bills that are acceptable to labor, the environmental  movement, and forward-thinking utilities are rare. Yet this is what we  really need if we are going to build a winning coalition to address  climate change.   We Democrats understand that the climate crisis requires bold action,  and we understand that we need many ideas and many solutions. I offer  one today.   I challenge--I urge--my Republican colleagues to do the same and to  join us. Join with us and help us find solutions to a crisis that will  shape irrevocably the world our children and our grandchildren will be  living in.   Science tells us that the challenge is great, but it also shows us  solutions that can cut net carbon emissions to zero, lower energy  costs, and expand jobs and opportunity. That is the future I want for  my children and my grandchildren yet to be born. Let's get to work. We  don't have any time to waste.   I thank Representative Lujan for partnering with me on this bill. I  thank my colleagues Senators Heinrich, Kaine, Whitehouse, and Schatz  for cosponsoring this legislation. I also thank Senator Jeff Bingaman  of New Mexico, longtime chair of the Senate Energy Committee, who first  worked in a bipartisan way on a clean energy standard bill that was a  template for our effort today.   I thank also the scientists and economists who have provided  thoughtful analysis as we developed this bill--most prominently,  Resources for the Future and President Obama's Secretary of Energy,  Ernie Moniz. I am grateful for their support and eager to begin the  push to get our policies moved forward.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, climate change is the existential challenge  of our time. I know this because this is what the science says.
