 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Biden  administration's failure to secure our border and create an immigration  system that works for the American people.   Let's be clear: The crisis at our southern border is still out of  control. Since President Biden took office, more than 5.5 million  illegal crossings have occurred at the southern border, yet he  continues to pursue policies that make the situation worse.   As a proud immigrant to this country representing thousands of first- generation Americans, I support policies to protect our communities and  uphold the rule of law.   House Republicans are taking action to secure our border and restore  order to our immigration system. I welcome the President and  Congressional Democrats to join us in the effort. The American people  deserve nothing less.                            ____________________
