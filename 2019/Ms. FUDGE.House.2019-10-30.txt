 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Vanessa Whiting of  Cleveland, Ohio, the recipient of the 2019 Black Professional of the  Year Award.   Ms. Whiting will become the 39th individual to receive this  distinguished award given by the Black Professionals Association  Charitable Foundation at their annual scholarship and awards gala. Each  year the organization honors an African American professional for their  career accomplishments, community engagement, and civic contributions.   Through her considerable achievements as an attorney, entrepreneur,  and civic leader, Ms. Whiting is most deserving of this long overdue  recognition. She embodies the mission of the Black Professionals  Association Charitable Foundation, which is to create opportunities for  African American professionals by providing scholarship, leadership,  and career development.   As president of AES Management and a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen  franchisee, Ms. Whiting has made hiring people from her community a  priority, creating employment opportunities where there are few  options.   Ms. Whiting has more than 30 years of experience as an attorney.  Throughout her law career, she focused her work on revitalizing  struggling neighborhoods and helping small and minority-owned  businesses succeed.   Ms. Whiting has committed her time and talents to address affordable  housing, the need for community centers, and other projects in our area  designed to uplift the community and empower its residents.   Ms. Whiting was recently elected chair of the MetroHealth Hospital  Board of Trustees where she continues her work promoting diversity and  inclusion throughout Cuyahoga County's public health system. She has  served in many key board positions in the Cleveland community,  including the NAACP Cleveland Branch, the Tri-C Foundation, Karamu  House, and the Cleveland Housing Network Board of Trustees.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Ms. Whiting for her outstanding contributions  to Ohio's 11th Congressional District. My sincere congratulations go to  Ms. Whiting on this distinguished accomplishment, and I thank her for  her leadership and her service.                            ____________________
