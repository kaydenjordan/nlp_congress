 Madam President, in May of this year, terrorist groups  in Gaza launched more than 4,000 rockets at innocent Israelis. For 11  days, Hamas and others fired off thousands of various rocket systems  with little guidance into heavily populated areas across Israel with no  regard, indeed, likely with the intention of killing civilians.   In the face of this barrage, once again, Israel deployed the Iron  Dome missile defense system, which intercepted 90 percent of these  incoming attacks. Because of this purely defensive system, Israel is  able to protect its own citizens and also direct its response to more  carefully target those in Gaza who are responsible for launching these  brutal attacks.   Now, I have been clear: We should all mourn the loss of innocent  Israelis and Palestinians who were killed during this conflict. Beyond  a lack of regard for innocent Israeli civilians, Hamas further  endangers Palestinians by hiding their stockpiles and themselves in  densely populated areas.   But I am not here today to relitigate thousands of years of conflict;  I am here to point out two simple facts: Hamas is a terrorist  organization that routinely threatens innocent civilians; Iron Dome, a  purely defensive system that protects civilians. It saves lives,  regardless of religion or ethnicity, period.   Furthermore, by saving those lives, Iron Dome also preserves  diplomatic space for deescalation, communication, and further  negotiations about Israeli and Palestinian long-term security and the  future of a negotiated two-State solution.   There is no conceivable reason why anyone in this Chamber, on either  side of the aisle, should stand in the way of U.S. support for this  lifesaving defense to be fully ready for the next attack.   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join the  House of Representatives in passing this funding on a broadly  bipartisan effort.   So, therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a  time to be determined by the majority leader, following consultation  with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; that there be up to 2 hours for debate;  that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be considered read  a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill without  intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object. While I respect the  Senator from Kentucky's consistent approach to foreign aid spending,  his substitute to H.R. 5323 is problematic for the following reasons:  This amendment would unleash an array of adverse consequences for our  broader foreign policy and national security objectives.   This amendment ultimately proposes to rescind funds from the  Departments of State and Defense. And this amendment would not  reallocate funds that would allegedly go to the Taliban, as the Senator  from Kentucky suggests. The reality is that U.S. dollars are not going  to the Taliban, nor will they.   Let me be clear and echo what the administration has said: No U.S.  foreign aid will go to a Taliban-controlled Afghan Government. This  does not mean that we remain any less committed to supporting the  Afghan people. On the contrary, U.S. humanitarian aid could be routed  through highly vetted partners, like the World Food Programme that we  trust to put the interests of the Afghan people first.   So let me be clear. Senator Paul's amendment would actually raid the  funding that delivers lifesaving humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.  And they need it more than ever.   Secondly, Afghanistan is in the grips of a dire humanitarian crisis.  The economy has collapsed. One in three Afghans do not know where their  next  [[Page S6887]]  meal will come from. People are afraid to leave their homes.   And so for those reasons, as well as the following--this amendment  would also slash refugee assistance being used at this very moment to  evacuate and resettle the U.S. allies and partners who served alongside  Americans in the War on Terror.   Likewise, Senator Paul is proposing we rescind the funding that  supports important bipartisan priorities like promoting regional  security, countering Chinese influence, and ending this pandemic.   And that is not all. The amendment also jeopardizes funds being used  to recover and secure U.S. military equipment.   We may no longer be funding the Afghan National Army, but we still  urgently need these repurposed funds to keep American equipment out of  the wrong hands.   In short, Senator Paul's amendment could undermine U.S. national  security; it would abandon the Afghan people in their darkest hour; and  it would betray the American people's commitment to supporting our  Afghan allies.   Finally, let me just say that this body overwhelmingly supports the  swift passage of Iron Dome. Despite what others may have said, even on  this floor, Democrats in the Senate are not holding up this critical  funding. In the House, there may have been a very small handful of  bipartisan opposition. And the only reason it is being held up in this  body is because of this amendment. He is not a member of the Democratic  caucus.   This is a defensive, lifesaving system built on years of cooperation  with our ally Israel. I am disappointed we are in this situation. But  because of all of these reasons, I must object to the Senator's  substitute amendment.    Madam President.    Let me just simply say, this is a figleaf.   We could have, today, passed Iron Dome as the House of  Representatives passed it, send $1 billion, and make sure that Israelis  and Palestinians would be safer as a result of the terrifying actions  that Hamas and others take. There is no reason for this.   I know my colleague has not been particularly supportive on foreign  aid in general, and in this case in particular, but the reality is that  we have an opportunity here.   Now, I am convinced that Iron Dome will get done. We will get the  resources to our allies, the State of Israel. But it is a shame that we  have to have the uncertainty that is pending as a result of the  objection that has been had.   We don't need to find a pathway in this particular way, which, you  know, is only going to undermine our own national security interests as  it relates to Afghanistan.   With that I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The USN EA-18G aircraft       will then be modified into a Royal Australian Air Force       (RAAF) EA-18G aircraft configuration. The sale would include       one (1) EA-18G Growler aircraft (Lot 38 or later) and       engineering and modification; verification and validation       flight test efforts; maintenance and storage; U.S. Government       and contractor engineering/technical assistance; related       studies and analysis support; and other related elements of       programmatic, technical and logistics support. The total       estimated value is $125 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        This proposed sale will allow Australia to effectively       maintain its current force projection capability that       enhances interoperability with U.S. forces well into the       future and maintain their original primary level of aircraft       authorized. This aircraft would replace Australia's EA-18G       A46-311 aircraft lost in an accident at Nellis Air Force       Base. Australia currently employs the EA-18G and will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this aircraft and follow-on support       will not alter the basic military balance in the region.        These aircraft will be provided from U.S. Navy stock. There       are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with       this potential sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale will require U.S.       Government and contractor personnel to visit Australia on a       temporary basis in conjunction with program technical       oversight and support requirements, including program and       technical reviews.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 21-58       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The EA-18G is a derivative of the two-seat F/A-18F Super       Hornet that performs an  [[Page S6891]]       array of airborne electronic attack (AEA) missions. The EA-      18G integrates the capabilities of an advanced AEA system, as       well as other complementary systems to provide one of the       most capable AEA platforms in the world.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3.

A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense services listed in this transmittal have       been authorized for release and export to the Government of       Australia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 0P-21.

(iii) Description: On March 19, 2021, Congress was notified       by Congressional certification transmittal number 21-31, of       the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act of two hundred eighty-eight (288) AGM-114R       Hellfire missiles. Also included were AGM-l14R spare parts;       U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services; repair and return; storage; and       other related elements of logistical and program support. The       estimated total cost was $36 million. Major Defense Equipment       (MDE) constituted $33 million of this total.        This transmittal reports a value increase due to a decrease       in global requests for Hellfire missiles, which negatively       impact Hellfire production economies of scale. The estimated       total increase in MDE value is $9 million, resulting in a new       MDE total of $42 million. The total notified case value will       increase to $47 million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the pricing for the original notification was outdated and       requires an increase.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by meeting the legitimate security and defense needs       of one of the closest allies in the INDOPACOM Theater. The       ROK is one of the major political and economic powers in East       Asia and the Western Pacific and a key partner of the United       States in ensuring peace and stability in that region. It is       vital to U.S. national interests to assist the ROK in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensitivity of       Technology Statement contained in the original notification       applies to items reported here.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: October 1, 2021.                            ____________________
