 Mr. President, before I was elected Governor of Delaware  in 1992, I served in the House of Representatives for five terms. We  have one congressional seat. Alaska is one of those States, as the  Senator from Alaska knows, that also has one congressional seat.   I got to the House on January 3, 1983, and one of the first people I  met there was Don Young. We ended up on the same committee together,  not the Environment and Public Works we serve on today but the Merchant  Marine and Fisheries, which has a lot of the same jurisdiction as the  Environment and Public Works Committee.   So I remember going to Alaska with him and a bunch of our colleagues  and just going through Prudhoe and just seeing all kinds of places  around the Senator's beautiful State and going back with my family  years later.   My colleague is also a colonel in the Marines. I call him  ``colonel.'' He knows that John Barrasso and I like music and that  every now and then, we will find some way to work some music lyrics  into what we have to say. In listening to the Senator talk about   Don  Young, it reminds me of a great song by Bob Dylan, called ``Forever  Young,'' which is a classic song. You can find anything on the internet  these days, and someone was nice enough to pull up the first verse of  the lyrics of ``Forever Young'' by Bob Dylan.   It goes something like this:         May God bless and keep you always        May your wishes all come true        May you always do for others        And let others do for you        May you build a ladder to the stars        And climb on every rung        May you stay forever young        Forever young, forever young        May you stay forever young      Don Young, congratulations from your Delaware buddy and former  colleague. Thank you.   What I really think we need to do is to join hands here in the Senate  and sing ``Kumbaya'' and get our act together now that things have  calmed down a little bit from earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:    Mr. President, Today I am introducing the ``Clean  Corridors Act of 2019.'' This legislation authorizes $3 billion in  grant funding to public entities for installing electric vehicle  charging infrastructure and hydrogen fueling infrastructure along  designated corridors.   Earlier this week, Chairman Barrasso and I sent a letter to the full  Senate requesting Senators' priorities for a surface transportation  bill reauthorization this Congress. The surface transportation bill is  the primary authorizing legislation for the programs of the Federal  Highway Administration at the U.S. Department of Transportation, among  other programs related to surface transportation.   As the Ranking Member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and  Public Works, this legislation is a reauthorization priority of my own.   Nearly two years ago, the Rocky Mountain Institute published a report  that said re-installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure should  be, quote, an ``urgent priority in all states and major municipalities.  Getting it right will require unprecedented cooperation by many  stakeholder groups. The time to act is now.''   I agree. This legislation would provide grants for the installment of  electric vehicle charging infrastructure and hydrogen fueling  infrastructure along the National Highway System. This bill is the  product of remarkable collaboration between stakeholders, and it will  take us one step forward in reducing emissions, improving air quality,  and enhancing energy security and fuel choice. This legislation is  endorsed by stakeholders from across the electric vehicle supply chain,  including the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Electric  Drive Transportation Association, Edison Electric Institute, Auto  Alliance, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials, and the American Highway Users Alliance.   As I have stated before, the threat of climate change is greater than  any one state, or region or country--we all have to do our part, and  the federal government has a leadership role to play. By deploying  necessary electric and fuel cell vehicle charging infrastructure, and  supporting growth of these needed technologies, doing so will help us  lower the rate of emissions of carbon into our atmosphere.   Even better yet, this legislation will help us in our efforts to put  the United States back in the driver's seat of the world's clean energy  economy, while creating green manufacturing jobs here at home. This  legislation is a true win-win for our environment and our economy, and  it is my hope that the Senate will support this legislation and that it  will be enacted this Congress.                                   S. 674         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Corridors Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2.

and        (ii) by striking ``by the end of fiscal year 2020.'' and       inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) summarizes best practices and provides guidance,       developed through consultation with the Secretary of Energy,       for project development of electric vehicle charging       infrastructure and hydrogen fueling infrastructure at the       State, Tribal, and local level to allow for the predictable       deployment of that infrastructure.'';
