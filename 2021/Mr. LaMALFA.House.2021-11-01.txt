 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in actually complete outrage  at the unbelievable consideration that the Biden administration is  putting forward of--get this--awarding $450,000 per person to illegal  immigrants that have broken our laws in this country.   $450,000. How is it even rational that someone who took an illegal  action in order to get to our soil, how can that lead to an outcome  where the perpetrator would receive a $450,000 payday?   There are American citizens whose families don't even make half a  million dollars in 10 years. The President doesn't even make $450,000 a  year.   We have already seen that illegal immigrants use children basically  as shields--not even their own children--to avoid deportation in order  to come across the border.   Democrats in Congress are trying their best to give illegal  immigrants citizenship, and the White House wants to give them a very  large check.   When I see proposals like this, I have to ask: Whose side are they  on? It certainly doesn't look like this administration is on the side  of the hardworking American citizens who are trying to make ends meet,  put their kids through school, pay their bills, when they hand out  $450,000 checks to people who came here illegally.                            ____________________
