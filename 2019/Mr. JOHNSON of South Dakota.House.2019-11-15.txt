 Mr. Speaker, it is National  Apprenticeship Week.   We have 7 million unfilled jobs in this country, and many of them are  in the skilled trades. We have got to close  [[Page H8885]]  that gap, and I think apprenticeships can help. There are companies  like Midwestern Mechanical in Sioux Falls who understand that and have  created their own in-house apprenticeship programs.   Their apprentices get free classes while they work 40 hours a week in  their field. They earn while they learn. Unlike many college students,  they finish their program with a license, with a skill, with a job, and  without college debt.   Now, as we look forward to how do we grow this economy and how do we  do a better job, we have to understand that, yes, 4-year degrees are  important, but they are not the only way to close that skill gap.   I think that in-house apprenticeships like those at Midwestern  Mechanical show us an important way forward.                            ____________________
