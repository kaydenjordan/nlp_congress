 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Subcommittee  Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Larson for their hard work on this  legislation. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 4547, the  Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of  2018.   As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I had the opportunity to  engage in this issue during hearings the committee held last year. I  recognize the need for reform of the representative payee program in  order to improve its integrity and ensure that beneficiaries are  getting the assistance they need.   The representative payee program helps around 8 million Social  Security beneficiaries manage their benefits. H.R. 4547 offers several  reforms that will improve the program. These include provisions that  will help better protect vulnerable beneficiaries, particularly those  who are in foster care, by allowing for enhanced information sharing  with State foster care programs. This will ensure that children in  foster care have the appropriate representative payee if there is a  change in placement. The bill also improves  [[Page H749]]  oversight of representative payees by requiring State protection and  advocacy programs to conduct reviews of payee performance.   Mr. Speaker, many Social Security beneficiaries require assistance in  managing their benefits. I appreciate the work that the Ways and Means'  Subcommittee on Social Security has done to improve the Social Security  representative payee program, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in  favor of H.R. 4547.
