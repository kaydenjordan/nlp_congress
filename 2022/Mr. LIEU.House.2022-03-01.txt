 Mr. Speaker, President Biden and Democrats are building a  better America.   Last year we passed the American Rescue Plan. That helped get our  economy back on track. We have created in America approximately 7  million jobs in the last 12 months. That is a record in U.S. history.  We are also experiencing very high economic growth. Jobs are up, wages  are up, and unemployment is down.   We then followed it up with an infrastructure law that is going to  rebuild roads, bridges, and highways. It is going to put broadband  internet everywhere from rural areas to inner cities. It is going to  get lead out of our water, and it is going to put EV charging stations  across America.
