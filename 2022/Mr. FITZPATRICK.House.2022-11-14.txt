 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5441,  the Preventing All Soring Tactics Act. As a member of the Animal  Protection Caucus, I believe, like my colleagues, that we should be  urging all of our colleagues to commit to ensuring our government is  doing everything we can to promote animal welfare.   The bottom line is this: The antiquated and inhumane practice of  soring intentionally inflicts pain on show horses for the mere purpose  of winning a ribbon in a competition. Our bipartisan PAST Act, which  has passed overwhelmingly, as has been pointed out, will give a voice  to these suffering animals and will finally put an end to this cruel  practice by banning devices integral to soring, strengthening  penalties, and also holding abusers accountable for their crimes  against innocent horses.   I am proud again to join Representatives Cohen, Schakowsky, and  Buchanan in championing this bipartisan bill; which, as was mentioned,  passed this House last Congress on an overwhelming bipartisan basis. I  hope that after passage today it will receive swift consideration by  our colleagues in the Senate.
