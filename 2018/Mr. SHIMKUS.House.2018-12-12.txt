 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to express my  sincere thanks to General Vincent Brooks, my classmate from West Point,  upon his retirement day after 38 years of active military service.   Mr. Speaker, I came down to the floor to read a Facebook post from  another West Pointer honoring his close friend who died on November 27  of this year in Afghanistan.   Time will not permit me to go through his entire post, but I think  for many of us who have served in the conflicts that we have today, it  underlines the sacrifice that our men and women pay to the service of  our country.   And I will end with this. It was Captain Andrew Ross who died on  November 27, 2018. And the last verse of our alma mater which was sung  at the second singing of alma maters at the Army-Navy game, it ends  with this, and I think it is appropriate:       And when our work is done.      Our course on Earth is run.      May it be said, `Well done;      Be thou at peace.'      E'er may that line of gray.      Increase from day to day.      Live, serve, and die, we pray.      West Point for thee.    God bless the family of Captain Ross and all the men and women who  serve overseas in dangerous locations.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Captain Andrew P. Ross, who  passed away in Afghanistan on Tuesday, November 27th.   Captain Ross was a Virginian native who earned his education at West  Point, my alma mater. He deployed to Afghanistan in 2013. Afterward,  Captain Ross joined Special Forces and led Green Berets.   On November 27th, Captain Ross was killed when an IED detonated  underneath his vehicle in Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. His friend,  Michael Shepherd, shared the following words to honor his memory:         I am still numb and perhaps still in disbelief. I have been       dreading writing this post, but I am going to get this out       because I believe people should know.        ``Apocalypse 36, this is Bushmaster 36. I am providing       overwatch from your northwest as you move north along the       route.'' I knew that voice better than anyone when it came       over the radio. That was Drew Ross, my best friend. My West       Point classmates and fellow platoon leaders know nothing is       more calming than knowing your battle buddy is looking out       for you.        I met Drew on July 2, 2007 when we started West Point       together. We were in the same cadet basic training platoon       and in the same cadet company (Go Frogs!) for three years.       Then, we found ourselves together again at Fort Stewart, GA       in the same cavalry squadron (Mustangs!). By the time we       deployed to Afghanistan in 2013, we knew more about each       other than we probably would've liked. Drew was the third       platoon leader in B Troop and I was the third platoon leader       in A Troop. After 9 months, we sat next to each other on the       flight home. When the pilot announced that we were over U.S.       airspace, Drew and looked around the plane and discussed how       lucky we were to bring all of our Soldiers home.        As I left the Army for law school, Drew not only stayed in       but decided he wanted to join Special Forces and lead Green       Berets. Of course, Drew made it through easily and married       his lovely wife in February. On Tuesday, November 27, 2018       Drew was killed when an improvised explosive device detonated       underneath his vehicle in Ghazni province, Afghanistan. We       FaceTimed last week and the last thing he sent me was his       address because I wanted to send him something for Christmas.        Drew represented the best of our country. He could have       done anything he wanted, but chose time and again to put       himself in between our country and the enemy under the most       violent and dangerous of circumstances. I would share more       about how funny and incredible of a man he was, but there are       some things I want to keep only for myself.        Please don't feel sorry for me. I am beyond lucky that I       knew him, let alone that I was able to call him a fellow       classmate, Frog, Soldier, Mustang, platoon leader, executive       officer, and most importantly (according to him at least) a       workout partner. Please keep in your thoughts and prayers his       wife, family, and Green Berets whose time with him was cut       short. Mourn for our country who lost a man who gave so much       in 29 years, but had so much more to give.    Mr. Speaker, Captain Ross served our nation honorably and  courageously. He will be dearly missed.                            ____________________
