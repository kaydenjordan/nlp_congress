 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Tom Durden who passed away at the age of 66.   Durden was a famous district attorney for the Atlantic Judicial  Circuit. In 1984, 2 years after earning a law degree from Mercer  University, he joined the DA's office as an assistant prosecutor until  he was elected DA in 1998.   He was a true public servant to the State of Georgia for almost 40  years and led the DA's office for 24 years before retiring in 2022.   During his career, Tom Durden worked on hundreds of criminal cases in  the Atlantic Circuit, which includes six southeast Georgia counties  outside Savannah.   He was best known for working on the Tomato Patch murder case and the  2020 Ahmaud Arbery murder.   Durden was a hard-working, determined, and endearing person with many  great qualities. He also had artistic talents such as singing, playing  guitar, and playing piano.   Durden will be remembered for being a good person and for his talents  in and outside of the courtroom.                            ____________________
