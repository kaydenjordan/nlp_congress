 Mr. President, today I rise to honor David Mahoney,  sheriff of Dane County, WI, on his retirement. Throughout his long and  notable career in law enforcement, Sheriff Mahoney has been a champion  of those in the profession and an advocate of deepening community  engagement.   After earning degrees from Madison College and the University of  Wisconsin-Madison, Sheriff Mahoney began his 41-year career in law  enforcement, all but one of which was spent in the Dane County  Sheriff's Office. He also graduated from the National Sheriffs'  Institute Executive Management Program and the FBI National Academy for  Executive Management. Sheriff Mahoney's distinguished career includes  extensive experience in labor management, having served 12 years as a  local, State, and national labor executive officer, including several  years as head of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. His  leadership abilities were recognized when he was appointed president of  the National Sheriffs' Association and the Badgerland Sheriffs'  Association.   Sheriff Mahoney was elected as the 52nd sheriff of Dane County in  2006. He won reelection in 2010, 2014, and 2018. As Sheriff, Dave led  an organization of 600 staff in a county spanning 1,238 square miles  with over 575,000 residents. He was a steadfast advocate for justice,  safety, taxpayers, and the men and women in uniform who served on his  team.   During his tenure, Sheriff Mahoney worked hard to reduce recidivism  and engage in partnerships to promote criminal justice reform. He is  especially respected for his work in understanding the reasons people  enter the criminal justice system and developing programming in a jail  setting to address these reasons. He has been a strong advocate for  more humane conditions in the county's aging jail facilities, including  improving access to mental health and substance abuse treatment. He  also expanded electronic monitoring programs to reduce a growing jail  population and ended a costly program that transferred inmates to  facilities in other counties.   But Sheriff Mahoney is perhaps best known for his efforts to expand  community engagement and rebuild trust between communities of color and  law enforcement. Under his leadership, the sheriff's office partnered  with the Justified Anger Coalition, a local initiative designed to  eliminate racial disparities and create opportunities for African  Americans. He also served on the county's Criminal Justice Council,  which pursues reform across both the legal and penal systems.   While Sheriff Mahoney is retiring from the Dane County Sheriff's  Office, he is not retiring from his dedication to safety and security.  He will continue his leadership in his new role as the director of  Strategy and Support in the Protective Services Division of American  Family Insurance, and he will remain a strong voice in the community's  pursuit of racial justice reform.   I am proud to honor Sheriff David Mahoney's four decades of  protecting Dane County citizens with respect and grace, and I am  grateful to call him my friend.                            ____________________
