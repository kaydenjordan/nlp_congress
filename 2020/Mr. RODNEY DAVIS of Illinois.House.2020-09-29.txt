 Madam Speaker, at this point, I will go  over to the other side of the aisle to yield to my friend, the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) to offer his comments.    Thank you, Mr. Tonko, for your  comments. I felt a little   John Shimkus-y here. I was getting a little  impatient. I thought we were running out of time. So I am going ask my  colleagues to please try to limit your comments to a maximum of 2  minutes.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood),  my good friend and fellow Illinoisan.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman  LaHood for his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), my  colleague, who has known   John Shimkus since before he was even  elected.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi), my colleague.   Madam Speaker, if it takes us up, you know, I am going to start  actually asking for time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr.  Krishnamoorthi for his comments tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), a  good friend of Congressman Shimkus and all of us.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Walden for  his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  McKinley), sticking with the Energy and Commerce Committee that Mr.  Shimkus has served on since he got to Congress in 1996.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. McKinley for  his comments tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  another leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Burgess for  his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks),  another Energy and Commerce member.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. Brooks for  her comments tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta),  another E&C member.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Latta for  his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie),  another E&C member.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), another E&C member.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington) for brief remarks.    Madam Speaker, I can attest, sometimes  the gentleman cannot throw the pitch straight. My shin feels that. But  I thank the gentleman for his kind words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber),  the newest member of the Shimkus slumlord era at his townhouse.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), another member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I can't tell you how  privileged I am to be here tonight, to be able to stand at this podium  and recognize my fellow colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  recognize somebody who I worked for, for 16 years.   I was talking to my wife, Shannon, about what I wanted to say about  John tonight because I really couldn't think of anything really nice to  say, after 16 years. She reminded me that I wouldn't be here without  his mentorship. I wouldn't be able to have this privilege to serve in  this institution with you, Madam Speaker, and with everybody who  crowded the floor tonight to honor our friend, Mr. Shimkus.   She reminded me, you probably--his wife, Karen, who I am not supposed  to recognize in the gallery, so I am not. I don't want to be chastised  later.   But his wife, Karen, probably doesn't know this, but I am probably  their fourth son. This is somebody who taught me to be a good worker,  taught me that being on time matters, taught me that helping others is  a privilege.   I can't say thank you enough to this man because I would not be  serving in this great institution without you and your mentorship, your  friendship, and your leadership. It wasn't without some hiccups, let me  tell you. I am sure he wanted to fire me a few times, and I think he  told me that a few times.   But I prevailed. You know why? Because we had a great team. And a  great team is built with the leadership of somebody who gives people  opportunities to not just survive in a workplace but to excel.   I can remember that I hadn't thought about running for Congress in a  very long time when I got a call in 2012 one day when there was an  opportunity to put my name into the mix to run for this office. In  typical John Shimkus fashion--and his wife Karen could probably attest  to this--John called me and said: Hey, have you ever thought about  running for Congress?    And I said: Well, I guess maybe because I really enjoy watching you.   He said: Well, if there is ever a time to think about it, now is the  time.   Okay. In typical John Shimkus fashion, he is like: All right, I have  to go. Call Craig--Craig Roberts, his chief of staff, the godfather of  my three kids.   What a team. What a team. The entire Shimkus team, including my  [[Page H5048]]  chief of staff since I got here who worked with me on the Shimkus  campaign, in the Shimkus office, and is now my staff director on the  committee that I am blessed to run, the House Administration Committee.  What a legacy this guy leaves in this institution.   People will not understand the importance of   John Shimkus serving  as a Member of the House of Representatives until they look back in  history and realize some of the things that our colleagues actually  talked about tonight.   If you were in an emergency anywhere in this great Nation, and you  have a cell phone that is a lot more ubiquitous today than it ever was  when this guy came to Congress in the dark ages of 1996, you can dial  911 and know that it is going to get routed to your local emergency  services center.                                time  2145    But before   John Shimkus got to Congress, that didn't happen. The  things that we take for granted today were started by people who served  in this institution years before us. If we don't understand their  legacy and we don't understand the history that they brought to all of  us and to our Nation to make sure that lives are saved, then we will  never know their true impact.   I personally know   John Shimkus' true impact because he impacted my  life greatly. He has known me since before I became a parent of now a  23 year old and two 20 year olds. These children look to him as  somebody who mentored their dad.     John Shimkus. I know I don't have a lot of time left tonight, and I  have got probably a couple of months left to harass him a little bit in  other speeches. But coming here to the U.S. House of Representatives  and being able to get to know my friend's roommates, his friends and  now colleagues, it would not have happened without the gentleman. He  has made me not just a Member of this privileged institution, he has  made me a better person, he has made me a better dad, he has made me a  better husband, and he has made this institution in the United States  of America a better place for every single citizen in this country.   Godspeed to you, Mr. Shimkus, in your retirement. Godspeed to Karen.  I love you both.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
