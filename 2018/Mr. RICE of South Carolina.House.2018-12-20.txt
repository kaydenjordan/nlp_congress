Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7227, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan, commonsense measure that I am  proud to have worked on alongside Mr. Lewis and many members of the  Ways and Means Committee for the past 2 years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of  the tax and oversight package before us today.   I appreciate the concern about the deficits from my colleague across  the aisle, but I would remind my colleague that President Obama added  $2 trillion in deficits in only 1 year.   Mr. Speaker, this bill adds to the successes, the amazing successes  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which became law last year, and our  economic potential in America has, once again, been unleashed and  America is, once again, the land of opportunity.   Unemployment is at a record low, Mr. Speaker. Consumer confidence and  small business confidence are at historic highs, and wages are growing  at their fastest pace in nearly a decade.   Mr. Speaker, my friends across the aisle can say that this bill  benefited only the wealthy, but I can tell you, I represent three of  the poorest counties in South Carolina, Marion County, Dillon County,  and Marlboro County, and all three of those counties, in 2016, were at  or about 10 percent unemployment. Today, each one of those counties,  largely as a result of this tax bill, are below 6 percent. For the  first time in 30 years they are below 6 percent unemployment.   When we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our message was clear: We  will not wait another 30 years to take up tax legislation. We will  consistently work to improve the Tax Code.   The legislation before us is an opportunity to build on the economic  momentum that is creating opportunities and lifting people up in South  Carolina and across the country.   Two years ago, Hurricane Matthew made landfall in South Carolina, and  just a few days before a tax filing deadline, people were ignoring  evacuation orders from disaster officials to ensure they could meet  their IRS filing deadlines. Can you imagine having to choose between  boarding up your house or filing a tax return? That is what my  constituents had to do.   Ambiguity under the current law results in the IRS waiting to grant a  deadline extension for weeks after a natural disaster. My bill, the  Disaster Certainty Act, would create an automatic 60-day extension  following a Presidential Disaster Declaration, and it is included in  this bill.   Additionally, this package includes the Hurricane Florence Tax Relief  Act, which I introduced with Congressman Holding. This legislation  gives disaster victims the flexibility to access emergency funds,  encourages charitable giving, and enhances the deduction for personal  casualty losses.   Immediately following a disaster, families are faced with the cost of  home repairs and temporary housing, but most do not have these funds at  their disposal.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this package.    Mr. Speaker, opioids and illegal  immigration are two cancers of a porous southern border, and my  constituents have had enough.   Illegal immigration holds down wages and diminishes our middle class.  The Democrats say they are for border security; they just don't want to  pay for it--empty words.   It is funny, Mr. Schumer voted for a border wall in 2006, but he is  against it now. Why? Because our President wants it? Empty words.    In 2017, 150 people in my district in 2017 were killed by opioid  overdoses. My law enforcement agencies tell me that 85 percent of those  drugs come across our porous southern border.   You say you are for border security, but you don't want to pay for  it--empty words, playing politics.   There were 150 people killed in my district. They are in your  districts, too. It is a cancer. It doesn't just affect my district. It  is across this entire country. You say you are for border security, and  you won't take any action to stop it.   Mr. Speaker, it has gone on long enough. Illegal immigration holds  down wages, stretches our social safety net, holds down our middle  class. The opioids kill people across our country. It is a cancer and  it is growing. It is not even leveling off. It is growing, killing  people in my district and yours, too.   Empty words, shame on you.
