 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Republican  spending plans.   Republicans in Congress have passed a tax giveaway to corporations  and left behind everyday Americans. Now Republicans are refusing to  address constituents' urgent priorities: from children's healthcare to  disaster relief, to certainty for DREAMers, and more.   They refuse to bring a clean reauthorization for the Children's  Health Insurance Program--CHIP--which serves 9 million children and  370,000 pregnant women. They want to drastically cut other healthcare  funding while saying they support CHIP.   Republicans are also planning to cut Medicare and Medicaid. These  cuts would be devastating for millions of people who depend on Medicaid  for essential health services: children, seniors, low-income  individuals, and people with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, this budget will hurt children, women, and all Americans  just to pay for a tax giveaway, and it is simply unacceptable.                            ____________________
