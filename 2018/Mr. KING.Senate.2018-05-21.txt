 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  outstanding career of a leader in workforce development in the State of  Maine. Michael ``Mike'' Bourret, of Bailey Island, ME, is retiring  after 36 years of professional experience in workforce development,  most recently in his position as executive director of Coastal Counties  Workforce, Inc. From his first days in the early 1980s as an employment  counselor in western Maine, Mike has held a number of leadership  positions in which he has developed greater access to--and  opportunities for individuals in--workforce development programs.   Mr. Bourret dedicated 12 years to the Maine Department of Labor,  holding positions from employment and training director to special  assistant to the commissioner. as director of the dislocated worker  unit while at the department of labor, Mike recognized the flaws of a  reactive government approach to plant closings and worker dislocation,  leading Mike to promote a more proactive approach. This resulted in  Mike assisting with the design of a new strategy to provide services  for these workers. His guidance led to the development of the Maine  CareerCenters, which provide employment and training services to  individuals at no charge. In 1996, during my time as Governor, Mike  helped establish the Governor's training initiative, GTI, to provide  employers with the financial support to expand training for their  employees and improve retention of their workers. GTI was recognized  for its success, and the following year, I awarded Mike the Governor's  Teamwork Award for his dedication to implementing projects to improve  Maine's economy and workforce. To date, GTI has helped over 20,000  Maine workers.   In 1998, the Workforce Investment Act, WIA, was passed, and Mike  brought together State and local parties to organize a new regionally  based workforce design in Maine, promoting a more customer-focused  approach in Federal job training programs. Under WIA, Mike established  Coastal Counties Workforce, Inc., in 2000, where he served as executive  director for 18 years, administering over $98 million dollars for the  organization. The Coastal Counties Workforce Board region today spans  six coastal counties and has received over 1.3 million customer visits  to its centers. Over 40,000 Mainers have received essential career and  training services, with 82 percent entering employment. These services  have improved the well-being of Maine residents, including assisting  some of our most vulnerable neighbors in finding meaningful employment,  while supporting local businesses with skilled workers.   Due to Mike's commitment to workforce development and ability to  secure funding for a variety of workforce initiatives and training  programs throughout the years, there has been continued expansion of  employment and training services for the residents of Maine. His  ability to coordinate programs and foster partnerships was a critical  factor in his success, whether it be at the local, State, or national  level. As a champion of workforce development, I join with his  colleagues, friends, and the people of Maine in thanking Mike for his  unwavering service to the workforce of our State.
