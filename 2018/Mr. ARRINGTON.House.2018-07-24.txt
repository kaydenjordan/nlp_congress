 Mr. Speaker, I can't thank the chairman enough for the  opportunity to serve with him, Mr. Takano, and Mr. Wenstrup. I am  looking out and seeing colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have  worked in a bipartisan way to solve problems so that we can better  serve our veterans. I have to say, it has to be the most productive  bipartisan committee in all of the United States Congress, and that is  refreshing. And there is no worthier customer to serve than those who  wore the uniform, those who sacrificed their today so that we could  have our tomorrow.  [[Page H7138]]    I think it is notable to remind my colleagues of the work under his  leadership to produce more than 70 pieces of reform legislation.  Seventy bills that have passed the House of Representatives is no small  task. More than 20 bills have become law of the land.   Again, I thank Mr. Takano for his leadership, Mr. Walz, and my  friends on the other side of the aisle. This is truly a bipartisan  committee and effort altogether.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support my  bill, H.R. 5649. It is really not my bill; it is our bill. It is the  bill of the committee, and it is the bill of the Subcommittee on  Economic Opportunity. This is a bill that was amended as the Navy SEAL  Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.) Transition  Improvements Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, again, there is no greater honor for me than to serve  the men and women who served our country with honor and distinction. I  am pleased to be here today to debate the legislation I introduced,  which I believe will significantly improve the lives of our servicemen  and -women who are in transition from Active Duty to civilian life.   When our soldiers come home from war, it doesn't mean that the  conflict necessarily is over for them. There is often a battle that  continues to rage on inside of them. I think that is a big reason that  we see, unfortunately, 20 veterans commit suicide every day in this  country.   One of those veterans was my good friend and fellow Plainview  Bulldog, Bill Mulder, after whom this bill was named. I am so proud  that this is named after Bill, and I am grateful to Sydney and their  family for allowing us to do so.                                time  1845    Bill was a true American hero who served his country with honor and  distinction. However, again, like many of our veterans, Bill returned  home from service with an internal struggle, with scars that you  couldn't see with the naked eye, and he was working through his  transition to civilian life after 20 years as a combat Navy SEAL. That  is tough. I can't imagine, to think about redefining your purpose and  your mission after 20 years of fighting for our freedom in combat as a  Navy SEAL.   Our country makes a tremendous investment, as Chairman Roe said, in  preparing our citizens to be freedom fighters, to be part of the  greatest fighting machine in the world, but we only invest a fraction  of that helping soldiers in their transition back to civilian life.   I have often said, like the gentleman has stated, that an ounce of  prevention is better than a pound of cure. And if we do a better job on  the front end in their transition, and especially identifying the  highest-risk individuals, I think that we can reduce the number of  veterans who struggle with unemployment, with homelessness, suicide, et  cetera.   This bill is the result, again, of Mr. Takano, Mr. O'Rourke, my  ranking member, my friend and fellow Texan, and it will make the  following improvements: It will improve in the sense that we will  engage our Active Duty personnel earlier in the process. We will have a  more comprehensive assessment, including mental health. We will  customize support for them.    It will not just be a one-size-fits-all, I think, like  we have seen in the past. We will also connect them back to community  organizations and we will track and we will measure the success and the  outcomes so we will know what is working, where we can continue to make  those investments.   Again, I want to thank my friend and fellow Texan, Mr. O'Rourke, for  working with me on this package, and Chairman Roe, and Mr. Walz for  helping bring this forward and to a vote here on the House floor.   I am proud to say that this bill is fully offset. It is budget  neutral, and I believe it will have a positive impact; in fact, I pray  it will actually save lives of our American veterans.   I urge all Members to support H.R. 5649, as amended.
