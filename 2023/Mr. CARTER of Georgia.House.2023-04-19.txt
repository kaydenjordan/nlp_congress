 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of  the bipartisan and bicameral H.R. 655, known as the Disaster  Reforestation Act. Specifically, this bill would eliminate the ``basis  limitation rule'' allowing landowners who farm trees with the intent of  sale to deduct the value of their timber loss from a natural disaster,  providing forest landowners financial recovery after a catastrophic  event.   There is currently no Federal program that allows timber farmers to  recoup the loss of their timber, leaving them with no way to  economically recover after a natural disaster.   Private forests in the U.S. are vital to rural economies, strong  domestic wood supply, and as a natural climate solution. Our Nation's  private forests act as our largest carbon sinks and are essential to  providing clean air and water.   Fixing this casualty loss issue would provide an immediate and  permanent solution for forest landowners to keep their forests working,  a vital part of rural economies.   Again, this is a bipartisan and bicameral bill, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 655, the Disaster  Reforestation Act.                            ____________________
