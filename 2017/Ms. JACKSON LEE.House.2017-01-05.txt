 Mr. Speaker, today, in the Senate, the other body,  unfortunately, joined the pathway of destruction for most Americans and  voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. These are not my words, the  pathway of destruction, but is evidence what will happen to millions  and millions of Americans. By repealing without a replacement, which  does not exist, insurance will be taken away from 32 million working  families. Now, some 4 million uninsured children will have no  insurance.   Let me be very clear that many of these individuals do not have  college degrees. Many of them, the voters of those who now will take  the rein of government. Healthcare premiums will increase by 50 percent  for millions of Americans. Hundreds of billions of dollars will go to  tax breaks for insurance companies while eliminating the tax credits  and subsidies for millions of working families.   It will take healthcare coverage away from millions of low- and  moderate-income Americans by cutting Medicaid, and it will close rural  hospitals and public hospitals that provide the lifeline for many  Americans. It will cut off Federal funds for health care for women  through Planned Parenthood. And yes, it will eliminate and have cuts in  Medicare and Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, this is a pathway of disaster. We should not repeal the  Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
