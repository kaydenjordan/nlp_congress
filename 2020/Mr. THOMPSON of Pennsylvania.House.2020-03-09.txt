 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and congratulate Scott Sheehan, a music teacher in Hollidaysburg,  Pennsylvania. Scott was recently elected to serve as president of the  National Association for Music Education, or NAfME.   NAfME is a membership organization of more than 60,000 individuals  who advocate for music education at the local, State, and national  levels. They provide resources for teachers, parents, and  administration who also champion music education.   Scott understands the value music adds to a child's education and a  child's life. He said: ``I foresee a future where every child can  achieve their creative musical potential and share their voice and  place in society through their artistic contributions.''   Scott taught all three of my sons music, and I know he will do a  great job in his new role at NAfME. The timing of this announcement is  particularly appropriate as March is National Music in Our Schools  Month.   I would like to thank Scott for his commitment to music education  over the years in teaching and wish him all the best of luck.                            ____________________
