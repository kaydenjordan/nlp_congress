 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the President's  senseless shutdown.   Over 5,000 Federal employees are affected in Michigan alone. These  dedicated Michiganders are confronted with: How do I put food on my  table? What bills will I pay? Which car or home payment can I afford?  Which prescription do I fill?   These are real questions my constituents are now asking themselves.   Throwing a temper tantrum and threatening to keep the government shut  down only reflects the President's lack of compassion for the citizens  of this great country.   In Michigan, programs that provide home heating assistance or  nutritional support for 1.5 million Michiganders are being held hostage  by this President.   Federal support for small businesses is on the line.   One in ten workers in Michigan relies on SNAP to put food on their  table.   Also, our highly esteemed veterans are waiting for us to do our job.   Every Democrat is devoted and committed to border safety. I will not  vote for and I will not fund an ineffective wall. I want real border  security.   I do support us doing our job. I just hope the President comes to his  senses and stops hurting our country and our constituents.
