 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.  Here we are, 3 days from a government shutdown voting again on extreme  Republican-led bills that do nothing to prevent it. The ink wasn't even  dry on the bipartisan debt ceiling bill deal before Republican  leadership reneged on their word, reneged on their promise.   Instead, the bills we are considering this week include disastrous  funding cuts and culture war priorities--priorities that apparently  play well in fundraising emails but fail to address our Nation's  problems like the opioid crisis.   This Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill would  dedicate $2 billion in taxpayer money to build a border wall--a 6th  century solution to a 21st century problem, especially considering 90  percent of fentanyl comes to the border at legal points of entry driven  by American citizens.   As a member of this subcommittee, I find this unbelievable.   Across the board, the Republicans' funding bill undercuts our ability  to take care of America today and build a brighter future for our  children and grandchildren.   It is about time the Republicans put the needs of the majority over  the loud few and pass a government funding bill that meets America's  needs.   Campaign season is over.    Campaign season is over. It is time to govern. I urge my  colleagues to reject this hyperpartisan bill and pass the bipartisan  Senate bill.
