 I call up my amendment No. 230, and ask that it be  reported by number.    Mr. President, Congress has passed an annual Defense  authorization bill for the past 62 years. This body--both parties-- takes seriously the threats our servicemembers face and the sacrifices  their families make.   To date, the Department of Defense has executed five audits--five  audits. No uniformed service has returned a clean audit, nor have major  offices and agencies within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.   By setting this deadline, we communicate Congress's seriousness on  this issue. We also communicate to the Secretary of Defense that we  believe this should be a priority of his and that we will hold him  responsible for failing to meet this deadline. In 4 years--4 years--we  must have a clean audit.   As the Department undergoes an extensive vital modernization and  seeks to take care of its people, policymakers must be able to debate  and consider the Department's budgetary priorities in a transparent  manner with  [[Page S3727]]  all the facts at our disposal. My cosponsor, Senator King, and I  believe DOD is doing the right things to be able to complete a full,  clean audit in the next 4 years. This amendment serves as a commonsense  communication of intense seriousness and urgency to the Department in a  practical manner.   I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I request a voice vote.
