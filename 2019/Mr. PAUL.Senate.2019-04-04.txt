 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I am all  for transparency. I think we should know as much about this  investigation into the President as we possibly can. We do know that we  only know part of the story and that the Mueller report is only part of  the story. What we also need to know is how this originated because I  think it is very important that we not turn our country into this back- and-forth where each successive party tries to use the apparatus of  government to investigate the previous President.   We do know now that the investigation of the Trump campaign reached  to the highest levels of the White House, all the way up to President  Obama. What we don't know is, was President Obama told that the  evidence to get this investigation started was paid for by the Hillary  Clinton campaign? We need to know that. That is not part of the Mueller  report, but that is something that I am asking that we should attach to  this resolution. We need to know, was President Obama told that this  information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign?   We do not yet know whether John Brennan was involved and to what  degree. We do not know whether John Brennan colluded with British spy  agencies to spy on Americans. It is illegal for our CIA to spy on  Americans. We don't yet know whether John Brennan was colluding with  British spy agencies and other spy agencies to get them to do his dirty  work.   We do know now that John Brennan, who had the power to listen to  every American's phone call and who had the power to listen to every  person's phone call in the entire world, is a rank partisan. We now  know that John Brennan has called the President a traitor, essentially  saying the President should be put to death. This is the guy who was in  charge of this investigation. This isn't an objective person. We need  to know about all of the communications.   So I ask unanimous consent that we modify this resolution and that we  find out about and gain access to all of the communications between  Comey, Brennan, Clapper, the White House, and President Obama, because  I don't want to ruin this great country with politically motivated  investigations year in and year out.   This had to do with placing spies and infiltrating the Trump  campaign. Do you really think that our intelligence Agencies should be  infiltrating each other's campaigns?   I don't want this to happen to a Democrat. When President Trump came  to the Hill a week ago, he said that this shouldn't happen to the next  Democratic President. We should not misuse the power of our  intelligence Agencies to have one party go after another. How can we  get on with the people's business if we are allowing the government to  be consumed with this kind of stuff?   I ask unanimous consent that we amend the resolution and look at the  entire story--not just at the investigation but at how we got here. The  media wouldn't even print this fake dossier because it was so  scandalous and so unverified and has turned out to be untrue. Yet this  was the basis for beginning the investigation. This was the basis for  doing something extraordinary--implanting spies and informants into the  Trump campaign.           Unanimous Consent Request Modification--H. Con. Res. 24    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we amend the resolution  and that as the Mueller report comes forward, we also come forward with  all of the communications between the people who got this started and  we discover once and for all whether or not these people have misused  their offices in starting this investigation.    Mr. President, I object.
