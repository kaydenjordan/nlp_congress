 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the passage of  the Veteran Service Recognition Act.   Shockingly, many noncitizen veterans have been unjustly deported  after honorable service. This is wrong. It is cruel, and it must stop.   Veterans risk their lives to protect our Nation, and now it is up to  us to honor their service regardless of their immigration status.   The historic passage of the Veteran Service Recognition Act honors  noncitizen veterans and servicemembers by giving them a fair shot at a  pathway to citizenship.   It puts veterans over politics. It honors service over politics. It  is fair, and it is the American way. That is why I was so proud to  strongly support this bill that passed on Tuesday.   It is now up to the Senate to show noncitizen veterans and  servicemembers the respect and dignity they deserve by passing the  Veteran Service Recognition Act.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to support people's  right to love and their equal protection under the law. The Respect for  Marriage Act will reaffirm marriage equality as the law of the land.   All Americans, no matter who they are and who they love, deserve  dignity and equal treatment under the law.   Madam Speaker, back home in my State of Texas, people are literally  scared. Entire families are considering fleeing Texas for fear of what  the MAGA GOP will do to their partners and their loved ones.   Earlier this year, the far-right Texas GOP declared homosexuality as  an abnormal lifestyle choice in their official platform. Yes, they put  it in their platform.   Last month, Texas Republicans pre-filed 17 bills targeting the LGBTQ+  community for our next legislative session in Texas.   To my LGBTQ constituents and neighbors back home, know that I am here  for you. House Democrats will not waver in our fight for human dignity  and equality under the law.
