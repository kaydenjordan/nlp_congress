 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and  classmate, Representative Cammack.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the Nation's self-inflicted  energy crisis created by the Biden administration.   The American people are feeling the strain of Biden's anti-energy  policies that are causing costs to skyrocket. Americans are paying 61  percent more nationally for a gallon of gas and heating costs are  projected to rise 54 percent this winter.   What actions has Biden taken to undo the damage he has caused?  [[Page H6840]]  Begged foreign countries to increase global output. Last week, he  tapped into our Nation's emergency reserve.   America will be less secure if we aren't properly stocked with  petroleum. We will be at a disadvantage financially and defensively,  making us increasingly dependent on countries like Russia and China.   Sadly, Madam Speaker, these policies place an undue burden on  Americans at a time when few can afford the extra expense. Inflated  prices on daily necessities are a tax on low- and middle-class  Americans, and Biden's continuous anti-energy policies impact virtually  every part of American lives.   Increasing domestic production of oil and gas would not only  consistently keep prices low, but also boost our economy, create jobs,  and preserve our energy security.
