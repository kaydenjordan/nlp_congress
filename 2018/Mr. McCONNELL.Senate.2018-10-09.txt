 Mr. President, first, I want to convey a few words of  thanks to our dedicated Ambassador to the United Nations, who we just  learned will be stepping down at the end of the year.   Our Nation has benefited greatly from the tough, skilled leadership  that Nikki Haley brought to the U.N. Her tenure will be remembered for  her proud reassertion of American moral leadership and her fearless  willingness to turn a bright spotlight on critical challenges, from  Israeli's sovereignty to Iran's sponsorship of regional violence.   Ambassador Haley has been a key part of the administration's team  that has faced down a wide variety of critical challenges, and she has  done so with distinction.   She took on this role after an impressive 6 years as Governor of  South Carolina and quickly proved to be both be a skillful advocate for  our national interest and a forceful spokeswoman for our principles.   I hope this is not the end of Ambassador Haley's distinguished career  in public service. I thank her for her significant contributions to our  country.                       Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday, I was pleased to attend  the ceremonial swearing-in for the newest member of our Supreme Court-- Justice Brett Kavanaugh.   Justice Kavanaugh's remarks yesterday affirmed yet again what his  record and his testimony clearly told us: He will be a thoughtful,  fairminded Justice who is committed to applying our laws and our  Constitution as they are actually written.   His confirmation last week was a victory for the very same principles  of fairness and justice we can now count on with him--along with his  fellow Justices--to uphold.   Saturday's vote was also a victory for the Senate--for this  institution--and for the integrity of this institution. Reason and  deliberation triumphed over what was literally--literally--an attempt  to sway the Senate using mob tactics. I wish this were an exaggeration,  but it isn't.   While many came to Washington peacefully to share their stories, the  loudest voices proved to be those of the politically motivated far  left--the same far left special interests that had pledged total  opposition to any Supreme Court nominee before the ink  [[Page S6704]]  was even dry on Justice Kennedy's retirement. They pulled out all the  stops. They did everything they could.   When it became clear Justice Kavanaugh's nomination would not be  stopped on the merits--well, as we know, that was only the beginning.  The far-left activists decided that the U.S. Senate and their Members  should be harassed and intimidated wherever they might be--in a  restaurant with family, getting out of their own car, or in their own  homes; anything went.   When they did not get their way, when these tactics failed to sway  us, they just turned up the anger even more. Protestors disregarded the  men and women of the Capitol Police, trampled barricades, stormed the  steps of the Capitol and the Supreme Court, climbed on statues, and  tried to literally shout down Senators right in the middle of a  rollcall vote in the Senate.   When the dust settled, literally hundreds of arrests had been made.  Extraordinary security measures were required to protect the Senate,  the Supreme Court, as well as the Kavanaugh family. Members of this  body and Senate staff have received threats of violence and murder.   After all that, I am afraid the far left had succeeded in only one  thing: They made it even more difficult for the vast majority of  Americans to take them seriously. They made it difficult for most  Americans to take these people seriously.   The madness hasn't stopped. They are already signaling that even more  drastic steps may be necessary now that Justice Kavanaugh is on the  Court.   Some leftwing publications are already trying to lay the groundwork  for--you guessed it--literally packing the Court with more Justices.  That is right. The far left has gone scrounging through the ash heap of  American history, and they are bandying about that discredited fantasy  from back in the 1930s.   In the meantime, while the groundwork is laid for that scheme, one  far-left pressure group is already trying to circulate petitions that  Justice Kavanaugh should be impeached--Justice Kavanaugh should be  impeached.   The mob would like to make themselves perfectly clear. If Democrats  were to retake Congress, ``progessives expect them to use their full  power to get Kavanaugh off the bench.''   So it is pretty obvious. The all-consuming animosity toward this  nominee, independent of all the facts and all the evidence, is still  being stoked. The far-left mob is not letting up.   Early today, former Secretary of State Clinton sent this signal as  clear as day--this is Secretary Clinton. She told CNN exactly how she  views millions of Americans who hold different political views from her  own. Here is what she said:         You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to       destroy what you stand for. . . . If we are fortunate enough       to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility       can start again.    No peace until they get their way? More of these unhinged tactics?   Apparently, this is the left's rallying cry, but fortunately the  American people know the fact-free politics of hate, fear, and  intimidation are not how we actually govern in our democratic Republic.   The Senate and the Nation will not be intimidated.                                   S. 3021    Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, earlier this year,  the President challenged us to seriously address our Nation's crumbling  infrastructure. We have wasted no time in Congress on working to tackle  this challenge in a bipartisan way.   Here are just a few highlights: The funding bill for fiscal 2018  included a $21 billion increase in infrastructure funding. We continue  to build on that significant commitment in our historic return to  regular appropriations for fiscal year 2019.   Just last week, we passed the longest FAA reauthorization in more  than three decades on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. This week, we  have the chance to keep the momentum going and advance another major  victory for the American infrastructure by passing America's Water  Infrastructure Act.   Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper deserve a lot of credit  for getting this important bipartisan legislation across the finish  line. Its importance for every State in our Nation really cannot be  overstated.   America's ports and inland waterways give our producers access to  markets around the world. For example, more than 60 percent of our  grain exports move through our inland waterways and so do other  commodities such as fuel, coal, and agricultural inputs.   No wonder the American Farm Bureau Federation wrote the Senate,  explaining that this legislation ``will put America's inland waterways  and port infrastructure on a solid and sustainable foundation to  contribute to U.S. economic growth, jobs and global competitiveness for  generations to come.''   This legislation covers big projects, like deepening ports and  ensuring the navigability of inland waterways, but it also focuses on  the unique challenges our local communities face. It will help ensure  access to functioning sewer systems and clean drinking water.   On the last point, there is good reason why the chairman of the EPW  Committee calls this legislation ``the most significant drinking water  infrastructure bill in decades.'' When you look at its contents, it is  hard to reach any other conclusion.   There is more support for our rural communities as they grapple with  aging water, sewer, and flood control infrastructure. The legislation  includes Senator Boozman's SRF-WIN Act, which puts low-interest  financing within reach for small and midsized rural communities, like  those in my home State of Kentucky.   For the first time in over 20 years, this legislation reauthorizes  Federal funding to States to help ensure the safety of our drinking  water.   The legislation also addresses environmental protection. To name just  one example, it includes an important effort championed by Senator  Rubio and Governor Scott to help address harmful algal blooms that have  plagued Florida's waterways. These are just a few of the significant  accomplishments this legislation secures. Dams and levees, flood  control for our communities, safe drinking water, and sewer systems in  communities big and small.    The bill before us addresses real needs in my State and across  America. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance  America's Water Infrastructure Act later today.                       Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh    Now, on one final matter, I would like to conclude where I started,  with a few words of thanks for a job well done. Justice Kavanaugh's  confirmation could not have happened without the tireless work of so  many. So while I certainly can't mention everyone who is deserving, I  wish to take a moment to express my gratitude.   First, of course, is President Trump himself, for sending to the  Senate such a talented and qualified nominee. He and Vice President  Pence are stalwart champions for the judiciary that the American people  deserve.   My deep gratitude also goes to White House Counsel Don McGahn.  Without Don's total dedication to ensuring that Judge Kavanaugh  received a fair hearing, we would not be where we are today.   Here in the Senate, I can't compliment enough our dear friend  Chairman Grassley for his leadership of the Judiciary Committee. He  balanced strong leadership with generosity and flexibility to all of  the Members. He oversaw the most thorough, painstaking review of a  Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history.   Supporting Chairman Grassley and the committee, I would like to  mention the following individuals: Staff Director Kolan Davis, Chief  Nominations Counsel Mike Davis, Steve Kenny, Lauren Mehler, Andrew  Ferguson, Taylor Foy, Rachel Mitchell, Katharine Willey, Jessica Vu,  George Hartman, Jill Kozeny, and Jennifer Heins in Senator Grassley's  office, and an entire team of outstanding staff.   Thanks are also due to the Republican Whip, Senator Cornyn, and his  excellent team, led by Monica Popp, and also to all of the dedicated  floor staff who make this body function: Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and  the entire cloakroom team; the Secretary of the Senate,  Parliamentarians, clerks, reporters of debates, Sergeant at Arms, and  our doorkeepers.   On my own team, I really cannot imagine this process--or really, my  office, at all--without the crucial leadership of Sharon Soderstrom, my  chief of  [[Page S6705]]  staff. She works harder and achieves more, under more pressure, than  almost anyone I have ever had the privilege of working with.   Don Stewart, my deputy chief of staff, is the expert hand who helps  keep us on course and shapes our communications strategy. Hazen  Marshall, my policy director, helped to keep this and other priorities  on track, including the other bipartisan policy wins the Senate  delivered during the nomination debate.   John Abegg is my chief counsel and right-hand man for every step of  this process. For 15 weeks, John poured his determination, his  experience, and his wisdom into this process. He started working the  moment Justice Kennedy announced he was stepping down and did not stop  until the gavel fell. We wouldn't be here without his work.   I am grateful to my policy advisers, my communications team, and my  operations staff for all the hard work and late nights they poured into  this process, and to Phil Maxson and my personal office team for their  assistance.   But most important of all, I need to close with this. To the men and  women of the United States Capitol Police and to all of the other law  enforcement officers who kept Members, staff, and citizens safe, even  in extremely difficult and often hostile circumstances, we really can't  thank them enough. Our representative government and the rule of law  depend on their dedication, their bravery, and their sacrifice. So  thank you so much for keeping the Senate safe.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following leader remarks on Wednesday,  October 10, Senator Schumer or his designee be recognized to make a  motion to proceed to S.J. Res 63; further that the time until 11:30  a.m. be equally divided between the leaders or their designees for use  on the joint resolution and message concurrently; further, that at  11:30 a.m., all postcloture time on the motion to concur in the House  amendments be considered expired and the motion to concur with further  amendment be withdrawn; finally, that following the disposition of the  motion to concur, all time on S.J. Res 63 be considered expired and the  Senate vote on the joint resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, October 10; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that the  Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:01 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, October 10, 2018, at 10 a.m.
