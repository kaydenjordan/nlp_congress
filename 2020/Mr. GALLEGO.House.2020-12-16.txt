 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7105. This  important package includes a bill I authored, H.R. 4908, the Native  American Veteran PACT Act.   Native people have fought in every American war since the American  Revolution, more than a century before they were even granted  citizenship.   When I served in Iraq, I fought alongside Navajo marines, some of the  best marines you will ever meet. I have witnessed, firsthand, Native  communities' tradition of service to America, which is why I introduced  the PACT Act, to make sure America keeps its promises to these heroes.   The PACT Act would prohibit the VA from charging copays to Native  American veterans. The United States Government has a treaty obligation  to provide healthcare to Native Americans free of charge.                                time  1515    Despite this, the VA has long charged Native veterans  unconstitutional copayments for their care. That should end today.   Now more than ever, in the midst of a health crisis that has been  disproportionately affecting Native people, we need to make sure that  Native veterans have access to the healthcare they are due, both as  veterans and as members of Tribal nations.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important provision to uphold our trust responsibility and to vote  ``yes'' on the underlying package.
