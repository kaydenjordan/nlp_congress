 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this historic  families and workers-first legislation.   My own community is an epicenter of the coronavirus. Families in the  Lower Hudson Valley--as in other areas of the country--have lost loved  ones, and even as we all hunker down for our lives, too many fear that  their livelihoods are still at risk when this crisis ends.   Congress must come together in this historic, bipartisan way to meet  this crisis head-on and ease some of the burden on our communities.  This legislation will provide increased testing capacity, personal  protective equipment for health workers, funding for hospitals and  health care providers, and research and development on vaccines and  therapeutics as well as much needed resources for small businesses,  schools, and state and local governments.   This country is resilient, and I am pleased that this third package  will give hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance to help  Westchester and Rockland Counties recover from this pandemic.   We must send this bill to the President's desk today to reassure the  American people that the federal government is united in protecting  every American's health and economic security.
