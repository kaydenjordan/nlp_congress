 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my chief of staff is a former naval captain who  commanded the aircraft carrier USS Constellation in the 1990s. I once  asked him what was the most important thing he had learned during his  distinguished naval career, and he said: The first reports are always  wrong.   That is why I would urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to  take a step back and await the investigations that are now underway to  determine exactly what happened at the Irwin County Detention Center,  lest they appear in retrospect to have behaved, well, rather  prematurely and foolishly.   This resolution affirms allegations that women detained by ICE for  the crime of illegally crossing the border underwent unwanted,  unnecessary medical procedures, including full or partial  hysterectomies and other procedures involving their reproductive organs  performed without their knowledge or consent.   Well, if that is true, it is appalling, and those responsible should  be held fully accountable.   The acting ICE Director, Tony Pham, said precisely that on September  18. He said: ``The recent allegations by the independent contracted  employee raised some very serious concerns that deserve to be  investigated quickly and thoroughly. ICE welcomes the efforts of both  the Office of Inspector General as well as the Department of Homeland  Security's parallel review.   ``As a former prosecutor, individuals found to have violated our  policies and procedures should be held accountable. If there is any  truth to these allegations, it is my commitment to make the corrections  necessary to ensure that we continue to prioritize the health, welfare,  and safety of ICE detainees.''   Of course, this resolution makes no acknowledgment of Mr. Pham's  statement or of the investigations that are now underway.   The reality is, at this point, we do not have all the facts.   We do know that the complaint by the group Project South, which  instigated the allegations, did not contain testimony from a single  woman who had a hysterectomy while detained at the Irwin County  Detention Facility.   We know that ICE has an annual third-party inspection of its  detention facilities, including the medical care at those facilities.   We know that ICE has performance-based national detention standards,  which include high standards for women's medical care.   We know that the 2019 third-party inspection conducted by the  Nakamoto Group found that the Irwin County Detention Center met ICE's  performance-based national detention standards.   We know that on September 18 the Associated Press reported: ``The  AP's review did not find evidence of mass hysterectomies as alleged in  a widely shared complaint filed by a nurse at the detention center.''   That is the Associated Press.                                time  0930    We know that on September 22, The Washington Post reported that since  2017, only two women in immigration custody were referred to the Irwin  County Hospital for hysterectomies and that there are no other  facilities in the region that perform that procedure. ICE reports there  may have been three. But the attorney for the hospital calls the claims  that we have just heard demonstrably false. His words, ``demonstrably  false.''   We know that on September 15, The Washington Post reported that the  lawyer who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the pro-illegal-immigration  group ``acknowledged to The Washington Post that she did not speak to  any women who had a forced sterilization, and said she included the  allegations in the report with the intention of triggering an  investigation into whether or not the claims were true.''   Whether or not the claims were true. Well, we are going to find out,  and once we have all the facts, we can make rational decisions about  what to do, but this resolution simply assumes the allegations are true  and condemns the institution as if they were true. It then calls for  indefinite postponement of the deportation of any illegal immigrant at  this facility that has any medical procedure, which I assume would  include routine medical screenings.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask the House this very simple question:  Wouldn't it be better to let the investigation take its course, have  all the facts laid out before us, and then take appropriate actions?   If the allegations are true, every bit of the indignation expressed  in this resolution and by my Democratic colleagues would be justified,  and a united, bipartisan Congress would demand and command redress and  reform.   But if the allegations are found not to be true, this House, that is  already plumbing the depths of public ridicule and derision, will once  again have diminished its credibility and its moral authority to speak  out on this or any other issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, John Adams' famous observation bears repeating here  today.   He said: ``Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes,  our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter  the state of facts and evidence.''   We have heard a great deal from the other side about their passions,  but we don't have all the facts. That is what the ongoing  investigations will provide us.   The facts that stubbornly present themselves on this matter here  today are that the AP found no evidence of mass hysterectomies at this  facility. The hospital that performs them for the facility reports that  two have been performed on ICE detainees since 2017. The hospital tells  us the allegations are demonstrably false--demonstrably--in other  words, they can prove it. The attorney who made the allegations that  have given rise to this debate today admitted to The Washington Post  that they were not based on any evidence and that she included them  ``whether or not true'' to prompt the investigation.   All the wishes and inclinations on the other side to abolish ICE,  repeal our immigration laws, throw our borders open, all the other  things that have been proposed from time to time and all of the  vitriolic passions we have heard from the other side today cannot alter  the state of facts and evidence.   More facts and evidence will be presented to us as the investigation  unfolds, and that will tell us exactly what happened at this facility.  I would strongly advise my friends to await the investigation to inform  us and to guide us.   My Democratic colleagues are fond of saying that we must always  follow the data. Mr. Speaker, I now commend to them their own advice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which  condemns an extremist group known as QAnon.   I have to admit that I had only recently heard of this group, but I  didn't know any of the details of their beliefs or tactics until this  resolution was brought to us. But from what I have read, they are a  delusional group that began with an internet post in 2017, and they  hold the bizarre belief that the Federal Government is infested with  satanic pedophiles who are busy running a global child sex trafficking  ring when they are not plotting against President Trump.   Now, I am tempted to say you can't make this stuff up, but,  obviously, somebody did make this up; and, given the reach of the  internet, it is apparently being taken seriously by some extremists who  are turning to violence.   Lest it get out of hand, it is appropriate for the House to speak  with one voice on behalf of all of our communities across this great  Nation in condemning QAnon and its conspiracy  [[Page H5654]]  theories. It should be clear to every man and woman of goodwill in this  country that this group seeks only to further roil our society and  divide our citizens along lines of race, religion, and politics.   Even in this highly polarized political climate, I think we can all  agree on this. Let me ask us all to do so without attempting to smear  any party or candidate with the ravings from this, the lunatic fringe,  of our society.   That term, ``lunatic fringe,'' was popularized by Theodore Roosevelt.  He wrote this in his autobiography: ``Then, among the wise and high- minded people who in self-respecting and genuine fashion strive  earnestly for peace, there are the foolish fanatics always to be found  in such a movement and always discrediting it, the men who form the  lunatic fringe in all reform movements.''   He continued: ``As I have already said, there is a lunatic fringe to  every reform movement.''   We have seen that borne out in the turbulent period of history that  we now occupy, and how we deal with it will determine whether we can  calm the political waters and restore peace and tranquility to our  cities and civil discourse to our conversations.   In that regard, it is important to note that QAnon and the lunatic  fringe on the right no more speak for the right than antifa and the  lunatic fringe on the left speak for the left. Both are poisonous to  our democratic institutions, and both are destructive of what  Lincoln called the mystic chords of memory that should unite us as a  free people.    So allow me to voice my hope that we will see similar condemnations  of the lunatic fringe that has been given free rein in recent months to  rampage, loot, vandalize, and burn so many of our towns and cities  across the country.   QAnon and its allied groups are real, but antifa and its allied  groups are also real. Both are direct threats to our democracy because  both threaten to employ violence for political ends, and that is the  very definition of terrorism. No free society can long endure if their  acts of violence are excused, ignored, or tolerated.   Lincoln said it best: There is no grievance that is fit object for  redress by mob law. To that, I would add this observation: Without law  enforcement, there is no law; and without law, there is no  civilization.   I would express the fervent hope that, before we adjourn, we will  entertain condemnations of all groups on all sides that employ violence  for political ends by name.   Wednesday night, the Rules Committee rejected a motion on a party- line vote that would have brought to the floor a resolution condemning  antifa and its allied groups concurrent with this resolution. That  would demonstrate that this House speaks clearly and stands united  against all such groups that have wrought such division and destruction  in our communities.                                time  1015    That is especially important when we survey the violence perpetrated  by the lunatic fringe in Portland; Seattle; San Francisco; Oakland; Los  Angeles; Chicago; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Louisville,  Kentucky; Minneapolis; and even Kenosha, Wisconsin.   It is especially important when the mayors of these cities have  withheld police protection from their own citizens, leaving innocent  and peaceful shopkeepers and residents to the mercy of mob law and when  prosecutors have refused to hold accountable those who have perpetrated  this violence upon the American people.   There is precious little time before the election to take a stand  clearly and unambiguously against all political violence and with one  voice to stand with the rule of law and not with the rule of the mob.  If we could speak together on this most important issue, maybe we could  start to find our way back to other fundamental principles and  institutions that have always united us as a people and made our  Nation, in Lincoln's words, the last best hope of mankind on this  Earth.   So, please, my Democratic friends, do not squander this fleeting  opportunity to turn back from the perilous road we are on and reclaim  the precious legacy our forefathers left us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Riggleman), a cosponsor of this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  will close as I began.   Extremist groups on the right and the left that advocate violence as  a method of achieving political goals threaten the very foundations of  our democracy, and I fully support this resolution in its denunciation  of one such group called QAnon.   But the American people can see with their own eyes where the  violence on our streets is coming from, and I deeply regret that the  majority is not willing to call out by name such groups as antifa or to  acknowledge that such evil forces even exist. We must speak out  together against all such groups, and I am deeply troubled that, for  some reason, we cannot.   We need to know who is funding these groups. We can already see with  our own eyes who is encouraging them.   We can see with our own eyes whose mayors have deliberately withheld  police protection from their citizens as these extremist-driven mobs  run rampant in our communities.   We can see with our own eyes those politicians calling for defunding  police departments that are the only means of defense that our citizens  have.   We can see with our own eyes those prosecutors who have refused to  hold accountable those who perpetrate violence in our communities and  who instead prosecute citizens who are desperately trying to defend  themselves.   So, I am pleased to support this resolution, but it is no substitute  for a clear and unambiguous stand against all political extremism and  violence that this House, for some reason, refuses to take.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
