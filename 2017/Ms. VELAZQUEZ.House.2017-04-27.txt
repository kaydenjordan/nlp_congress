 Mr. Speaker, while my Republican colleagues take their  sweet time passing a bill to fund the government, Puerto Rico is  watching its Medicaid funds evaporate.   In this package, we must provide sufficient resources to address this  shortfall from the funding authorized under the ACA that is already  owed to the people of Puerto Rico.   I remind Congress the funding under discussion would close a Medicaid  shortage that was created by the unequal treatment of American citizens  in Puerto Rico, fueling a healthcare crisis of historic proportions.   Last year, Speaker Paul Ryan committed to helping the people of  Puerto Rico. As he, himself, recognized, these are our fellow citizens.   Yes, Mr. President, they are American citizens. They have fought,  shed blood, and given their lives in nearly every major war, yet they  have been treated unfairly for decades.   Donald Trump's own HHS Secretary recently acknowledged Puerto Rico  needs $900 million to fund Medicaid. For once, I agree with the  Secretary.                            ____________________
