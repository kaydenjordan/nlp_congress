 Mr. Speaker, I thank my great colleague from  California and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their leadership on a subject of urgency.   Mr. Speaker, in the strongest terms possible, I urge support of this  bipartisan legislation called the PRIVATE Act that makes it illegal for  military members to share explicit photos without consent.   Our Democratic Working Women's Group recently held a bipartisan  hearing regarding the Marine United Facebook page where male marines  posted thousands of nude photos of female servicemembers and veterans  without their consent.   At this hearing, we heard the testimony of two courageous female  marines whose privacy was violated with the nonconsensual posting of  intimate photographs. They described their embarrassment, their anger,  and the vitriolic harassment by their marine brothers that followed,  with threats of rape and violence, and stomach-sickening posts like:  ``We should throw female Marines into a tub of acid and rip off their  eyelashes.''   Mr. Speaker, I am the proud mother of a United States Marine veteran,  so I can tell you, I understand firsthand the selfless sacrifice a  marine makes when he or she puts on their uniform.   So I say to those warriors whose honor was violated: We stand with  you today to declare that you were targets of behavior that we will not  tolerate; and we will seek to punish those who offended and prevent  similar conduct in the future because that conduct is not only  degrading to brave patriots, it threatens the safety and security of  our Nation.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.
