 Madam Speaker, I am so very proud to rise in strong  support of H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act.   At the heart and the core of this bill are 2.5 million people who are  American in every single way but paper. Dreamers, and those with  temporary protective status and DED, are integral parts of our  communities and families; a community of strivers who have given and  will continue to contribute to America in the finest of our traditions  as a Nation.   Over 400,000 U.S. citizens live in a household with TPS holders. They  own homes in our communities and fill critical workforce gaps central  to our economic and community development, including in construction,  food service and landscaping.   And Dreamers, too, have long-called the United States their home. One  of those Dreamers is Esther, who interned in my office last year.   Esther came to the United States on a visa when she was 3 years old  from South Korea. Her parents sought to obtain more permanent legal  status. They gave an immigration lawyer most of their money, and he ran  away with all of it. Esther's parents' visas expired.   They pushed their kids around in a shopping cart because a stroller  was too expensive. But they started over and they built their lives  here, raising a smart, passionate daughter who went to Harvard.   The DACA status that Esther obtained in 2013 helped her to pursue her  own American dream. And this bill would give her, and so many millions  more, true freedom.   At the core of this bill, Madam Speaker, is the dignity and respect  that we accord to human beings, the way in which we see people and  exercise our own compassion.   We have a rare opportunity today to provide permanent protections for  Dreamers and TPS and DED holders, not just for them, but also for the  approximately 1 million U.S.-born children whose parents would get  permanent protection.   This is a first step, not a last. We must stop criminalizing  immigrants at every turn, even as we willingly accept their labor and  contributions.   We cannot allow xenophobia and racism to permeate our country from  its top ranks. We must continue the work to pass germane and just,  comprehensive immigration reform that provides a roadmap to citizenship  for 11 million undocumented immigrants, strengthens family-based  immigration, and protects workers' rights on the job.    But today, Madam Speaker, we have a chance to right real wrongs for  these young people and TPS and DED holders. And I thank Chairman  Nadler, the incredible Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee  Chairwoman, Zoe Lofgren, and my colleagues, Representatives Roybal- Allard, Velazquez, and Clarke for their hard work to bring this  forward.   I also thank our staffers--including mine--Jennifer Chan in my  office, but most of all, Madam Speaker, I thank the Dreamers, TPS and  DED holders, families, friends, and advocates, many of whom are here in  this Chamber.    Madam Speaker, I thank the Dreamers, TPS and DED  holders, the families, friends and advocates, many of whom are right  here in this Chamber with us.   Thank you for your courage in speaking out.   Thank you for demanding a different and more just future for our  country.   Thank you for knowing that we always make the road by walking and for  never giving up.   Madam Speaker, we have a chance to affirm the hope and promise of  America. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
