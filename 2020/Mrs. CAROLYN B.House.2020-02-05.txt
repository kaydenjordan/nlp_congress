MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   The Representative Payee Fraud Prevention Act is a commonsense  bipartisan bill that would protect recipients of Federal pensions from  unscrupulous representatives who use the money for their own benefit  instead of the retirees'. Currently, representative payees can receive  pension benefits on behalf of a recipient who is a minor, is designated  mentally incompetent, or has another disability.   Embezzlement or conversion of Social Security and veterans benefits  by a representative payee is a Federal felony. However, there is no  Federal penalty in current law for representative payees who embezzle  or convert Federal retirement benefits to their own use.   The Representative Payee Fraud Prevention Act would close this  loophole and apply the same penalties to those representative payees  who misuse Federal pension benefits. We must ensure that those who have  spent their careers in public service receive the benefits they have  earned.   I want to thank my friend and colleague, Representative Tlaib, for  her hard work, along with Representative Meadows. It is a bipartisan  effort on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 5214. I thank Elijah Cummings for his hard work on this bill, too,  and my colleagues, Mr. Meadows and Ms. Tlaib, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3830) to provide taxpayers with an  improved understanding of Government programs through the disclosure of  cost, performance, and areas of duplication among them, leverage  existing data to achieve a functional Federal program inventory, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3830         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the  measure before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and would like to thank Congressmen  Walberg and Cooper for their hard work on it.   The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act is a bipartisan and commonsense  solution that would help identify areas of inefficiency in the Federal  Government. The bill would create an inventory of Federal programs that  would be published on a government website and updated regularly. The  information in the inventory would also be archived.   Previous attempts at getting information from agencies on Federal  programs have yielded incomplete and varied results, since agencies  often have different ways of defining Federal programs.   This bill aims to provide streamlined and uniformed insight into the  activities of programs governmentwide. The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act  would require agencies to report on the spending, authorization, and  purpose of a Federal program's activities. Information would also be  required on any awards of financial assistance. Access to enhanced  information would result in greater transparency into duplicative or  inefficient programs.   This bill would also provide a means to test a way in which this  comprehensive inventory of Federal programs would be achieved across  the Federal Government. It would require the Office of Management and  Budget to report on how existing agency data would be used to create  the program inventory or explain how the data will be presented and the  results of a pilot program.   Mr. Speaker, I support this good government measure, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  from North Carolina has no further speakers, I am prepared to close.    MALONEY of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2382) to amend title 5, United States  Code, to repeal the requirement that the United States Postal Service  prepay future retirement benefits, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2382         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Subsection (d) of section 8909a of title 5, United States       Code, is repealed.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the U.S. Postal Service Fairness  Act, which I am a very proud cosponsor, would make a small but very  important change to help address the dire financial condition of the  Postal Service.   Common law requires the Postal Service to prefund the healthcare  costs of its future retirees decades into the future. We are aware of  no other entity, public or private, that faces this type of onerous  financial burden. This mandate has cost the Postal Service billions of  dollars since it was first imposed 14 years ago. The Postal Service has  not made a payment into this fund since 2012.   This bill won't solve all the Postal Service's financial problems.  Eliminating the mandate will take some paper liabilities off the books  of the Postal Service, but it will do nothing to improve its cash  position.   Without major structural reforms, the Postal Service will run out of  cash in about 4 years. At that point, it will not be able to pay its  own workers, and mail delivery would simply cease.   The Postal Service has taken significant steps to control its costs,  including shrinking its workforce by close to 300,000 employees over  the past 20 years. Yet, it has incurred net annual losses for 13  straight years.   The Postal Service currently funds universal mail service to nearly  159 million delivery points solely through the sale of postage. It is  required to expand its network to deliver mail to approximately 1  million new addresses every year, even as the volume of mail continues  to decline by a projected 45 billion mail pieces over the next decade.   So while I support this bill, more must be done to stabilize the  finances of this important American institution on which so much of our  population relies.   The Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Congressman Connolly in  particular, is working on comprehensive legislation to do just that. We  will continue to work on comprehensive legislation after this bill  passes.   Finally, I thank my good friend, Mr. DeFazio, for his tireless,  passionate advocacy for this bill. I also thank Mr. Reed and Mr.  Fitzpatrick, on the other side of the aisle, as well as Ms. Torres  Small, for all of their hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the author of the  legislation.    MALONEY of New York.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the  measure before us.  [[Page H818]]     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I thank my colleagues and friends, Representatives Connolly and  Meadows, for their bipartisan work on this very important measure.   The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Authorization  Act would codify and improve the existing FedRAMP program in the  General Services Administration.   First established in 2011, FedRAMP is an important program that  certifies cloud service providers that wish to offer services to the  Federal Government. The FedRAMP certification process outlined in this  bill is comprehensive and facilitates easier agency adoption, promotes  agency reuse, and encourages savings.   The FedRAMP process uses a risk-based approach to ensure the  reliability of any cloud platform that hosts unclassified government  data. A significant provision of this bill is the Federal Secure Cloud  Advisory Committee. This committee would be tasked with key  responsibilities, including providing technical expertise on cloud  products and services and identifying ways to reduce costs associated  with FedRAMP certification.   The Director of the Office of Management and Budget would be required  to issue regulations pertaining to FedRAMP and would ensure that  agencies are not using cloud service providers without authorization.   This bill supports a critical effort to keep our Nation's information  secure in cloud environments.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much  time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly),  chair of the subcommittee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   I urge passage of H.R. 3941, as amended, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 375) to improve efforts to identify and  reduce Governmentwide improper payments, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 375         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the  measure before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Improper payments include overpayments, underpayments, payments to  the incorrect recipient, and those that lack proper documentation. They  are a longstanding and significant problem in the Federal Government.  In fiscal year 2018 alone, they totaled more than $151 billion.   Congress has passed a number of laws over the past two decades to try  and address this problem, but the problem, unfortunately, persists.   S. 375, the Payment Integrity Information Act, would consolidate the  existing and proper payment laws in one place in the U.S. Code and make  several changes to help identify and reduce improper payments. It would  require agencies to develop plans to prevent improper payments and also  to identify programs with the highest risk.   It would also require the Office of Management and Budget and  inspectors general to offer guidance on how to improve annual reporting  on improper payments.   Finally, the bill will create a working group of Federal agencies and  non-Federal partners to develop strategies for addressing the key  causes of improper payments, such as fraud and eligibility  determination in State-managed Federal benefits programs.   I thank Senators Tom Carper, Ron Johnson, Gary Peters, and Mike Braun  for their good work on this commonsense measure. I commend Senator  Carper for his longstanding dedication to reducing improper payments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure  to reduce waste and fraud in Federal programs, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig), the House sponsor for  this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  S. 375, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the  measure before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as  much time as I may consume.   The Presidential Transition Enhancement Act would make a number of  important changes to the transition process when a new President is  elected.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their  hard work on this issue.   Many of the provisions in the bill before us today were introduced in  the House by our late chairman, Elijah Cummings, in the Transition Team  Ethics Improvement Act.   Most importantly, the bill would strengthen the ethics requirements  for transition team members.   The Government Accountability Office issued a report in 2017 about  President Trump's Presidential transition.  [[Page H827]]  GAO reported that the Trump transition team required team members to  sign an ethics code of conduct but failed to designate a transition  team member responsible for enforcing it.   Ethics plans are important for Presidential transitions because  Presidents-elect often hire transition team members who work in the  private sector, but unlike Federal employees, private-sector employees  are not subject to Federal ethics laws.   This bill would require eligible Presidential candidates to agree to  enforce ethics plans during the transition period. The bill includes  core elements of what those ethics plans should include, such as a  description of how the transition team will address participation by  lobbyists and individuals working for foreign governments.   The bill would also require that transition teams make the ethics  plans they adopt publicly available. It also includes provisions to  ensure that nonpublic information remains confidential and is not used  in any way for personal gain.   The bill would clarify the responsibility of the General Services  Administration during a transition by requiring a memorandum of  understanding between the agency and the Presidential transition team.  Finally, the bill would allow GSA to provide transition services for up  to 60 days after an inauguration.   These provisions would help ensure smoother transitions than we have  had in the past.   I am very glad this is a bipartisan bill. The Senate approved this  bill without any opposition.   The peaceful transition of power from one party to another is a  cornerstone of our democratic system. We must do all we can to ensure  the integrity of that process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  this bill, S. 394, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3976) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 12711 East Jefferson Avenue  in Detroit, Michigan, as the ``Aretha Franklin Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3976         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ARETHA FRANKLIN POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 12711 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit,       Michigan, shall be known and designated as the ``Aretha       Franklin Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Aretha Franklin Post Office Building''.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3976, to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located  at 12711 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, as the Aretha  Franklin Post Office Building.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Brenda  Lawrence, for introducing this important measure to honor a cultural  and civil rights heroine.   Aretha Franklin, the ``Queen of Soul,'' was an American singer,  songwriter, pianist, and civil rights activist from Detroit, Michigan.  Over her career, Aretha Franklin was awarded 18 Grammy awards, along  with various lifetime achievement recognitions.   Her unique vocal style not only influenced generations of future  singers, but it also earned her the number one spot on Rolling Stone  magazine's list of the Greatest Singers of All Time.   Aretha Franklin was also a champion for civil rights and women's  rights. She frequently donated to civil rights groups, and two of her  biggest hits, ``Respect'' and ``You Make Me Feel Like a Natural  Woman,'' became anthems for social change movements across the country.   In 1987, she was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and  Roll Hall of Fame. She also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom  from President George W. Bush in 2005.   Aretha Franklin died of advanced pancreatic cancer on August 16,  2018, in Detroit, Michigan. Naming a post office in the city she  cherished so fondly would recognize her important cultural and civic  accomplishments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence),  the author of this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3976. I had the opportunity to  meet Aretha Franklin several times. She was a great friend of Charlie  Rangel and would often perform for his events. She very generously gave  her time to raise money for all kinds of civic rights events. She was a  remarkable person and a great singer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this important legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York: Committee on Oversight       and Reform. H.R. 3941.
