Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, I rise today in support of Jay Clayton,  who has been nominated to serve on the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission. In the interest of time, I will save my longer remarks for  later.   As demonstrated at the Banking Committee's nomination hearing, Mr.  Clayton is eminently qualified to serve on the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission, or the SEC.   He impressed both Republicans and Democrats and was voted out of  committee on a bipartisan vote of 15 to 8. His extensive expertise and  experience in our financial markets will be a benefit to the Commission  and to the American people.   His testimony about the need to make our capital markets more  attractive, which would rejuvenate their ability to invest in the  United States and grow and create jobs, was well received.  Additionally, he pledged to members of this committee and to the  American people that he will show no favoritism to anyone.   While some have raised issues about his previous work potentially  creating conflicts, Mr. Clayton is not new in this regard, nor will he  be any less vigilant to ensure that he acts appropriately and  ethically.   I will be supporting his nomination and look forward to having him at  the SEC, where he can help protect and promote the success of our  security markets and our investors.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Moran). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
