 Madam Speaker, imagine fleeing your home,  journeying through the desert in search of refuge. Imagine having your  child ripped away from you. Imagine learning that your kids are hungry,  unbathed, cold, screaming from cages, wrapped in foil blankets.   Yesterday, news broke of children being sexually assaulted at a Yuma  detention facility. What I have described is a reality here, and it is  un-American.   I represent a border district in southern Arizona. I have met with  Border Patrol, migrant advocacy groups, faith-based organizations, and  city leaders. I have been proud to see our community work together in  powerful ways. Our Tucson community has shown more humane leadership  than Federal departments led by the Trump administration.   We must be vigilant and protect humanitarian rights, and we must  remind our neighbors that humanitarian aid is not a crime.  [[Page H5314]]    I stand with Scott Warren. I stand with all the organizations helping  migrant families. I will continue to ask tough questions and fight to  hold this administration accountable.                            ____________________
