 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, one dollar--one dollar--that is the  amount that the Speaker of the House said she would be willing to  invest in physical barriers at our southern border--one dollar. Talk  about serious, good-faith negotiations. Talk about taking borders  seriously.   The men and women on the ground have been unambiguous about the  crisis they are facing: the entry of criminal aliens and gang members  into our country, the drugs that go on to infect our communities, the  ongoing humanitarian crises that are fueled by our government's mixed  signals and our inability to enforce our own laws.   According to Speaker Pelosi, these urgent issues are worth about 33  cents each--33 cents. As we all know, that is because the Speaker has  recently defined a brandnew dogma for the Democratic Party: Actually  enforcing our immigration laws with the help of physical barriers is  ``an immorality''--an immorality.   That is quite the indictment of her fellow Democrats' past positions.  Recent years have seen Democrats vote for billions--billions--of  dollars in physical walls and fencing. Recent years have seen a  Democratic administration build the same steel barriers--the very same  steel barriers--that this President now wants to expand.   But these days, it seems that Democrats are happy to take their cues  from the gentlelady from San Francisco and her extreme, fringe position  that walls have now become immoral. Really?   Yesterday, President Trump issued yet another bipartisan invitation  for Members of Congress to meet at the White House and actually  negotiate. Yet, again, only Republicans came to the table.   For the American people, who deserve both a functioning government as  well as a secure border, that really is not a promising sign. For  Federal workers who are now stretching every dollar until Democrats  lose interest in dead-end political games, the Speaker's $1 punchline  is not very entertaining.   So for everyone's sake, I hope our Democratic colleagues will reverse  course and work seriously with this White House to reach an agreement  that can become law and fulfill our promises to our country.   In the meantime, as the White House made clear just yesterday,  cherry-picking continuing resolutions that fail to  [[Page S234]]  address the border crisis will not receive the President's signature.  They are not going to.   The only way out of this impasse is a bipartisan agreement, and as  the Democratic leader and I have both stated here on the floor, only an  all-corners bipartisan agreement will receive a vote here in the  Senate.                                 S.J. Res. 2    Mr. President, on another matter, before the Senate today is a  resolution from the Democratic leader that would overrule career civil  servants at the Treasury Department and fire from the hip on one of the  top foreign policy concerns of the United States.   This is the pending business, despite the fact that the Democratic  leader had previously proclaimed he would not let the Senate address  any business--any--during this partial government shutdown. Apparently  there is an exception to that.   Remember, that was the reason the Democratic leader gave for leading  a Democratic filibuster of a bipartisan package that would have  reaffirmed our commitment to defend our allies in Israel, stand  alongside Jordan, and unlock justice for the victims of Assad's rogue  regime.   On one day, they insist we shouldn't do any business; on another, it  is time to bring up an unrelated resolution of their own. At the end of  the last Congress, they said they would support bipartisan legislation  to shore up our allies in the Middle East and deliver justice for  victims of unspeakable violence in Syria. Now they are filibustering  the bill and have voted against it three times--three times against  this potential bill that benefits our allies Israel and Jordan and  deals with the victims of cruelty in Syria.   These twists and turns are pretty hard to follow, confusing, until  you remember the one key to our Democratic colleagues' thinking these  days--political spite for the President comes first, ahead of  everything else.   You see, the administration isn't opposed to these bipartisan, urgent  bills to back Israel, Jordan, and the Syrian people. President Trump,  we expect, would sign these bills. We might actually make a law, which  is what people sent us here to do, presumably.   Naturally, the Democratic leader isn't interested. Democrats in  Congress don't think working with the President to accomplish things  suits their political brand these days.   The Democratic leader's new resolution, which he has been happy to  prioritize ahead of Israel and the Syrian people, offers him a chance  to make a political splash. It overrules the careful actions of career  civil servants at Treasury and blows up a nuanced decision the current  law actually requires. Current law actually requires what they do.   Supporting Israel? It is not too interesting to my friends across the  aisle, but picking a political fight with the President, boy, they are  up for that one every day.   This is the key to understanding this unusual moment. This is the  central principle. Democrats have made a marketing decision to obstruct  President Trump at all costs, even if it hurts substantive priorities  they used to support. That is why we are in day 26 of this partial  government shutdown, with Democrats refusing to even show up and  negotiate on funds for border security, which they used to brag about  supporting. That is why Senate Democrats have decided that aid for  Israel and help for the people of Syria are not worthy of this body's  time but are happy to spend more time trying to blow up a highly  technical Treasury Department decision that current law actually  requires.   Let me say that again. They are happy to spend floor time trying to  blow up a highly technical Treasury Department decision that current  law actually requires. Political obstruction is their top priority.  Everything else follows from that.                          Nomination of William Barr    Mr. President, on a final matter, even in the midst of this political  climate, the President's nominee for Attorney General delivered an  impressive performance during the first day of his hearings before the  Judiciary Committee. Senators were reminded exactly why he won  bipartisan admiration for this body in 1991 and was confirmed as  President Bush 41's Attorney General with no opposition--none.   Now, as Mr. Barr himself acknowledged in his testimony yesterday,  times have changed, but the core principles that our Nation's Attorney  General must uphold haven't changed. As the nominee testified  yesterday, ``the American people have to know that there are places in  the government where the rule of law--not politics--holds sway . . .  the Department of Justice must be such a place.''   Those are the words of the right man for this job. His testimony made  clear what he sees as key priorities for the Department of Justice:  building on past progress in preventing violent crime, enforcing and  improving our Nation's immigration laws, and protecting the integrity  of our electoral system.   He stated definitively where his loyalties lie: with ``the rule of  law, the Constitution, and the American people. That is how it should  be. That is how it must be. And, if you confirm me, that is how it will  be.''   Experience, integrity, and total commitment--the President has made  an outstanding choice. The Judiciary Committee continues its hearings  today. I look forward to their continuing review of this nomination  and, then, to its being reported here to the floor. The American people  deserve the very best. That is just what Attorney General Bill Barr  will be   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 11,  S. 109.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk on  the motion to proceed.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senator Merkley.
