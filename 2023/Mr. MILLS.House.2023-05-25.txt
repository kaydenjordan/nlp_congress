 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment made in order by the rule.    Mr. Chair, today I stand before you to emphasize the  critical need for the Department of Defense's involvement in fentanyl  research.   My amendment would include the Department of Defense in the list of  eligible agencies that qualify for the expedited procedures on fentanyl  research.   The Department of Defense has several existing research programs  involving fentanyl, and considering that today's servicemembers are  tomorrow's veterans, there is no reason why the DOD should be  ineligible for these expedited processes.   Not only should this bill be directed at our veterans but the brave  men and women who serve on Active Duty and are also susceptible to  injuries that are routinely prescribed opioids as the treatment. As we  all know, this can lead to serious addictions.   My amendment would ensure that the DOD is included in the research  and reporting process of fentanyl and its effects.   As someone who was blown up twice overseas and was a combat medic, I  know firsthand the pain and the injuries that the brave men and women  in uniform can sustain.   Common combat injuries can include second and third degree burns,  spinal cord injuries, broken bones, limb loss, paralysis, and sharpened  wounds.   As we face this ever-growing crisis, it is imperative that our  military actively participate in fentanyl research for several  compelling reasons.   By actively participating in fentanyl research, the DOD can make  significant strides in addressing the opioid crisis within the ranks  and improving the quality of healthcare provided through TRICARE to our  brave servicemembers.   Allow me to share some of these alarming statistics concerning the  use of opioids among our Active Duty personnel.   According to a study conducted by the Defense Health Agency, between  the years of 2012 and 2017, the rate of opioid prescriptions within the  military healthcare system has increased by a staggering 56 percent.   This trend is deeply concerning as it highlights the potential risks  and challenges faced by our servicemembers when it comes to opioid  misuse and addiction.   It is crucial to recognize that the DOD has a responsibility to  ensure the physical and mental well-being of our military personnel.   Engaging in fundamental research will allow the DOD to gain a deeper  understanding of the specific challenges faced by Active Duty  servicemembers regarding opioid usage.   By providing the necessary support and resources to combat opioid  addiction, the Department of Defense can empower our servicemembers to  overcome this critical challenge and continue to fulfill their duties  with resilience and strength.   This research can lead to the development of new and innovative  therapies, improved access to treatment resources, and more  comprehensive addiction prevention programs for servicemembers abroad.  [[Page H2604]]    It is essential to note that by prioritizing fentanyl research, the  Department of Defense demonstrates its commitment to the overall well- being of our Active Duty personnel.   By addressing the fentanyl and opioid crisis proactively, they will  not only protect the lives and health of our servicemembers but also  foster a culture of support and understanding within our military  communities.   This, in turn, contributes to the overall readiness and effectiveness  of our Armed Forces, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
