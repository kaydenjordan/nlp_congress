 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
