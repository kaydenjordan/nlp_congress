 Madam Speaker, 100 years ago today, Mary  Crate Taylor brought together a group of 67 women to form the Junior  League of Buffalo.   Ms. Taylor organized this group of all women volunteers to provide  needed relief to families during the Depression era. During this era,  the league generated tens of thousands of dollars in donations for  various causes in western New York, including Children's Hospital.   Since 1919, the Junior League has created programs to curb substance  abuse, assist mothers at risk of poverty, combat illiteracy, and  empower women through many volunteer programs and projects.   Today, with more than 500 women, the Junior League has generated  millions of dollars in donations that benefit cultural and community- based programs throughout western New York.   Happy centennial to the Junior League of Buffalo. Keep up the great  work, and here is to 100 more.                            ____________________
