 Mr. Speaker, it has been 5 years since the largest  single wildfire in Washington State history.   The Carlton Complex fire raged through north-central Washington,  burning more than a quarter of a million acres and leaving more than  500 homes and structures destroyed in its path. Still today, the  communities, small businesses, and families in Okanogan County continue  to rebuild and work to address the long-term consequences of this  disaster.   While the devastation was heartbreaking, what we saw on the ground  was a testament to the resilience and spirit of Washingtonians, as well  as the generosity and bravery of those from across the region and the  Nation who came to north-central Washington's aid.   At the height of the fire, in those frightening days of late July  2014, more  [[Page H7390]]  than 2,800 firefighters from across the country poured in to assist the  firefight. Today, I rise to recognize and remember the heroic efforts  of those thousands of firefighters, first responders, and volunteers  who worked tirelessly and at great personal risk.                            ____________________
