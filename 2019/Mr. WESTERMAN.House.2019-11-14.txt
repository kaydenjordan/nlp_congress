 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Veterans  Day, when we honor the extraordinary sacrifices made by our Nation's  veterans.   While Veterans Day has already passed this year, Congress must  continue providing veterans with the support they need following their  service.   We saw significant progress in this area in June, when President  Trump signed the bipartisan Blue Water Navy Act into law. This bill  expands Vietnam veterans' access to VA benefits. Yet, we still have  much work to do.   The bipartisan Keeping Our Promises Act would further assist Vietnam- era servicemembers exposed to Agent Orange.   May we focus the attention of this body on what our Founders  described as the pursuit of happiness. May we work across the aisle to  provide both former and active servicemembers with both the support and  the resources they need.   As Theodore Roosevelt said: ``A man who is good enough to shed his  blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal  afterwards.''   Our democracy and freedom continue to thrive, thanks to the  sacrifices of veterans and their families. On behalf of the Fourth  District of Arkansas, thank you for your service.                            ____________________
