 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize some incredible things  that have happened in my State.   In Utah, COVID-19 has hit families and the food-buying public very  hard. Many supply chain elements have closed, leaving farmers unable to  sell their Utah-grown products.   But Utah farmers are passionate about feeding people, so the Utah  Farm Bureau launched ``Farmers Feeding Utah.''   Donations to the nonprofit campaign went to farmers to purchase their  products, and the Utah Farm Bureau handled processing costs and  partnered with hunger relief organizations to get the food directly to  needy families.   Since May, they have received more than $300,000 in donations that  allow  [[Page H3990]]  them to purchase 20,000 pounds of beef, 10,000 pounds of flour, 200,000  eggs, and $100,000 worth of dairy products. They have delivered 600  live sheep to the Navajo Nation and donated to numerous food pantries  throughout Northern Utah.   Utah routinely leads the Nation in volunteering. Farmers Feeding Utah  is the latest example of how Utahns come together to protect lives and  livelihood and to overcome adversity.         Honoring the City of South Jordan's Public Safety Personnel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the City of South  Jordan, Utah, its public safety personnel, and also its residents for  showing tremendous leadership and courage during a recent public safety  crisis.   On Pioneer Day, July 24, 2020, approximately 600 people were quickly  evacuated from their homes and their businesses after public safety  officials discovered explosive material in a nearby home. Officials  determined that the substance had to be neutralized through controlled  detonations.   Our State's official holiday, Pioneer Day, is usually reserved for  festivities and gatherings with family to remember a legacy of  overcoming hardship. Instead, South Jordan city officials and residents  had their holiday interrupted and were called to react quickly, work  together and demonstrate courage and leadership. They did so valiantly,  and they did so bravely. The detonations were completed with very  minimal damage caused to nearby homes and no injuries whatsoever. Given  the circumstances, the outcome could hardly have been better.   I applaud these Utahns who came together in the face of adversity to  support one another. South Jordan has much to be proud of on this  Pioneer Day.                            ____________________
