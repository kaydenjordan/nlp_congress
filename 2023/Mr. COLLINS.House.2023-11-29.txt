 Mr. Chairman, you would think by just listening to this  debate that we were sitting here debating funding and we were debating  guns, and that is actually not the case.   You see, Mr. Chair, what the Biden administration is trying to do is  just another glaring example in a long list of glaring examples of what  they have done to destroy the American fabric as we know it.   Mr. Chair, you can look at inflation, and you can look at the  wokeness in the military, but this is actually about an invasion, and  now they are wanting to take a national park and turn it into a migrant  camp.   I want to tell you something, Mr. Chair: If you give this  administration an inch, they will take a mile. That is just the  beginning of this.   People want to go see their national parks. They want to go see the  Grand Canyon. They don't want to see a grand caravan.   Instead of punishing Americans for its failures, the Biden  administration should look to actual long-lasting solutions to the  border crisis. House Republicans, Mr. Chairman, knew exactly right. We  have already acted by passing H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.   Mr. Chair, I want to urge all of my colleagues to support this bill  and protect our national parks.
