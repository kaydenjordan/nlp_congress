 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, Maxine Waters,  and the ranking member, Mr. McHenry, for this important resolution.   Last week, Democrats stood united and ended the longest government  shutdown in history. We should be clear: This shutdown was caused  solely by President Trump's personal obsession with the border wall.   Roughly 800,000 Federal workers were either furloughed or forced to  work without pay. More than 1 million contractors were forced to miss  multiple paychecks.   Now, Donald Trump may not relate to this, but for these workers, this  means bills piling up. It means choosing between putting gasoline in  your car or groceries in your refrigerator.   Throughout the shutdown, my office was in contact with several  financial institutions and companies that were offering forbearance  options, waiving late fees, and providing short-term, no-interest loans  for affected workers. That is admirable, and I thank them.   However, the media also reported on numerous workers who were forced  to take out personal loans and cash advances on credit cards, or who  even turned to predatory payday loans to make ends meet.   For example, NBC News recently reported on one company offering  personal installment loans that had seen an uptick in customers looking  to use their products. It is perhaps no coincidence that this uptick  coincided with a nearly 19 percent rise in the company's stock since  the shutdown began.   This is unconscionable. Financial institutions and companies should  not be preying on Federal employees or contractors who went nearly a  month without pay. Instead, they should be working with those affected  to get them back on track and rebuild their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Waters for offering this important  resolution to further that goal, and I urge all my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''
