 Mr. President, yesterday, the longest serving female  Senator in American history announced she plans to retire at the end of  her record fifth full term.   My good friend Dianne Feinstein made major history in 1992 when she  became the first woman to represent California in the Senate. But, of  course, both her knack for notching historic firsts and her commitment  to her fellow Golden Staters were very well established by the time she  arrived here in Washington.   Dianne's career in politics began where many do: at the local level.  But for Dianne, that happened to mean shattering glass ceilings in a  major metropolis. She was the first woman to serve as president of the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors. While in office, she endured a  failed attempt to bomb her home. Then her predecessor as mayor was  assassinated. That is when Dianne became the city's first female mayor.  And then she handily beat an attempted recall.   By the time this trailblazer became Senator Feinstein, there was  practically nothing that could faze her. Dianne has been the top  Democrat on the Rules Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the  Judiciary Committee.   For decades, she has been one of our country's most formidable  legislators across numerous subjects. And, somehow, amid it all, this  battle-tested veteran stateswoman has maintained a genuine warmth and  collegiality that cuts through even the tensest debates.   Elaine and I have been fortunate to count Dianne a friend for many  years. Elaine and Dick served on a board together in the private sector  years ago. Frequently, when Dick was in town, the four of us would go  out to dinner. We had a genuine friendship.   So as you can imagine, we hated to lose Dick recently. But the good  news is Dianne will be here for 2 more years as our colleague. And that  is very, very good news for Elaine and for me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter,  last week, President Biden spent part of his State of the Union Address  celebrating what he seemed to think was a victory over inflation.  Yesterday, however, another wave of official figures confirmed what  working families already knew: The President was simply wrong. The  Democrats' football spiking was premature. The American people are  hurting badly. The CPI rose another half a point last month, even  faster than predicted, for an overall price hike of 6.4 percent year on  year.   Now, mind you, that is not 6.4 percent inflation since President  Biden was sworn in. That is an additional 6.4 percent just since  February of last year--since February of last year--a baseline that  already had an entire previous year of historic and unacceptable  inflation already baked into it.    The overall Biden inflation rate is 14.4 percent. The overall Biden  inflation rate is 14.4 percent from January 2021 to today. Rents are up  12.7 percent since President Biden took office. Grocery prices are up  19.6 percent. Energy prices are up 38 percent after 2 years of total  Democratic control here in Washington.   Prices are still rising out of control. And, even worse, the rate of  increase is speeding back up again. This past month was the hottest for  inflation since last October.   We have now had 21 straight months above 5 percent annual inflation-- a mind-boggling policy failure.   And what does the White House have to say about it? Well, yesterday,  the President's press secretary claimed:         The President's economic plan is indeed working.    So I guess the official White House position is that Democrats caused  all of this crushing inflation on purpose. This is the kind of insanity  that has left just 16 percent of Americans saying they are in a better  financial position than they were 2 years ago. That has nearly two- thirds of Americans saying they are living literally paycheck to  paycheck. So much preventable pain, because Democrats gambled away  families' security on their radical plans and their reckless spending.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on one final matter, yesterday,  President Biden and the Senate Democratic leader took time to boast  about their judicial confirmations. There was something interesting,  strange, and telling about their statements. Both the President and the  Democratic leader focused their comments overwhelmingly on identity  politics and demographic box-checking.   The President's statement spent literally one part of one sentence  paying lip service to the question of legal qualifications. The  remaining five paragraphs were devoted solely to these new judges'  demographic characteristics. It was really quite bizarre.   President Biden informed the American people that a particular  District Court in Puerto Rico will now have its first judge who is not  heterosexual. He pointed out that men have been a small minority of his  judicial nominees; that certain percentages of his nominees fit into  certain demographic categories. He went on and on and on like this.   Most Americans want our country to keep moving forward in a direction  where people's physical characteristics  [[Page S408]]  do not define us. Do you know what share of Americans believe race or  ethnicity should be a major factor in university admissions? Seven  percent. Do you know what percentage believe that gender should be a  major factor in university admissions? Four percent.   But when these Democrats talk about our sacred legal system, they  sound like the HR department at some liberal university.   The White House statements singled out three judges by name. In all  three cases, the President belabored some aspect of the judge's  identity. In zero--zero--of the three cases did the President have  anything to say about their knowledge, intellect, or professional  distinction.   It is offensive to all Americans who have a President seeming to view  our judiciary as some kind of crude sociological math problem. This is  just the kind of thing our Constitution cuts against.   Ironically, when it came to how these new judges actually think, both  the President and the Democratic leader went out of their way to  celebrate the lack of diversity in their thinking. They bragged about  their coordinated and deliberate effort to stuff the judiciary with an  unprecedented volume of former criminal defense attorneys.   Democrats have long said they want judges to have empathy. Well, that  is good news if you happen to be the party for whom the judge has a  special bias; not so good, however, if you are the other party and you  are looking for a fair trial.    Now, Democrats are helpfully telling us whom they want judges to  empathize with: accused criminals, not innocent victims.   Now, nobody is saying we shouldn't have any public defenders on the  bench. But even the New York Times admits the Democrats' sweeping  effort to tilt the playing field in one direction is ``a sea change in  the world of judicial nominations.''   When Republicans held the Presidency and the Senate, we spent 4 years  confirming staggeringly qualified and incredibly brilliant men and  women to the courts, from widely diverse professional and educational  credentials.   Back then, even the very liberal outlet Vox.com reported:         Based solely on objective legal credentials--    Objective legal credentials--       the average . . . appointee has a far more impressive resume       than any past president's nominees.    That was then. So where are we? These days, things are different. To  name just one example, significantly smaller shares of this President's  nominees have attained prestigious clerkships at the Supreme Court or  the appellate level.   To name another example, one person President Biden has put up for a  lifetime appointment could not even tell the Judiciary Committee what  is in article II or article V of the Constitution.   Look, our courts uphold the rule of law and protect our citizens'  rights. The American people deserve a judiciary that contains the  smartest, most formidable, and most qualified legal all-stars in our  country. And they deserve a President who takes this seriously.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this approach has met our needs for  five of the past six Congresses, and I, too, would like to see it  continue. In addition, special reserves have been restored to its  historic purpose. We should continue to fund special reserves to the  extent possible in order to be able to assist committees that face  urgent, unanticipated, nonrecurring needs. Recognizing the tight  budgets we will face for the foreseeable future, it is necessary to  continue to bring funding authorizations more in line with our actual  resources while ensuring that committees are able to fulfill their  responsibilities. I look forward to continuing to work with the  majority leader to accomplish this.
