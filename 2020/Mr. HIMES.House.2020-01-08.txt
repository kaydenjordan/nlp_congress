 Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 months, the House has been  riven by the process of impeachment. It has been emotional, divisive,  and challenging. If you noticed, many of the statements about  impeachment started with some version of this: Impeachment is the most  serious thing that Congress will do, other than declare war.   Well, here we are. In the next day, in the next month, and in the  next year, this body may be called upon to make decisions that will  alter history and possibly send young men and women to their deaths or  not. I say ``or not'' because, once again, I see Congress at risk of  failing to stand up for the clear mandate placed on us by the  Constitution, to which each and every one of us took an oath.   There is no argument about our duty here. The language of the  Constitution is plain: Congress shall have power to declare war, not  Congress shall have power to declare war unless the President wants to  retaliate against someone; not Congress shall have power to declare war  unless a Syrian airbase needs destruction; not Congress shall have  power to declare war unless our forces are attacked in the Tonkin Gulf.    Congress shall have power to declare war. Period, full stop.   Mr. Speaker, in the long run, this has nothing to do with our  confidence in a particular President. It has everything to do with  whether we take the obligations that Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton asked  us to take seriously. In their wisdom, the Founders understood that  every American--every American--should have a voice in the decision to  go to war because it will be those Americans who offer up their  [[Page H20]]  sons and their daughters; because it will be those Americans and their  children who will sacrifice not just themselves but the roads, the  bridges, the schools, and the scholarships that will get consumed in  the costs of war; and because our Founders understood that the true  power of our awesome war machine was not in the technology. It lay in  the sober assent and careful enthusiasm of millions of Americans, not  in the decision of one person in an Oval Office.   So, here we are. Yes, the questions are many and complicated. Was the  strike on General Soleimani legal? Was it ethical? Was it smart? These  are not easy questions, and I suspect the answers will come only over  time and after careful study. But right now, in this there is a  question that hangs the lives of our people and potentially trillions  of dollars: What comes next?   For those of us who were chanting, cheerleading, and whipping  themselves into a belligerent frenzy, reflect on our experience over  the last 20 years in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Comments  by the Secretary of Defense notwithstanding, that we are not looking to  start a war, but we are prepared to end one, the experience of the last  20 years is that we are not prepared to end any war. Some estimates  suggest that we have spent $6 trillion on Middle Eastern wars, and more  importantly, we have laid down the lives of thousands of our men and  women.   While we may have taken some satisfaction from the removal of people  like Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi, at what cost? One of our most  accomplished Middle Eastern diplomats, Philip Gordon, answers that  question best. Philip Gordon wrote this years ago: ``In Iraq, the U.S.  intervened and occupied, and the result was a costly disaster. In  Libya, the U.S. intervened and did not occupy, and the result was a  costly disaster. In Syria, the U.S. neither intervened nor occupied,  and the result is a costly disaster.''   Mr. Speaker, I close my plea for care, thoughtfulness, and careful  consideration by reminding my colleagues of a friend who died almost  exactly a year ago, Walter B. Jones, Jr., from North Carolina. Some of  us in this Chamber remember his journey.                                time  1045    In 2003, he was an ardent supporter of the Iraq war; and over time  and, in particular, when he attended the funeral for a young sergeant  in his district, he came to regret his decision. This was the guy who  led the charge to rename French fries ``freedom fries,'' and he came to  be haunted by what he had done and by what we had done.   I didn't know Walter well, but we celebrated his life when he died.  Let's be like Walter. Let's learn the cost of war--but let's not attend  funerals to do it--and give this decision the careful consideration it  deserves.                            ____________________
