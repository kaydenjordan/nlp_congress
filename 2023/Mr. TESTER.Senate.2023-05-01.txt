 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of  Anthony Johnstone's confirmation to be a judge for the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals.   I am very proud to be supporting this Montanan for such an important  position. He is going to bring something that we are in need of in this  body a lot of the time, and that is common sense. He is also a man of  integrity.   Americans expect their judges to apply the law without bias, in a  nonpartisan way, and that is exactly what Anthony Johnstone has done  throughout his legal career. He has an outstanding record of service to  the people of Montana. He served as clerk for Judge Sid Thomas on the  Ninth Circuit and then as our State solicitor and assistant attorney  general at the Montana Department of Commerce.   For more than a decade, he has encouraged the next generation of  legal minds at the University of Montana's Alexander Blewett III School  of Law.   He is supported by Democrats and Republicans alike, including the  past two attorney generals from Montana--one from each party. He is  supported by Montana's former Republican solicitor general. He is  supported by retired Montana Supreme Court justices. He is supported by  Tribes across the great State of Montana. And he is supported by former  Yale and Chicago Law classmates and countless other public servants  across the Ninth District.   Mr. Johnstone has stood up for our Constitution time and time and  time again. I have no doubt that he will continue to do that as a  judge. We have the opportunity--the opportunity here in a moment--to  confirm an excellent and impartial legal mind to the Ninth Circuit  bench. I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  Anthony Johnstone's nomination.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled vote  occur immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
