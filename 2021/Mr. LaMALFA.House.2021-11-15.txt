 Madam Speaker, the Fifth Circuit Court has very recently  blocked President Joe Biden's coronavirus vaccine mandate. The Court  wrote that the mandate ``grossly exceeds OSHA's statutory authority.''  This reaffirms that the President and OSHA simply cannot make up laws  and penalties as they go or from thin air. So let's stop making health  decisions for an entire population. Instead, let the individual and  their doctor decide what preventative measures will suit them best, not  a bureaucrat guessing one week to the next what that might be.   Some said--many are saying--that they would rather retire or let  themselves be fired than to continue in a job situation where they are  being forced to take a vaccine. I can't believe this is happening in  this country. I can't believe they are trying to pin it on some 1905  State court decision of Massachusetts v. Jacobsen.   Losing our doctors, losing our healthcare workers to retirement would  be a devastating one already to our underserved rural and urban areas.  Other employees represent years and years of knowledge and talent that  would be lost because of this unconstitutional mandate.    I say to President Biden: Whose side are you on?                            ____________________
