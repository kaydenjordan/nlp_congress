 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and thank him for his leadership in leading this discussion  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to discuss the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act. As a CPA, I knew that reforming our broken Tax Code would  make us competitive in a global economy and would lead us to jobs and  prosperity for the American people. I saw firsthand the old Tax Code  was a nightmare to comply with, adding excessive time for companies and  individuals alike to file.                                time  1945    Doubling the standard deduction and streamlining the alternative  minimum tax are just two examples within the legislation to simplify  the taxpayer experience for millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric around here and in the press can get out of  hand at times, so let's take a look back at some of the biggest claims  about the bill and what the reality is.   One of the most common claims I have heard as a Representative from  Kansas was that this act was simply the Kansas tax plan on steroids,  but that was never the case. Where Kansas eliminated income taxes on  certain businesses, the Federal act simply reduced taxes on all  businesses at a comparable rate to other businesses. With the new  Federal rates, all businesses, regardless of size, continue to pay  Federal income taxes, just at a lower rate. In fact, the truth is,  instead of breaking the bank, thanks to this bill, the State of Kansas  is seeing new revenue to the tune of nearly $140 million or more a  year.   Mr. Speaker, another one of the most egregious claims was the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act would raise taxes on the middle class. Not only was  this claim debunked by fact checkers, here is what the reality is in my  district.   A typical family of four in my district is seeing a Federal income  tax cut of just over $2,200. This is on top of bonuses paid and utility  companies, like Westar Energy and Kansas City Power and Light Company,  announcing they would lower utility rates as a result of this tax  reform.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, there were claims made that companies would keep  the benefits of tax reform and not use it to grow jobs or wages. I  would like to share with you an example from my district, which sets  the record straight on this notion.   The Lawrence Paper Company, which employs hundreds of workers across  three locations in Kansas and Nebraska, has recently committed to  increasing their post-tax reform investment to $13 million in  equipment. The company's president attributes this increased investment  as a direct result of the lower taxes and favorable business climate  generated by the recently enacted tax reform.   Couple that fact with the same company's employees receiving hundreds  of large bonuses that went toward recovering holiday expenses, paying  down bills, or reinvesting in their local community, and my point is  even more clear.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is putting more money in Kansans'  pockets and creating a system that allows our businesses to compete in  a global marketplace. I could not be more pleased that Kansans and  Kansas businesses are doing their part to get my State and the national  economy moving again.
