Sec. 16.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 7691) making       emergency supplemental appropriations for assistance for the       situation in Ukraine for the fiscal year ending September 30,       2022, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived.

The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks.    Madam Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 1097, providing for consideration H.R. 903,  the Rights for the TSA Workforce Act under a structured rule. It  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security. It  self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Thompson, makes in  order eight amendments, and provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 2499 and H.R. 5129  under structured rules. It provides 1 hour of debate for each equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Education and Labor. It self-executes manager amendments  from Chairman Scott to both bills. It makes in order 8 amendments and  17 amendments respectively, and it provides for one motion to recommit  for both bills.   The rule provides en bloc authority to Chairmen Thompson and Scott.                                time  1815    Further, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7691, the  Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairwoman DeLauro and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also deems passage of H. Res. 1096, a resolution,  Recognizing Congressional Workers' Right to Organize.   The rule also provides recess instructions, suspension authority, and  same-day authority through June 10.   Finally, the rule postpones requested roll call votes on suspension  bills considered on May 10 and May 11 through May 18.   Madam Speaker, the rule contains five essential points of action.   H.R. 903, the Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of 2021: This  legislation seeks to afford TSA employees similar rights, protections,  and benefits afforded to most other Federal workers across the country  in order to improve the agency's operations, workforce retention, and  morale.   H.R. 2499 is the bipartisan Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of  2022. This legislation establishes a science-based list of diseases for  which an automatic presumption of work-related illness would apply for  Federal firefighters who get sick, provided that they are employed in  fire protection activities for at least 5 years. It also establishes a  process for adding other diseases based on scientific data and analysis  going forward.   H.R. 5129 is the bipartisan Community Services Block Grant  Modernization Act of 2022. It reauthorizes and improves the popular and  effective community services block grant program to help reach even  more Americans, provide more community development across the country,  and further reduce poverty.   The rule also contains a resolution recognizing the right of  congressional staff to unionize.   Finally, it includes H.R. 7691, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental  Appropriations Act, 2022. Madam Speaker, generations to come will look  back at this moment to ask: What did our generation do when Vladimir  Putin and his army invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine and tried  not only to crush its democracy and violate the spirit of its people  but vaporize and annex the entire nation?   Well, today, let future generations observe the Biden administration  and a bipartisan Congress has not only already provided more than $4  billion in security assistance to Ukraine, almost all of it coming  after the February 24 invasion, but today, we are voting to provide  nearly $40 billion to address the immediate and near-term security,  economic, and humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people that are  urgent and desperate.   We will provide $6 billion for training, equipment, weapons,  logistics support, supplies, salaries and stipends, and intelligence  support; $4.35 billion in emergency food assistance, medical equipment,  and other humanitarian aid; and billions more for humanitarian relief  for the millions of refugees displaced by Putin's violence and  bombardment of communities in Ukraine.   The aid that we vote on today will come with the fervent solidarity,  admiration, and love of the American people. We are in awe of President  Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people, and their army. They have been hanging  tough against terrible odds and terrible violence in a splendid display  of democratic patriotism for their country. Their resolve is heroic,  and it is breathtaking to behold.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentleman asks us to justify the use of American  resources in supporting our democratic allies in Ukraine.   How would we justify the use of these resources?   Well, let's start with this. The Ukrainian people and President  Zelenskyy have asked for our help. They have asked for these resources,  and they need these resources in order to beat back a brutal, bloody,  and illegal innovation by Vladimir Putin, who is violating the laws of  war on a daily basis.   They have killed thousands of civilians, they have killed more than  150 children, murdering them, and his Army is raping and killing women,  leaving their corpses in the street.   So we have a democracy trying to defend its sovereign borders against  an autocrat who wants to rebuild the Russian empire, Vladimir Putin,  the former chief of the KGB, who said that the greatest catastrophe of  the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union.   We were hoping that we would have a unanimous, bipartisan statement  today in favor of aid to the besieged people of Ukraine. Instead, we  get more voices of defeatism, pessimism, and gloom.   We have heard it before. We heard Representative Cawthorn who said:  Remember that Zelenskyy is a thug, remember that the Ukrainian  Government is incredibly corrupt, and is incredibly evil and has been  pushing woke ideologies.   We heard from Steve Bannon who said: No Republican should vote for  any money for Ukraine, zero dollars for Ukraine.   We are hearing it from other candidates around the country, J.D.  Vance, who says: I have got to be honest with you; I don't really care  what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.   Madam Speaker, the democratic world is under siege by Vladimir Putin  and his filthy army, which is murdering children, raping women, killing  civilians. Which side are we on?   The Biden administration is rallying the democratic world, rallying  the NATO countries. We should be standing on a unanimous, bipartisan  basis with the people of Ukraine.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Levin).    Madam Speaker, here is a formula for the destruction of  democracy: Repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation and  appeasing imperialist assaults on sovereign nations.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, the very distinguished gentlewoman from  Colorado called the President of the United States, or likened him to,  I think she said, a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.   We obviously could have taken those words down, but we have serious  business to do here, and unlike some of our colleagues on the other  side, we are not interested in censoring other people's speech. We want  the whole world to see how the gentlewoman from Colorado speaks in  public as a Member of Congress. We want everyone to look at that.   Meantime, we have come here tonight, Madam Speaker, to fight for the  rights of the TSA workforce. More than 50,000 workers. We are giving  them the same rights that other Federal workers have. We came here to  fight for the rights of Federal firefighters, tens of thousands of  them, who will be able to benefit from this legislation if and when  they get sick from illnesses caused by their work as firefighters.   We came here to expand and improve the Community Services Block Grant  Modernization Act of 2022, a bipartisan piece of legislation. Despite  what was said about it on the other side, I believe there were eight  Members of the minority who voted for it in the House Education and  Labor Committee.   We are here to recognize the right of congressional staff to  unionize, and we are here most significantly, Madam Speaker, on the  Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act.   It is for that act that the antics and the diatribes of our  colleagues are so profoundly disappointing to those of us who have come  here to support President Zelenskyy and the heroic people of Ukraine  who are resisting a brutal, illegal aggression by Vladimir Putin and  his army.                                time  1900    And we were hoping that we would have a bipartisan, unanimous support  for this legislation to render the military and strategic economic and  humanitarian aid that our democratic allies need, and they are asking  for and deserve, to fight off this illegal criminal aggression by  Vladimir Putin, who is not a genius but a war criminal and a mass  murderer. That is what he is.  [[Page H4770]]    We are very proud of the work that President Biden has been doing in  unifying the democratic world against the autocrat Vladimir Putin and  his naked, bloody aggression against the people of Ukraine, which has  cost the lives of thousands of civilians already. We have seen the war  crime of rape spread at the hands of Russian's filthy soldiers, and we  have seen them kill children, blow up schools and hospitals.   We don't see anything remotely like the seriousness and the solemnity  that we would expect of Members of the United States Congress. Instead,  they put up profanity, they mock the President of the United States,  they make a disgrace of their own party by the way they behave on the  floor of the House of Representatives.   Madam Speaker, Vladimir Putin and his cheerleaders all over the world  thought they would make quick work of the people of Ukraine and  President Zelenskyy. They only had supplies for less than a week.  Everybody thought it was just going to be game over, as some of our  colleagues have said; that Vladimir Putin would just cut right through  them.   But you know what they weren't counting on, Madam Speaker? They  weren't counting on the spirit of a democratic people, the noble people  of Ukraine who have heroically resisted every criminal aggressive act  by Vladimir Putin and his autocratic cheerleaders around the world.   So today, 2\1/2\ months later, President Biden, having rallied the  democratic world, having unified NATO, comes back to us and asks for  nearly $40 billion in aid to support the strategic needs, the security  needs, the economic needs, the humanitarian needs of a population that  is reeling from the war.   Madam Speaker, we say the American people are here to support the  Ukrainian people. That is what we are doing here tonight.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Our colleagues don't seem to want to talk about the chaos and the  violence and the bloodshed that has been unleashed on the people of  Ukraine. I am really shocked that they don't want to talk about it, but  they want to talk about free speech.   Great. Let's talk about free speech in Russia.   More than 15,000 people arrested and detained as they crush the  antiwar movement in Russia, as he jails political opponents in Russia.  And they haven't said a word about that.   Have they said anything about the opponents of the war in Russia who  have been thrown into jail? No.   They are talking about a board in America that I wasn't even aware  existed--I am not sure it does--that has never thrown anybody in a  jail.   How do they feel about Russian critics of the war being thrown into  jail? How do they feel about more than 8 million Ukrainians who have  been displaced by the war, who are living in the homes of the Polish  people who have heroically opened their doors to them? They say nothing  about that.   Do they think that Vladimir Putin is the leader of a democracy?   Is there any one of them who will stand up and say that Vladimir  Putin is an autocrat, an authoritarian, a would-be totalitarian?   Do any of them remember that Vladimir Putin was the head of the KGB?   Is that their ideal model for civil liberties? Vladimir Putin, who  said that the collapse of the Soviet Union is the greatest catastrophe  of the 20th century?   Is this Abraham Lincoln's party we are hearing today? Or is it a cult  of Donald Trump?   Madam Speaker, we have to decide which side America is going to be  on. The democratic world has risen as one to support the people of  Ukraine, and yet, our friends don't seem to want to talk about that.  They don't want to seem to support this effort, which is extraordinary  to me, as the people of Ukraine are doing whatever they can to fight  this naked, illegal aggression, this unilateral war of aggression;  unprovoked, unjustified, a violation of international law in every way.   Madam Speaker, it is incumbent upon us as the leader of the  democratic world, if that is still what we want to be, to support  democracies under attack by authoritarian regimes.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. We  were interrupted by a motion to adjourn a few moments ago.   Ukrainians are being slaughtered by Putin's army as we speak.  Schools, churches, and hospitals have been bombarded, and yet I think  188 of our colleagues voted just to pack it up and to go home instead  of acting to provide the people of Ukraine and President Zelenskyy with  the military and humanitarian assistance that they need. I am very  glad, and I thank the bipartisan majority that rejected that approach,  and I want us to make sure we are sending a message of hope and  solidarity to the people of Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, if we have isolationists in the House, I hope that they  don't flatter themselves to think that Vladimir Putin is some kind of  civil libertarian. Vladimir Putin is no civil libertarian for those  people who have found the cause of civil liberties today. Vladimir  Putin is no civil libertarian.   He is shutting down the freedom of speech and blocking his people's  access to social media. He has thrown thousands of people into prison  for protesting against his war in Ukraine. He just signed a new law to  impose 15 years in prison on anyone who publishes or broadcasts what  Russian Government censors consider false information about the  invasion of Ukraine.   In fact, it is against the law in Russia now to even describe the  invasion of Ukraine and the war against Ukraine as an invasion or a  war. You can't describe it. Talk about Orwellian.   Why did we hear nothing from our colleagues about that?   Do they actually think that Vladimir Putin is fighting for civil  liberties in his bloody and filthy invasion of Ukraine and his attempt  to demolish a country?   Mr. Speaker, the American people in every public opinion poll we have  seen stand strongly with the people of Ukraine. They understand illegal  aggression when they see it. We know that Vladimir Putin is trying to  crush the sovereignty of the people of Ukraine.   America stands with the NATO countries. America stands with the  democratic governments and peoples of the world. America stands with  democracy all over the world. That is who we are. That is who we are.  We will never forget it, and we will never let go of it. We will not  fall prey to Putin's propaganda, his disinformation, or the conspiracy  theory that tries to blind us to the reality of what is happening in  Ukraine today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
