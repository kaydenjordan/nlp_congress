 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   Mr. Speaker, I was in this very Chamber on January 6 when our  democracy was attacked.   In the days following, I received texts and calls from friends and  former colleagues around the world, who were working on improving  democracy in places like Burma and Hungary, who were devastated about  what they were seeing and how it would impact their ability to make  progress around the world.   Passing H.R. 1, rebuilding trust in our democracy, is imperative for  our national security.   Since January 6, countries have questioned whether they need to  listen to America's calls to defend human rights or abide by the  results of free and fair elections.   Our allies and partners have questioned if they should continue  following our lead when it seems like other countries' autocratic  systems are more capable of addressing crises.   We need to rebuild our credibility on the world stage.   Countries needn't be defined by their darkest days, but rather by how  they overcome them.   The world was watching on January 6, and it is watching again today.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1.                            ____________________
