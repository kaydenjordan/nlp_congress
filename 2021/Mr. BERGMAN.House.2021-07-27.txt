 Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   We all know mental health is a major problem in our country.  According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 50  million Americans from all walks of life suffer from a mental health  issue.   One such population extremely close to my heart is veterans. With  around 20 veteran and servicemember suicides per day, I consider one  death to be too many. The amendment before us, however, is trying to  solve a problem that, frankly, just doesn't exist.   There is plenty of research already being conducted featuring the use  of schedule I drugs to treat mental illness and addiction. The  amendment will do nothing to change this, despite its claims to the  contrary.   What the amendment will actually do is repeal an existing provision  that limits the use of funds to promote legalization of schedule I  drugs. The amendment also repeals a provision that specifically allows  Federal funds to be used to research the therapeutic uses of these  substances.   The stated purpose of this amendment, which is to support this  research on behalf of those who suffer from critical diseases, is  contradictory to the actual effect. Therefore, because of the  disingenuous nature and intent of this amendment, I urge my colleagues  to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion and the articulate response of  my colleague. I have had the honor to serve with him, and we agree on  the vulnerability of veterans. In fact, a year-plus ago, we tried to  move the IMPROVE Act through the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to try  to look at different ways to provide opportunities to bring veterans  into the VA healthcare system so we could identify them and treat their  addiction. It wasn't necessarily about the research of the product. It  was the research of the veteran as a whole, the veteran's  vulnerability.   Mr. Speaker, it was painful in the committee setting to have the  IMPROVE Act disapproved when, at the same time, that same committee  authorized equine therapy.  [[Page H4075]]    As Dr. Phil Roe said at the time, this a first for the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs. We have not allowed people to treat veterans, but we  are allowing horses to treat veterans.   The point is, we are looking to do something here via this amendment  that does not solve an existing problem. We need to have the outreach,  the research, but we also need to have the human side to make sure that  we connect all the dots for the betterment of the veterans' mental  health.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the amendment before us, as it has been  presented, is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist, as stated.  There is ample research already being conducted featuring the use of  schedule I drugs to treat mental illness and addiction. The amendment,  as presented, will do nothing to change this, despite the claims to the  contrary.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to not support or, said a different  way, to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as a veteran and one who served the country  for 40-plus years in uniform, the bond we have as veterans goes deeper  than anyone could imagine. The worst thing that can happen, as has  happened in my family, is to have a loved one and a veteran take their  own life. I have decades, unfortunately, of family experience in this.  Because of that, my passion for stating opposition to this amendment  goes unabated.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
