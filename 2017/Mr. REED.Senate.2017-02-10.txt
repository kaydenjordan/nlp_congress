 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  Steven Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury.   No Cabinet official can have such a profound impact on our economy,  on family budgets, on taxes, and on consumer protection as the  Secretary of the Treasury. It is a job of immense reach that requires a  steady hand, a commitment to fairness, and a deep  [[Page S1082]]  knowledge of our Nation's financial markets and the rules that protect  the savings and investments of middle-class Americans. In light of this  reality, I do not think Mr. Mnuchin meets these requirements.   I know that for many of my fellow Rhode Islanders and for many  Americans, the economy is not producing the jobs and wages they want  and they need. I share that sentiment and have pushed for job and wage  policies like the minimum wage, paid leave, and health care that help  struggling families cope. I have pushed for job creation by putting  people to work by rebuilding our Nation's roads, bridges, transit  systems, schools, and new housing. But I think it is important that  everyone in this Chamber take a step back and understand where our  economy was, where it is today, and what is at stake.   In 2007, the housing market began to collapse. One measure of the  housing market is the seriously delinquent rate, which is the  percentage of loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process  of foreclosure. Here are just a few examples of the hardest hit States:  13.2 percent in Arizona in December 2009, 9.63 percent in Ohio in  December 2009, and 20.61 percent in Florida in March 2010.   By the end of President Obama's term in office, here are the  seriously delinquent rates for those same States: 1.35 percent in  Arizona in September of 2016, 3.59 percent in Ohio in September of  2016, and 4.14 percent in Florida in September of 2016. Just to remind  on this, Florida went from a seriously delinquent rate of over 20  percent in 2010 to just over 4 percent in 2016 because of the policy,  the programs that were initiated by the President and supported by this  Congress.   In 2007, the unemployment rate began to skyrocket. Again, here is  what that meant in a few States at their highest unemployment rates:  11.2 percent in Arizona in November of 2009, 13.6 percent in Nevada in  December 2010, 11 percent in Ohio in January 2010, 11.2 percent in  Florida in January 2010, and in my home State, double digit  unemployment rates also.   By the end of President Obama's term in office, here are the  preliminary rates for those states as of December 2016: 4.8 percent in  Arizona, 5.1 percent in Nevada, 4.9 percent in Ohio, and 4.9 percent in  Florida. We have seen improvement across the Nation.   I urge my colleagues to take all of this into account when they  consider Mr. Mnuchin.   These are sobering numbers, and behind each of these numbers is an  individual or a family, our constituents, who suffered real and serious  harm. We owe it to our constituents to do something so that these  generational losses will be prevented from happening again. We came out  of a deep abyss through difficult work, through cooperative efforts; we  have reached a point where we are poised, I hope, to continue to move  forward, and we don't want to go back. That was at the heart of our  work on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  It was to learn the lessons from this catastrophe so that we would  never endure another in our history.   Unfortunately, for some of my constituents in Rhode Island and others  around the country, the aftershocks of that financial crisis have not  fully dissipated. We are still living in some respects with what  happened. There are still too many looking for a decent-paying job or  facing gut-wrenching financial decisions like whether to turn the heat  off or to skip feeding the family another day, just to make ends meet.   Indeed, one of my constituents recently wrote:         My wife and I lost nearly half our assets in the 2008       financial crisis. Over eight years later, and our house is       still worth less than the mortgage that remains on it. We are       both professionals, and will have to stay that way until we       are 75 in order to come close to the standard of living we       enjoy now during retirement. The financial reforms enacted       under Dodd Frank, and Obama's regulation that requires       financial advisers and brokers to act in their client's best       interests, are critical to my family's well-being and to the       health of the US economy. I would like to know how you plan       to defeat any attempts to unravel these rules. Given the       clear threat that Trump poses to our economy, and the losses       I have already suffered due to bankers' greed and       incompetence, without these rules I feel better off putting       my money in my basement and will do exactly that. At least we       won't lose half of what we own.    Those are the words of a professional family in Rhode Island who have  seen this struggle firsthand, and they ask this question: What are you  going to do to protect the reforms and the advances we have made that  have been manifested in the economic statistics that I shared with my  colleagues?   As you can see, for this Rhode Islander and for many others, the law  we put in place to stanch the bleeding and stabilize the financial  system is a critical help.   But some have so demonized Dodd-Frank that they would have you  believe otherwise. That may be why its opponents prefer calling it  Dodd-Frank instead of its full name, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act, because it is about reforming Wall Street  and protecting consumers. It is a lot easier to be against something  called Dodd-Frank than it is to be against Wall Street reform and  consumer protection. But as my colleagues just heard in my  constituent's own words, Dodd-Frank is ``critical to my family's well- being and to the health of the US economy.''   The question I have to answer as my constituent's Senator is whether  Mr. Mnuchin will support Dodd-Frank, push efforts to further reform  Wall Street, and place as his highest priority the protection of  consumers as our next Treasury Secretary.   Based on a review of Mr. Mnuchin's record, the answer, to me, is very  clear: No, he will not.   As chairman of OneWest Bank, Mr. Mnuchin made a fortune employing  questionable foreclosure practices that made the financial crisis worse  for families and seniors. What is particularly worrisome is that  OneWest engaged in so-called robo-signing, where companies cut crucial  corners by not properly reviewing or even bothering to read foreclosure  documents.   Indeed, according to one news report:         Erica Johnson-Seck, vice president of OneWest's department       of bankruptcy and foreclosures . . . robo-signed an average       of 750 foreclosure documents a week, according to a sworn       deposition she gave in a Florida case in July 2009 . . .       Under oath, Johnson-Seck acknowledged that she did not read       the documents she was signing, taking only about 30 seconds       to sign her name. To speed up the process, Johnson-Seck said       she shortened her first name on her signature to just an       ``E.'' She said in the deposition that OneWest's practice was       to review just 10 percent of the foreclosure documents for       accuracy.    As part of the confirmation process, when asked whether his company  engaged in robo-signing, Mr. Mnuchin responded that OneWest did not  robo-sign documents. However, it is not clear that this was the case,  and not just because of Ms. Johnson-Seck's deposition. Quoting from a  Bloomberg article written by one of Rhode Island's finest exports, Joe  Nocera, who writes: ``But here's the clincher: In 2011, the man who now  says his bank never robo-signed documents signed a consent order with  the Office of Thrift Supervision, which had accused it of--you guessed  it--robo-signing.''    Disturbingly, Mr. Mnuchin's response on this issue either raises  troubling questions about his management capabilities or his  willingness to be forthright, or potentially both.   Ironically, Mr. Mnuchin's confirmation process mirrors his career in  at least one way. While the Senate Finance Committee normally requires  at least one Democratic Senator to be present in order to vote in  committee on a nominee, the normal rules were suspended so that Mr.  Mnuchin could be reported out of committee for consideration by the  full Senate. In other words, the rules were not followed, special  shortcuts were created for him, and much like the robo-signing that  occurred at OneWest, Mr. Mnuchin is on the path to robo-confirmation  without a full and proper vetting by the United States Senate.   The last thing this body should be doing is robo-stamping Mr.  Mnuchin's nomination so that he, as Treasury Secretary, can change the  rules and rig the system in favor of the insiders at the expense of  working-class Americans who are working overtime just to, in many  cases, make ends barely meet.   For example, Mr. Mnuchin has stated that his first priority would be  enactment of the Trump tax plan. This plan makes deep, unfunded cuts to  revenue, and roughly half of the reduced tax burden is just for the top  1 percent, the wealthy, who don't have to worry  [[Page S1083]]  about how much a gallon of milk costs, what it costs to ride the bus or  fill the gas tank. We have seen what huge tax cuts for the wealthy will  do to the economy. Just look at the economy in the late 2000s and the  deficit. The economic plan endorsed by President Trump and Mr. Mnuchin  will not help the middle class, but will only further skew the economy  in favor of the wealthy and well-connected and do precious little for  job growth.   In addition, the incoming Treasury Secretary will be tasked with  rolling back the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection  Act in support of a President who said:         We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank because,       frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that have       nice businesses, and they can't borrow money. . . . They just       can't get any money because the banks just won't let them       borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.    Indeed, Mr. Mnuchin seems all too eager to assist because he himself  has said that ``we want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent  banks from lending.''   We are simply not seeing this, though. According to JPMorgan's chief  financial officer, Marianne Lake, on an analyst conference call last  month, ``loan growth remains robust.''   According to Bloomberg:         At JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, core loans increased 10       percent to $806.2 billion last year, with gains in every       category, including credit cards and wholesale debt. Bank of       America Corp.'s total loans climbed 1.1 percent to $906.8       billion, while Wells Fargo & Co.'s grew 5.6 percent to $968       billion.    According to the same article, ``banks now have a record $9.1  trillion of loans outstanding.''   Based on this, it seems that big bank lending is actually doing well,  and maybe the reason the President's friends have not gotten loans is  that they borrowed too much and possibly have gone bankrupt too much,  and the megabanks want to be careful about whom they lend to.   Indeed, Anat Admati, a finance professor at Stanford University and a  member of the FDIC's Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee, notes  that:         The claim that regulations are prohibiting lending is       simply false. . . . The banks have plenty of money and can       raise more from investors like other businesses if they have       worthy loans to make. If they don't lend, it's because they       choose not to lend and instead do many other things.    This is a key point. According to Bloomberg:         Banks don't actually ``hold'' capital. In banking, capital       refers to the funding they receive from shareholders. Every       penny of it can be loaned out. A 5 percent minimum capital       requirement means that 5 percent of the bank's liabilities       has to be equity, while the rest can be deposits or other       borrowing. The more equity a bank has, the smaller its risk       of failing when losses pile up.    Given the protection that equity provides, you are left to wonder why  Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump are so anti-capital.   Indeed, from that same Bloomberg article:         Former Goldman Sachs partner Phillip D. Murphy, who was a       member of the banks' management committee with [National       Economic Council Director Gary] Cohn and Treasury Secretary       nominee Steven Mnuchin, said he's mystified with the changes       they're pushing. ``To think that undoing those regulations is       going to lead to a better result is folly,'' said Murphy,       who's seeking the Democratic nomination in this year's       gubernatorial race. ``The fox is in the hen house, that's       what this is. This is people on Wall Street who should know       better.''    For an administration that campaigned on a claim of dismantling a  rigged system, I am confused why President Trump nominated Mr. Mnuchin  to be his economic quarterback for working-class America. Mr. Mnuchin  has spent his professional life spotting value, and he has done quite  well for himself. But despite this ability to value assets, Mr. Mnuchin  still seems puzzled about how to value the assets that matter most to  working class Americans. My constituents don't need fancy Wall Street  calculators or formulas to understand that there is a value and a  benefit to reforming Wall Street and keeping reckless greed in check.  There is a value and a benefit to protecting consumers and their hard- earned wages. And there is a value and a benefit to keeping a family in  their home and avoiding foreclosure.   Indeed, an individual who made his fortune aggressively foreclosing  on his fellow Americans does not possess the right values, in my view,  to be our Treasury Secretary.   Based on his record, I am not convinced Mr. Mnuchin is capable of  draining the swamp, and I fear he may end up further rigging the system  in favor of the 1 percent at the expense of working class  Americans. For all of these reasons, I do not support Mr. Mnuchin's  nomination, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting no.    Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to yield the remainder of my time to Senator Wyden of Oregon.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Daniel  McCartney, a fellow in my office, be granted privileges of the floor  for this session of Congress.
