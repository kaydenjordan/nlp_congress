 Mr. Chair, I have seven amendments in the en bloc, and  I will talk on two issues, in general, that cover, I think, all of the  amendments.   The first thing is an overall concern of spending. It is a lot easier  to break an economy than to fix an economy. And the American Rescue  Plan and the very high-spending infrastructure bill--between them,  spending over $3 trillion--I think is the primary reason for the huge  inflation we are having to deal with today.   Look at these underlying bills--the T-HUD bill, up 12 percent;  financial services--in general government up 17 percent--these programs  have to be held at an even or slight decrease level for years to make  up for the damage that was done with those two big bills.   I am not going to say there wasn't damage done before that. I think a  little bit of the COVID bills that were originally signed by the prior  President were not exactly the most frugal things either, but everybody  knew at the time this was a problem. And my amendments are along the  lines of not destroying programs, not taking out programs altogether,  but going back to the amount that was spent last year, or the amount  that was spent in President Obama's final year.   I sometimes use President Obama's final year to show that I am not  being reckless here, but what I am saying is, there ought to be a  little bit of restraint in the Committee on Appropriations and a little  bit of restraint of the new bills coming out.   A couple of my amendments also address this obsession with hiring  bureaucrats to enforce diversity. America is supposed to be a country  in which we view ourselves as individuals. There are people who, I  think, want to destroy America, and try to set one group against the  other group.   When I look in my district, I know a lot of people who are Hmong. I  recently got to know a lot of people from India. I know people from  Russia. They have had no problem succeeding in America. And they all  tell me the same thing: The easiest place in the world to succeed is  America.   But there are people who try to divide us and set up programs in  which you say, I am not going to succeed because of who I am. I want to  succeed as a group of people determined by where my ancestors were born  three or five or ten generations ago.                                time  1545    Not only are these programs, first of all, a waste of money. We have  to have some people administer the programs, we have nowhere near  enough people to work in American business as it is.   Secondly, they are designed to train people that what goes on in  Washington is a fight or a contest between ethnic groups--that is a  cancerous way to think. The fact that so many immigrants come here  without even being able to speak English and succeed, wildly show it as  a lie. I am trying to reduce funding or get rid of funding all together  for some of these programs.    Mr. Speaker, I will talk about a variety of issues  tonight. I will start one more time. I direct this talk not only to the  Chair, not only to my colleagues in the legislature, but also the press  corps that normally doesn't cover this because I think I am going to  touch on some stories that ought to appear in the press corps but for  whatever reason they don't.   The first thing, and I have addressed it several times from this  microphone, is what is our goal in Ukraine, okay?   It would seem to me a good goal would be to end the war. We have a  lot of Ukrainian troops who have died; we have a lot of Russian troops  who have died; we have a lot of Ukrainian civilians who have died; and  it seems to me that every week or month that the war goes by, those  numbers get greater and greater.   Not only that, but particularly Russia is also a country with access  to horrific weapons, and every week or month that goes by, the chances  that eventually some horrific weapons will have to be used goes up.                                time  2015    I will also point out with regard to these two countries, not that  losing any young life isn't a tragedy, but it would seem to me there  would be special tragedies in these countries because both countries  have low birth rates and declining numbers of young people. For two  countries that have been around--I believe Ukraine has been--for  millennia, we would kind of like to see these countries continue to  exist into the future.   Of sizable countries around the world, Ukraine has the second lowest  birthrate, trailing only South Korea. There are also people who  emigrate from Ukraine. In any event, I would think one of the primary  goals of Ukraine is to make sure that they hang onto the young people  they have left.   Russia is in a similar situation. They also have a low birthrate. I  repeated this story about 7 months ago before this war began. I was at  the San Diego sector of our southern border, and San Diego is only one  tiny sector of a large border, and it was only talking about the week  or month that I was there, but in any event, at that time, the second  biggest nationality crossing our border came from Russia, which kind of  surprised me.   So not only do they have a low birthrate in Russia, we have a lot of  people emigrating. It would seem to me a primary goal of the  governments of both Russia and Ukraine is to make sure the few young  people they have left don't die in a war.   Now, I do not know what President Biden's goal here is in this war. I  try to talk to some Democrat colleagues; I try to talk to people who  should know President Biden. I think he himself may be a little bit  mixed on the situation, but the press corps ought to be calling upon  him and saying: What is your goal in this war? Is our goal to end the  war and perhaps give President Putin an off-ramp; give Mr. Zelenskyy an  off-ramp; find a way for both to declare some sort of victory and stop  the carnage? Or is our goal to continue on for another 6 months or year  or 2 years, and we don't care if another 5,000 or 10,000 or 15,000  Russian or 15,000 Ukrainian troops die; not to mention the monetary  damages that take place when you have a war in your country?   I would like to know where President Biden stands on this. We  collectively have not had a decent briefing for congressional Members  since March 31. And given that we have been asked to give tens of  millions of dollars to Ukraine--this week we were asked to affirm or  accede in the policy of adding Sweden and Finland to NATO--I don't  think it is too much to ask that the administration invite its key  Cabinet members over here, as they did in February and March, and let  us know where the Biden administration stands on this war.   I don't think we have such a great relationship right now with Russia  that we can moderate a conclusion to the war, but I think perhaps  Israel, perhaps Turkey, perhaps some other country should do that, and  perhaps we could grease the skids a little bit.   I mean, I realize back home right now everybody is focusing on  inflation, but I will tell you if something bad happens in Ukraine,  people are going to be focusing on that very, very quickly.   It would be a lot better if we wrapped up this war. I know there are  hard feelings that will probably last for generations, but nevertheless  I think the United States had very good relations with Russia only a  few months ago. It would be good if we were able to wrap up this war,  and it would be good if President Biden, if it was clear that we knew  that his administration was working his way toward that.   So, again, I ask the press corps to kind of lean in a little bit on  President Biden, find out where he is. I ask my Democratic colleagues  in particular, insofar as they have access to the administration, to  point out that it would be good to end this war, good to find countries  that would mediate ending this war, and insofar as people on that side  of the aisle get to see President Biden, carry that message to him.                             Vitamin D and COVID     Another topic that I have addressed before from this  microphone but haven't talked about for a couple months, so I am going  to bring up again is that of vitamin D. People know I have talked about  it before, but it bothers me that the House Select Subcommittee on the  Coronavirus Crisis has not really addressed this issue.   The most recent study that came out was that done by an Israeli  researcher, and in that study, it indicated that if you had inadequate  amounts of vitamin D, which I believe he described as 20 nanograms per  milliliter, that you were 11 times more likely to die of COVID than if  you had adequate amounts.   If you break it down by race--and I don't like it when we break  things out by race, but I am going to do it for these purposes--it is  even scarier in that studies show that 35 percent of the White  population is inadequate in vitamin D, 57 percent Hispanic, and 85  percent Black, which means having an adequate amount of vitamin D in  your system should be a huge priority for people of color.    I think the COVID committee ought to have a hearing solely on vitamin  D. We ought to find out, given the trillions of dollars we have thrown  at COVID and billions of dollars we have thrown at trying to solve this  problem, why the public health establishment has not talked about  vitamin D like they should. They may say we don't know whether this is  a matter of causation or a matter of correlation, but if  [[Page H6879]]  that is so, we should certainly be doing more studies on this matter,  because I think it is possible that hundreds of thousands of lives  could have been saved if we began to promote vitamin D when it appeared  to be the cure, as it appeared before the vaccines were even invented.  Nevertheless, to this day, it is not discussed.   The next question that the committee ought to look at is why are we  not routinely testing people who are at risk for vitamin D deficiency?  I would think anytime anybody over 65 went to a doctor today, they  should be tested for vitamin D. Now, some people say you can take  vitamin D without getting a test, which is true, but my personal  experience in telling people about vitamin D is if they take a test  right now, say the low level of adequate is about 20 nanograms per  milliliter, if somebody goes and takes a test and they wind up being a  12 or 8 or 7, they immediately go out and take vitamin D because they  have the result of the test that says you have got big trouble coming  if you don't take more vitamin D. Having the test specific to that  individual is much more relevant than just a doctor saying it wouldn't  be a bad idea to take vitamin D.   I do believe we would save a lot of lives if that was done. As I  understand it, you can get an online vitamin D test for about $40, so  it shouldn't be a cost-prohibitive thing. Given the trillions of  dollars we put at it, we should even be paying for the test. But if we  don't, individuals should be encouraged at getting those tests.   I do believe vitamin D is good for other things. It is good for bone  health, another reason why people should be taking it. There is really  no downside. Again, people back home that I know or even experts in the  field begin to wonder if the reason we don't push vitamin D is because  you can pay $20 for a bottle from Walgreens or CVS and there is not a  lot of money to be made, and they seem to be more in favor of trying  antidotes that will make money for somebody--there have been  billionaires made on this disease--rather than focusing on vitamin D.   I really beg the committee to look into it a little bit more, get  some experts there. Even though this pandemic seems to be on the  downside, hopefully we will be ready for a different sort of pandemic  in the future. So I encourage the COVID committee to spend a little  time looking at vitamin D because they could have cut the number of  people who died maybe in half.                        Crisis at the Southern Border     Mr. Speaker, the next issue that maybe has bored the  press by now, but they shouldn't stop reporting on it, is what is going  on on the southern border.   We recently got the estimated number of migrants remaining in the  interior who crossed the southern border for June. The good news is it  is down a little bit from May and April, and it is expected to be down  because June is such a hot month, fewer people cross our border.   But if you look at June of this year, about 142,000 migrants remained  in the interior. Of those 142,000, 50,000 are what they call got-aways,  which means the Border Patrol didn't even touch them. We didn't even  have a perfunctory interview with them. They just came across the  border, which should be particularly scary.   What I want to point out, though, is that almost 150,000 from this  June is compared to 79,000 last June. So we have gone from 79,000,  which was a crisis at the time, to 142,000. Two Junes ago, under  another administration, we were around 9,000. So when we go from 9,000  people a month to 79,000 people a month to 142,000 people a month, that  should be a banner headline in every newspaper around the country.   Now, I know the newspapers don't like to do anything that would make  the current administration look bad, but there is a reason why people  don't subscribe to newspapers anymore or don't listen to the news at  night, and that is they caught onto the idea that you are not going to  be well informed if you read the local newspaper or turn on the news at  night.   Again, I will repeat those numbers: 9,000 people in June of 2020  migrants crossing the border. We go from 9,000 to 79,000 to 142,000.  Massive increases. In addition to that, as we know, almost all these  people who cross the border paid $5,000 or $10,000 or $20,000 to the  Mexican drug cartels. I have been at the border about eight times.  Every time I am down there, the Border Patrol tells me they think the  Mexican drug cartels are making more money letting people across the  border than they are selling drugs.   This brings another thing which hasn't been brought up enough, our  poor neighbor to the south, Mexico, is right now in very, very bad  shape due to the strength of the drug cartels, and part of that is our  inability to close our border. We are making the Mexican drug cartels  wealthier and wealthier and wealthier with all their crime, with all  their corruption. I think the United States, just as we refuse to  enforce our border, we refuse to stop taking illegal drugs crossing the  southern border, and as a result we are making Mexico a complete mess.   I beg my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to express some  interest in the flood of people coming here. I beg our newspapers to  begin to report these monthly numbers with the banner headlines that  they deserve so America can know what is really going on here.                          Drug Overdoses in America     Related to the border, speaking of numbers, every year  we come out with new numbers of the number of people who die of drug  overdoses in this country, and that is something that has been  underpublicized.    When I first got this job 7 years ago, about 57,000 people died every  year of drug overdoses. We are now at 107,000. Twice as many people die  of drug overdoses every year as died in 12 years in Vietnam. That is  another story that should be banner headlines, and every newspaper  reporter in this country or cable news reporter ought to be asking  politicians: What are you going to do? Why is Congress not doing  something to save the 107,000 lives a year?   It is a huge national problem. And, again, I don't like to talk about  race, but if you look at the last 4 years, particularly the number of  Black men who die of drug overdoses is just going through the roof. I  mean, normally we are always, particularly the Democratic Party, are  always so eager to point out if there is a difference in statistics  from one race to the other. Here there is a significant difference.  They don't even talk about it. I am not sure what causes it. Normally  they would attribute prejudice. I don't think that is it. I think to a  certain extent it is police being less active than they have in the  past, the judicial system not putting drug dealers in prison because we  are all antiprison right now.   But in any event, when you have 107,000 people die every year, isn't  it something we ought to be talking about, both in this Chamber and on  the nightly news?                             Spending in Congress     Mr. Speaker, the next issue we should be talking about  more is the overall level of spending that is going on in this  institution. I think it was very predicted when the first bills passed  when President Biden took office--and then we had the infrastructure  bill; between those two bills we are looking at, I believe, over $3  trillion--that it would lead to inflation.   But, again, the press corps, maybe because the press corps doesn't  like to talk about numbers, does not like to talk about the size of the  increase in spending. Now, it is a lot easier to break an economy than  it is to put it back together.   Since the inflation was caused by excessive spending, I think the  only way to get a handle on things is to not spend so much.   We will, this week, be voting on a variety of bills to fund the  government, beginning October 1. I have not seen the press corps report  what I think is enough on the size of the increase in those bills. It  would seem to me we should go back to the days of sequester where  routinely you were seeing these bills go up by 0 percent, 1 percent, 2  percent.   What do we have in the bills we are going to vote on this week? We  have a transportation and housing bill, up 12 percent. We have an  agriculture and rural development bill up 8 percent. We have an energy  and water bill up 6.4 percent. Financial services up 17 percent.  Interior and the environment, up 18 percent. Military construction and  VA up 18 percent.  [[Page H6880]]                                     time  2030    Again and again, what we are seeing here is just fiscal  irresponsibility. It is just throwing more gasoline on the fire of  inflation.   I think the press corps, if they were responsible, should be asking  Congress whether these numbers could be closer to 1 or 2 percent, which  is where we should work toward.   I think, quite frankly, Republicans during appropriations should be  coming forth and saying that we would like to see these numbers at 1 or  2 percent. If we are ever going to get our economy back, we can't  continue down this path of excessive spending or the amount of  inflation is just going to continue to go up and up.   The final spending vote we had today was on the National Park  Foundation. I love the national parks. It wasn't a huge spending bill  by the standards of what we do around here, but it was a 300 percent  increase. Almost everybody in this body voted for it because who wants  to be against the national parks. Think about that, a 300 percent  increase.   I hope the press corps wakes up a little and decides to report on the  individual lines of these budgets, how much the spending is going up  line by line and the overall increases in spending in each of the  packages.   I will deal with one more issue here tonight that I think ought to be  covered constantly but is covered nowhere near as much.   I think so many of the problems that we deal with in society, or at  least the people back home feel are part of the problem, are caused by  the breakdown of the family. I think America used to have very strong  families in the forties, fifties, and early sixties. The breakup in the  family did not just happen. It happened because we began with a welfare  system in the 1960s that, quite frankly, put nonnuclear families in a  position that sometimes was better off than a married couple, depending  upon their situation.   In any event, we went from a situation in which the people born  without a mom and dad at home rocketed up between the early sixties to  about 40 percent, went down a little, and has gone back up to 40  percent since the welfare reform of the 1990s.   I find a lot of people in my age bracket think it is going to be very  tough for the next generation, and when they talk about being tough on  the next generation, above all, they talk about the breakdown of the  family.   I have pointed out before that Black Lives Matter--an organization  that people should run from but apparently has been embraced by too  many people in the majority party and some people in the minority  party--originally came out saying they wanted to disrupt the  traditional nuclear family. I would be very concerned when an  organization that claims on their website that they want to disrupt the  traditional nuclear family is received positively around here.   I know some people will say that Black Lives Matter is a diffuse  organization, and just because the founders say they want to disrupt  the nuclear family doesn't mean every segment of Black Lives Matter  wants to disrupt the nuclear family. But I would feel better if more  people came down to the well and boldly said: I am in favor of  strengthening the nuclear family; I don't care if I happen to have my  picture taken next to Black Lives Matter. I haven't seen that happen.   You might say, what is the nature of the marriage penalty? I will  tell you where to begin to look. I would look at some of my local  administrators of low-income housing. I think particularly 42 housing,  which is newer housing, is frequently superior to other housing. I  would ask people about that in your neighborhoods, my colleagues, and  see what type of incentives we have when we have new housing, new  apartments going up, some of them quite lavish, better than the old  apartments that other people have to rent. Is that a good or bad thing?   I would ask the clerks in grocery stores, as far as the expensive  food that people are buying, if they are more being provided for by the  government than provided for within the family.   I would ask tax accountants about the earned income tax credit and  some of the perverse incentives that are involved in the earned income  tax credit. I would also ask the tax accountants what people are doing  with the earned income tax credits when they get that $6,000, $7,000,  or $9,000 check once a year.   I think when we get done asking these questions, we can ask ourselves  if we want to continue programs that prevent children from having both  parents, particularly a dad, at home. I think there are so many  problems in our society that would, to a certain extent, be improved if  only we got back to what we would call old-fashioned, traditional  family values.   In any event, those are some of the issues that I think the press  corps ought to be covering but aren't covering and some of the issues  that I think our body ought to be addressing that we are not  addressing.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the wonderful staff for being here so late, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
