 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss  our Nation's ballooning debt and the lack of interest across the aisle  to address this crisis. We currently face a national debt that exceeds  $22 trillion and a deficit reaching $1 trillion.   President Reagan's chief economic adviser recently called our  Nation's fiscal situation ``the most dangerous domestic problem facing  America's Federal Government.''   The majority party--so, the Democratic Party--is responsible for  producing a budget representative of their values and priorities.  Despite our grim fiscal reality, Democrats have made the decision to  skip their duty of writing a budget, foregoing the only opportunity to  look at our entire fiscal picture.   Speaker Pelosi has stated on numerous occasions: Show me your budget,  and I will show you your values.   So, since the Democrats refuse to pass a budget, do they truly have  any values that represent the American people? These are Speaker  Pelosi's own words.   If my businesses spent money like the Federal Government, I would be  forced to file bankruptcy. These wasteful habits are encouraged by  politicians who do not see Federal dollars for what they are: hard- earned American taxpayer money.   The failure to produce this budget begs the question: Are our friends  across the aisle concerned about our national debt? Again, I refer to  the Speaker's words: No budget, no values.                            ____________________
