 Mr. Speaker, two of my amendments were included in this  year's National Defense Authorization Act, and I would like to just  speak for a moment about their importance.   First, the Department of Defense transfers surplus equipment like  hoses, vehicles, and aircraft parts to the U.S. Forest Service to help  States with firefighting. But this equipment right now is distributed  on a first-come, first-serve basis and doesn't take into account  community need or risk.   My district is seeing increasingly extreme fire events. But  Washington State does not receive equitable access to this equipment. I  am asking for an analysis of the program to make sure that equipment  goes to the places where it is most needed, like Washington State.   My second amendment supports military spouses, most of whom are  women, who continue to experience high levels of underemployment and  unemployment. This unfair treatment happens too often because of  frequent moves and impermanence in communities and surrounding bases,  like JBLM in Washington State.   This amendment will expand opportunities for military spouses in  fields of education, software, and coding in companies with high levels  of teleworking to ensure that military spouses are matched with  fulfilling and successful employment.
