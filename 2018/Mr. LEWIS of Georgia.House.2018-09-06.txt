 Mr. Speaker, I thank my beloved friend,  Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for holding this Special Order.   You know, Ron Dellums was a special human being, special leader. He  was one of a kind. He was born and grew up in due season.   Those of us who worked with him and got to know him, we loved him. We  admired him. I can see him now saying, ``Hi, bro. What is going on?''   We must continue to stand up and speak up and fight the good fight.   You know, Ron never gave up; he never gave in. He never became  bitter. He was never hostile. He loved people. He worked so hard and  tirelessly for what he believed in.   As Congresswoman Barbara Lee has stated so well, Ron was the founding  member of the Congressional Black Caucus. But I tell you, he was a  peaceful warrior. He believed in peace.   He struggled to help build what I call a true democracy in America.  He fought to build what Dr. King called the beloved community. He  wanted to redeem the soul of America.   He wanted to bring people together. It didn't matter whether they  were Black or White, Latino, Asian American, or Native American. He saw  us as one people, one family living in the same house, not just the  American house, but the world house.   I tell you, as one Member who came here after winning an election in  1986, coming here in 1987, I would talk with Ron a great deal. I  learned a great deal from him.   He used his leadership of the Armed Services Committee to highlight  the senseless nature of war and to press for greater investment in the  public good. He fought for peace at home and abroad.   As a Member of Congress, he was the author of legislation and the  movement for corporate divestment in South Africa.   As a political leader, he was an inspiration to people all over the  world. People admired him. People loved him.   You know, he was tall. He stood up; he stood out. And he spoke with  passion.   In his passing, the Nation has lost a strong and powerful crusader  for justice, for equality, and for peace.   He was cool before it became popular to be cool. He dressed so well.  You knew Ron Dellums was coming when you saw him before he made it to  you.                                time  1645    For many of us, he was our hero. Activists of the 21st century, and  all of the new Members of Congress who seek progressive change in  America would do well to take several pages from Ron Dellums' book. It  would make you a better Member of this body.   His voice made him a force to be reckoned with as a committee chair,  as a legislator, as a leader. He insisted in his call for justice for  his cause for peace. He will be deeply missed all over America, not  just in California, not just in Oakland, but all over America and  around the world, for people who long for peace, for justice, for  equality.   Thank you, Ron Dellums, for all that you did to help make our country  and make our world a better place. I thank the gentlewoman, Barbara  Lee, for this Special Order.
