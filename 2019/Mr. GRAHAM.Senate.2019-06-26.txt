 Mr. President, I am going to move to table this  amendment. Being the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee,  this is taking one disaster and creating 100 in its place. This $4.6  billion will destroy all the humanitarian assistance we have passed to  deal with an unprecedented wave of refugees. The global health programs  are all impacted severely, including PEPFAR and the child survival and  maternal health programs. This money comes out of those accounts. Can  you imagine how it is going to be to deal with Ebola after cutting the  Global Health Program?   Programs to counter the influence of Russia and China will be zeroed  out. Counter-human trafficking programs will be dramatically reduced.  Counterterrorism programs are all affected by this amendment.   You are taking one problem at the border, and if you enact the Paul  amendment, you will create 100 in its place.   So I move to table the Paul amendment No. 902.   I ask for the yeas and nays.
