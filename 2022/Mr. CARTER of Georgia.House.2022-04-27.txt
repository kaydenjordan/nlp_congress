 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of Connor Daniel, the new World Champion in English  Sporting Clay Shooting.   A student at Savannah Christian School, Connor attended the 2022  World English Sporting Clay Championship in San Antonio, Texas, with  1,000 other competitors. The event, held at the National Shooting  Complex, pitted some of the top shooters in each classification against  one another in the spirit of competition.   Connor is a fierce competitor and participates on the Savannah  Christian Sporting Clays team that competes in the GISA Scholastic Clay  League as well. Throughout the competition he was shooting right on  target and managed to bring home the Sub Junior World Championship.   It is always a great day when a championship is brought home to the  First District of Georgia, be it a State championship or a world  championship. I am so honored to represent a district with young people  who exemplify what it means to work hard, compete, and  win championships.    I congratulate Connor. His hard work and dedication to his craft have  paid off, and I can't wait to see what he does in the future.                            ____________________
