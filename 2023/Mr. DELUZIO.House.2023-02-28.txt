 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the fact  that when Norfolk Southern's train derailed next to my district-- leaking chemicals, evacuating constituents, and distressing thousands-- the people of western Pennsylvania were mad, and so was I.   That is why my first bill in Congress is to take on the railroads.  Today, the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna) and I introduced the  DERAIL Act, which ensures trains carrying hazardous materials are  properly classified and have increased safety requirements. It is long  overdue, but rail industry lobbyists have fought against it.   This derailment included hazardous materials, but since the train  wasn't classified properly, it didn't have stricter safety rules. That  is why we need the DERAIL Act.   This bill is for everyone in Beaver County, East Palestine. It is for  everyone who has heard about this derailment and thought: ``Could this  happen here?'' The terrible reality is yes, it could, but if colleagues  from both parties join together, it doesn't have to.   Let's tell the railroads we won't let them recklessly pursue profit  and endanger our communities and workers.   I will keep fighting to hold Norfolk Southern accountable for every  penny of pain they have caused.                            ____________________
