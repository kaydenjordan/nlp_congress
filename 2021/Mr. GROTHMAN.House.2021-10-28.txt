 Mr. Speaker, as Congress leaves for the weekend, we  have to alert the American public over the potential results of the  Build Back Better bill as well as the American Rescue Plan that was  already passed.   Soon we will be getting our winter heat bills in the Midwest. If you  are from Wisconsin, if you are from Michigan, if you are from  Minnesota, look out, because we have a big increase in energy costs,  and you ought to be cutting back on your spending right now.   In any event, this bill looks like it is stoked up for more spending,  which means more inflation. We have new Pell grants for people who are  here illegally, and the idea of getting free college for people here  illegally and paying for it by inflating the dollar still more is just  plain irresponsible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the American people to pay attention because if  this bill passes, it will be further increases in your heat bill.                            ____________________
