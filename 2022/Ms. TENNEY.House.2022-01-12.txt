 Madam Speaker, once again, we find ourselves on the floor  of the House of Representatives debating legislation to enact the great  takeover of elections by partisan Federal bureaucrats and their friends  across the aisle and prohibit the most basic voting rights and security  measures entrusted to the States and the American people.   The so-called Freedom to Vote Act: John R. Lewis Act, which Democrats  hope to attach as a rider to nongermane legislation, will undermine the  very integrity of our elections, not improve and increase access to  voting, a mission we all share.   The right to vote is sacred and represents the most important  expression of self-governance as American citizens. This legislation  will further erode the confidence of the voters who have already lost  faith in our ability to ensure free and fair elections.   President Biden and his allies in Congress are yet again pushing  unconstitutional legislation to ban popular voter ID laws and mandate  ballot harvesting. This includes States that have already passed these  commonsense laws to bolster election integrity and guarantee that each  citizen is guaranteed one vote in each election, not more than one.   This legislation also burdens the American taxpayer with the  obligation to fund political campaigns, even for those whom they don't  support. Worse, this pair of bills will open the door for noncitizens  to vote, thus undermining and diluting the power of sworn citizens to  control their government.   In my home State, Democrats--one-party rule in New York City; one- party rule in Albany--are already enacting these radical policies that  drive a dagger into the heart of self-governance. This deliberate act  to erode our democracy and to weaken the voting power of American  citizens is not only wrong; it is unconstitutional.   Article II of the New York State Constitution explicitly states that:  ``Every citizen shall be entitled to vote at every election . . .''  Section 5-102 of New York Election Law states: ``No person shall be  qualified to register for and vote at any election unless he'' or she  ``is a citizen of the United States . . .'' Finally, the 15th Amendment  to the U.S. Constitution also protects the right of all eligible  citizens to vote.   Subversive legislation, such as the law allowing noncitizens to vote  signed recently into law in New York City, and most of the provisions  that we are debating today, will, if passed, undermine the core  principles of freedom and individual rights that are enshrined and  protected by our constitutional Republic.   In fact, a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found that a mere 20 percent of  the public was very confident in the integrity of our election system.   Our democratic principles and the belief in the idea of ``one person,  one  [[Page H72]]  vote'' are under attack. When our citizens lose faith in the integrity  of our elections, this is what happens.   We are at a crossroads.                                time  2220     Too many precious American souls have sacrificed life and  limb to protect our sacred right to vote. Now is the time to choose  self-governance by, of, and for the people, not a takeover and  surrender to partisan bureaucrats.
