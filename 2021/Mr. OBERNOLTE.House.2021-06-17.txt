 Mr. Speaker, I rise to note with great alarm the  recent uptick in inflation in our country.   Last month, the Consumer Price Index rose over 5 percent, which is  over 2\1/2\ times the Fed's target rate for inflation in our country.   The price of lumber--although, thankfully, it has declined the last  week--is still over three times what it was just a few months ago. The  price of fuel is over 50 percent higher. And that mirrors the price of  many commodities from corn to soybeans.   This is alarming, not just from a macroeconomic standpoint, but most  importantly, from the standpoint of the constituents we represent. The  Members of this Chamber might be able to afford to spend 50 percent  more to fill the tank of their car, but unfortunately, many of the  people we represent cannot. And that burden of inflation is an unseen  tax on the least advantaged members of our society, the members of the  lower class, and the working poor.   Economists tell us that this uptick in inflation is directly related  to the  [[Page H2916]]  spending policies of our government, and we need to get our fiscal  house in order to prevent this in the future.                            ____________________
