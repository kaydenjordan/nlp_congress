Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to oppose Steven Bradbury's  nomination to serve as general counsel at the Department of  Transportation.   The general counsel position at DOT oversees and makes critical  judgments about legal work that impacts public safety, development, and  innovation that drives our economy. Unfortunately, Mr. Bradbury's  previous actions during his time at the Department of Justice showed  that he lacks the judgment and commitment to our shared values that are  a prerequisite for any lawyer privileged to serve the people of the  United States of America.   During his time as the acting head of the Department of Justice's  Office of Legal Counsel, Mr. Bradbury was one of three primary lawyers  who helped lay the groundwork for the Bush administration's defense of  what they described as ``enhanced interrogation techniques.'' The so- called torture memos that Mr. Bradbury helped write were used to  justify the Bush administration's decision to use torture that included  extreme sleep deprivation, cramped confinement, and waterboarding. Mr.  Bradbury helped find legal loopholes that were an affront to our  American values. And he failed to fulfill the special responsibility  all lawyers have to the quality of justice in our legal system.    Mr. Bradbury's past government service reflects a lack of sound legal  judgment. In fact, a 2009 review by the Department of Justice raised  questions about the objectivity and reasonableness of the conclusions  found in the memos he authored. Rather than standing up for our values  and laws, Mr. Bradbury deferred to the wishes and pressure of the  President he was serving.   Furthermore, during his confirmation hearing, when referring to his  legal justification for these so-called enhanced interrogation  techniques, Mr. Bradbury stated: ``If I had my druthers, I wouldn't  have engaged in having to address those issues.''   If Mr. Bradbury preferred to not engage in tough legal questions at  the time, then he should not have been serving in the Office of Legal  Counsel, and he should not be confirmed for a general counsel position  now. By definition, the job of general counsel is to deal with  difficult legal questions.   It is clear Mr. Bradbury is unwilling to provide the sound legal  judgement and impartiality necessary for this role. He has  demonstrated, in the past, that his legal analysis is flawed, he lacks  a commitment to America's values, and his actions have had truly  dangerous implications for our Nation.   I will oppose this nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S7192]]         I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
