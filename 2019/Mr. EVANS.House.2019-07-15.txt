 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York (Mr.  Delgado) for the introduction.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for H.R. 1649, the Small  Business Development Center Cyber Training Act.   As vice chair of the Small Business Committee, I was proudly joined  by fellow colleagues in the committee, Ranking Member Chabot and  Chairwoman Velazquez, in introducing this important bipartisan  legislation.   I consider small business to be the foundation of our communities.  They are the engines that drive innovativeness, investments, and  economic development, and they are the pillars that prop up our  neighborhoods.   Both in my home State of Pennsylvania and across the U.S., small  businesses account for more than 99 percent of all businesses.  Nationally, they support almost 59 million jobs.   Over the past decade, as we have seen immense growth in technology  and innovativeness, we have also seen an increase in incidents  involving the theft of valuable information from businesses and  governments.   In 2014, it was discovered that the Office of Personnel Management  was hacked, resulting in the theft of over 20 million records.   In 2013, criminals broke into Target's databases, with the credit and  debit information from almost 40 million consumers being compromised.   Breaches have also been reported at Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase, and  Sony.  [[Page H5810]]    As we have witnessed, these breaches can have extremely devastating  and costly impacts on major corporations.   Now, if major entities struggle with the challenges of cybersecurity,  what chances do our small businesses have?   H.R. 1649 was written to address this risk by providing cyber  training, strategies, and resources to small businesses to better equip  themselves against cyberattacks.   I appreciate having the opportunity to co-lead this important piece  of legislation that will truly help our small businesses, the backbone  of our Nation's economy, have the tools they need to protect themselves  and to succeed.     Mr. Speaker, I applaud the gentleman and the coleader for  leading this event for the Congressional Black Caucus under the  leadership of Chairwoman Karen Bass. The Congressional Black Caucus is  the conscience of this Congress.    I don't know if you know, and I am constantly reminding people, Mr.  Speaker, that the President, in August 2016, came to Philadelphia and  said, ``What the hell do you have to lose?'' That is what he said.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues from the Congressional  Black Caucus in calling for an increase in the Federal minimum wage. I  am pleased that the Democratic leadership plans to put the Raise the  Wage Act up for a vote in the House.   A raise for these workers is long overdue. Congress has not raised  the national minimum wage in 10 years.  [[Page H5818]]  My home State has not raised its minimum wage for 13 years. Inflation  has increased the cost of living nearly 19 percent from 10 years ago.  Food, healthcare, and utilities all went up.   Let me repeat that. A raise for these workers is long overdue.  Congress has not raised the national minimum wage for 10 years. My home  State of Pennsylvania has not raised its minimum wage for 13 years.  Inflation has raised the cost of living nearly 19 percent from 10 years  ago. Food, healthcare, and utilities all went up.   Members from both parties should be able to agree that no one who  works full-time should live in poverty. I am very focused on poverty  because my city of Philadelphia has a 26 percent poverty rate.   Raising the minimum wage is one of the best tools in the toolbox for  lifting Americans out of poverty. That includes 600,000 children who  will be lifted out of poverty by the Raise the Wage Act.   It is important, Mr. Speaker, to understand that one of our  colleagues, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who leads the effort around the  reduction of poverty, particularly child poverty, when we talk about  the issue, 600,000 children will be lifted out of poverty by the Raise  the Wage Act. How can my colleagues say no to that?   We need to find some way to move forward. We have an opportunity, and  that opportunity is the Raise the Wage Act. Americans who are working  the hardest to grow our economy need to share the rewards of that  growth. Just think, that raise in their pocket allows them to spend  money in the economy. That is not something to take lightly.   When we talk about small businesses--and I am the vice chair of the  Small Business Committee--and we talk about small businesses being the  backbone of our community, obviously, they need customers. They need  customers who have money in their pockets.   It is not just enough for that individual, but it is enough for  entrepreneurs. It is enough for building businesses. It is enough for  building communities. It is enough for all of us to recognize the  importance and the significance of raising the wage.   We need to not take that lightly. We need to understand that, in some  of our communities, there is a growing income inequality gap, and we  need to address that. The way to address it is by fundamentally raising  the wage. Raising the wage gives people more of an opportunity to  participate in this economy.   We know this economy tends to be rigged for those who are at the top  against those at the bottom who are trying to struggle and find a way.  When you talk about our not raising the minimum wage in 10 years--and  13 years in Pennsylvania--I want anyone who is listening or watching  what is taking place here this evening to know that the Congressional  Black Caucus, clearly, as the chairperson always likes to say--she  always talks about hidden figures. The hidden figures are that we  haven't raised the wage in 10 years, and in Pennsylvania, they haven't  raised it in 13 years.   Americans who are working are working harder. They are working more  than one job. They are working two, three jobs. There is something  wrong with that. The CEOs have definitely been getting their raises.   Where is the raise for the people who cook their food, make their  beds, and clean their offices? Where is the raise for the people who  cook their food, make their beds, and clean their offices?   Today, led by my two colleagues from the great State of Nevada and  the great Virgin Islands who are leaders in this effort, I am glad to  join with them to add my voice to raising the wage.   This is not an accident that the Congressional Black Caucus will be  in the forefront because this is an issue that means a great deal to an  awful lot of Americans and particularly African Americans when we have  a President of the United States who comes and says: What do you have  to lose?   The fact of the matter is, when we look at his administration,  clearly, the policies are not connecting to moving the people, at least  not moving the people whom we are talking to and the situations that we  are seeing.   The bottom line on the minimum wage is simple: Pay these people now.  Pay these people now and raise the wage.   We can no longer joke about this. We can no longer have it as  political rhetoric. We must show action, and we must show people that  we are determined to raise the wage.   I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to add my voice  to both of yours for what we are attempting to do today. We need to  keep doing this every single day and not leave here until this wage  raises.   The bottom line of the minimum wage is simple: Pay these people now  and raise the wage.                                time  2000
