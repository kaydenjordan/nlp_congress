 Mr. Speaker, I stand today in solidarity with  46,000 United Automobile Workers who are now entering their fifth week  on strike following the expiration of their contract in September.   Ironically, this September also marked the end of GM's third quarter,  where it sold 737,000 vehicles, more than any other U.S. automaker,  recording record profits and capturing nearly 18 percent of market  share.   GM cited product quality and reliability for its continued strong  sales. The United Automobile Workers made those 737,000 vehicles with  pride and dedication and attention to detail.   The United Automobile Workers made sacrifices to keep GM whole when  the automaker faced bankruptcy 10 years ago. Now those workers simply  want to keep their families whole with good healthcare, fair wages, and  job security.   With record sales, a fair deal is within reach, one that secures the  long-term success of General Motors and a better future for United  Automobile Workers. Let's get the deal done.                            ____________________
