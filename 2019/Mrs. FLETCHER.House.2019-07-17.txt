 Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11, the spacecraft that sent  Americans to the Moon.   On September 12, 1962, before a crowd of 40,000 spectators at Rice  University in Houston, President John F. Kennedy announced the  ambitious goal of sending Americans to the Moon before the end of the  decade.   On July 20, 1969, we got there. Neil Armstrong became the first human  to set foot on the surface of the Moon, and 19 minutes later Buzz  Aldrin became the second.   More than 600 million people around the world watched Armstrong take  his first step live on television. The first words they heard on the  Moon were ``Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,''  followed by the observation, ``That's one small step for man, one giant  leap for mankind.''   As a native Houstonian and the Representative of Texas' Seventh  Congressional District, these historic words are seared in my mind. The  Apollo 11 mission was more than just an amazing technological  advancement, it brought Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs  together toward a common goal and a common purpose. It made people a  part of something bigger than themselves, perhaps bigger than they had  ever imagined.   More than 400,000 Americans worked to make the Apollo 11 mission a  success, many of them based at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  From the support crew to the flight directors at mission control, to  the space suit designers, to the human computers, engineers, and  scientists who designed and built the hardware and software, to the  custodial staff who worked in the building to make sure that they had a  place to work, and to every small job in between, Apollo 11 was the  result of a historic collaboration across our country.   The resounding success of the Apollo program served to captivate the  world's attention and cemented America's status as a leader in  scientific discovery and technological innovation, and it taught us  what we as Americans can do, what we can accomplish when we work  together toward a common goal. What we learned from this mission is  that, when we do that, even the sky is not the limit.                            ____________________
