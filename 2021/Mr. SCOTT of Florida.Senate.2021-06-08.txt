 Mr. President, there is clearly an urgent need  for the United States to address the growing threat posed by Communist  China. In so doing, we can't forget the commitment we all made to  American taxpayers to be responsible stewards of their tax dollars.   America is in a nearly $30 trillion debt crisis. We can't afford to  spend more than $250 billion on a bill that doesn't pay for itself.  Worse, it would add to our national yearly deficit in dramatic fashion,  which is what triggers the point of order I am raising today.   In 2018, we agreed not to pass spending bills without a way to pay  for them, but there is no plan to pay for this. We are completely  ignoring our own rules to advance this spending.   Spending beyond our means has consequences. There will be a day of  reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 to S. 1260,  would violate the Senate pay-go rule by increasing the on-budget  deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure  pursuant to section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71 to the concurrent  resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S3976, June 8, 2021, second column, the following  appears: There will be a day of reckoning. The pending measure,  Senate amendment No. 1502 to amendment No. 1260, would violate the  Senate pay-go.      The online Record has been corrected to read: There will be a  day of reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502  to S. 1260, would violate the Senate pay-go.    ========================= END NOTE =========================
