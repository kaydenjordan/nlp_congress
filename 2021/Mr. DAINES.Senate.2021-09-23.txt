 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Dave Hutton of Flathead County as Montanan of the Month for  his dedication to serving the Kalispell community as a parking officer.   Dave brings a positive and upbeat attitude to one of the most  thankless jobs in the Flathead Valley. Whether it is a sweltering July  day or a snowy December morning, Patrolman Dave greets every Montanan  he meets with a smile.   It is the simple things that make Dave a model Montanan. Locals have  seen him stop in roadways to protect pedestrians from oncoming traffic,  and he is often spotted chatting with local shop owners who are always  excited to see a friendly face.   One early June morning, Dave was rounding a corner on Main Street and  noticed a line of debris littering the street and blocking the  sidewalk. Unbeknownst to him, the night before, a reckless drunk driver  had driven off the road damaging thousands of dollars in property.  Instead of ignoring the mess, Dave took the initiative to stop and  clean up the area.   This silent service to the community was just one of many in his  tenure. Through his kindness and positivity, Patrolman Dave has made a  lasting impression on the citizens who live, work, and shop in  Kalispell.   It is my honor to recognize Dave for his dedication to the Kalispell  community and for doing the small, silent acts of service that are  often forgotten. Keep up the great work, Dave.
