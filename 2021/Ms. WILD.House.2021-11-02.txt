 Mr. Speaker, we have been working hard on a transformative  bill that will make a difference in so many people's lives, the Build  Back Better Act. And yet, the Democrats who are behind this bill, who  have worked on it so hard, have been under a barrage of attack and  criticism for being in disarray, for being unable to get it done.   But let me say this: This is how it should be done. We are talking  about historic unprecedented investments in our climate, in universal  pre-K, in drug pricing, in housing policy. Why would anyone think that  that is a bill that should come together quickly?   This is the legislative process. We craft. We read. We edit. We make  changes. We read it again--all for the good of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, we will get this done and it will be a solid, well- thought-out, beautiful piece of legislation. It will make a real  difference in people's lives. Keep the faith.                            ____________________
