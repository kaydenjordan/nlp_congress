 Mr. President, due to ongoing and urgent recovery  efforts from Hurricane Irma, which devastated many parts of Florida, I  am staying in my State to assess the damage and help marshal the full  capacity of recovery resources available to us. Congress  [[Page S5477]]  has passed authorizations for use of military force, AUMFs, that the  President is using to fight the war on terror and conduct  counterterrorism operations against our enemies. This includes the  Islamic State, which the State Department recently reaffirmed is guilty  of genocide, and other terrorist groups that continue to pose grave and  persistent threats to the United States and our allies.   Paul amendment No. 871 would repeal these critical congressionally  passed AUMFs, so I therefore oppose this amendment.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
