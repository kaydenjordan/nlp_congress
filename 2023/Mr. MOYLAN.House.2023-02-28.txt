 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the late Jacob Cruz Barnes  who sadly left this world earlier this month.   Jacob, also known as Jake, was a proud son of Guam and a proud  veteran of the United States Air Force who served our great country for  over 29 years in uniform. Jake also spent a good number of years  ensuring that the many needs of our community were addressed in public  service.   Unfortunately, the last couple of years were very challenging for  Jake and his family as he was unable to get needed care that he  required as he fought several medical challenges, including the fight  for survival. The simple and decent services were unavailable in Guam  for not only Jake, but for many other of our veterans.   These are individuals who have put so much on the line to preserve  freedom and democracy to our great Nation and our beautiful island of  Guam, that this country, this government needs to invest more to ensure  when it is their time to obtain reliable care that it is made available  for them at home where they can be with their family and loved ones.   Sadly, Jake had to relocate to the mainland to obtain additional  care. We need to do more.   This government needs to take note that Guam has among the highest  per capita enlistments in the Nation. We have proud patriots who call  Guam their home. We have American citizens who are treated as second- class citizens when it comes to care, whether it be for our veterans or  even when it comes to SSI for our disabled residents.   We can't say we are a land of opportunity when American citizens on  U.S. territory are not provided equity.   Jake leaves behind a legacy of leadership, courage, and commitment to  his family, our island, and our Nation.   I had the honor of serving with his wife, longtime senator and former  Speaker in the Guam legislature, Tina Muna Barnes, over the past 4  years. She, too, has always been a staunch advocate for equity when it  comes to benefits for our community. I witnessed firsthand the  challenges she and her family had to endure to ensure that care was  made available for Jake. It wasn't easy.   From the Halls of this historic building which represent democracy  and freedom, I honor a veteran, a son of Guam, the late Jacob Cruz  Barnes.   On behalf of the 118th Congress, I express my deepest condolences to  his wife, Speaker Tina, his four children, his grandchildren and great- grandchildren, and his many other family members.   Jake, thank you for your service and may you rest in peace.                            ____________________
