I want first to salute my colleague, Senator Whitehouse, who will be  on the floor momentarily. He has come to the floor many times to talk  about issues relative to climate change and global warming. He has come  on so many occasions that I have lost track, but it shows his  dedication to this issue.   He has also been outspoken on the issue of campaign financing and  what is happening in America today. We all know that it takes big money  to run big campaigns, and we all know that many people are put off by  politicians who are waiting on wealthy donors to give them the money to  make it across the finish line. That is a fact.   I have always said that in this business of politics, there are two  categories. There are multimillionaires and mere mortals, and I am in  the second category, never having enough money to finance my own  campaign, prevailing on my friends to help. It is too bad that politics  has reached the level where campaigns are so long and so expensive.   Tonight Senator Whitehouse and I will highlight one aspect of that  issue that is particularly worrisome and really should be front and  center; that is, the so-called secret contributions, the dark money-- money that is being spent on political campaigns with no fingerprints.  It is a growing phenomenon, and it is troublesome to think that our  democracy has reached that point.   I am going to speak about one aspect of it, and Senator Whitehouse  will follow me on the topic. I thank him for initiating this  opportunity this evening.   Let me tell my colleagues what my topic is about. It is one aspect of  it. We know that the United States leads the world in medical research.  Because of the U.S. scientific community, HIV/AIDS is no longer a death  sentence, polio has been eradicated in this country, people survive  cancer and heart attacks in record number, and a child born today will  likely live to be 78 years of age--nearly three decades longer than a  baby born in 1900.   Thanks to the U.S. scientific community, we know the true dangers of  tobacco. Now we are learning about the dangers related to e-cigarettes.  But it was not always the case that the dangers of cigarette smoking  were commonly accepted knowledge. For years, the tobacco industry  claimed to be interested in rigorous, independent science. They wanted  to sell less harmful products, and they wanted to support scientific  research. Evidence has now been disclosed which unequivocally  demonstrates that tobacco companies, by funding alternate research and  funneling money into front organizations to do their bidding, have  literally corrupted the science on this issue. They produced products  they knew were no less hazardous and sought to influence elections to  ensure the friendliest voices supporting tobacco were elected to office  at Federal, State, and local levels all across the country.   If this tactic sounds familiar, it should. It is exactly what the  Koch brothers are currently doing with respect to sowing seeds of doubt  about the causes of climate change and helping to elect Republicans who  are climate change deniers.   I have said repeatedly on the floor of the Senate and I will repeat  this evening: The Republican Party of the United States of America is  the only major political party in the world today that denies climate  change. I have said that repeatedly, expecting some Republican to come  to the floor and say it is not true. One of them whispered to me in the  elevator after I said this a few times: I think there is a party in  Australia that also denies climate change. That is the best they could  come up with.   How did this happen? There was a time when Republicans were the  leaders when it came to environmental protection. If I am not mistaken,  I say to my colleague, I think it was President Richard Nixon who  created the Environmental Protection Agency.   When I look back on my own experience in Congress, there were  Republicans who stood up and spoke up on the issue of climate change. I  remember when John McCain and Joe Lieberman were the two lead sponsors  on a bill dealing with global warming. It has been within my period of  time serving in the Senate, but not anymore. It has changed  dramatically. The Koch brothers, I think, are behind it. They didn't  come up with this strategy on their own. They were able to look at Big  Tobacco's playbook from years gone by.   The first thing Big Tobacco did was to question legitimate science.  The Koch brothers got right in line. They have been questioning  legitimate science when it comes to global warming, and they pioneered  efforts to use dark money to influence America's public opinion and to  sway elections without ever really revealing their true identities or  motivations.   I look back on tobacco and cancer. I am one--probably, like most  Americans--who has lost a dearly loved member of my family to tobacco  and cancer. My father died when he was 53 years of age from lung  cancer. I was 14 years old. He smoked two packs of Camels a day. It was  a horrible death.  [[Page S2355]]  He lingered for 100 days in the hospital before he died. It is  something you never forget. There is hardly a family in America who  doesn't have a similar story to tell.    By the early 1950s, evidence linking smoking and lung cancer was  growing. Tobacco companies could have responded by taking steps to  protect American consumers. What they did was to launch a conspiracy to  challenge the science behind tobacco. In 1953, tobacco companies hired  the PR firm Hill+Knowlton to lead a pioneering effort to discredit  emerging science and keep people smoking. At the heart of this strategy  was an effort to manufacture a scientific controversy by insisting  there were two sides to the debate about whether cigarette smoking  caused cancer. Tobacco companies identified and paid scientists who had  expressed skepticism about the health risk of cigarettes, who were  critical of statistical methods, and who had offered alternative  theories of what really was causing cancer among smokers.   They also formed an industry-sponsored research entity that claimed  to support independent research. Instead, the organization's main  purpose was to serve the industry's public relations interests--namely,  to sow seeds of doubt about the health risks of smoking and not advance  science. Does it sound familiar to the scientists sowing seeds of doubt  about global warming?   As more and more independent research found an association between  smoking and disease, tobacco companies used their so-called independent  research organizations to insist that there was a great deal of  uncertainty about whether smoking caused cancer. These entities  supported scientists who showed a willingness to generate data and  provide testimony that would support the industry. Meanwhile, tobacco- friendly elected officials were happy to accept this bogus, fake  science while also receiving generous campaign contributions from Big  Tobacco.   The tobacco industry efforts reached new highs--or lows, if you  wish--when, in the early 1970s, there was growing concern about the  impact of secondhand smoke. Arizona became the first State to restrict  indoor smoking in some areas in 1973 after a Surgeon General report  mentioned that secondhand smoke could be harmful to nonsmokers. By  1981, 8 years later, 36 States had some type of smoking restriction in  place.   I know this issue, personally, because as a Member of the U.S. House  of Representatives I decided to offer an amendment to ban smoking on  airplanes. At the time, I was opposed by the leadership of both the  Republicans and the Democrats in the House of Representatives. Of  course, anyone from a tobacco-growing State or from the South opposed  my efforts to ban smoking on airplanes. Well, it turned out we had a  lucky break here and there in the House Rules Committee and got to  bring the measure to the floor of the House for a vote, and I succeeded  in passing the first restriction on smoking on airplanes.   It turned out the reason was obvious: The largest frequent flier club  in America is the U.S. Congress. We spend half of our lives on  airplanes, and we know better when people say: You are sitting in the  nonsmoking section of an airplane. Everybody was in the smoking section  in the back of the airplane was puffing away.   So that measure passed. I called my friend Frank Lautenberg of New  Jersey, then a Senator, and said: Frank, can you take this up in the  Senate? He said he would, and he did, and the two of us passed the  basic prohibition of smoking on airplanes.   By the 1980s, evidence had accumulated about the health risks of  secondhand smoke and, in 1986, the Surgeon General concluded that  secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmokers and was associated  with respiratory illness in children. Once again, tobacco companies  didn't accept the obvious. They responded to the evidence of harm from  secondhand smoke and restrictions on smokers by launching an effort to  undermine the scientific evidence. They identified, trained, and  subsidized friendly scientists and sponsored symposia all around the  world to feature these scientists without revealing they were paying  them to come up with these opinions.   In 1988, tobacco companies began funding the Center for Indoor Air  Research. This is after we started banning the use of cigarettes on  airplanes, for example. Like the other so-called independent research  organizations funded by tobacco companies, CIAR--the Center for Indoor  Air Research--allowed tobacco companies to fund and control the use of  research favorable to their market position so they could continue to  sell addictive, cancer-causing products to more and more people-- especially to kids. To shift emphasis away from secondhand smoke, the  so-called research institute supported studies to weaken the case for  regulation of tobacco.   Why is it important to reflect on history of 30 years ago? It is  happening all over again. Tobacco companies continue to provide funding  to third-party organizations that advocate policies that align with the  interests--such as e-cigarettes--without ever publicly disclosing their  ties to these tobacco companies. In recent years, tobacco companies  have sought to advance the idea that bringing to market so-called lower  risk tobacco products will actually benefit public health. They warn  that overregulations are going to hurt their business.   Tobacco companies have provided funding to an array of think tanks-- the Heartland Institute, the R Street Institute, the National Center  for Public Policy Research, just to name a few. These tobacco industry- funded groups have sent letters to policymakers, they publish op-eds,  they write reports, and they issue press releases that mirror the  tobacco industry's position, warning that any future FDA rules will  burden the tobacco industry and undermine efforts to bring a so-called  lower risk product to market. Many of these groups have historically  been silent or opposed policies that have proven effective in reducing  smoking rates. Do you know what reduces smoking more than anything  else? Cost of the product. As we have seen States and the Federal  Government raise the tobacco tax, we have seen use of the product  diminish. They haven't supported that, of course, and they don't  support smoke-free laws or mass media campaigns.   Last year, Philip Morris, notorious as a tobacco company, established  the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. Let me repeat that. Philip  Morris, a tobacco company, established the Foundation for a Smoke-Free  World. They are going to fund research to end cigarette smoking and  provide $80 million a year for 12 years. Given their history and their  continued opposition to proven policies to reduce cigarette use, excuse  me if I am skeptical.   That is the problem, isn't it? Research from the Foundation for a  Smoke-Free World or TV ads or op-eds from the Heartland Institute or  the National Center for Public Policy Research just may seem harmless,  but if the American public and elected officials knew that R.J.  Reynolds, Altria, or Philip Morris--some of the biggest tobacco  companies--were behind this research PR, they would be as skeptical as  I am.   One more example: corporations and wealthy donors flooding cash into  efforts to influence the American public and American political  officials. In addition to funding bogus research, we know tobacco  companies have poured millions of dollars into nonprofit, dark money  organizations, which, in turn, spend millions of dollars to influence  elections, never disclosing who they are or where the money is coming  from. Dark money makes it nearly impossible to find the true sources  behind the attack ads and political campaigns these organizations fund,  but sometimes, thanks to the news media and transparency organizations,  the donors are revealed.   In 2013, the Center for Public Integrity reported that the tobacco  giant Reynolds American, Incorporated, funded several dark money groups  during the 2012 election cycle, including conservative activist Grover  Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, the Koch brothers' Americans for  Prosperity--a conservative political advocacy group--and the  Partnership for Ohio's Future, an anti-union organization backed by the  Ohio Chamber of Commerce.   The only reason we know Reynolds was the secret source is because it  was disclosed at the behest of an unnamed  [[Page S2356]]  shareholder; otherwise, these donations and the involvement of tobacco  companies would have remained a secret.   Whether they are quietly funding attack ads or the release of  supposedly unbiased reports, corporations and wealthy donors are using  anonymous, dark money contributions to influence America's public,  casting doubt on legitimate science and trying to sway elections  without ever revealing their true identities and motivations.   It is not just limited to Big Tobacco and their campaigns to turn  public opinion against tobacco taxes and smoke-free laws; the Koch  brothers have built on this model and expanded the Big Tobacco  playbook. They are pushing faulty research in an attempt to obscure the  reality of global warming and using dark money to influence our  political system. Why would the Koch brothers care so much? They are in  the oil business. It is so a rich few can benefit financially at the  expense of everyone else if they vote the Koch brothers' line--and that  is at the expense of our children and grandchildren.   It is time to put an end to dark money influence in elections.   I yield the floor to the leader on this issue in the Senate  Democratic caucus, Senator Whitehouse.
