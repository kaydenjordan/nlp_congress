 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 555, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4502) making appropriations for the Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies  for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. Though, to consume time is not what I am here to do today. To  consume time is a luxury that we can no longer afford.   Madam Speaker, after decades of disinvestment and the devastation of  the pandemic, the time is now to reinvest in the American people. The  time is now to create jobs, grow opportunity, and support our Nation's  most vulnerable. The time is now to meet the moral test of government.   Vice President Hubert Humphrey defined this test by how government  treats ``those who are in the dawn of life . . . , those who are in the  twilight of life . . . , and those who are in the shadows of life.''   As I have led the Committee on Appropriations over the past 6 months,  this idea has served as a guiding light. It has challenged us to dig  deeply into the areas of greatest need and to provide every American  the opportunity to contribute and succeed.   I believe the package of seven appropriations bills before us, H.R.  4502, will not only pass this moral test, it will fulfill the sacred  mission we are charged with as a body to leave this Nation stronger and  better than we found it.   With investments in education, nutrition assistance, and rural and  underserved communities, we are providing every American the resources  they need. By rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure and confronting  the climate crisis, we are creating and sustaining good-paying American  jobs. And with renewed urgency to protect our democracy, close racial  disparities, and advance women's rights, we are building back better  and fostering a brighter future. We are meeting the moment and more  than meeting Hubert Humphrey's moral test.   As chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, I want to take a moment to turn to the  investments we are making in this legislation more specifically to lift  up the most vulnerable and prepare our Nation for future challenges.   The $253.8 billion we provide in the Labor-HHS bill represents a  historic increase of 28 percent. It includes $7.4 billion for the Child  Care and Development Block Grant, $12.2 billion for Head Start, nearly  a $20 billion increase in Federal support for high-poverty schools, and  record funding for students with disabilities.   It provides continued support for social and emotional learning and  makes post-secondary education more affordable with a $400 increase for  the maximum Pell grant. It includes $1.1 billion for programs serving  historically Black colleges and universities, minority-serving  institutions, community colleges, and underresourced institutions of  higher education. And it provides $100 million for the Strengthening  Community Colleges Training Grant program.  [[Page H4047]]    To give workers the skills and protections they need, this bill  includes an increase of $1.6 billion for the Employment and Training  Administration, including a total of $285 million for registered  apprenticeships and $3.1 billion for Workforce Innovation and  Opportunity Act State grants, and $2.1 billion for worker protection  agencies.   This bill heeds the lessons of the pandemic by providing record  funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including  $1 billion for public health infrastructure and capacity. It invests  $6.5 billion in the National Institutes of Health, which were crucial  in developing the COVID-19 vaccine in record time, including an  increase of $3.5 billion for biomedical research at existing NIH  institutes and centers. And it supports the President's request to  establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H,  which will be indispensable in achieving breakthroughs in the treatment  of diseases, such as diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer,  and Alzheimer's disease.   This bill further provides $100 million to help communities create a  new mental health crisis response partnership pilot program in  partnership with our law enforcement agencies. And it provides $50  million for gun violence prevention research at the NIH and the CDC.   Finally, this bill ensures equal treatment for women by repealing the  discriminatory Hyde amendment and supports the more than 3 million men,  women, and young adults who receive the full range of family planning  and reproductive health services funded by Title X.   I have just scratched the surface of the historic and unprecedented  investments contained in this funding package, which together meet this  moment and, I believe, faithfully fulfill the moral test of government.   I thank all the subcommittee chairs, the ranking members, and all the  members of the Committee on Appropriations and their staffs for their  hard work on these bills.   In particular, I must note my deep appreciation for my partnership  with Ranking Member Cole; my partnership with the ranking member of the  full committee, Congresswoman Granger; and my gratitude for the Labor- HHS staff led by Stephen Steigleder, and including Jared Bass, Philip  Tizzani, Jennifer Cama, Jackie Kilroy, Laurie Mignone, Becky Salay, and  Trisha Castaneda. Thank you as well to the minority staff, Susan Ross  and Kathryn Salmon. Last but not least, I must thank my personal staff,  including Liz Albertine, Christian Lovell, Caitlin Peruccio, and Marie  Gualtieri.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chair of the Committee on Appropriations'  Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies.

Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Subcommittee on  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for  Appropriations.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House.  [[Page H4051]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree), the chair of the Subcommittee on Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial  Services and General Government.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, our country faces dire needs. Far too many people are  struggling to put food on the table, to pay their rent. Many more  struggle to afford childcare or the cost of education and skills  training. The deck has been stacked for so long for the wealthy and the  well connected, while our infrastructure crumbles and the existential  threat of climate change looms. From the mountains of Appalachia to the  struggling neighborhoods of our largest cities, the biggest deficit we  face is one of hope.   The moral test of our government today is how we meet these  challenges. It is whether we can rise to the occasion and deliver hope  for the American people who have been left behind for far too long.   The bills before us meet that moral test. Their transformative  investments create jobs, grow opportunity, and provide a lifeline to  the vulnerable. They invest in our infrastructure and in a cleaner,  safer future.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 555, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   While I have offered this en bloc amendment for the purposes of  legislative efficiency, I strongly oppose it.   The amendment would cut funding for important programs and services  that provide opportunities for working families. The simultaneous  public health and economic crises of the last 18 months have  demonstrated, once again, that these programs are underfunded. They  fail to meet the existing needs across the country.   A few examples. This amendment would cut Head Start by $2.4 billion.  That leads to tens of thousands of children losing access to high- quality early learning programs.   It cuts the Child Care and Development Block Grant by $1.5 billion,  at a time when parents want to return to work, but there is no one  available to care for their children.   It cuts the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It is a  bipartisan priority, but it cuts it by $780 million.   It cuts senior nutrition, including Meals on Wheels, resulting in 25  million fewer home-delivered or prepackaged meals for low-income  seniors.   It cuts biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. It  is a reduction of 10,000 new grants for potentially lifesaving  research.   It cuts $2 billion from mental health and substance use disorder. CDC  data shows that 93,000 deaths in 2020 were related to drug overdoses,  the highest number ever.   It cuts title I funding for low-income public schools, reducing  needed resources for 25 million low-income students.   It cuts special education grants to States by more than $3 billion.  It reduces support for services for 7.6 million students with  disabilities.   It cuts Federal financial aid programs--the Pell grants, the FSEOG  program, and work study--by $5.4 billion for students and families in  need.   It cuts funding for job training programs, resulting in fewer  supports for Americans who are seeking better economic opportunities  for themselves and their families.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the Hyde amendment is a discriminatory  policy. For more than 45 years, it has been routinely extended every  year as a legislative rider, but the time has come to reckon with the  status quo, a status quo that denies health to the poor, in this case,  disproportionately denying people of color health services available to  those who can afford this choice.   The inequities in our country's healthcare system have been exposed  by COVID-19. Systemic racism makes itself felt here, and it is time we  insist on equality for women, particularly women of color. However we  feel about abortion, we shouldn't deny health coverage just because  someone is working to make ends meet.  [[Page H4057]]    When Medicaid covers the cost of pregnancy-related care, including  abortion, it means someone can make a decision based on what is best  for their circumstances. Thirty-three States and the District of  Columbia deny State funding to women seeking access to abortion. As a  result, millions of economically insecure women in these States are  hostage to their geography.   I work every day to advance the respect for life and dignity for  every human being. I believe that government has a moral purpose, and I  am committed to helping the poor and the disadvantaged, reducing the  rising rates of poverty, taking seriously the decision to go to war.   We cannot pick and choose among life issues. Increased access to  education is a life issue. The COVID-19 vaccine is a life issue. The  Affordable Care Act is a life issue. Medicaid expansion is a life  issue. Separating children from their families is a life issue. Gun  violence prevention research is a life issue. Food and nutrition  assistance, housing and homelessness assistance, supporting background  checks, addressing climate change are all life issues.   The bills today all address these issues, all of which my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle oppose. I am proud that the bill we  consider today moves us forward, ensuring access to essential  reproductive healthcare services. It protects women's health and  empowers all women by eliminating these riders which for years have  allowed certain politicians to insert themselves into a woman's most  personal care decision. The decision to get an abortion should be made  by a woman and her family in consultation with her doctor and in  accordance with her own faith. The decision should not be made by  people in this Chamber.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair of the Subcommittee on Defense.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, this amendment would cut Head Start, cut  childcare, cut low-income home energy assistance, cut senior nutrition,  cut biomedical research, cut mental health programs, cut title I for  low-income public schools, cut special education, cut Federal financial  aid programs like Pell grants and work-study programs, and cut funding  for job training, and so much more.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 555, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.   Madam Speaker, the en bloc amendment includes a number of proposals  offered by Members on both sides of the aisle. It includes amendments  offered by both Democrats and Republicans and several offered jointly  by Members of both parties on which the vast majority of this body can  agree.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I misspoke earlier. This en bloc  amendment includes a number of proposals offered by my Democratic  colleagues, and it reflects our shared values of investing in the  American people to create good paying jobs, grow opportunity, and  provide a lifeline to the vulnerable; and I urge support.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en  bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Pursuant to House Resolution 555, I offer amendments en  bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.   This is an en bloc amendment and includes a number of proposals  offered by Members on both sides of the aisle. It includes amendments  offered by both Democrats and Republicans and several offered jointly  by Members of both parties on which the vast majority of this body can  agree.   I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify that if this amendment passes, it does  not fund the specific project referred to by Mr. Pfluger in debate.   I support this general type of funding, and the text in the summary  of the amendment are general, but the Committee on Appropriations has  established a process for consideration of a specific community project  funding request. That process is designed to ensure transparency and  accountability.   The intention of this amendment, as explained by Mr. Pfluger during  debate, appears to fund such a project without going through the  vetting process. Accordingly, I would encourage my friend to submit the  project to the Appropriations Committee under the established process  next fiscal year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Spanberger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close. I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support this amendment and urge Members  to pass it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 555, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   While I have offered this en bloc amendment for the purposes of  legislative efficiency, I strongly oppose it. The en bloc makes severe  harmful changes to the bills under consideration.   Within the Labor-HHS-Education division, the amendment would support  discrimination, it would attack workers' rights, cut money from  education, put affordable child care further out of reach for families.   The amendment strikes a general provision from the bill that  prohibits funding to organizations that do not follow the Federal  regulation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of age,  disability, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, gender  identity, or sexual orientation.   Under the previous administration, HHS used taxpayer dollars to fund  child welfare organizations that were willing to discriminate against  families.   The United States has over 400,000 children in foster care, over  125,000 of whom are waiting to be adopted. Children in foster care need  and deserve every chance to be placed in loving homes.   America's workers, this amendment prohibits the Department of Labor  from revising the previous administration's antiworker rule, granting  taxpayer-funded contractors the extraordinary power to hire and fire  employees based on religious beliefs. The rule weakens antibias  protections for workers by shielding Federal contractors from complying  with workplace antidiscrimination laws.   The amendment undermines the highly successful registered  apprenticeship grant program by wasting taxpayer funds on low-quality,  predatory programs with no accountability.   At a time when quality, affordable education is more important than  ever, this amendment cuts $122 million from the higher education  account and the underlying bill. The amendment takes money away from  Hispanic-serving institutions, historically Black colleges and  universities, Tribal colleges and universities, Asian-American and  Native-American Pacific Islander-serving institutions, and other  minority-serving institutions.   Finally, as our Nation faces a childcare crisis, the amendment  reduces childcare options for student parents who rely on university  childcare programs supported by the Childcare Access Means Parents in  Schools Program.   Harmful changes. This barely scratches the surface of funding cuts  and harmful policy provisions espoused in this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this en bloc. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Speaker, for the reasons I spoke of earlier, I urge  a defeat of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, through scientific research, institutions  of higher education advance our understanding, advance our knowledge of  various aspects of our world, expands our knowledge. Without such  research, there would be limited scientific discovery and breakthroughs  helping to shape our daily lives.   As more States and localities move to legalize cannabis, including my  home State of Connecticut earlier this month, many institutions of  higher education are expanding the knowledge base on this controlled  substance, offering scientific information to better inform  decisionmaking and medical use.   What are its properties for medical use? I don't know. I am not a  scientist. I am not a medical professional. That is what science is  about, to expand our minds, to give us information about what  directions we ought to take.   In advancing our understanding of cannabis, many institutions fear  that they will lose access to Federal funding because of the Drug-Free  Schools and Communities Act, which, in part, prohibits the possession  of a controlled substance, including cannabis.   The underlying bill includes a provision to prohibit the Department  of Education from penalizing institutions of higher education that  conduct scientific research on marijuana. Evidence-based research  regarding cannabis ought to be encouraged in academic settings, not  discouraged. We should ensure that we broaden our understanding of  marijuana, not limit it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 555, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that amendment Nos.  129 and 205 printed in part B of House Report 117-109 be modified in  the form I have placed at the desk.
