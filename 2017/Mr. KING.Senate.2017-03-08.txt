 Madam President, I rise to address the bill that has been  recently--and I emphasize the word ``recently''--introduced in the  House of Representatives. I believe it was introduced Monday. It is  having not a hearing but a markup today, and may be on the House floor  as soon as tomorrow or early next week.   As the President said recently, healthcare is complicated. To me, to  introduce a bill that was not available to any Members of Congress  before Monday, mark it up in committee 2 days later, attempt to pass it  on the floor of the House, and then I understand it may come directly  to the floor of the Senate without any committee consideration, it just  seems to me is a disservice to the process and a disservice to the  traditions and practices of this institution.   This is complicated. It is difficult. The ramifications and  implications of this bill, just as any other major change in our  healthcare system, are incredibly important. This is not about  ideology. This is about people. This is about the impact on people. I  want to talk about the impact of this bill, as we have thus far been  able to assess it, on the people of Maine. When I look at a piece of  legislation down here, I start with Maine. How will it affect the  people who live along our coast or inland, in the small towns, and  particularly people who are above the age of 50?   Maine happens to be the oldest State in the country. Therefore,  anything which negatively impacts seniors doubly negatively impacts the  people of my State. I feel this bill is a disaster for seniors. I  define seniors in this case as anybody over 50 because it does several  things. One of the things it does, and there should be a great deal of  discussion about this, under the Affordable Care Act, which recognizes  the fact that seniors and people who are older tend to have more  medical needs than those who are younger, it caps differential at three  times. In other words, a senior can only pay three times what a younger  person pays, and even that is burdensome in many cases.   This bill changes three to five. It will be a very substantial  increase in the payments and the costs of insurance and healthcare to  senior citizens. Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is, I find,  the most nonpartisan and informative source of information on all of  these issues, has created a handy tool on their website, where you can  put in information, such as family income and age, and determine what  you would have paid under the Affordable Care Act and what you would  pay under this new bill.   What they found was--I wanted to look and see what somebody in my  State will pay. If you are a 60-year-old in Aroostook County Maine with  an income of $30,000, the subsidy--the support for the premium for  individual insurance--would fall by 70 percent. The support for your  insurance policy under the Affordable Care Act would fall by 70  percent.   Throughout our State, the average decrease would be 48 percent-- almost half. So we are talking not about some theoretical, ideological,  political thing here, we are talking about people's ability to afford  health insurance. It is about as clear as it could be. That is why it  is frustrating to me that we collectively--the Congress--are going to  be asked to consider this bill with literally no hearings, no input  from the public, no discussion of how all the pieces fit together or  don't fit together. Yet we are going to be asked--I believe, my  understanding is, we are going to be asked to vote on this bill  sometime on the floor of the Senate, without any committee  consideration, in the next week or so.   This is too important to people's lives to give it such short shrift.  It is just not right to make changes of this magnitude that are so  vital to people's well-being and literally their health and their  survival in some cases. It is unthinkable to me that we would do this  without a round of hearings and discussions and the regular order that  we supposedly honor around here as to how major legislation is to come  to the floor.   I received a letter just recently: ``Hi, Angus.''   I like it when my correspondents say ``Hi, Angus'' instead of  ``Senator.''         Hi, Angus [he says]. I have worked in the pulp and paper       industry for close to 30 years. It was a good industry up       here, supported middle-class families in northern Maine. But       we have had layoffs and closures of our mills. After every       closure, I had to obtain health insurance for my family on my       own. Before ObamaCare, this was a disaster. I could only       obtain catastrophic insurance from one of two providers.       There was no way I could pay $1,500 a month for a decent       plan. After ObamaCare, I could obtain decent insurance at a       decent price. While there may have been problems for some, it       was a godsend for my family. Please help ensure we don't go       back to the old days. We are self-employed by our small       business and would not be able to pay more for less.    That is what the bill that is in the House would do, pay more for  less. By the way, how does the money work in this bill? Well, one of  the things the bill does is, my understanding, and, again, I am only  operating on what we have seen in the last 24 hours because of no  hearings, but one of the things it does is eliminate a tax on people  who make over $250,000 a year in order to cut coverage for people who  are not making that kind of money.   It is a tax cut, and shifting the cost to our citizens, particularly  our seniors. The pattern is, shift and shaft. Shift the cost, and shaft  the people who need the coverage. This is supposed to be a substitute.  It is supposed to be coverage for everyone. You have to be careful.  When people talk about access, they are talking about: Yes, you can buy  it, but if you can't afford it, that is not really access. This bill  dramatically decreases the support for health insurance premiums  through the Affordable Care Act.   The reality is, and I hear a lot of talk about how ObamaCare is  collapsing. It isn't. More people signed up this year than last year.  Yes, it is true the rates went up, but that was because younger people  were not signing up in significant numbers. We need to deal with that  issue because that makes the risk pool older and sicker and therefore  more expensive.   I have been told by insurance officials that if something like this  bill that is in the House passes and the subsidies disappear and the  Affordable Care Act goes away, the private health insurance market for  individuals, the so-called individual market, will essentially  collapse. The reality is, the uninsured population of this country has  fallen virtually in half since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.  Twenty-two million people have coverage now who did not before and we  can take it away.   The other piece I don't like about this bill is it phases things out  so the impact will not be felt until after the next election or  sometime in the future. Well, the future comes. In this case, the  future is going to be pretty desolate for people who have health  insurance now and are not going to have it 2, 4, or 6 years from now.  It is just not right.   I am one who has been saying, since I entered this body now 4-plus  years ago, that there are problems with the Affordable Care Act. We  should be working on those problems. We should be working on repairing  it, not destroying it. We should not be talking about taking healthcare  coverage away from people in this country.   I am sure I and many others will be addressing more comprehensively  the provisions of this bill as it becomes more clear, even though we  are going to have to ferret those provisions out because we are not  going to have the benefit of expert testimony and views from a variety  of points of view of how this is actually going to work.   The reality is, I don't think there is much question that this  proposal will hammer Maine and my people. I can't stand for that. I  hope the House will have a more vigorous process, they will understand  what the implications are, and take a more judicious approach so we are  not tearing insurance out from under people, we are not going to make  the cost be driven up, we are not giving a tax break to people who make  over $250,000 a year, and at the same time taking coverage away from  people who make $30,000 a year.   That is wrong. We should be repairing, not repealing. I think this  bill is not the right place to start. I stand for the people of Maine.  I stand for the people who are going to be harmed by this, whether they  are seniors or working people or self-employed people or people who  have been able to start businesses because they could get, for the  first time, insurance under the Affordable Care Act.   I believe that is our obligation. We have an opportunity to work  together.  [[Page S1660]]  I am willing to work with anyone who wants to work on improving and  dealing with some of the issues that have been raised by the Affordable  Care Act.   Let's stop talking about repealing. Let's talk about fixing,  strengthening, and meeting our commitment to our fellow citizens in  Maine and across our country.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
