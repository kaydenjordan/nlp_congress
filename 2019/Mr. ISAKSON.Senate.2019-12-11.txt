 Mr. President, I always come to the well of the Senate  with a purpose. I try not to talk too long, and I try to make my point  and get out before I make a big mistake. When you are saying thank you  to people who have done so much for you, it is almost always the time  where you do make a mistake and you leave somebody out here and  somebody out there and somebody out here. I am going to do a little  something I have never done before. I know one thing, I will leave  nobody out.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a list of names of my staff.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Personal Office Staff and Interns         Monica Heil, Jeremy Johnson, Jay Sulzmann, Amanda Maddox,       Marie Gordon, Charles Spry, Michael Gay, Toni Brown, Jody       Redding, Kathie Miller, Nancy Bobbitt, Nancy Brooks, Tommy       Nguyen, Maureen Rhodes, Sheila Robinson, Andrew Blascovich,       Michael Black.        Laura Gower, Will Dent, Jack Overstreet, Gus Youmans,       Elizabeth McKay, Tripp Adams, Hanna Yu, Preston Miller,       Kristine Nichols, Brad Williamson, Ryan Williams, Brooke       Doss, Drew Ferguson, Connor Rabb, Taylor McDowell, Logan       Purvis.        Caroline Maughon, Kate Hunter, Nyjel Jackson, Jason       Maynard, Max Turner, Hannah Kitzmiller, Colleen O'Connell,       Ken Ciarlatta, Seth MacKenney, Riya Vashi, Matt Sartor,       Sahiti Namburar, Olivia Kelly, Frederick Severtson, Floyd       Buford.                             VA Committee Staff         Adam Reece, Thomas Coleman, Reider Grunseth, Asher Allman,       DeKisha Williams, Barry Walker, Leslie Campbell, Annabell       McWherter, John Ashley, Brian Newbold, Lindsay Dearing, David       Shearman, Patrick McGuigan, Jillian Workman, Emily Blair,       Pauline Schmitt.                           Ethics Committee Staff         Deborah Sue Mayer, Karen Gorman, Cami Morrison, Geoff       Turley, Madeline Dang, Shane Kelly, Katharine Quaglieri,       Kelly Selesnick, Charlotte Underwood, Danny Remington, Katie       Jordan, Gabrielle Quintana, Taylore Presta, Taisha Saintil,       Mary Yuengert.     Mr. President, it contains a list of literally hundreds  of people who have helped me get to where I am today in this Chamber. A  few of them are in this Chamber with me right now and a lot of them  were here Tuesday of last week when the Senate was very kind to give me  a sendoff. In fact, I thought they were so happy I was leaving, I had  done something really wrong, and I was saving them some trouble, but  they were really happy because we were being happy together about the  years we have had together.   I have had 15 years together with Members of the U.S. Senate, and it  has been the greatest 15 years of my life. I learned as much about  myself as I learned about anybody else, but I learned even more about  my country, which I love so passionately.   I want to take a few minutes today to talk about a few people I want  to thank for what they said about me, what they have done for me, and  how they have helped me. I wish to also tell the people who may be  listening to this show or watching C-SPAN today to understand there are  a lot of people who make us work. We do all the mistakes by ourselves  without any help, but the good things we do take a lot of help. They  take a lot of strength and a lot of time and a lot of commitment.   The 100 Members of this Senate sitting here have literally hundreds  of people behind them who help them do their job they otherwise  couldn't do. I represent 10 million people; Senators from California,  almost 30 million people; from New York, almost 15 million people. All  of the States have different populations, but all of them have a lot of  people who need help.   That is what Members of the Senate are there to do, along with the  Members of the House, and that is to give them the help they need from  the country they love and the country they were born in or became a  naturalized citizen in.   I want to talk today more about the hard work--the hard work of  licking stamps and envelopes when I first got  [[Page S6977]]  in politics. I don't do that anymore. We punch a computer key, and it  says ``reply all'' or ``distribute to all'' or ``send to all.''  Technology allows us to communicate at the drop of a hat.   The biggest challenge I have every day communicating is because of  what is on television beginning at midnight. President Trump usually  makes a tweet about 3 o'clock in the morning, and the news starts. We  get phone calls, our staff gets phone calls, and for the rest of the  day we are responding to what he said at 3 a.m., knowing the next  morning at 3 a.m. there will be a new tweet. There will be a new issue,  and he will be setting the pace. During the afternoon, when people  respond to it, their response to it will be setting the pace. All of us  are reacting in the third person or for the third time. It is a  challenging job.   With communications like it is and 24/7 television like it is and the  media like they are, it is really a challenge. The men and women who  work for me help me to make that communication. I want to, first of  all, start off by thanking them.   The lady sitting to my left--on the screen, I guess that would make  it your right--Miss Amanda Maddox. Amanda came to work for me a number  of years ago when I stole her from one of the House Members because I  knew she was the best person on the floor of the House. She was not an  easy steal because I knew she was a tough lady, but I knew I needed a  tough lady and somebody who could help. She has been a tremendous help  for me through a lot of difficulties we never expected, neither she nor  I--health challenges that I had, challenges I had in terms of my staff,  training for trips I took, going on trips I took, dealing with the  media during things we took on that were tough. Every day she did it  with skill and aplomb. Every day she did it right, and every day she  helped me look much better than I deserved.   I look in the mirror so I know what I start out with, but when I get  up and open my mouth, I can do even more damage. Amanda keeps me from  doing that. She is a first-class lady.   Another lady who is not here today, unfortunately, is Marie Gordon,  who is in Atlanta. Marie works under Amanda. She works for me in  Atlanta, GA.   They are really my communication. You heard of left brain-right  brain. This is my left brain. Marie is my right brain. They make me  work, and I know how many times I owe to say thank you to them, and it  is more than I could ever come to. They have been wonderful to me, and  I will miss them a lot as I retire, but I know they will be here to  help somebody else along the same way who will take my place and do  just as good a job or better.   I want to, personally, publicly, thank Amanda and Marie for what they  have done and how they made me look good.   A harder job is getting me around with my current difficulties I am  having in terms of movement.   Where is Logan?   Logan is on the floor somewhere. He is my pusher. He is not the kind  of pusher you are thinking about. He is my wheelchair pusher. He  doesn't sell anything else but wheelchairs, but he does a great job  with it and gets me in a lot of bad places I am not supposed to be able  to get into, but he does it safely. We haven't had any accidents, and  he makes me look good. I could not do without Logan and his talent and  his willingness to get up early hours to get me in a truck or get me in  an airplane or get me in my own car and get me to the places I need to  go safely and on time and get me back home to see my wife if we are in  Atlanta or back here to see my many supporters in the office when they  need me.   He is my instant communication man. That means he is also my right  brain. He is in there thinking ahead to make sure we have enough time  to get where we need to go and have enough places to stop for the  restroom, which when you are in a wheelchair, that is something you  have to think about from time to time and all the other little parts of  life you take for granted until you can't do them anymore. When  somebody helps you do them, they are a lifetime friend, and Logan  Purvis is a lifetime friend for me in what he does.   There is a real tall guy somewhere in the room who is good golfer.  His name is Trey Kilpatrick. Trey has been with me for 10 years. He  started with me in my third reelection or second reelection--one of my  reelections--in the first half of this century. Sometimes elections  seem like a century, not a day or not an hour but a century.   Trey has done everything. He has made appointments; he has  substituted for me; and he does an excellent job of that. He has given  me advice on what not to say. When he does this, I know what it means.  I know what it means from my wife, too, but when Trey does it, it means  to shut up, you dummy. He gets me to shut up in time and not say a bad  thing. That is a valuable person.   He is also valuable because I can't play golf anymore, but I let him  play in my stead, and he is a scratch golfer. For those of you who are  listening or watching this, that means he will beat anybody who tries  to beat him, and I hope to get half the money. If I don't get half the  money, I just enjoy seeing him and his great talent.   He has his third child coming pretty soon, so he is producing some  good voters for us in about 15 or 20 years from now. I appreciate that  as well. I appreciate Sally, his wife, and the sacrifice she has made  to let him take as much time out of his life and her life as I have  taken out of their lives.   I appreciate those who have made me look good. They made me look good  all the time, and I appreciate what they have done to help me along the  way with my service in the U.S. Senate.   There is another person I want to talk about for 1 minute. I will do  it some more tomorrow. I will break it up, so I am not taking up all of  the time of the Chair, but I want to take as much as I can right now to  talk about Joan Kirchner Carr. I have a unique situation with the chief  of staff. Joan Kirchner is my chief of staff. Her name is now Joan  Carr. She changed her name because she married my previous chief of  staff. She came with me as a deputy chief of staff and fell in love  with my chief of staff, and they fell in love with each other. He is  now the attorney general of Georgia. She married my chief of staff.   I actually have pretty good luck for somebody who wants to get  married. If you come to my office, you will find a husband or wife or  something like that. That is not a bad thing to happen in Washington,  DC.   Joan has been fantastic. She wrote for AP. She covered me when I was  almost a little guy. I first got elected in 1976, and she was working  for AP at that time in the Georgia Legislature and wrote speeches about  all the people who were in the legislature, and I was one of them. I  was the minority leader. I was the minority leader of a group of 19  Republicans who had 161 Democrats opposing them. Custer had better odds  than we did. We didn't have good odds at all. She was a great writer, a  great reporter, and I fell in love with her--not in the physical sense  but in the platonic sense--because I knew how good she was at what she  did.   Over the years, she impressed me so much, I brought her along on  whatever campaign I had. I brought her along to help me in the office I  had. She ultimately became my press secretary, my deputy chief of  staff, my chief of staff, and my best friend. When you can cover all  those bases at one time, you are doing pretty good, and Joan does  exactly that.   I am so grateful for all those who have helped me along the way, all  those who gave a lot, all those who gave a little but mostly those who  gave of themselves. Politicians are always asking for money; they are  always talking about money; and they are always promising money. Money  is fine, but that doesn't get you much of anything--but relationships  are impossible to replace. You take a good relationship with somebody  who has worked hard to help you get where you want to go, there is  nothing better or more valuable in life. No contribution of money is  worth anything more than just that act of love or that act of kindness  or act of support that gets you where you are going.   From this one guy who is leaving the U.S. Senate under his own power,  but not as much as I used to have, I enjoyed my 15 years more than you  would ever know, and I want to thank all those people who helped me get  here and made it possible for me, particularly those I pointed out now  and will point out later in my speeches this week. May God bless them,  may God bless all of you, and may God bless the United States of  America.  [[Page S6978]]    I yield back.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
