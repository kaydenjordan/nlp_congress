 Madam President, today I would like to recognize  Ms. Beth Anne Maloney of Hampton, NH, and celebrate her well-deserved  retirement after 31 years of service to the students in that community  as a school nurse.   After beginning her nursing career in 1984, Beth joined the staff of  Centre Elementary School in Hampton in the fall of 1988. Centre School  serves roughly 350 prekindergarten through grade 2 students and has the  distinction of being the oldest public school in the State of New  Hampshire. Beth was the school's first full-time registered nurse, and  she has overseen the modernizing of the school's health services.   Over the years, Beth connected with thousands of students while  carrying out her daily duties of assessing health, conducting vision  and hearing screenings, and acting as a first responder. She developed  particularly close relationships with students who had chronic  conditions that required specialized care and management, including  epilepsy, allergies, and asthma. Over time, she gained significant  experience assisting students with type 1 diabetes, who often require  daily nursing assistance with their diet, blood sugar monitoring, and  medication. Beth was actively engaged in developing care plans for  these students that would minimize interruptions to their daily  schedules, and she continually trained her fellow staff members to  prevent and respond to diabetic emergencies.   In addition to her nursing duties, Beth was a tireless advocate for  students in need of health-related services, which could range from  immunizations or a new pair of glasses to specialized care for  untreated conditions. She maintained numerous relationships with  seacoast area health providers willing to help the families of students  in need. Beth also took on a number of charitable causes and frequently  organized the school's annual Thanksgiving food drive in partnership  with the local St. Vincent de Paul Society.   I thank Beth for her dedication to keeping our young people healthy  and her service to the students, parents, and staff, who make up the  Centre School community. I know these values will continue to guide her  future endeavors. Please join me in honoring an outstanding Granite  Stater, Beth Maloney.                            ____________________
