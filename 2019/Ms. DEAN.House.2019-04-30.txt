 Madam Speaker, climate change is already exacting a  dramatic toll: extreme weather, unprecedented migration, and untold  suffering.   Meanwhile, the administration denies basic science, and President  Trump wants to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement.   But the American people--and the world--reject this approach. As Pope  Francis has written: ``We must regain the conviction that we need one  another, that we have a shared responsibility for others and the world,  and that being good and decent are worth it.''   When everyone from the Pope to the Pentagon warns us that we are in a  crisis, it is clearly time to act.   This week we consider H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act. This  legislation will keep us in the Paris Agreement, along with more than  180 other countries; require the President to develop real emissions  plans; and recommit the United States to global climate leadership.   My eldest son and daughter are expecting a child, and I have a 7- year-old granddaughter. I want them to know clean air and pure water.   I also want them to understand that we did everything we could to  protect this wondrous planet for them and for generations to come.   I thank Representative Castor for her leadership, and I urge Members  to support the bill.                            ____________________
