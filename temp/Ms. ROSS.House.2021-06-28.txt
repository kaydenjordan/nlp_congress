 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the NSF for the  Future Act, a critical piece of legislation that would bolster our  Nation's research enterprise and enhance our status as a world leader  in science and research. It is so wonderful that it has been done in a  completely bipartisan way.   Included in this legislation is a bipartisan bill I introduced, the  NSF Technology Research Institutes Act. This important bill would  create a grant program at NSF that will fund technology research  activities at institutes of higher education. This will further our  national innovation enterprise and ensure our technology workforce has  the requisite skill set to work on cutting-edge research as the key to  success in the 21st century.   This program will enable our academic institutions, including those I  represent in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, to further  provide their students with critical research experience to build the  robust technology workforce our country urgently needs.   I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure this critical  bill is signed into law.
