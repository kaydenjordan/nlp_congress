 Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Harvey's hammering  floodwaters crept closer and closer to their home, Annie and her  husband, Gary, became nervously anxious because, you see, Annie was  pregnant and needed to get to the hospital.   But the 2-mile drive to the hospital was no longer possible due to  high rising water. So they called 911, but the lines were busy. Both  doctors in training, the Smiths started preparing for a home delivery.  Finally, a call to Annie's school brought a rescue team to their door.  But the waters were still high and moving fast.   Risking their own lives, numerous neighbors and firefighters formed a  human life chain, passing Annie along in the raging floodwaters to a  high-water truck. A few hours later, Annie brought new life--Adrielle  Smith--into the world.   That is the thing about Texas, Mr. Speaker, we help each other. That  is what makes us Texas strong.   Congratulations to the Smiths on the birth of their hurricane  daughter, Adrielle.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate  it, Congressman Weber, for allowing us to talk a little bit about  Hurricane Harvey and what folks did down in the Texas area.   While it was still raining hard, I get a phone call, and I looked at  the area code on my cell phone and I said: I think that is  Massachusetts.   And sure enough, it was Representative Kennedy from Boston,  Massachusetts, calling me saying he would do whatever he could to get  Bostonian's first responders down to Texas to help out. And that is  what happened, as has already been mentioned by all of my colleagues  tonight: both sides of Members of Congress working on this issue to  help in Harvey. Beto O'Rourke is from El Paso. You are from Beaumont.   People may not realize that there is a sign in Beaumont. I used to  represent Beaumont, as you know. As you are driving in from Louisiana,  there is a sign that says: El Paso, Texas, 876 miles away.   That is how far it is from Beaumont to El Paso, and yet Beto O'Rourke  made his way all the way to the Houston-Galveston area to help out as  well. The whole State helped with what was taking place.   The magnitude of the devastation--not just the weather, but the  devastation--if you take the State of New Jersey and turn it on its  side and set it down on the Gulf Coast, that is how much devastation  there was in the State of Texas. That was the area that was hit where  disaster occurred. They got rain as far as Dallas and San Antonio, and,  of course, we know that it went all the way up to Kentucky a thousand  miles away. Still, they were getting rain days later.   I want to talk about one of the people involved in the rescue. Dr.  Babin talked about a lot of folks who helped out. Here is another guy  who helped out. You have probably never heard of him: Steven Perez,  Houston police officer, 34-year veteran of the Houston Police  Department, married, two kids. The rains are coming down. It is in the  middle of the night. It is his time to go on shift at the Houston  Police Department. His wife is saying: Don't go; it is too bad. And he  said: I am going to work. It is my duty.   And he did. He left home. He couldn't get to the downtown Houston  Police Department, so he is headed in a different direction, my  understanding is, up to Kingwood, where I represent--that is about 25  miles away from downtown Houston--where he was going to do what he  could to help folks out there. He took a bad turn, got under an  underpass, and his patrol car was submerged and he drowned. He was out  doing what he wanted to do: to protect and serve.    He is a symbol of all the first responders, of all the badges that  they wear from all over the country who came down there to do their  duty, to help people in need. We regret his loss. We are with his  family and our prayers are with his family, his wife and his two kids,  for their future.   At his funeral, of course, in Houston that I had the opportunity to  attend, there were a lot of police officers from all over the country  showing their respects to another first responder.   With this hurricane that came through the Houston area, I have kind  of an unusual district, so I got hit several places. People got  flooded.   Michael McCall showed, earlier, a map of the Houston area, that there  are two reservoirs that are supposed to protect the city from flooding.  Water filled up those reservoirs, and people whom I represent are on  the downstream of that reservoir. They got flooded when water came over  it.                                time  1730    But I also represent people upstream, and they got flooded because  the reservoir overflowed up in the northwestern direction. People also  got flooded in the middle of the night after they thought the storm was  over with because Conroe--and, Mr. Speaker, I know you don't know where  that is, but it is just northwest of Houston. They have a lake up in  Conroe. They started letting water out of Lake Conroe because it was  too full. Water came rushing down the San Jacinto River into Humble,  Texas, and Kingwood, Cypress Creek. All that overflowed, and people got  flooded in all of that area as well--thousands of people. Their homes  are devastated. In fact, two of those people who have lost their home,  they are still staying with us, friends of ours. We do take care of  each other.   One thing that I want to mention is we need to get a regional plan to  prevent these disasters in the future. It would be a whole lot cheaper,  in fact, to prevent these floods than try to continue to pay for the  damage of these floods. No question about it, we have to do recovery  now for those people who have lost everything they have, do what we can  here in Congress, and we are going to do that in a bipartisan way. But  we need to have a plan for the future as well.   I have introduced legislation for the Corps of Engineers to come up  with, in 90 days of our legislation being signed by the President, to  evaluate all the conditions in the flood plain area that was flooded  and come up with a long-term plan, whether it is building one more  reservoir, two more reservoirs, making the ones that we have bigger,  desilting the channel to Buffalo Bayou, San Jacinto River, whatever it  is. We need to come as a united area from Mr. Weber's district all the  way up to Mr. McCaul's district and everybody in between on what we are  going to do to solve the long-term flooding problem.   Because, you see, September comes around every September. Mr. McCaul  talked about the flood of 1900. That happened in September, almost to  the same day. Here this flood happened at the end of August, near the  beginning of September.   I hope we can do that. I think that we can, and I do want to  reiterate what has been said about people who just helped each other.  They didn't know each other. It wasn't just neighbors helping  neighbors. It was people who didn't know each other. Some of them who  were flooded out themselves were doing everything they could to help  other people.   There were a lot of bass boats. They weren't all from Louisiana.  There were a lot from Louisiana, but I think it is every young boy's  dream in Texas to own two things: a pickup truck and a bass boat. You  saw all of those pickup trucks and bass boats on the road and in the  water--because a lot of them are pretty high--rescuing people. People  they did not know, Mr. Speaker. They were just looking to help other  individuals. It is remarkable.   I have been through a lot of hurricanes. I grew up in the Houston  area. I remember Hurricane Carla in 1961, before most of you all were  even around. We have had a lot of hurricanes since then. Nothing like  Harvey. It was the granddaddy of all of them. It hammered the Houston  area, but we are using this as an opportunity to fix things because  this Hurricane is not going to defeat the spirit of Texans. It is not.  We will resolve to overcome whatever the difficulties are now and to  fix things in the future so that we can have a response when the rains  of September come.   The rains have stopped, the flood waters have gone down, the rainbow  is out, the kids are playing in the parks again, but we are still at  work solving the problem of what took place and moving on because, as I  said, Harvey will not defeat the Texas spirit. And that is just the way  it is.
