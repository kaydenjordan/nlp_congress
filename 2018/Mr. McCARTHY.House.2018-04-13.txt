 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for  morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be  postponed until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  today.   Next Tuesday, April 17, is also Tax Day. While this is a day  Americans usually dread, I am pleased that this will be the last year  they will have to file under the old and burdensome Tax Code. Because  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, not only will filing be simpler,  Americans will keep more of their hard-earned money, on top of the  bonuses and increased wages we have already seen.   In addition, the House will vote on several important bills aimed at  safeguarding all taxpayers next week.   First, there is H.R. 5192, the Protecting Children From Identity  Theft Act, sponsored by Representative Carlos Curbelo. Studies have  shown the rate of ID theft is actually 50 times higher among children  than adults. This bipartisan bill would modernize fraud detection  systems to prevent such theft from occurring in the first place.   Second, H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act, sponsored by  Representative Lynn Jenkins, which would improve the independent  appeals process at the IRS, along with other crucial taxpayer services  within the agency.   Lastly, H.R. 5445, the 21st Century IRS Act, sponsored by  Representative  Mike Bishop. This bill would boost cybersecurity and  other IT systems in the IRS to ensure the agency serves all taxpayers  effectively and efficiently.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the House passing all these critical  bills without delay.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, my friend is correct that in this House we worked to  pass all 12 appropriation bills. We sent them to the Senate, and the  Senate did not act. So as the process works, we had to come to an  agreement.   My friend on the other side said he worked very hard on that, but at  the end of the day, I tell my friend: You voted against it.   A rescission, as my friend knows, is not about an omnibus bill. It is  about finding savings for the American people. To quote Ronald Reagan:  ``The problem is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is  that the government spends too much.''   On this side of the aisle, we know that unaccountable and unnecessary  spending not only puts our fiscal future on shaky ground, but it also  puts burdens on the programs that Americans actually rely on. That is  why we passed all 12 appropriation bills. Unfortunately, the Senate  Democrats blocked even debate on every single one of these bills. So  they wouldn't even debate it, and they put us into this late process.   Now, as far as rescissions, I believe the Trump administration is  committed to sending Congress a rescission proposal.   As my friend knows, the 1974 Budget Act would give this proposal  fast-track procedures both in the House and, more importantly, in the  Senate, which means, to the American public, it takes 51 votes to pass.  So no longer can a minority hold up debate or hold up process to harm  the American public.   While this has not been done in 20 years, President Trump is not  afraid of challenging the status quo, and I personally respect that.  But I want to look at history, and I want the American public to  understand it.   Rescissions were once commonly used by five different  administrations, both Republican and Democratic, and at times the  Republican Presidents had Democratic majorities in Congress. Let me  give you a for-instance: President Bill Clinton proposed 166  rescissions. Congress passed 111 of those.   George H.W. Bush, when Democrats controlled both, proposed 169. They  passed 34 of those.   Ronald Reagan proposed 602, and they accepted 214 times to be able to  cut spending.   Now, Jimmy Carter proposed 122, and Congress accepted 50.   President Gerald Ford proposed 152, and Congress accepted 52.   As far as what this proposal looks like, it remains a work in  progress. Now, I will continue to work with the administration, but the  one thing I want to be very clear about is this is not about an  omnibus. This is about saving money.   So what a rescission package can do is it can go back into other  accounts that have just sat there with money in them with no action. No  business would run their business that way. No family would want it run  that way, to keep some debt while you have money sitting over here.   If you can save, I would believe everybody in this body would want to  save the taxpayers some money if there is an opportunity to do this.  And if I checked my record correctly, I believe my friend has voted for  a few rescissions in the past.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   If I first may answer the other questions the gentleman raised.   First of all, when he talks about trust, everybody should know what  happens when you get to an omni and why. We had an omni not because of  this House. We had an omni not because of this majority. We passed all  12 appropriation bills. The last time that was done by a Republican  majority, the iPhone wasn't invented.   We sent it to the Senate, and do you know the sad part? The last time  when we sent it to the Senate, maybe they debated the bills and the  bills failed--no. And it wasn't the majority on the other side in the  Senate. It was my friend's party on the other side that wouldn't even  allow it to come to debate.   Now my friend talks about being very concerned because they spent a  lot of time negotiating. You see, I don't really care for omnis. I  would never want to see another one on the floor. That is why we did  our job.   But when it comes to an omni, the minority has power. They could say:  No. This can't be in it.   And they kind of finally came to an agreement. And when they did, my  friend on the other side said: I am worried about trust, so I am voting  against it after all these negotiations.    And then he brings up: Oh, my God. The Republicans. They spent money  on the military.   Sequester has cut more than 20 percent from the military. You can  look back just the last 2 weeks. How many of our men and women died not  in combat, but in training? How many planes of ours can actually fly  today?   I will tell you this: The world is not 20 percent safer while the  military has been cut.   As we speak today, our Navy is sailing. As we speak today, we are  concerned about what is going to happen with Iran. We are concerned:  What is North Korea going to do? And where is Putin on the march?   So, yes, I am proud of funding the military. That is why we did it.   Did you want to put the other? No. We are held hostage because the  minority in the other Chamber decided to hold the country hostage.   Now, when it comes to rescissions, let's be truthful with the  American public. That could be unobligated funds from prior years. So  if there is money, just because it was budgeted and appropriated but  they didn't need it all, why don't you save the taxpayers and bring  that back to the Treasury?    Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the gentleman's support,  because we didn't have it last time.   Mr. Speaker, in these rescissions, we can look at these unnecessary  programs. That is healthy for the country. The world changes. We should  modernize. We should make government more efficient and more effective  and, most importantly, more accountable.   Now, my friend needs to be familiar with this process, because when I  look at history, both in 1996 and 1998, the omnibus bills included  numerous rescissions that President Clinton proposed and Congress  accepted.   Now, that was back when you voted for the spending bills, but I am  hopeful you will be for this rescission as well, because I believe the  American public will look at it not as a Republican or a Democrat.   Every time I watch people run for office, they say: I want to go line  by line. For 20 years, we didn't have people that wanted to do that in  the administration. Today, we do, And I applaud President Trump for  saying it, and I applaud President Trump for doing it.                                time  1115    Now, you talked about a few other things. You are concerned about  debt. I am concerned about debt. You think there are two different ways  to solve this. I believe if we grow the economy and we watch our  budget, we can solve this problem. When I look at the revenue coming  in, it is hitting its highest level.   When I walk across this country, I now see growth of more than 3  percent. I see unemployment at almost the lowest point in my lifetime.  And if you happen to be African American, or you happen to be Hispanic,  it is the lowest it has been in America. I just saw 800,000 people come  back into the workforce.   If you look at manufacturing jobs, in the last 3 months, we haven't  seen that type of growth since 1984. If I look at the last  administration and I go and look for the highest growth year under  President Obama, it is still lower than the worst year under Bill  Clinton.   So let's grow and get this deficit taken care of. But what is  interesting to me--I wrote this down because I want to get it right,  and you correct me if you think it is wrong--you said: Whatever we  spend, we should pay for it. Is that correct?   So this concerns me then. That Democrat budget that you voted for not  only increased the deficit by $6.8 trillion over 10 years, it calls for  the $3.9 trillion in revenue enhancements. We know what that means.  That means tax increases. So you want to increase taxes by $3.9  trillion, but you want to increase the debt by $6.8 trillion. That  doesn't meet what you just said. You said whatever we spend we should  pay for.   So you are going to increase the debt almost double, and you are  going to increase taxes. That is the difference between us. When we put  the tax bill on the floor, and I look at just in one company, 1.2  million of those employees, they got extended maternity leave; the  number of companies that raised what they pay; the electrical bills for  Americans in 39 States are now lower because of that tax bill. And  let's not even talk about the millions of bonuses that Americans got.  That is their own money. And the revenues are coming in higher.   The growth is bigger. Our opportunity is greater. But what you want  to do is snatch that back--say, no, no, government needs it. But you  are not saying government needs it to pay off the deficit because you  are raising the deficit even higher. It just doesn't work.   So what I am hopeful for, when we come back to this table--and I do  believe in trust--but if you are at the table and you make an  agreement, come to the floor and be honest. Come to the floor and  uphold that agreement that you talked through. Because I will tell you,  I didn't like that bill. Because we voted on all 12 bills here. I voted  for all of those. I voted for those and sent them to the Senate, and  the Senate held this country hostage.   And do you know what? The military, the number of men and women,  there is a greater number who are dying in training than in any combat  we have today. That is a direct correlation to the funding they have.  And we know where the world is today. We have an obligation to make  sure our men and women can carry out their duty and be safe. But today,  the question is: Can they carry out their training and be safe? We made  a downpayment to make sure that is the case.   And so I will say to my friend, I am concerned about the debt as much  as you and even more. That is why I voted to grow this economy and get  more money in. I voted on this floor to actually curve what is causing  the greatest growth, to guarantee it for next generations so it is  there. Because if you let it get out of control, it will not be there.   But what is more important, at the end of the day, is that we can  look back on any unobligated funds. It may be 5--it could be 6, 7, 8  years ago, and that money is just sitting there, and that program is  doing nothing. If you are concerned about the debt, you want to take it  back and let's pay it down. I look forward to working with you.    I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I apologize,  you did ask me that the last time. I got caught up, and I forgot the  other stuff. The President has sent a budget. The Budget Committee is  reviewing it. I think you will see one coming after they review it.   But the one thing I do want to bring up, let's not repeat the same  things we have gone through. We are living under the Budget Act of  1974. I think the world has changed since then. Why don't we modernize  the Budget Act? We put that in that last bill. The bipartisan working  group, I would say that should be our top priority. Let's not repeat  the same mistakes, and let's not constrain ourselves if we really want  to tackle this deficit.   I am hopeful you will work with us on that. But you said a few things  that are interesting. You support the military, and I don't doubt that.  But you voted against the military funding that was on the floor. When  you talked about that omnibus that you wanted a lot of trust because  everybody worked so closely together on and you are really afraid about  the rescissions coming back that can take money back that wasn't even  in the omnibus--a trust that that could break that you voted against-- you said, but, of course, the Republicans wanted the military. And you  said, we increased it by 10 or so, even though it has been cut by more  than 20. You said, but, of course, we wanted to fund other things. I  thought you said education.    You said opioids.    So if you care about the military, you care about  education, you care about opioids, and you are concerned about breaking  a trust because you negotiated this, why did you vote ``no?'' Why did  you vote against the things you just said you cared about? Then you  said you cared a lot about the deficit. But on this floor, we had a  balanced budget agreement--you actually said you supported it--but that  is not how you voted. You voted ``no.'' So when you had an  opportunity----    The answer is no, I'm not saying that, and you know I  am not. Let me be very clear. They fought for the military funding; and  when we got in the room to make the agreement, we held up our word. So  let me follow through with a few more, because you make me concerned.    May I ask the gentleman if I may finish my answer  before the gentleman reclaims his time.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is very healthy that we have  these debates. I think the American public should see it because I  believe, Mr. Speaker, when somebody says they support something, the  best way to prove it is you vote for it.   As I stated earlier, the gentleman said he supports the military. I  don't doubt that. But when the military funding bill came to the floor,  after it has been cut by more than 20 percent and after more people  have died in training than in combat, we had the opportunity to do it.   The gentleman also said in that bill there was good stuff like  opioids and education. But he said ``no'' to that. I have heard the  gentleman on this floor, Mr. Speaker, I have heard my friend talk about  CHIP and the importance of that. I know it is important to the  gentleman, but he voted against it.   I heard, Mr. Speaker, my friend bring up, because one of our  colleagues here, Mark Meadows, talked about he would rather have a  different BBA, but when he had the opportunity, he voted for that  because he does believe in a balanced budget.   Mr. Speaker, I went to Puerto Rico with my friend. But when that  funding came on the floor, I don't doubt that what he wants to do, we  have written editorials together. He voted ``no.'' He told me time and  time again that shutting down the government is the worst thing and  that he would never do that. But when the time came, Mr. Speaker, he  shut the government down this year.   So there is a difference between words and actions.    The one thing I would say, Mr. Speaker, my friend also  told me he would let me answer this question without reclaiming his  time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate individuals and their words.  I just want to make sure people are held accountable for their actions.  Yes, there was an omnibus on the floor, not anything on this side of  the aisle wanted.   We passed all 12. We did our job. We did our job just like we  promised. Unfortunately, the Senate--and it wasn't the majority over in  the Senate, it was the minority--wanted to hold it hostage the same way  they did when they wanted to shut down the government.   I think the American public deserves more and deserves better. That  is why I think we need to reform the 1974 Budget Act, and I think this  floor will see a great debate. I think both sides of the aisle would  like to see it reformed. I just hope that the American public will not  only hear the words but see the action in the votes to back up what  people say.    We have.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to my friend to give his explanation  of why he voted ``no'' on the omni the people negotiated for, and I  don't doubt that that is the reason why. He said he was concerned about  DACA. The only thing, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about, that was the  same excuse he gave me of why he voted to shut the government down when  he said he would never do that either.   But, Mr. Speaker, when I read his Twitter account----    Once I finish this, I will give my friend the date.   Tuesday, on the gentleman's Twitter account--I like how my friend  uses it more often, maybe the President inspired him--@WhipHoyer,  Dreamers can still apply to renew DACA protections. Learn more about  the requirement for applying for renewal.   I don't know which one is right. If on his Twitter account he says  that it is okay because no DACA students or kids are being removed, he  says in his Twitter account you can apply right now. But I am going to  vote against the omni that we negotiated with because I am really  worried about the rescissions that go against maybe some money that has  been wasted.                                time  1145    But when I look at this, Mr. Speaker, I know for a fact the President  made another offer to not only solve DACA, but to solve Dreamers. All  he requested was could we have the border secure. He wasn't asking for  an astronomical number.   When you think back, many times, Mr. Speaker, I get an argument from  the other side about the Gang of Eight bill. They spent twice as much  on border security than the President is asking for.   I know for a fact the President talked to the leader on the other  side, of his party. I know for a fact they came back and said no. I  know the President actually put it out on his Twitter account. The  President wants to solve this problem, but he wants to make sure the  border is secure.   Mr. Speaker, as we speak right now, there are people who are marching  from other countries because they think they can just march directly  across our border.   I think our border needs to be secure. I would hope everybody would  feel that same way. I know the President wants to solve this problem.  He offered. As a fact, Mr. Speaker, the President said it from inside  these Chambers for the whole Nation to hear.   Sometimes I begin to wonder: Do words and action actually do the  exact same thing? Could it be possible, Mr. Speaker, that sometimes  people play politics with issues? Could it be possible that sometimes  people could use that for an excuse? Could it be possible that people  would say they want to solve a problem, but when they have the offer of  a solution, they say no so they can keep it to try to make a political  argument out of it?   I don't know. Maybe. But I will tell the American public this: We  want to solve that problem.   Now, Mr. Speaker, my friend on the other side of the aisle is worried  about the debt. I am, too. He voted for a budget that would increase it  by more than $6 trillion, but he wants to raise your taxes and take  more of your money by another $3 trillion. It still increases it much  more than what he takes in taxes.   He said he heard those arguments all before that the Republicans,  they won't do well if they let people keep more of their own money.  Well, I just looked at the latest numbers. In the first 3 months with  the new tax bill, do you know what? More revenue came in. Millions of  people got to keep more of what they earned.   What is interesting is so many Americans got a pay raise simply  because government said you could do better with your own. That, I  think, is true. And if my friend, Mr. Speaker, agrees with that, I know  he will be there for the recision.   Where can we stand up for the taxpayer? If there is money wasted  here, why wouldn't we go line by line? It won't be just the omni. It  will be all those other accounts that have been sitting there. I don't  think that is a Republican or Democratic idea. I truly believe that is  an American idea, and I think that is the responsibility that we all  have.   I know these colloquies go long. I like my friend across the aisle,  Mr. Speaker. I consider him a friend. But just as anybody has friends,  we have different philosophical opinions, and that is healthy. But at  the end of the day, we can't make excuses. At the end of the day, Mr.  Speaker, there is a bill on the floor.   And, yes, I want it 100 percent my way, but, unfortunately, that is  not the way our government is created. It is supposed to find  compromise. I can always find an excuse: Do you know what? Someone  didn't look right at me, or someone said something I disagreed with.   But as we know today, no DACA child is getting deported. As we know  today, the President wants to solve this. As we know today, the  President  [[Page H3229]]  has made many offers. So, I think, Mr. Speaker, there is no more time  for excuses. It is time for solving.    Will the gentleman yield?    He knows that is not true. You just said I want to stop  unification of moms and dads? You know that is not true, and you know I  made an offer to actually speed that up.    Yes, I am saying that is not true. Let me explain what  it is.    So, when someone comes here, they can petition others.  They can petition their parents. They can petition their children. They  can petition their spouse.    They can petition their brother and sister, and then  they can petition their married children.     Right as of today, currently, you are only allowing  65,000 for brothers and sisters. That is not a mother, and that is not  a child.   Right now, today, there is more than a 30-year wait. So what we  proposed is that system is not working. So a brother and sister has  their own family. So instead of taking those up, why don't you put  those into the spouse and the children?   So what we offered to you--and maybe they didn't quite understand  it--you would speed up the process for parents, your spouses, and your  children. I always thought that was very reasonable.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman asked me a question earlier. I want to  make sure I answer it.   I made a claim that the gentleman voted to shut the government down.  My claim is based upon three times:   January 22, the continuing resolution to keep the government open,  you voted ``no'';   On February 6, the continuing resolution, you voted ``no'';   Then, when government was shut down, there was a bill to reopen the  government on February 9, and you again voted ``no.''  [[Page H3230]]         Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, April 16, 2018,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
