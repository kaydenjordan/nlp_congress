 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  share the gentleman's strong passion for making sure that America has  the very best deterrent on the face of the Earth in view of what we are  facing not only in the Middle East, but obviously, as you stated, in  Ukraine and with what is happening on the high seas around the globe.  We are so proud of our nuclear Navy.   I rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment because of my dear  friendship with Congressman Garamendi, and I respect his efforts to try  to have a responsible nuclear deterrent and weapons program.   I understand that. This amendment itself would prohibit funding, as  has been stated, for the plutonium pit production at the Savannah River  processing facility.   We all know that plutonium modernization is a key aspect to meeting  our nuclear weapons stockpile requirements and maintaining the Nation's  nuclear deterrent.  [[Page H5112]]    On both sides of the aisle of our subcommittee, we have had complete  support, really, in ensuring that our country maintains a safe, secure,  and credible nuclear deterrent while also addressing the threat of  nuclear nonproliferation and terrorism.   However, on our side of the aisle, at least, we continue to be  troubled by the unsustainable spending in the Department of Energy's  weapons program.   I have to say that the concerns about the budget deficit and so forth  attend to every agency, including this one.   There have been cost overruns at a level that are historic, and I  think we have to have rigor in terms of managing whatever funds are  allocated to that important task.   I wholeheartedly agree with Chair Fleischmann that the National  Nuclear Security Administration needs to improve its program  management--I hope they are hearing us--given that more than half of  its projects are over cost or behind schedule. That is not really a  good record for something so important.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. We, as a  committee and as a Congress, have to face the realities of future  defense caps and begin making important decisions to prioritize within  those programs. Only through strategic prioritization can the program  achieve success in meeting the needs of stockpile requirements and  maintaining our Nation's critical nuclear deterrent.   Nonetheless, prohibiting all funds to one strategic investment of  plutonium modernization at the Savannah River Plutonium Processing  Facility is not the right approach at this time.   Mr. Chair, I thank all of my colleagues. In working together, we will  find the right path for America. I urge my colleagues to vote against  this amendment, and I thank Congressman Garamendi for making sure we  spend our dollars wisely.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I invite the gentlewoman to come into any  pulmonary ward in this country and see the cancers that attend to  people who have suffered from carbon ingestion in their careers.   This amendment prohibits funds to implement the Industrial  Decarbonization Roadmap published by the Department of Energy in  September 2022.   The purpose of the roadmap is to develop a strategic approach to  decarbonizing the Nation's industrial sector--I come from industrial  America--while simultaneously creating good-paying jobs for American  workers, spurring economic growth, developing U.S. leadership in these  new technologies, and creating a cleaner, more equitable, and healthier  workplace for all Americans.   The industrial sector represents 30 percent of energy-related carbon  dioxide emissions in the United States. To address the climate crisis,  we must address these emissions. We have a lot more people living in  this country now. When I was born, there were 146 million. Today, we  have about 335. It is going to go up to 400 million people. We have to  think about our way of life and how we meet the demands of a new era.   In addressing these emissions, we will also dramatically improve air  quality and reduce millions of early deaths in our country and around  the world.   The roadmap focused on proven steps for energy technology innovation:  advancing early-stage research and development, investing in multiple  process strategies, and scaling through demonstrations and integrating  solutions, including on the factory floor and places where equipment is  repaired.   America has always been about the future. A successful industrial  decarbonization strategy is critical to supporting the existing 11.4  million workers in American manufacturing and growing a future  workforce in the clean industry transition.   There is a lot of training that has to be done there. How is it that  our firefighters across this country, just in the last few years, have  discovered the cancers that attend to working in that extremely  dangerous and important patriotic service to the people of our country?  Their equipment is important, and what happens to their lungs and their  bodies is really important.   Again, I invite you to come with me into the hospitals of this  country and meet the families of workers who have died and the people  suffering because of carbon ingestion.   While it is clear we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy that  taps domestic oil and gas and invests in clean energy, we must continue  to promote energy innovation, a cleaner workplace in all sectors of the  economy, and in the American home as well.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, mining is a really difficult industry. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, as a daughter of automotive and truck America  and an aficionado of NASCAR and having spent a lot of my time on drag  strips across the country, including my own reasons, I really rise in  strong opposition to this amendment because it is not about the future.  It is about the past.   This amendment prohibits funds for the Department of Energy's  SuperTruck 3 program within the Office of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy. It is hard to make an engine. It is hard to conceive  it. It is hard to build it. It takes a lot of creativity to understand  propulsion. The parts of the country that I represent specialize in  that.   The Department of Energy initially launched the SuperTruck initiative  in 2009 to improve heavy-duty truck freight efficiency by 50 percent.  That is a gulp.   The second iteration, SuperTruck 2, sought to double fuel efficiency  for 18-wheeler trucks.   SuperTruck 3 is currently working to improve medium-and heavy-duty  truck efficiencies and reduce emissions of freight transportation, that  is underway.   This program consists of a public-private partnership with General  Motors, Ford Motor Company, Daimler Truck North America, Volvo Group  North America, and PACCAR.   Now, I want America to succeed. I want the free world to succeed.  This program is building on a proven track record. Within 7 years, four  truck makers exceeded the SuperTruck 1 goals and the five SuperTruck 2  projects are on track to more than double their fuel efficiency.   I invite the gentlewoman to come with me through some of these  companies and some of these research sites to see what it takes to make  America more fuel efficient.   These efforts help create good-paying jobs here at home and boost  American supply chains, not in China, not in Japan, not anywhere else  in the world, but right here.   Oil prices are on the rise again. Our transportation sector is  currently largely dependent on petroleum and thus subject to oil price  volatility and what will become diminished supplies in the decades  ahead. I don't want America to be stuck on the whims of dictators  throughout the world. It is common sense we should be developing energy  alternatives and promoting energy proficiency and advancement in our  transportation sector.   While it is clear that we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy  that taps domestic oil and gas, we must also invest in alternative  energy options to diversify our energy portfolio, including hydrogen,  hydrogen fuel cells. Where the market is moving, the companies are  moving. We need to help to propel that advancement sooner rather than  later.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Fleischmann), the chair of the Energy and Water Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, first, I oppose the amendment because the  Department of Energy is charged with implementing congressionally  directed energy efficiency standards. They are implementing the laws we  passed.   The Department of Energy drafts energy efficiency regulations with  the full participation of the manufacturers and the public at large,  and they do issue their guidelines and regulations for review.   The end result is people save money. They save money on water  heaters. They save money on what it costs to wash clothes at home and  on refrigerators.   When these standards are set forth, they also promote innovation. You  get a lot of new inventions across the country, and we can see the  results of that every day. The benefits are real.   As a result of the Department of Energy's efficiency actions in the  past, cost savings for American families and businesses are projected  to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. It not only makes sense for the  consumer. Frankly, it makes sense for the country because it means that  the systems to supply the energy are also more efficient. It drives us  to be better at what we do.   It is estimated per household the energy efficiencies achieved  already have amounted to over $6,000 of savings for every American  every month when you pay every one of those bills: your gas bills, your  electric bills, everything else you have to pay for in your house.   The Department of Energy estimates that this specific rule would  slash household utility costs by over $11 billion annually to save  consumers $198 billion on their energy bills over 30 years when we look  at the whole. With the population growing, we have to do a better job  of trying to save resources in order to make sure that everyone has the  ability to access them.   Stopping the Department of Energy from finalizing, implementing, or  enforcing energy efficiency standards basically is bicycling backward  and will only create uncertainty for manufacturers and consumers.   For consumers, costs go up when we don't pay attention. With respect  to the proposed energy efficiency standards for consumer water heaters,  I urge my colleagues with concerns to participate fully in the  rulemaking process, as I have done with respect to my concerns about  the proposed energy efficiency standards for distribution transformers.  That is appropriate. It is a response people can take to the proposed  rule and companies can take.   Congress has vested the Department of Energy with the authority to  promulgate these rules. Let us fully participate in the process. Let's  make  [[Page H5118]]  America better. Let's modernize America.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I have long been a champion of ensuring that  the United States maintains a safe, secure, and credible nuclear  deterrent while addressing the threat of nuclear proliferation and  terrorism.   I wholeheartedly agree with Chair Fleischmann that the National  Nuclear Security Administration needs to improve its program and  project management given that more than half of its projects are over  cost or behind schedule.   We must also face the realities of future defense caps and begin  making important decisions to prioritize within this program.   As one step in the prioritization process, the National Nuclear  Security Administration proposed pausing, not phasing out, construction  of this facility to focus resources on high-priority items necessary  for nuclear weapon modernization efforts.   Only through strategic prioritization can the program achieve success  in meeting the needs of stockpile requirements and maintaining the  nation's nuclear deterrent.   We should not prohibit the NNSA from pausing certain activities,  especially since those issues will be resolved through conferencing  funding levels.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment the gentlewoman has offered  raises serious constitutional issues and may amount to an  unconstitutional bill of attainder.   This is not the way to handle policy disputes, with Michael Conner,  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for civil works.   This amendment prioritizes, I am sad to say, legislative theater over  the American people, and it has no chance of becoming law.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  harmful amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Fleischmann), the chair of the Energy and Water Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would prohibit funds for the  Corps of Engineers to implement or enforce guidance from the 1996 memo  called Approval of Perpetual Beach Storm Damage Reduction Easement As a  Standard Estate. That is engineering language. While this may sound  like a lot of jargon, it is actually an attempt to have one area of  Florida treated differently than other areas.   Beach renourishment is an important function of the Corps of  Engineers and includes the adding of sediment onto or directly adjacent  to an eroding beach, something that our country on many coasts now is  experiencing. The Corps of Engineers generally requires that real  estate easements are granted when performing work, which makes sense,  because the taxpayers are footing the bill for the improvement.   Further, it seems particularly of interest to taxpayers that, if our  taxpayer dollars are improving private property, then there should be  an easement provided.   In this case, that wasn't required in the past, but the Corps of  Engineers realized it wasn't following standard procedures and decided  to implement that going forward.   This really comes down to one basic question: Do we want to treat one  area of the country differently than all the rest of the areas are  supposed to be treated? I believe we should strive for consistency in  implementing the laws and regulations of this country, especially when  it comes to projects funded with taxpayer dollars.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    This amendment prohibits funds provided by this act from  closing campgrounds or parks operated by the Army Corps of Engineers  and located at or around Lake Sidney Lanier, Georgia.   I can certainly understand the strong interest in preventing the  Corps from closing campgrounds and parks in a particular area. Frankly,  I wish my area had one, but we don't have Corps facilities like that.  The gentleman has been blessed.   The Corps of Engineers is one of the Nation's leading Federal  providers of outdoor recreation. Its recreation sites receive 262  million visits each year and include more than 400 lake and river  projects in 43 States. Unfortunately, the Corps of Engineers'  recreation funding has been declining in recent years.   I support the notion that we do not want the Corps to begin closing  recreation sites due to lack of funding. However, this is an issue that  affects hundreds of sites across dozens of States. I do not believe we  here today should begin the practice of using funding prohibitions to  carve out special designations, but instead should develop a  comprehensive solution, fair to all regions across our Nation, to  address the challenge of funding the Corps' recreation sites.   I would welcome the opportunity to work with the gentleman on that  and obviously the chair of the full committee.   For this reason, I oppose the amendment at this time, but look  forward to working with my colleagues to develop a solution to the  larger problem. Maybe we can even give a little attention to the Great  Lakes. Wouldn't that be great?   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, as I understand it, this amendment prohibits  the use of funds for the Department of Energy's Office of Scientific  Workforce Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.   This bill already includes harmful riders that show Republicans are  not interested in bills that can gain bipartisan support and become  law.   During our full committee markup--I remember it well--Republicans  added a provision that prohibits funds for any diversity, equity, and  inclusion office, program, or training. The underlying bill already  includes section 606 that prohibits funds related to advancing racial  equity and support for underserved communities and related to  diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the Federal  workforce.   In addition, section 605 of the underlying bill prohibits any  activities related to ``critical race theory'' that, as we heard during  the markups when I asked the question, none of my Republican colleagues  could even define. I don't see a definition in your presentation here  today.   How many times do the individuals on the other side of the aisle need  to emphasize that they do not like the words ``diversity, equity, and  inclusion?''   I know when we were educated, we were always taught about ``e  pluribus unum,'' out of many, one. That is what makes our Nation great,  that we aren't just one widget, that, in fact, our common experience is  our shared heritages, wherever they might be from. It makes us a more  interesting place, and it also connects us to the broader world beyond  our shores.   I really do not understand why these provisions are necessary on an  energy and water bill, and I hope that my colleagues would stop  targeting those who may be different from themselves--or they might  think they are--and embrace acceptance or at least tolerance of others.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would prohibit funds for the  Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases.   In my part of the country, we recognize what greenhouse gases are. We  have to contain methane at many landfills that have let that stuff  belch out into the atmosphere. The satellites that take photos of the  Earth from a distance can show us that when we weren't conscious of  greenhouse gases, we were breaking through the ozone layer, and we have  been able to heal that over time with concerted effort. Those who care  to know about greenhouse gases have plenty of evidence around us.   We know that the work of this particular group is crucial to making  sure the government accounts for the potential impacts of government  actions on the climate.   Now, I just left a group of farmers back in Ohio, and I can tell you  that their fields are being washed out because of added rainfall at a  level they have never seen before.   We have the saltwater creeping up the Mississippi River right now. I  was just talking to one of the Members on the other side of the aisle  yesterday concerned about Baton Rouge and what is happening with the  ocean and saltwater coming north. This has never happened before. This  is very unusual.   Whether it is gases in the air--I think of Canada this past summer.  In  [[Page H5135]]  my part of the country, we never had the kind of fog, I call it, that  came from those forest fires down into our region and even made it here  to Washington, D.C., and down to the panhandle. This is all new.   As I have said, it is undeniable that we are witnessing growing  weather events stemming from climate change occurring in real time,  even to the point where we can see it with our own eyes.   As of the end of August, there have been more than 23 disasters in  2023 alone costing at least $1 billion each. With the costs of trying  to pick up after these terrible events, whether we are talking about  Hawaii or other places in our country that have been hit hard, our  homeland security and disaster assistance accounts have tripled because  of what is going on.   We know that the events this year have exceeded the previous records  set in 2020, and we still have a few more months to go before this year  is done. We don't have the luxury to pretend that climate change isn't  impacting us--whatever name you call it--or that our actions aren't  somehow related to it.   Tell the American citizens who lost businesses or homes and loved  ones from hurricanes, wildfires, and other recent natural disasters,  and those who continue to face unrelenting flooding in the Midwest,  that there are no costs from climate change because there sure are.   It is already past time for aggressive action to address climate  change and its impacts.   The truth is that it is having catastrophic social and economic  impacts here in the United States and across the globe, and these are  real and unrelenting. Pretending that it doesn't exist simply won't  make it go away.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  harmful amendment and would enjoy talking to the gentleman at any time  about my part of the country and what we endure. From what I see in  your part of the country, you have issues there, as well.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, all I wish to say on this is there is an old  expression: Don't try to fool Mother Nature. I would say and advise,  don't ignore Mother Nature.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, here is another amendment that prohibits  something else. The gentleman's amendment would prohibit funding for  the American Climate Corps.   I have been a long-time supporter of the idea of engaging young  Americans in helping to build our country forward as the original  Civilian Conservation Corps did many, many years ago.   People who became a part of that saw a part of America that they had  never seen before. They made friends. They learned new skills. It gave  people a pride in our Nation that was incalculable.   The whole intent of the American Climate Corps is to engage young  Americans in helping our Nation build forward, whether they would be  weatherizing homes, planting trees, installing solar infrastructure,  mitigating coastal erosion, permitting fires and flooding--the  gentleman talked about some of the needs of our national forests-- constructing and maintaining public trails, and so much more.   From the western Great Plains to the coast and Great Lakes, we are  witnessing the wreckage brought about by changing climate with a  ferocity that knows no bounds.   Our success in tackling this challenge will require bold and  innovative strategies and connecting to the younger generation.   Last month when the President announced the American Climate Corps,  he talked about training young people in high-demand skills for jobs in  the clean energy economy, as well.   This program will give a new generation of Americans the skills that  our grandparents had, which are necessary to access good-paying jobs  that are aligned with high-quality employment opportunities after they  complete their paid training and service. It is really a program for  America and for the next generation, and I would welcome that.   It used to be that most persons had someone in their family who  joined the U.S. military. Today, less than 1 percent of America's  families are connected to the U.S. military.   We have to find other means to engage our younger people in patriotic  service, and this is one of those. I believe we must continue to invest  in America's next generation, our future workforce, and this is such a  positive way to do it.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.    Madam Chair, this amendment raises serious constitutional  issues and may amount to an unconstitutional bill of attainder. This is  not the way to handle policy disputes with the Secretary of Energy for  our country.   This amendment prioritizes legislative theater over the American  people and doesn't have a chance of becoming law.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would say in reaction to what I just heard  on the floor here, there must be two Jennifer Granholms because the one  I know is simply exceptional.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Fleischmann), the chair of the Energy and Water Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, his amendment would prohibit any funds to  enforce COVID-19 mask mandates.   I must say, America used to focus on big issues. I remember as a  child we tried to figure out how to eradicate polio coast-to-coast, and  you know what, we did it.   America was inspired by a great a President, John Kennedy, to land a  man on the moon, and we did. America did it. We worked together to  defeat Soviet communism, and guess what, we did it. We have remnants of  that tyrannical regime still seated, and history will show whether we  meet the challenge or not. But most of America wants to defeat Vladimir  Putin's unconscionable invasion, unprovoked to the adjoining nation of  Ukraine.   This amendment is one more controversial poison pill policy rider  dealing with face masks. You know what, I didn't really come to  Congress to worry about the face masks. I find the majority's odd  interest in this peculiar.   Preventing diseases reduces healthcare costs, such as  hospitalizations, pharmaceuticals, and benefits employers by resulting  in less employee absenteeism. I find it very odd--here we are moving  into Halloween and people are spending millions of dollars on masks to  go all around the country and parade around in neighborhoods in masks.   Yet, when we talk about facial masks to fight the COVID-19 virus,  which is a wicked one, it has been politicized to a level that it is  almost a theater of the absurd.   From January 3, 2020, to September 27, 2023, there were how many  deaths in our country from COVID?   Madam Chair, there were 1,127,152 deaths from COVID-19 in our country  alone. That is 1,127,152 deaths. Some of the people who died we knew  and loved, and some were people serving in this room.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  harmful amendment and to focus on great quests, not ridiculousness.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the Department of Energy is charged with  implementing congressionally directed energy efficiency standards. So  the Department is fulfilling the obligations in law. Now, if  individuals want to comment on that there is a way to do that, to fully  participate in the rulemaking process, and I urge our colleagues to do  that.   Again, the gentleman's interests seem to be rather narrow, and to  create false fears--whether it is masks or whether it is trying to get  better equipment--more energy efficient equipment in the country to  help everyone, businesses that use ice making machines, and homeowners  who have ice making in their home.   This specific rule would save Americans over $44 million in annual  operating costs. That is pretty good. We make American industry more  efficient and we make it cheaper. They save money.   We are trying to act in the interest of the American people. There is  a quote in this Chamber, ``Let us develop the resources of our land,  call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great  interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not  perform something worthy to be remembered.'' That is what we should  aspire to.   In saving the American people money in helping them to promote their  companies to save money to make America better, I think that we are on  the right path. I think the gentleman's amendment is misdirected, and I  oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Department of Energy is charged with  implementing congressionally directed energy efficiency standards, and  I think it is safe to assume that virtually all Americans, let alone  all the people in this room, have benefited from these types of  efficiency standards over the course of their lifetimes.   Today, the typical new room air-conditioner uses 39 percent less  energy than its 1990 counterpart. In that 33-year time span, the  Department of Energy raised the efficiency standard for room air- conditioners three times, and real results happened.   The Department of Energy estimates that these new standards will save  American families and consumers approximately--are you ready?--$1.5  billion per year on their electricity bills.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment raises serious constitutional  issues and may amount to an unconstitutional bill of attainder.   This is not the way to handle policy disputes with Mr. Rodrigues, the  Assistant Secretary for Electricity at the Department of Energy's  Office of Electricity. He has very impressive credentials, with over  two decades of work in industry in California and Arizona, parts of our  country that understand the new pressures on producing power. Look at  the forest fires that have occurred out there and the stresses on the  environment that cause millions of people not to have electricity. He  has actually lived in places in our country that have experienced it  first.   He has impressive degrees in law and obviously in business, so I  don't think they are being fair to this gentleman, and this is  certainly not the way to handle this.   This amendment prioritizes legislative theater over the American  people. It has no chance of becoming law.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, as well.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, first of all, the gentleman's amendment raises  serious constitutional issues, and like others this afternoon, may  amount to an unconstitutional bill of attainder. This is really not the  way to handle policy disputes with Andrew Light, Assistant Secretary of  Energy for International Affairs.   First of all, I think I have to say: Energy security for our country  understands the global environment in which we exist and function, and  that is both the commercial marketplace as well as on the defense  ledger.   This is a very, very important job. This gentleman has very broad  experience prior to coming to his current position, even in the area of  atmospheric sciences, trying to understand some of the science as well  as the security issues involved in America remaining energy independent  in perpetuity here at home.   The amendment prioritizes legislative theater again over the American  people. It doesn't have any chance of becoming law, and I strongly urge  my colleagues to vote against this harmful amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann),  Chair of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    When the gentleman began his remarks, he referred to the  Interior bill. This is the Energy bill. I wonder if the gentleman could  clarify that.    I think the Record will have to be corrected.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                  Amendment No. 59 Offered by Mr. Rosendale     Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, as of the end of August, there have been more  than 23 disasters in our country, just this year, costing at least a  billion dollars each--each. That exceeds the previous record set in  2020, and we have not even finished this year yet.   This morning, as I drove to work, I was listening to the  Representative from Hawaii talk about the recovery in Maui and ongoing  efforts there and the struggle and the positive attitude of the people  to try to rebuild. Don't try to tell American citizens who have lost  businesses or homes and loved ones from hurricanes, wildfires, other  natural disasters and who continue to face unrelenting flooding in the  middle part of the country that there are no costs from climate change.   Talk to any insurance company, property insurance company. Disaster  costs have risen substantially across this country, and they are  growing. In fact, they have tripled. The Federal Disaster Assistance  Office, just the Federal side, it is billions and billions and billions  more dollars.   It is already past time for aggressive action to address climate  change and its impacts, and pretending that it doesn't exist won't make  it go away.   We must maintain American leadership for our clean energy future and  not cede all the economic opportunity, which Congresswoman Castor just  talked about when she was here on the floor, to China and other  countries who surely want to be right at our ankles and try to dump  product into this country.   We have to stand on our own two feet and be as great a Nation as we  really are and seize the horizon.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend  and congressional colleague who passed away late last month, Senator  Dianne Feinstein of California.   I was deeply saddened at the news of the passing of Dianne, whom I  worked with closely over many years on energy independence for our  Nation and to protect the waters of the United States, which are  amongst our Nation's most precious resources. Her acute mastery of the  energy and water needs of our Nation had no comparison.   Throughout her career, Dianne shattered glass ceilings, first on the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors, serving as the board's first female  president, then as the first woman to serve as mayor of San Francisco,  and, finally, as the first female Senator from the State of California.  [[Page H5157]]    She would go on to become the longest serving woman in the history of  the U.S. Senate and was a champion for LGBTQ rights and our  environmental needs throughout her career.   My thoughts and prayers are with her dear daughter, Katherine, and  all who knew and loved her, including her staff in the Senate. Rest in  peace, my dear friend.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an opinion piece celebrating her  life, which was published this past month.                  [From the Washington Post, Oct. 2, 2023]    Opinion--Our Nation Is in Dire Need of Leaders Like Dianne Feinstein                        (By Hillary Rodham Clinton)         One day, on the floor of the Senate in 1993, Idaho       Republican Larry Craig condescended to Dianne Feinstein, the       Democratic sponsor of a proposed ban on assault weapons.       ``The gentle lady from California needs to become a little       bit more familiar with firearms and their deadly       characteristics,'' he said. Craig, a board member of the       National Rifle Association, had picked the wrong target.        ``I am quite familiar with firearms,'' Dianne responded,       with fire in her eyes. ``I became mayor as a product of       assassination. I found my assassinated colleague and put a       finger through a bullet hole trying to get a pulse. I was       trained in the shooting of a firearm when I had terrorist       attacks, with a bomb in my house, when my husband was dying,       when I had windows shot out. Senator, I know something about       what firearms can do.''        Craig was left sputtering, and the Senate passed the       assault weapons ban thanks to Dianne's tireless advocacy. My       husband proudly signed the ban, and it helped keep millions       of Americans safer for a decade.        Feinstein, who passed away on Thursday evening, was a giant       of the Senate. She was brave, honorable, honest and unafraid       to do what was right for her constituents and her country. We       both came to Washington in 1993, I as first lady and Dianne       as a senator. When she used her first floor speech to support       the Family and Medical Leave Act, I knew I had found a       kindred spirit.        When I joined Dianne in the small sisterhood of Senate       women eight years later, I gained an appreciation for her       blend of principle and pragmatism. In an institution known       for show horses, she was a workhorse. Perhaps because she had       been a mayor, she believed in delivering results, not       rhetoric--and that's what she did.        Dianne was tough and sometimes formal, but she had a big       heart and enormous compassion. She was an early advocate for       LGBTQ rights and people suffering from HIV and AIDS. As a       trailblazer for women in politics, she opened space for those       of us who followed.        I learned a tremendous amount from Dianne. We strategized,       commiserated, laughed, drank California chardonnay and one       time even planned a covert operation: Dianne hosted a secret       meeting in the living room of her Northwest D.C. home, where       then-Sen. Barack Obama and I made peace after the grueling       2008 primary. We chose to meet there because we both trusted       Dianne. (She let us in, offered a glass of wine and left us       alone.)        For all of us who loved Dianne, her passing is a deep       personal loss. It is also a loss for our country when we are       in desperate need of leaders willing to show half the       backbone she displayed throughout her storied career.        Her calm determination in the wake of the 1978       assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city       Supervisor Harvey Milk by a fellow council member reassured a       shaken city. That tragedy didn't just make her mayor; it gave       her a mission. She took on the NRA and won. She became a       champion for the rule of law and democratic institutions and       refused to be intimidated by anyone.        As the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, she       exposed torture and other abuses committed by the CIA after       9/11, despite efforts to keep her silent. She was a strong       supporter of the intelligence community, but she believed       those abuses could not be covered up. ``History will judge us       by our commitment to a just society governed by law and the       willingness to face an ugly truth and say `never again,' ''       she said.        Those are words we should remember as we face the       challenges ahead. Dianne has left the national scene at       another moment of political violence and threats to the rule       of law. So, we must again face ugly truths and do what is       right.        The cries of an insurrectionist mob have barely faded from       the halls of the Capitol. Former president Donald Trump,       whose incendiary rhetoric has repeatedly incited violence,       recently said Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, the just-retired       chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had committed ``a       treasonous act'' for which ``in times gone by, the punishment       would have been DEATH!'' As President Biden noted, while most       Republicans may not agree, the silence is deafening.        Trump and his supporters have also suggested that if he       regains the presidency, he will seek to gut checks on       executive power, weaponize the Justice Department to pursue       political opponents, eviscerate the civil service and attempt       to put himself above the law. This is a man who has been       indicted on a charge of a conspiracy to overturn an election       and called for the ``termination of all rules, regulations,       and articles, even those found in the Constitution.''        We should believe him when he tells us what he'll do next.        We could have used Dianne's voice in the fights ahead.       Democracy needs champions. So do our institutions, creaky and       frustrating as they might be. The United States needs leaders       willing to respond to attacks on the rule of law with the       same fearlessness that Dianne showed when she exposed       unlawful ``enhanced interrogation techniques.'' We must       summon the passion of Dianne's answer to Sen. Craig back in       1993. We all can honor her legacy by finding in ourselves the       courage that Dianne showed on that bloody day in 1978.        Dianne's journey has ended, but the fights of her life are       far from over.                            ____________________
