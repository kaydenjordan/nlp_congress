 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support Ms. Sanchez' amendment  on malign disinformation spread within the Department of Defense and  the VA.   Within the military, a 2019 Military Times survey found that 36  percent of Active-Duty servicemembers have personally witnessed white  nationalism or ideology-driven racism within recent months, a 12  percent year-over-year increase.   This is not about vaccinations. This is about extremism, and  specifically about racism. Witnessing extremist views is more common  among enlisted members than among officers, and a majority of minority  servicemembers, 53 percent, reported some experience with extremist  ideology in the military.   We know this ideology is fomented through mis- and disinformation.  Our enlisted people need to be ready to work as a unit with very  diverse peers, and our military needs to able to engage globally at all  times. That means we need to have a view of the world based in reality,  not disinformation.   This is even more paramount when we know that Russia intentionally  engages in disinformation to sabotage our country and our troops.   We can't let our troops be susceptible. I can't think of a more  important effort to help our troop readiness.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
