 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life, career,  and achievements of Anna Mae Robertson. Her service to the American  people during World War II in the 6888th Central Postal Directory  Battalion, known as the Six Triple Eight, is a shining example of hard  work and courage in the face of cultural grievance.   In her youth, Robertson lost her mother suddenly, leaving her and her  brother alone. Her mother had instilled the values of hard work and  service in her children, which inspired Anna Mae to devote her time and  dedication to the U.S. Army. In service, she worked strenuous hours,  filing over 65,000 pieces of mail for every shift. Robertson's  battalion consisted solely of Black women who excelled at their work in  their respective department. Despite wartime anxieties and cultural  unrest, Robertson and her team would complete 6 weeks of hard work in  half the time needed, all while being stationed in Birmingham, England,  amidst enemy attacks and wartime fears.   Had it not been for Robertson and her team's success, wartime  communication would have been convoluted and inefficient. She handled  the passage of information in the most dire of conditions at the  darkest of times when communication was a necessity. Her service did  not end there. While stationed in France, she served as a hospital  aide, continuing to assist and nurse American soldiers.   Robertson's passion for helping those who have served would follow  her home. When returning to Milwaukee, Robertson dedicated her time to  working as a nurse aide at the Milwaukee VA Medical Center. She also  joined the ``I Am Not Invisible'' campaign headed by the Center for  Women Veterans, advocating for equal recognition, awareness, and  resources for women who have served in the American military.   Robertson served despite facing racial bigotry and discrimination.  She stood for the American people unconditionally when some may have  not stood for her. Robertson was previously been decorated with six  awards for her service, and I am pleased that she, along with the  members of Six Triple Eight, will now receive a Congressional  [[Page S3068]]  Gold Medal in recognition of their service. Anna Mae Robertson is an  inspiring example of hope and service in the United States. I am  pleased to share my congratulations and heartfelt gratitude with Anna  Mae Robertson for her lifetime of service and devotion to our Nation.                            ____________________
