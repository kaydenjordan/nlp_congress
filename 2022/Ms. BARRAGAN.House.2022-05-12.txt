 Mr. Speaker, as we observe National Police Week, I am  here to honor and celebrate the life and service of South Gate Police  Detective Alexis Gonzalez of South Gate, California.   Detective Gonzalez tragically passed away on April 25. Detective  Gonzalez first joined the police department in 2013 as a police  explorer. He graduated from the Rio Hondo Police Academy in 2017,  realizing his dream of becoming a South Gate police officer.   At the age of 27, Detective Gonzalez was a 5-year veteran of the  police force and a hero in South Gate. He was a shining star and will  be sorely missed by family, friends, and the entire community.   We honor the life and service of Detective Gonzalez and his family,  and of every police officer who has put their life at risk to protect  our communities.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
