 Mr. Speaker, the day after our new President spoke to the  President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, we saw a surge in Russian  aggression and attacks in eastern Ukraine. Every American must realize,  Russia is testing our new administration's resolve to stand up for  liberty.   Since Russia invaded Crimea in February 2014, 10,000 innocent  Ukrainians have been killed by Russian aggression, and this has  increased over the past week. Dozens more have been displaced--17,000,  in fact.   These actions violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security  Assurances that stated: the Russian Federation would respect the  independent sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine.   Russia's new aggression is another step in its campaign to undermine  the democratic order that has existed in our Transatlantic Alliance  since the end of World War II and cold war.   America must stand up for the people of Ukraine and our European  alliances and denounce the actions of President Putin. We have to stand  up or we face--Russia will face condemnation by the world community.  Russia should withdraw her heavy weapons from that region. They should  stop financing separatists. They should allow repairs for critical  infrastructure and fulfill all of their agreements under the Minsk  accords.   What is happening is a global shame.                            ____________________
