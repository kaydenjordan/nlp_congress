 Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, I got the phone call everyone  dreads. My wife had collapsed at work and was being rushed to an  emergency room. It is a moment that is painfully familiar to far too  many. Time stops. You fight to push your breath down your throat. Your  brain gets stuck in that highlight reel of worst-case scenarios. You  are terrified.   Fortunately, we were among the lucky ones. Lauren was okay. Most  critically, our health coverage gave us the support that we needed to  be able to focus on the one thing that mattered most, her recovery.   For families in America, that is the simple expectation of our  country's healthcare system, a commitment that our society makes to  care for one another in our time of deepest need because our health is  our great equalizer.   No matter your power or privilege, no one among us escapes our time  here on Earth without watching someone we love fight for their life. So  we fortify this social contract, not just out of sympathy for the  suffering, but so that it is there for us, too, when we need its sturdy  brace.   ``Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.''
