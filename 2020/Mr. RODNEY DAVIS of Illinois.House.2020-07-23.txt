 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking  member, Ms. Granger, and Chair Lowey. Also, I give thanks to Chair  McCollum and also Ranking Member Joyce on the Appropriations  Subcommittee for Interior for allowing the provision that I am going to  speak about to be included in today's legislation.   It is very important because this inclusion was language from a bill  that I introduced, the Springfield Race Riot National Historic Monument  Act, and that is in the fiscal year 2021 Interior Appropriations bill.   Mr. Speaker, my bill would designate the 1908 Springfield Race Riots,  which ultimately played an integral role in the formation of the NAACP,  it would designate the site of those race riots.   For over the last few years, because of a Federal project, we have  been uncovering artifacts from those race riots. We want to tell a  story about those race riots and why America and Springfield, Illinois,  should never have anything like that happen again. This language would  authorize the Park Service to conduct a special resource study to  determine its eligibility into the park system.   Thank you, again, to all who have made this a possibility. Building  off conversations that we had on the floor yesterday, I am grateful for  this opportunity to further engage in the important discussions that we  are having surrounding race in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to supporting a final package that  includes this language to give this site and the events that occurred  there proper recognition.
