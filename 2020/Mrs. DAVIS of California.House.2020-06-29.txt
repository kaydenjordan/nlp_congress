 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Usually, one's healthcare is not top of mind, until it is. This,  Madam Speaker, is one of those times.   We have to protect people's healthcare, men and women, whether it is  battling the coronavirus, finding a cure for cancer, or even birth.   Currently, Medicaid covers women for only 60 days postpartum, but  life-threatening complications from pregnancy, as we all know, can  continue much longer.   These illnesses don't follow the calendar. Regulations, of course,  must align with reality.   This needs to be changed. Fortunately, this bill would extend  Medicaid coverage to a year postpartum and provide women with critical  coverage to help detect, diagnose, and treat potentially fatal  complications.   By ensuring better health awareness from the beginning, we can ensure  that all babies are protected and cared for as they grow.   When our Nation is facing a health crisis, the logical reaction  should be to strengthen healthcare, not to weaken it.   We need to secure these smart policies to protect future Americans  from the start.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Affordable Care  Enhancement Act.
