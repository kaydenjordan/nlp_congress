 Madam President, I rise today to recognize and give  thanks to one of the hardest working and most integral members of my  team, Ms. Chesna Foord. Chesna has been my director of scheduling for 6  years and has spent nearly a decade in my offices in Washington, DC,  and in San Francisco.   Every Member of this Senate knows the importance of their scheduler,  and Chesna has been a 10. She is the first person I call in the morning  and often the last person I check with at night. She gets me where I  need to be and ensures that I am prepared when I get there, but she  also has developed a sixth sense for what needs to be done and pitfalls  to avoid. And I am forever grateful that she does it all with  unflappable patience and good cheer. I am pleased to have her not just  on my staff, but as a friend.   As a Senator, I have the pleasure of seeing young people come into  public service and, in some cases, flourish in the environment. Chesna  is one of those people.   She joined my San Francisco office as an intern shortly after  graduating from the University of Puget Sound. After distinguishing  herself there, Chesna moved across country to intern in my Washington,  DC, office and was promoted to staff assistant and then to deputy  scheduler.   But it has been over the past 6 years as director of scheduling that  I have gotten to know Chesna and watched her grow in skill, in  communication, in leadership, and into the woman I now get to see day  in and day out.   She has been here with me through good times and bad and has helped  me get through impeachments and Supreme Court confirmations, vote-a- ramas and insurrection. And I will be always be thankful for her help  with arrangements and support when my husband passed away earlier this  year.   I am sad to see Chesna leave, but I understand that the lure of the  West Coast and personal ties are calling Chesna back home to  California. Thankfully, Chesna will remain on the team, as a field  representative in my Los Angeles office.   And so, on behalf of this grateful Senator, I thank Chesna Foord for  her friendship and her forbearance, and thank her for her years of  excellent and caring service.                            ____________________
