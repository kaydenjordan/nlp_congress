 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  California for the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment in order to increase  and decrease funds in the State Department to highlight the need for  stronger congressional oversight, robust human rights measures, and  transparency in U.S. arms sales to countries.   The fact of the matter is, despite leaky laws in place, the United  States has quietly trained and armed actors who eventually engage in  human rights abuses all over the world through a State Department  program known as direct commercial sales.   This program allows the State Department to sell up to $100 to $300  million in military training, weapons, and services without so much as  notifying Congress.   It was through this policy that the U.S. provided paramilitary  training to Saudi operatives that later went on to kill Jamal  Khashoggi, as well as for the sales of arms later used in the abduction  and killing of more than 300 Colombians in the May 2021 protests over  labor rights.   The U.S. must stop arming and funding human rights violators. We must  have stronger congressional oversight, robust human rights standards,  and transparency in all U.S. arms sales.
