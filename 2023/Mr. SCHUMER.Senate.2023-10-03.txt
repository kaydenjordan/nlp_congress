 Mr. President, it says, ``Let me be the first to welcome  our newest colleague,'' but I see she has had a lot of good welcomes  already. So let me be the first majority leader to welcome our newest  colleague to the U.S. Senate, Senator Laphonza Butler, sworn in moments  ago as the next Senator from California.   Mr. President, I can't help but think how proud Senator Feinstein  would be seeing someone as brilliant, as accomplished, as history- making as Laphonza Butler take her place. I know that our old colleague  is looking down at this moment with pride now that her seat is in good  hands.   Congratulations to Senator Butler on this immense honor. This is a  historic moment for the Senate, for California, and for the entire  country. Senator Butler is only the third Black woman in American  history to serve in the U.S. Senate. She is the first openly lesbian  Senator from California, and  [[Page S4902]]  she is the first openly LGBTQ Senator of color to serve in this body.  Today, the Senate takes another step toward fully reflecting our  vibrant democracy.   Now, Laphonza's life story can be summarized in two words: serving  others. By her own telling, service was practically a dinner table  conversation growing up in Magnolia, MS. After losing her father to  illness, Laphonza watched her mom sacrifice everything to put her kids  first: working night shifts as a nurse, as a security guard, a  classroom aide, anything to help her kids have a better life.   No surprise, that example left a mark on Laphonza for the rest of her  days. Following in her mom's footsteps, Laphonza has dedicated her  entire career to fighting for others: fighting for women, fighting for  working families, and fighting for the cause of justice. I know she  will do the same here in the Senate.   So, again, this is a proud moment for all of us. And I know this must  be a proud moment for Laphonza's family.   I know you are not supposed to address members of the Senate Gallery,  Mr. President, but let me say this to everyone who had attended here  and who are still here: We are all very happy Laphonza's family could  join us to share in this special day. We share in their joy too.   Finally, to our colleague Laphonza, I know these last few days have  felt like a whirlwind. I know it seems like there is a million things  to do and so little time to do them. But rest assured, we are here to  help you.   I spent a great half hour, 45 minutes talking to Laphonza, and she is  going to be one great Senator. We are ready to work with her. All of us  who have stood where Laphonza stands now have felt the awesome weight  of holding this office and are ready to help her. I urge you, if you  permit me, to never let the sense of duty disappear, for in our hands  rests the trust, the wishes, the hopes, and the burdens of the American  people.   So to Senator Butler, congratulations on this honor and welcome to  the Senate today. Today is a day of celebration.   As we celebrate, we also remember to give thanks to our late  colleague and friend Senator Feinstein.   For the information of Senators, the floor of the Senate will close  so Members can attend the memorial service of Senator Feinstein in San  Francisco this Thursday. And on that day, it will be my honor to speak  at Senator Feinstein's memorial to give thanks for all she did for this  country and to honor the legacy she leaves behind.   I hope all my colleagues who worked with her all these years are able  to attend so we can say a final goodbye to one of the greatest public  servants to serve in this Chamber.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
