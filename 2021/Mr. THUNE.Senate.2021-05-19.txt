 Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, President Biden  unveiled his so-called American Families Plan, which one might  summarize as free stuff--free preschool, free community college, lots  of government subsidies. It sounds great, but the problem, of course,  is that none of that is really free. The government may not send  individuals a bill for any of those items, but that doesn't mean they  don't have to be paid for by someone. So President Biden proposed a  raft of tax hikes to at least partially pay for his proposals--a hike  in the capital gains tax, an additional new death tax to add to the one  we already have, and a hike in the top income tax rate.   Now, President Biden is selling these tax increases as tax hikes on  wealthy Americans, whom Democrats view as a bottomless source of  funding for new government programs, but there are two problems with  that.   In the first place, there is no question that some middle-class  Americans will be hit by President Biden's new death tax. While he  provides an exemption for gains of $1 million or less, the truth is  that it is possible to die with an estate whose value has increased by  more than $1 million over the course of your life, while never breaking  out of the middle class. We are not talking about individuals with a  yearly income of $1 million; we are talking about the lifetime gains on  assets an individual has at his or her death.   Then, of course, there is a good bet that many of those individuals'  heirs--the ones whose inheritance will be diminished by this tax--are  thoroughly middle class. Your parents might die with an estate that has  gained $1 million-plus in value, but you yourself might be earning just  $40,000 or $50,000 a year.   All this is especially true in the case of family farms and  businesses. Farming is a cash-poor business. Farmers might have land  that has appreciated over decades by substantially more than $1 million  even though the farmers themselves may at times struggle even to break  even. Levying President Biden's new tax at death could permanently  destroy a family farm or business.   Now, President Biden has suggested that he will carve out an  exemption for family farms and businesses if the next generation  commits to running them, but it remains to be seen what that exception  looks like and whether it truly protects family farms. He has not  pledged to carve out an exception for middle-class Americans whose  inheritance will be hit by this new tax.   Then there is the fact that President Biden's new income tax hike  will also hit small businesses, many of whose owners pour a substantial  part of their profits back into the business instead of raking in a  large salary.   But even leaving all that aside and supposing that President Biden's  new taxes will be levied only on wealthy Americans, there is still a  problem. Sure, if you are in the middle class, the government might not  be sending you a tax bill, but that doesn't mean you won't be  negatively affected by these taxes.   You see, Democrats operate under the entirely false assumption that  you can tax higher earners without consequences, that you can tax  investments without consequences, and that you can tax businesses  without consequences. In Democrats' world, you can heavily tax  something, but no one will behave any differently. No one will reduce  his or her investments. No business will flee high tax rates by moving  overseas. No business will pass on higher tax bills to consumers in the  form of higher prices at a time when inflation is already on the rise.   But, of course, in the real world, people do respond to tax hikes.  Businesses raise prices on their products, they limit wage growth to  their workers, and they create fewer jobs. In fact, studies suggest  that 50 to 70 percent or more of the burden o corporate tax hikes is  borne by workers in the form of lower wages and fewer job  opportunities.    Corporations also move overseas. Before Republicans lowered the  corporate tax rate to make American businesses more competitive in the  global economy, a significant number of American companies were moving  their headquarters overseas.   Small businesses hit with big tax hikes cut jobs or limit their  creation of new ones. They raise prices. They decide not to expand.   Investors hit with major tax hikes decide not to invest as much.  Since investment fuels jobs and innovation, both of those suffer as a  result.   In every one of these cases, ordinary Americans are affected--not  just the rich; not just millionaires; ordinary, middle-class Americans.  After all, most Americans, if they are not self-employed or working for  government, are employed by businesses. If the business they work for  isn't doing well, their prospects are going to be significantly  affected. If businesses hold down wages to deal with the impact of tax  hikes, for example, ordinary Americans' long-term earning potential  will be diminished. These effects may not sound as concrete as being  handed a tax bill, but they have just as real of an impact on  Americans' income and Americans' lives.   Democrats talk a lot about making the rich pay their fair share. We  hear it constantly. From the way Democrats talk, you would think that  rich people rarely pay any taxes. That is not even close to being the  case.   The fact is that our tax system is highly--highly--progressive, the  most progressive in the world, and the tax relief Republicans passed 3  years ago actually made it even more progressive.   In 2013, individuals making over $1 million paid twice as much per  dollar in taxes--I should say in 2018, individuals making over $1  million paid twice as much per dollar in taxes as individuals making  between 75,000 and $100,000 or more than 10 times--10 times as much per  dollar as individuals making between $20,000 and $30,000.   It would be interesting to know what exactly Democrats consider to be  a fair share. When financially successful Americans are paying half of  their income in taxes, is that when it is fair? Seventy-five percent of  their income? Ninety-five percent of their income? And when they are  paying that much, what happens then? Well, I have already indicated  what happens. Investment declines, wages stagnate, prices go up, job  creation goes down, and ordinary Americans start feeling the  consequences. But, unfortunately, Democrats are so used to viewing the  wealthy as an inexhaustible source of money that they refuse to admit  that hiking taxes on wealthier Americans will have consequences.   It even goes further than that. It is not just that Democrats view  wealthier Americans as an inexhaustible source  [[Page S2749]]  of money; it is that Democrats are well on their way to a kind of  Marxist-style class warfare that demonizes success.   Nowhere is that more evident than in the fact that Democrats are  proposing a capital gains tax hike on the wealthy that will fail to  maximize government revenue. That is right. Democrats could actually  get more revenue to pay for their social programs if they raised the  capital gains tax less. Democrats are proposing a capital gains  increase so substantial that it will actually return less government  revenue--thanks to the resulting decrease in investment--than a lower  rate hike would return.   At the level of tax hike Democrats have proposed, the tax hike  becomes less about raising government revenue and more about punishing  more prosperous Americans for being successful, which is a pretty un- American way of looking at things. Democrats like to portray the  wealthy as a bunch of billionaires sitting on inherited piles of money  and not doing a day's work. But the truth is that a lot of prosperous  people in this country are, A, not billionaires, and B, only wealthy  because they worked hard, saved, and made prudent financial decisions  and took advantage of the opportunities they were given.   Focusing on punishing successful Americans for being successful  instead of focusing on how we can create opportunity and remove  obstacles to success for everyone else is counterproductive because it  has a negative effect on our economy. It fosters an atmosphere of envy  instead of possibility, hostility instead of determination. Rather than  focusing on how we can lift everybody up, the focus becomes on how we  can drag part of society down.   Rather than counterproductively hiking taxes to punish the successful  or pay for an ever-increasing array of government programs, we should  be focusing on creating an economy that gives every single American the  chance for success and that reduces the need for government programs by  increasing economic opportunity for all Americans. Unfortunately for  the American people, Democrats' tax hikes will have the opposite  effect.   I yield the floor.
