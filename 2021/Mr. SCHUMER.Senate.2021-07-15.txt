 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, every Senator, from every State, has  witnessed the hollowing out of the middle class over the past few  decades. Globalization and technology have changed the way that  Americans work and compete. Productivity increased, but wages for the  bottom 70 percent stagnated in this century, in this 20 years. Income  equality spiked as wealth agglomerated to the top.   The financial crisis and the COVID pandemic heaped additional  hardship on middle-class families that were already falling behind. The  changes in the world--the swirling changes, economic and social--have  made it harder to stay in the middle class and have made it harder to  get to the middle class.   We Democrats feel an obligation to make it easier for those in the  middle class to enjoy that middle-class life and stay there and for  those struggling to get into the middle class to have those ladders so  they can climb up to get there.   These are exciting and fundamental times to be here in the Senate. In  short, we have a lot to do to restore the fundamental American promise  of opportunity and economic mobility--the faith that, through hard  work, any American can build a better life for themselves, their  families, their children, and then pass even greater opportunity on to  their children. That is the American dream. It has been fading, and  that has allowed demagoguery and nastiness and divisiveness to become  too great a part of our politics.   We want to restore that sunny optimism that Americans have always  had, and that is why we are so intent on moving forward this month. The  idea that Americans can build a better life for themselves and pass  greater opportunity to their children is at the heart  [[Page S4912]]  of what Democrats are trying to achieve this year through the American  Jobs and Families Plan, helping middle-class families stay in the  middle class and breathe easier and helping poorer Americans climb that  ladder to get there.   And nothing--nothing--will do more to advance that goal than the bill  we are working on this year. The budget resolution agreed to by  Democrats on the Budget Committee this week is the first step down a  long road toward enacting a transformational change in our economy. It  will allow us to pass the most significant legislation to expand  support for American families since the era of the New Deal and the  Great Society. If not quite Rooseveltian in scope, it is certainly near  Rooseveltian. It is dramatic change to help average families do better.   The best way to understand the emerging legislation is in three broad  categories: jobs, which will come through major infrastructure  investments; families; and climate. We are going to create thousands  upon thousands of good-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and  the training and apprenticeships that will help more Americans,  including many of those who have been left out, get those jobs.   We are going to expand and strengthen the programs that support  American families and introduce new ones, like paid family leave and a  robust expansion of Medicaid to cover vision, dental, and hearing. I  salute Senator Sanders for putting it on the map and now making it a  real possibility to happen.   And we are going to act on climate in a bold and comprehensive way,  to reduce emissions, make our infrastructure more resilient, and create  the green jobs of the future to meet the President's goals of an 80- percent reduction in dirty carbon that goes into energy production and  a 50-percent overall reduction in the carbon we send to the atmosphere.   When Republicans held the majority in the Senate, unfortunately,  their signature legislative achievement was a massive tax break for  corporations and the wealthy. From one report I read, the top 1 percent  got 83 percent of the benefits when the Republicans had power. What a  difference when Democrats are in power. You know what the top 1 percent  got in the ARP bill? Zero. Nada. Nothing.   God bless them. They are doing great. They don't need it.   Democrats, instead, are strengthening the backbone of the middle  class, and that is what we are going to do in this jobs and family  plan. American workers, American families are going to benefit while we  address the generational challenge of climate change.   And as I have said from the start, Madam President--as I have said  from the start--the two tracks of infrastructure are going to move in  tandem. We are making good progress on both tracks.   We in the Democratic caucus heard from the President yesterday on the  budget resolution. The meeting was wonderful. The excitement was  palpable. The opportunity to do so much good for so many American  families was in the air in that meeting. It was exciting. And, as that  happened, the bipartisan working groups had many meetings on the  bipartisan infrastructure framework as well.   Today, I am announcing that I intend to file cloture on the vehicle  for a bipartisan infrastructure bill on Monday of next week. Senators  will have until Wednesday of next week before the initial vote on  cloture on the motion to proceed.   Everyone has been having productive conversations, and it is  important to keep the two-track process moving. All parties involved in  the bipartisan infrastructure bill talks must now finalize their  agreement so that the Senate can begin considering that legislation  next week.   And I am setting the same deadline, next Wednesday, for the entire  Senate Democratic caucus to agree to move forward on the budget  resolution with reconciliation instructions. The time has come to make  progress, and we will. We must    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 195.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 246.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for cloture motions filed today, Thursday, July  15, be waived.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished  Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, I send to the desk a resolution  authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and ask for its  immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a lawsuit filed in Federal  court in Florida that names a range of local, State, and Federal  defendants, including Senator Rubio. Plaintiff's sole allegation  against Senator Rubio is that he did not respond to plaintiff's request  to introduce legislation that plaintiff urges him to present to  Congress. Plaintiff's claims against the Senator based on this  allegation are subject to dismissal on jurisdictional grounds and for  failure to state a claim. This resolution would authorize the Senate  Legal Counsel to represent Senator Rubio in order to seek dismissal of  the claims against him.                            ____________________
