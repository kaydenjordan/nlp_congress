 Madam President, there has been a lot of well-deserved  attention to free expression limits on college campuses. My colleagues  have heard me right here on this very Senate floor speak about the need  for free expression many times. But one reason we have this issue at  colleges is because students aren't exposed to the diverse ideas in our  public schools and other K-12 institutions. So when brandnew college  students encounter opposing ideas for the first time, you have heard  it--they lash out. They demand what are called safe spaces on the  college campuses.   Now, that tells me that students are coming to college very  unprepared to hear diverse views. If your own views have never been  challenged, then you almost certainly have not developed the skills to  evaluate different viewpoints and then go ahead and make up your own  mind.   So let's raise this question: Why are students arriving in college so  resistant to hearing diverse views?   I have been following some news stories on this subject last month,  and all of this may not be entirely accidental, that our high school  students aren't prepared to hear diverse viewpoints when they get to  college.   The American Federation of Teachers recently announced that it wants  to put an extension on the computers of its 1.7 million members. The  goal of this NewsGuard extension is to provide ``trust ratings'' of  news websites. Although numerous studies have pointed to a clear  leftwing bias from NewsGuard, the AFT still wanted to bring it into the  classrooms across America. Now, that should not be our goal. Our goal  should be to get political bias out of K-12 schools, not ingrain it.   Contrariwise, a major focus that I have heard from Iowa teachers has  been that we need to develop among our students critical thinking.  Well, critical thinking requires listening to different ideas. If all  students just agree with their teachers, that is repetition, not  independent thinking.   The disease that has infected so many colleges now seems to spread  throughout our K-12 schools. I hope for our country's future we find a  way to continue to show kids both sides of an argument rather than  shutting down ideas that teachers may disagree with. I have heard from  many Iowans concerned about exactly that kind of bias. But we can't fix  it here in Washington, DC.   The first rule of education policy should be that decisions are made  as close to the family as possible. If you have issues with how your  school is being run, your local school board should be your very first  step. These elected officials are directly accountable to the parents  in their own communities. A problem should only go up to the State  legislature if it is caused by State law, and only a select few issues  should go to this national level, where Federal intervention is found  out to be the source of the problem.    So if you see political bias or lack of diverse viewpoints in your  kids' school, go to the people who can fix it. Make your voice heard  both at school board meetings and at the ballot box.                               Border Security    Madam President, on another subject, we had the good fortune of  hearing a series of speeches last week led by my colleague from Iowa,  Joni Ernst, on the critical situation at our southern border, with  people violating our laws, coming into this country, and almost being  invited into this country in violation of our laws because our  [[Page S2907]]  laws say you need the permission of the United States to come to this  country.   So I didn't speak last week on that subject, but, as I have done on a  number of occasions otherwise, I want to once again come to my  colleagues about the border crisis created by President Biden,  Secretary Mayorkas, and maybe more throughout this administration.   The crisis at our southern border is one of the top issues I hear at  my county meetings. Iowans are understandably upset by President  Biden's policies that have incentivized illegal immigration and created  a historic crisis at the southern border.   In the first 15 months of this administration, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection--CBP, as we call it--has experienced over 2.7 million  encounters with illegal immigrants at the southern border. That number  is staggering. It is larger than the population of 15 States and  Washington, DC. It is almost three times larger than the President's  home State of Delaware.   Make no mistake about it, this crisis is entirely the fault of  President Biden and the policies that he put in place almost his first  day in office.   Since taking office, this administration has terminated physical  barrier construction at the southern border. In other words, the wall  that works to keep people from entering our country was stopped being  built.   Next, this administration attempted to severely limit the ability of  ICE to deport illegal immigrants; also attempted to terminate the  ``Remain in Mexico'' policy; rolled back asylum cooperative agreements;  openly supported sanctuary city policies; embraced mass catch-and- release policies; put forward mass-amnesty legislative proposals that  would do nothing to secure the border; and even attempted to terminate  title 42 without any plan in place to deal with what happened when we  increased the number of people illegally crossing our border from about  6- to 7,000 a day to 18,000 a day, and that figure comes from the  estimates of our own executive branch government.   Now, listing all these things, therefore, it shouldn't be a surprise  to see a record-shattering surge of illegal immigration at our southern  border. This is what happens when you make it clear that you have no  intention of fully enforcing the Nation's immigration laws or cracking  down on illegal immigration.   As I have said before, it is an unfortunate reality that the  President and his administration believe the surge in illegal  immigration at the southern border due to his policies is a process to  be managed rather than a crisis to be stopped. Until that mindset  changes, this historic crisis at our southern border will continue. And  President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas, and the irresponsible and reckless  policies of this administration deserve all of the blame for the  situation that we are in.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
