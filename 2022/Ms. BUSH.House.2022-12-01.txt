 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today to remind my  colleagues that there is no place in a humane society for State- sanctioned violence.   On Tuesday, Kevin ``KJ'' Johnson was taken from his family by capital  punishment. From the systemic racism that tainted his conviction and  the State's continuing use of executions to the Missouri Supreme  Court's and the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of a stay of execution, KJ  was failed by our criminal legal system.   Missouri intends to move forward with the executions of four more  people in the coming months. Congress must act. Congress must pass  legislation to abolish the Federal death penalty and encourage States  to follow suit.   I am also urging our President to continue leading on this issue and  act now. Commute the sentences of all those on Federal death row,  condemn State executions, and urge his administration, this  administration, to stop seeking the death penalty. Let's abolish the  death penalty once and for all.                            ____________________
