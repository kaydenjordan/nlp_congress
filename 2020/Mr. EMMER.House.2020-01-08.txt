 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an outstanding  athlete from Anoka, Minnesota.   Reese Dehen, this year, became a repeat State champion in swimming.  She won the State swimming title in the Class AA 200 individual medley,  and then the sophomore from Anoka continued to add a second State  championship in the 100 breaststroke during the swimming State  championships at the University of Minnesota.   Reese is an outstanding young talent and one of Minnesota's premier  athletes. She is also a role model for thousands of young swimmers and  student athletes who make the sacrifice to achieve the best they can  be.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Reese and thank her for being a great  role model. Our entire community is proud of her.            Honoring Christopher Stewart, an Outstanding Educator     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Christopher Stewart of  North Lakes Academy charter school in Forest Lake, Minnesota. Mr.  Stewart took learning to a new level this past year, participating in a  program designed to preserve and amplify the history of fallen U.S.  service personnel.    For an entire year, Mr. Stewart researched the life and service of  Richard Willard Moody, a fallen World War II hero of the United States  Army's 129th Aero Squadron assigned to the French Escadrille Br. 129.  Mr. Moody was from Minneapolis, Minnesota, and he fought bravely on  behalf of the United States before making the ultimate sacrifice in  France.   Sponsored by National History Day, in conjunction with the U.S. World  War I Centennial Commission and the Pritzker Military Museum and  Library, Mr. Stewart brought history to life and revived and preserved  the memory of Richard Willard Moody. In fact, he even traveled to  France to give a graveside eulogy and, when he returned to the United  States, used this experience to teach his students.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Stewart for remembering a fallen hero and  preserving his legacy. His students are lucky to have him and so is  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District.                    Honoring Stan Nelson, a Minnesota Hero     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Stan Nelson for his  decades of service to the United States and to the city of Anoka,  Minnesota.   Stan is well known throughout his community as a man of faith,  family, and football. Some know Stan as ``Coach.'' Others know him as  ``Lieutenant Junior Grade.'' Others know Stan as a Minnesota Senior  Olympic gold medalist. Today, we add ``Hero'' to the list of titles  that accompany his name.   Stan was a student and football player at Augsburg College who went  on to enlist in the Navy following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Stan  operated one of the first boats to land on Omaha Beach on D-day.   Following his service in World War II, Stan went on to coach the  Anoka High School football team for 26 years, becoming a legend in  Anoka and a mentor for generations of players. In honor of his repeated  sacrifices, Haven for Heroes, a local nonprofit that provides  transitional housing for veterans, recently dedicated their auditorium  in honor of Stan.   Men like Stan deserve to be honored. He has lived a life as a servant  leader. And at age 99, he hasn't slowed down.   Mr. Speaker, we are honored that Stan's name will forever adorn the  Haven for Heroes auditorium, and I thank him for his service to Anoka  and to his country.                   Recognizing Starkey Hearing Technologies     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Starkey Hearing  Technologies, a Minnesota-based manufacturer of hearing aids, for  earning a place on Time magazine's list of Best 2019 Inventions.   Starkey's invention of the Livio AI hearing aid not only provides  users with improved hearing quality, but it also tracks an individual's  body and brain health.   This device, in addition, has several features that apply to our  fast-paced world: It can stream music; it can act like a smart  assistant; and it can even translate languages.   Minnesota is proud of its many innovators and inventors. From  Medtronic's pacemaker to Starkey's cutting-edge hearing devices,  Minnesota remains one our country's premier medtech hubs.   I congratulate Starkey for its amazing contribution to hearing health  for patients across the country. Minnesotans are proud that they call  our great State home.                                time  1015              Addressing Workforce Shortages for American Farms     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the recent passage of  the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, H.R. 5038.   I want to thank my colleague from the State of Washington, Mr.   Dan  [[Page H17]]  Newhouse, and my colleagues from across the aisle for working in good  faith in search of a solution to a longstanding issue in our  agricultural community.   Workforce shortages are crippling our most important industries. In  the Sixth District of Minnesota, agriculture and manufacturing have  suffered the most. Farmers need assurances they will be able to  maintain their farm over the long term and that includes having a  reliable workforce.   Unfortunately, H.R. 5038 fell short of addressing key changes to our  temporary worker visa programs.   While we have more work to do, I appreciate my colleagues' efforts to  find solutions to the challenges.                            ____________________
