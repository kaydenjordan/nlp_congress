 Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting day here on  Capitol Hill. Madam Speaker, the hearing was still going on when I was  just in the Cloakroom, where we had an FBI agent, one of the top  supervisors, he had been in charge of foreign counterintelligence as  well, and then after his outrageous bias and comments through text  messages came to light, Robert Mueller relieved him from the Trump  investigation and left the others who were just as biased. But it was  an incredible day.   For somebody who has not just shown bias, but outrageous animus,  disgust, disdain, and deploring people who voted for Trump by their  smell, he  [[Page H6167]]  tried to clean it up a little bit in his testimony today.   Madam Speaker, I thought it might be helpful to some of our Members  who know there is some rule here of the House that somehow you are not  supposed to besmirch other Members. I am not sure how far it goes, but  if they will check the rule, it is for those who are elected, be it  House Member, Senate, Vice President, President, we are required to  show decency and not call into question the intentions of such an  elected person.   When a witness comes before a hearing who is testifying 180 degrees  opposite of what he put in writing thousands of times, for most of us,  for a majority here in the House, it has no credibility. It makes the  witness even look worse.   To come in after we have seen so many of the texts he sent, we have  got a good sense of where this man's heart, soul, and mind have been.  It appeared abundantly clear that he had gotten very, very good at  lying. It doesn't violate any House rule to say that.   Now, when we were in our hearing, and one of my Democratic friends  across the aisle yelled that I was off my meds, see, now, that was a  violation of the rule. I thought about calling it out, having her words  taken down, but we didn't need any further delays. But I thought it  might be informative to my friends across the aisle who don't  understand the rules of the House, but when somebody is lying through  their teeth, sitting there smugly and smirking, and, frankly, when it  hit me, that is probably the same smug little smirk you had on your  face when you told your wife, no telling how many times, there is  nothing going on between me and Lisa Page. He got really good at lying  and showing no emotion whatsoever.                                time  1815    So, unfortunately, what I brought out in that hearing and he denied  recalling should not be lost in the exchange about his lying. It is far  more important.   But for the record, as a prosecutor, a defense attorney, a felony  judge, a chief justice, and as a Member of Congress, I have asked  thousands of witnesses questions. When you have somebody who has just  gotten so good at lying that there is no indication in their eyes  whatsoever that it bothers them to lie, somebody has got to call them  out on it. It is just not good for the state of this Union.   It is also denying credibility to actually have the witness say he  doesn't recall getting information about a foreign entity that is not  Russia getting every--actually, it was over 30,000 emails, emails that  were sent through to Hillary Clinton through the unauthorized server  and unsecured server and every email she sent out. There were highly  classified--beyond classified--top secret-type stuff that had gone  through that server.   Out of the over 30,000 emails that went through that server, all but  4 of them--no explanation why those 4 didn't get the same instruction,  but we have some very good intelligence people--when they were asked to  look at Hillary Clinton's emails, they picked up an anomaly. As they  did forensic research on the emails, they found that anomaly was  actually an instruction embedded, compartmentalized data embedded in  the email server telling the server to send a copy of every email that  came to Hillary Clinton through that unauthorized server and every  email that she sent out through that server, to send it to this foreign  entity that is not Russia.   We know that efforts were made to get Inspector General Horowitz to  receive that information. He would not return a call. Apparently, he  didn't want that information because that would go against his saying  that the bias did not affect the investigation.   Of course it affected the investigation. It couldn't help but affect  the investigation. It denies logic and common sense to say somebody  with that much animus, that much bias and prejudice would not have it  affect their investigation.   Madam Speaker, I can tell you I know there are people in this House  who don't care for me, but I can also tell you there is no one in this  House on either side of this aisle who I would put up with being  investigated and prosecuted by somebody with the hatred, the absolute  nasty prejudice that Peter Strzok had for Donald Trump. I wouldn't put  up with it. I would go to bat for any Democrat in this House, any  Republican in this House, the ones who don't like me on either side. It  wouldn't matter.   Nobody in the United States of America should have the full power of  the Federal Government coming after them in the hands of somebody  prejudiced, full of hate for that individual. But such is what we are  dealing with here. That is why I laid the groundwork, gave the names of  the people--some of them--that were there when Peter Strzok was  informed about Hillary Clinton's emails for sure going to a foreign  entity. This is serious stuff.   What came of our intelligence community providing that information to  the FBI agent in charge, Peter Strzok? Nothing. Peter Strzok received  the information that it wasn't speculation, that maybe Hillary  Clinton's emails were capable of being hacked, but we have no evidence  that they were hacked.   All this garbage that we have heard about from reports? No. When the  FBI was told her emails were hacked and every email she received, every  email she sent out--over 30,000, except for 4--over 30,000 were  compromised and going to a foreign entity not Russia, and Mr. Strzok  did nothing about it.   When I started laying the groundwork pointing out the people, I am  told an attorney behind Mr. Strzok mouthed, ``Oh, my gosh,'' something  like that, as I was laying the groundwork. I don't know if she knew  what I was talking about or not, but I thought I picked up just a  fleeting note of detection in Peter Strzok's eyes that he knew what I  was talking about.   But, again, for my friends who are not familiar with the true rules  of the House, let me explain. In trial courts, for example, the felony  court over which I was a judge, the rules of evidence are very strict,  and we protect the jury from hearing things that don't have any basis  for believability. That is why most hearsay cannot come in, but there  are exceptions.   But one rule that you always find in any court, no matter how strict  the rules are, the credibility of the witness is always in evidence,  always relevant, always material. The witness' credibility is always  material and relevant.   When it has been as open and everyone in our hearing room knew what  has been going on for such a prolonged period and I saw that look, that  is all I could think is: I wonder if that is the same look you gave  your wife over and over when you lied to her about Lisa Page.   The credibility of a witness is always material and relevant. Mark it  down.   Now, in our House hearings, the rules are not that strict. It is more  in the nature of anything that we feel may be relevant to the subject  at hand. But in a hearing like today, even things that have nothing to  do--they are not germane, they are not relevant, they are not material  to what we are doing, we still have people bring in posters about  something that is not germane, not relevant, not material; and they can  get away with doing it, in some cases, as they did today, even though  the rules probably could have restricted keeping some of that out. We  have very relaxed rules, so these kind of things happen.   Like I say, to yell out I am off my meds, yes, that violates the  rule, but I am sure my Democratic friend didn't realize what a rule- breaker she was as she tried to claim I was breaking the rules, which I  was not.   But what really came home, too, is, again, Inspector General Horowitz  did a good job gathering the evidence, except he refused to get the  evidence that was offered to him about Hillary Clinton's emails  absolutely, unequivocally being hacked and everything over  30,000, except for 4, going to a foreign entity not Russia.    You get the picture. The bias made a lot of difference in the outcome  of the case.   Horowitz is just wrong about that. He was obviously--as I said at the  hearing: So you give us over 500 pages showing bias by the  investigators on the Republican side, and since you don't want your  Democratic friends mad at you, you conclude there is no indication all  of this evidence showed any affect on the outcome.   Well, hello. When you show such hatred and animus in the mind of the  lead  [[Page H6168]]  investigator and you show that everything that concluded from that  investigation was 100 percent consistent with the bias and hatred, you  don't have to have the witness agree: You are right; you caught me. All  my bias affected the outcome of my investigation.   Just like a prosecutor who puts on evidence that a guy gets in a car,  drives to a bank, pulls out a gun, holds it to the head of the teller,  makes the teller give him money, and leaves in that car, you have to  prove intent, that he intended to rob the bank, but you don't have to  have evidence that the bank robber said, ``Hey, I intend to rob this  bank.'' No.   When the results--and there are a lot of results--all of them are  consistent with the bias and the hatred, the disdain, the animus, then  you have got at least a de facto case, certainly one that can get past  a motion for summary judgment and get to the jury and put in the hands  of the fact finder.   Again, when you have somebody who is as good at lying to folks over  and over and over again with a straight face, gets a lot of practice,  and he comes before Congress--the guy is good. He is really good.   As I told him--I think, obviously, he and his lawyer had a different  opinion, but it seemed to me it would have been more credible to come  in and do what Inspector General Horowitz did, and say: Yeah, there is  a lot of bias here, no question, but I don't think it affected the  outcome.   Of course, he wasn't 100 percent sure, it didn't sound like, that it  didn't affect when Strzok decided to end the Hillary Clinton  investigation and when he immediately decided to pick up the  investigation against Trump.   As I heard my friend say over and over about how Comey, of course,  just really harmed the Clinton campaign, they are ignoring something  that appeared pretty clear, even without resorting to people who have  provided information about what went on.                                time  1830    We know Hillary Clinton's emails that she claimed were missing were  found on Anthony Weiner's laptop. Maybe it was Huma Abedin, Anthony  Weiner, one of their laptops. They found those emails there.   Of course, Peter Strzok, helping the woman whom he thought ought to  win 100 million to 0 for President, wow, that was not good news for  people like him who wanted to help Hillary.   They couldn't help the fact that FBI agents, when investigating  something else, find all these missing 30,000 or so emails on this  laptop. And they have got the information at least for some weeks,  maybe 2, maybe 3, maybe 4. We are not sure, but they had found this  information.   So Comey was in a difficult situation. He wanted Hillary to win, no  question. He did not want Donald Trump to win. He never did like Trump,  never has, apparently, things he has said and done.   So what could he do that would cause the least amount of problems for  Hillary Clinton?   There was a threat, apparently, that FBI agents were going to go  public that they had found these missing emails and that Comey was  blocking reopening the investigation now that we have all these emails.  And if FBI agents, who are righteous, unlike Peter Strzok, really  righteous people--and I know a lot of them around the country. They are  good, decent, upstanding, honorable, give-their-life-for-their-country  kind of people, not give their affair for themselves but give their  lives for their country. Those people have gotten a big blemish on them  because of Peter Strzok and others at the top of the Department of  Justice in the last administration, as they held over. They would never  do what Peter Strzok did. They would never do that.   So it gets a little like they erect a straw dog: You are condemning  the thousands of great FBI agents around the country.   No, I am blaming you. We know they are good, but you are not.   And that is where we have been here. This country is in a lot of  trouble. But it was very clear: Peter Strzok, intentionally and  knowingly, with demonstrated prejudice, refused to pursue the disclosed  fact to him, in his presence, that a foreign entity not Russia was  getting every email that Hillary Clinton sent and received. There was  classified material in there, and there was higher than just plain  classified. There was extremely sensitive information in there.   What else did we know? Actually, if you dig what has been uncovered  during the last 2 years, Hillary Clinton had the President's Daily  Briefing going to her home. And there are times that the young man--I  believe his name was Oscar Flores--who worked there, they may have  tried to get him a clearance at one time, but, apparently, from what I  could read, he didn't have any kind of clearance, yet he would print  stuff off.   The President's Daily Briefing is some of the most sensitive  information in the entire United States Government, extreme  sensitivity, and she violated the law by making it accessible to people  without the proper clearance and, certainly, her young man, or man, who  was working there for her.   She violated the law. It wasn't necessary that she have intent; it  was just necessary that she broke the law in that case.   I really would like to have intent be an element of most every crime  that is in the Federal law. I think it would be a good idea. But right  now it is not part of the laws she broke.   Yet people like Peter Strzok covered for her. They refused to pursue  the things that would have made her guilty. They went after things to  try to hurt Donald Trump.   When you look at that October press conference that Comey had, you  realize, gee, what if he had not called that press conference and you  had one or more FBI agents come out and say: ``Hey, we found these  emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop weeks ago, and Comey refused to  reopen the investigation''; that would have doomed her election far  worse than what happened.   So what, under the circumstances, was the best thing that Comey could  do for his friend Hillary Clinton? It was to get out ahead of anybody  disclosing that they had been sitting on the thought-to-be-lost emails  and say: We have got them.   Then, as I had said back at the time, well, we will find out how  serious Comey is. If he comes back within 2 or 3 days and says they  have examined all 30,000 or so, whatever, of the emails, then we will  know that this was just a charade to cover for Hillary Clinton, because  they are not going to be able to adequately research all of those  emails in just a matter of 2 or 3 days.   He came back very quickly, so that it would not affect the election  coming up, and announced: No. Clean bill of health. We looked at all  the new evidence. Nothing was there.   Except they still didn't bother to use the information provided by  the intelligence community that was available. They didn't pick it up,  didn't do anything with what was disclosed.   I am telling you, I am very grateful we have people working in this  government who want to protect the United States and want to protect  the United States' people. They don't get a lot of credit, usually  don't get any credit, but they do a good job for this country; and my  head and my heart and my salute go out to them as we deal with the mess  that has been created by those with far more selfish motives.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
