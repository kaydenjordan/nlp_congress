 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 150th  anniversary of the town of Island Falls, ME. As one who was born and  raised in Aroostook County, it is a great pleasure to celebrate the  generations of industrious and caring people who have made Island Falls  such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.   Incorporated on February 27, 1872, Island Falls is a small town with  a rich history. For thousands of years, the west branch of the  Mattawamkeag River was the hunting grounds of the Micmac and Maliseet  Native American Tribes. Permanent settlement began in earnest when the  long-disputed border between the Aroostook region of Maine and British  New Brunswick finally was determined in 1842.   The early settlers created a vibrant community. They cleared farmland  and, with the river and falls providing power, established lumber and  grain mills. The first school, built in 1859, also served as a church  and meeting house.   With the river, pristine lakes, and spectacular views of Mt.  Katahdin, Island Falls has long been a paradise for outdoor  enthusiasts. With William Sewell, the son of one of the first settlers  as his guide, young Theodore Roosevelt often visited Island Falls to  hunt, fish, hike, and canoe. Bible Point State Historic Site marks the  location where the future President would sit in quiet contemplation on  his Sunday mornings in Maine.   Today, Island Falls is a premier four-season destination for outdoor  recreation. In addition to the activities Theodore Roosevelt enjoyed,  it is an ideal place for golf, leaf-peeping, star-gazing, and, with an  extensive network of well-groomed trails, snowmobiling.   Island Falls is a town of patriots, and a park pays tribute to those  who have defended our nation. Among them is Pvt. George F. Robinson,  who served with the Maine Eighth Regiment in the Civil War.   While recovering from wounds received in battle, Pvt. Robinson was  reassigned as an attendant to Secretary of State William Seward. On the  night of April 14, 1865, as the assassination of President Lincoln was  being carried out, a coconspirator entered the Seward home and attacked  the Secretary with a knife. Pvt. Robinson fought off the attacker and,  despite his own stab wounds, helped render the first aid that saved  Secretary Seward's life. This Maine hero rose to the rank of major and  was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. In 1965, on the centennial of  this act of valor, the Maine Legislature renamed Robinson Mountain in  his honor.   The celebration of Island Falls' 150th anniversary is not about the  passing of time, but about human accomplishment. We celebrate the  people who pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great  community. Thanks to those who came before, Island Falls, ME, has a  wonderful history. Thanks to those there today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________
