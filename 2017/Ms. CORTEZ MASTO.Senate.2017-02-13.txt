 Mr. President, I rise today, along with many of my  colleagues, to speak out against the White House nominating Steven  Mnuchin to be the next Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. President Trump  has nominated the former CEO of OneWest Bank--who before that for 17  years was a Goldman Sachs executive--to run the Federal agency tasked  with crafting and implementing U.S. economic policy. So much for  draining the swamp.   I want to start, however, by sharing the story of a good friend, Lola  Orvik, whom I met when I was attorney general of Nevada.   In 2013, Lola's mortgage on her townhouse in Henderson was  underwater. Like thousands of other Nevadans, she needed to refinance,  but five different loan modification applications had all been rejected  by her bank. Lola was desperate for a solution and on the verge of  losing her home. She received a telephone call offering help that was  too good to be true, and it was. After calling my office, she  thankfully discovered that it was a scam. I am so glad she called my  office. Our staff referred her to a new program we had created, the  Home Again Homeowner Relief Program. It is a one-stop shop to help  struggling homeowners. It helped Lola finally get a loan modification,  reduce her principal by $37,000, slash her interest rate from 5.7  percent to 2 percent, and keep the house she had lived in for nearly 20  years.   The Home Again Program helped thousands of Nevada homeowners  understand all the State and Federal housing resources available to  them. It has helped folks like Lola restructure their loans to ensure  more affordable monthly payments. That simple hotline number has gone a  long way.   Because we were there to help her, Lola got her life back. However,  not everyone was as fortunate as Lola. In fact, some families are still  trying to overcome the continuing destructive impact of the foreclosure  crisis in Nevada and across this country.   In the depths of the great recession, Lola's predicament was not  unique. Nevada was ground zero for the housing crisis. Property values  plummeted. ``For sale'' signs lined the streets. Foreclosure notices  hung on doors throughout the State. Thousands of families lived in  constant fear of losing their homes.   In 2008, Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation, with  more than 77,000 homes getting a notice at the door saying they were at  risk for eviction. We led the Nation in the terms of foreclosure rate  for 62 straight months during the recession.   Things got so bad that by 2010, nearly 70 percent of Nevada  homeowners were underwater on their homes, meaning  [[Page S1118]]  that they owed more on their mortgages than the current value of their  property.   As Nevada's attorney general, I fought the big banks, Wall Street  institutions, and default servicing companies to secure more than $1.9  billion to help hard-working families get back on their feet. That  money helped to fund the Home Again Program.   More than just getting that money back, this was about changing the  conduct and predatory practices of the big banks when working with  homeowners. For instance, we made dual tracking an illegal practice so  that banks could no longer foreclosure on a home while simultaneously  considering their request for a loan modification and then charging  them fees every step of the way. We demanded that a homeowner have a  single point of contact within the financial institution so the  homeowner would no longer get shuffled around from person to person and  told to resubmit their loan modification application over and over  again. We demanded that the banks demonstrate that they had personal  knowledge of the foreclosure documents they filed to prevent robo- signing and unlawful foreclosures of a home.   Unfortunately, not every bank was willing to do everything possible  to help the millions of Nevadans and Americans who were suffering. Mr.  Mnuchin's OneWest Bank--formally known as IndyMac--was one such bank.  Instead of trying to help homeowners, OneWest enforced predatory and  unforgiving practices that only served to line the pockets of Mr.  Mnuchin and his co-owners.   Steven Mnuchin purchased IndyMac from the Federal Government after it  collapsed and took control of the thousands of mortgages the bank  managed. Mnuchin rebranded the bank as OneWest and went to work using  questionable foreclosure practices, like dual tracking, so he could  make more money. That is not right.   Instead of working to help these homeowners stay in their homes,  OneWest Bank, under Mnuchin's leadership, became a foreclosure machine.  The bank had one of the highest denial rates for applications to the  Home Affordable Modification Program. A judge in Wisconsin cited  OneWest's ``harsh, repugnant, shocking, and repulsive'' practices when  deciding a suit against them. Recent documents show that the company  used robo-signing to deny modification claims, proving that it did not  fairly consider loan modification applications for tens of thousands of  homeowners.   When confronted with these facts at his Senate confirmation hearing,  Mr. Mnuchin lied. He denied that OneWest used robo-signing, offered  empty excuses, and shifted blame for his company's heinous practices.  And during his confirmation hearing, Mr. Mnuchin repeatedly refused to  say how many homes OneWest foreclosed on in Nevada.   However, according to new data, during the foreclosure crisis and its  immediate aftermath, OneWest made $3 billion in profit while evicting  3,654 Nevada families from their homes. This includes 181 foreclosures  on seniors who had taken out reverse mortgages. When he eventually left  the bank, Mr. Mnuchin received a $10.9 million payout. This is on top  of the annual compensation of $4.5 million he has received since 2015,  when OneWest was bought by other investors. Let me repeat that. Some  3,654 Nevada families lost their homes because Mr. Mnuchin's OneWest  put profits over people. That is a snapshot and a statistic which does  not do justice to how much pain that caused for those families.   I want to spend some time on these accusations of robo-signing, both  because Mr. Mnuchin clearly lied and also because this was an issue I  took on when I was attorney general during and after the crash.   First, let's be clear what this is. Robo-signing is a procedure used  by mortgage companies to sign foreclosure documents without reviewing  them. This is a reckless practice used by banks to cut corners and  forge documents, to rush things along, and it caused thousands of  families to be wrongfully evicted from their homes.   Like OneWest, the banks were involved in a massive robo-signing  scheme in my home State of Nevada, and I went after them aggressively  as the State's attorney general. Nevada led the Nation in foreclosures  every month for more than 4 years.   Mr. Mnuchin's company did not care that middle-class families were  losing their homes during the crisis. In fact, during his confirmation  hearing before the Senate, he admitted:         I never wanted to be in the mortgage servicing business. I       didn't want to be in the reverse mortgage business, I wanted       to build a regional bank.    In other words, Mr. Mnuchin had to convince his investors that they  would make money--a point that Mr. Mnuchin admitted at the hearing,  saying: ``Yes, my investors made a lot of money on OneWest.''   Not only did his investors make a lot of money, Mr. Mnuchin did so as  well. Since leaving the bank, he has pocketed nearly $20 million. Mr.  Mnuchin was making millions, while thousands of Nevadans were losing  their homes and their dignity, Nevadans like Heather McCreary of  Sparks, who came to Capitol Hill last month to share her heart- wrenching story of how she applied to OneWest for a loan modification  in 2010 after she and her husband lost their jobs as a result of the  financial crisis. Despite three applications and following all  instructions, the bank kept Heather's family dangling and then suddenly  foreclosed on their home. I want to read some of Heather's testimony.  It is moving and heartbreaking and deserves to be heard by every Member  of this body.   Here is what she told us at the hearing:         In 2008, when the economy started to get worse, I was laid       off. The following year, in 2009, my husband Jack was laid       off too. Though Jack was able to find another job pretty       fast, he had to take a big pay cut--from about $25 an hour to       $8.50 an hour. Between the cut in Jack's pay and the loss in       income I experienced when going on unemployment insurance       benefits after I got laid off, we were pinched and we were       drowning financially.        However, we were determined to keep our dream home, so Jack       and I were tenacious about doing whatever we could to get       help. We sought help from the Hope Now Alliance, which is an       alliance of HUD-approved counselors who provide free       foreclosure help, and from the Washoe County Senior Law       Project.        We worked side-by-side with both organizations to do       everything required of us by our mortgage servicer IndyMac,       which later became OneWest. When we first asked for help,       OneWest gave us a short forbearance and allowed us to make a       smaller payment for several months with the goal of a       reduction in our monthly mortgage payments through the Home       Affordable Modification Program (or HAMP).        By applying for the HAMP program, we thought we were back       on the road to keeping our home. We complied 100 percent with       OneWest requirements for HAMP--we were incredibly nervous       about being able to keep our house, so we were extremely       careful to make sure we did everything we could to keep the       process going forward. Our application for HAMP was processed       and we were approved for our modification. I sent in the       signed paperwork and the first payment under the modified       payment amount along with it.        But then the process started to fall apart. After a whole       30 days, OneWest returned our personal check and told us that       only certified checks would be accepted, so they were now       voiding the modification offer. We had followed the       instructions to the letter on OneWest paperwork, crossing our       ``T''s and dotting our ``I''s. But in the end, this didn't       matter--and OneWest's rejection of our HAMP application put       us on the road to foreclosure.        We applied two more times for loan modifications over the       next six months because we were given assurances by people at       OneWest that they would approve our application. We again       complied with every request OneWest made of us, taking care       to send in extra documents whenever OneWest requested them.        But as far as I can tell, OneWest never attempted to       process the loan modification. The foreclosure went through       and we lost our home on September 10, 2010. The foreclosure       left us without a home; and finding a new rental was       extremely difficult because of our credit. Juggling the       demands of raising our twins was so hard--the foreclosure       even meant that our kids had to miss school. Eventually we       did find a new place, but we had to pay an outrageous rent,       even though it was not a good home for us at all.        It's hard to explain the shame, embarrassment, and grief       that Jack and I felt. I've cried a river of tears over this.       I really didn't think we were asking too much: We wanted to       hang on to our home for the sake of our kids, and we did       everything we could to stay in our home. And while I will       probably never know exactly what OneWest did, the outcome of       my story proves that Steve Mnuchin's company had no interest       in helping us. They wanted to foreclose because they were       focused on their profits.    Heather's story is just one of thousands that highlight just how  wrong  [[Page S1119]]  Mr. Mnuchin is to be our next Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The  Treasury Department has the vital mission of promoting the conditions  that enable economic growth, stability, job opportunities, and the  ability to buy a car or own a home. Their actions directly affect the  lives of every American.   Our next Treasury Secretary should have a proven record of fighting  to expand economic opportunities for everyone. That is what Americans  deserve. Yet, from where I stand, Mr. Mnuchin falls far short of that  test.   President Trump's choice of Mr. Mnuchin to lead the U.S. Treasury is  a slap in the face for Nevada families like Heather's. Her story makes  it crystal clear: This is not someone who will be looking out for  working people when he implements our Nation's economic policy.   In many ways, President Trump's unfortunate choice of someone like  Mr. Mnuchin should not surprise us because in 2006 the President said  he ``sort of hoped'' the real estate market would tank, and in 2007 he  said he was ``excited'' for the housing market crash. The motive was  the same: profits.   We cannot afford to return to the misguided policies that brought us  to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Families  cannot afford to lose their homes again. But that is exactly what we  can expect if Stephen Mnuchin is confirmed as President Trump's  Treasury Secretary.   When I ran for the Senate, I promised Nevadans that I would fight for  them, that I would stand up for them and be their voice here in  Washington. Today, I am that voice, and that is why I rise with my  colleagues in opposition to the ``Foreclosure King,'' Mr. Mnuchin.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
