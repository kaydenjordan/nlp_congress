 Mr. President, may I ask the Presiding Officer to remind  us of rule XIX.    Mr. President, I will be very quick. I understand we have  work to do on the Defense authorization and the vote coming up, but I  am glad the majority leader is on the floor, and I am glad so many  Members are on the floor.   We have a problem in this institution of the uneven enforcement of  rule XIX, and it is hurting this body.   I have just by happenstance been on the floor for various violations  being called by the Presiding Officer, usually with the advice of the  Parliamentarian. It is very clear to me that the rules are not being  applied equally to each party, and I think that is something we are  going to have to wrestle with if we are going to continue to be worthy  of the moniker ``the world's greatest deliberative body.''
