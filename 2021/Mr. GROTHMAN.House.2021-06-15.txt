 Madam Speaker, we are back here after 3 weeks in our  districts, and I think our minds should probably be on the border and  the thousands of people--tens of thousands of people streaming across  every month, or perhaps on the economic problems caused by higher  inflation. But, instead, there was a few brief statements made by one  of our prominent TV anchors that causes me to feel I have to speak  tonight.   While we were gone, we celebrated both Memorial Day and the hundreds  of thousands of American soldiers who have died for our freedoms. We  celebrated another anniversary of D-day, the landing in Europe. And  when we think about Memorial Day, we can't help but remember other  names of battles during World War II: Okinawa, Iwo Jima, the Battle of  the Midway, the Battle of the Bulge, as well as all the soldiers who  died fighting the communists in Vietnam and Korea.   It is a time for superlatives talking about the heroic efforts of  these great men and women.   Unfortunately, on a formerly major network, NBC or MSNBC, Brian  Williams decided to compare or supposedly compliment all of our brave  troops by comparing them to people who fight under the most evil banner  I think that has existed, or one of the two most evil banners that has  existed in the last 100 years, and that is the banner of antifa.                                time  1945    Antifa is an organization. If we had their flag here before us, it is  virtually identical to the flag used by the communists in the early  1920s in Nazi Germany. The socialist flag at the time, the communist  flag, allied with the Soviet Union, which at the time millions of  people were dying as they adjusted to life without the czar and life  under communism.   The Soviet armies were soon responsible for killing millions and  millions of Ukrainians as they guarded the food so the kulaks would  starve to death, the communist armies that in Red China caused tens of  millions of deaths, the communist armies in Cambodia, these countries  with their anti-God philosophy, proud in Red China when the final  Christian churches were closed.   Of all things, to compare our troops at D-day with antifa, I cannot  imagine a greater insult to give these soldiers. I wish more of them  were still alive so they could respond to seeing on television a TV  anchor trying to compare them--these brave men to keep the world free-- to compare them to antifa, a group whose flag is almost identical to  the communist flag.   By the way, it is not surprising that we have a red flag for Nazi  Germany and a red flag for the Soviet Union. Red at the time stood for  socialism.   Our young children should be educated on the comparisons between the  two. During the 1920s, there were times when both ideologies entered  into joint strikes because they both wanted to get rid of what existed  of a free country in Germany at the time.   We would like to hear from NBC. Shame on you, NBC, the once-proud  network. Would you respond to the statements by Brian Williams  comparing the men who died at D-day, the men who landed on European  soil to free Europe? Will you respond to your anchor implying they were  the equivalent of antifa, a group connected with communism? Shame on  that once-proud number one network in America. What do you think of  what you have done?   The next issue I would like to comment on that I heard about again  and again when I was back is an issue that is not surprising. To a  certain extent, some of the policies of the past are responsible for  this, but recently, we have had a new round of checks go out, a greater  increase in the money supply, both M1 and M2.   Not surprising, when the government prints money, we see an increase  in the amount of gasoline, an increase in food prices led by an  increase in soybeans, an increase in lumber, and massive increases in  homebuilding.  [[Page H2813]]    I am scared to death for the younger generation as a new economic  ideology seems to have taken over in which there is a feeling that you  can spend yourself into prosperity. When I look at the degree to which  housing costs have skyrocketed within the last year, it is perhaps not  surprising, given the degree to which money is being printed. But it is  going to be much more difficult for a young couple to buy that first  house today compared to 12 years ago.   It is important that everybody in this Chamber sit back and question  the idea that is being approved by the Federal Reserve that America can  become wealthier just by printing money. America will not become  wealthier by printing money. America will have inflation, and that  inflation will strike hardest at commodity prices and hardest at  housing.   So everybody in this Chamber, before we vote for any more spending  bills, ought to look at the rather boring charts of M1 and M2 as we  analyze the money supply and look at the cost of all commodities over  the last year as this Chamber has decided that the way to create  prosperity is to print more money.   I do feel it is also important to address one more time the crisis at  the border and the variety of bad things happening because of that  crisis and not caring like we did only a few months ago as to who  crosses the border.   I don't think we have spent enough time addressing the drug crisis in  America. It has been around so long, it becomes boring even to think  about it. Except recently, we hit the point at which 90,000 Americans  had died of drug overdoses in a 12-month period.   When I talk to people at the border or my local drug enforcement  administration, they both agree that this is in part happening because  more drugs are coming across the border. In part, it is predictable  that more drugs are coming across the border because it is easier to  get across the border. More people are crossing the border. But even  more so, as marijuana becomes legalized in the country, it is no longer  profitable to bring marijuana across the southern border.   I heard an anecdote of a significant amount of marijuana coming  across the border, and the people who owned it couldn't sell it.  Because the marijuana produced by the now-legalized agriculture  operations in the United States--not surprisingly, because we now do  genetic engineering, that sort of thing--the marijuana produced in the  United States in States like Colorado and Washington is superior to the  marijuana brought across the Mexican border.   Well, if the Mexican drug cartels cannot make money selling marijuana  or bringing marijuana across the border, how are they going to make it  up? They are going to make it up by bringing more and more dangerous  drugs--meth, cocaine, heroin, but above all, fentanyl. They are going  to bring more and more fentanyl across the southern border. Now, we  have 90,000 deaths in this country in 1 year.   A little bit of my district touches Milwaukee County, not a huge  county, by nationwide standards, about a million people. Last year, 540  people died of drug overdoses in Milwaukee County. There were about 200  murders, which is the all-time record, and everybody couldn't believe  200 murders. There were over 500 illegal overdoses.   Now, what do we do about that? Well, clearly, one of the things we  have to do is we have to prevent these drugs from coming into the  country in the first place. It is disappointing that we put the  security of the border on the back burner and think of excuses not to  deal with it.   But in addition to thinking of all the people running across the  border, take a minute to think about the 90,000 people, many very young  people, dying primarily of fentanyl but also other illegal drug  overdoses, and ask yourself: What is this body going to do to stop it?    Of course, other problems are at the border. We have gone from  checking in or touching about 17,000 people a month to 180,000 people a  month. As far as got-aways, people who aren't even checked in, our  Border Patrol estimates we have gone from about 6,000 this time last  year to about 30,000 now--just massive increases.   I would guess between got-aways and people who are checked into the  country, we are looking at 60,000 or 70,000 a month instead of under  10,000 a month at this time last year. It is truly a crisis.   Quite frankly, this body ought to be doing nothing else but dealing  with that crisis until it is solved. The fact that we had under 10,000  people crossing the border only 4 or 5 months ago shows it is not  something we don't know how to solve or that it is impossible to solve.  It is that we are willingly allowing a massive increase across the  border.   Of course, that massive increase, since the drug cartels charge  people to come here, also increases the power of those drug cartels,  both in the United States and their country. It, to a degree, results  in separation of children from their families, as unaccompanied  children come here, as well as a given number of children are probably  rented by people to come here because they know supposed intact  families have a better chance of being allowed in this country than  single people, who are still frequently turned around.   In any event, there is a brief summary of issues. I hope I was  enjoyable. And I hope NBC will let us know what they were thinking when  Brian Williams decided to say that our soldiers landing on D-day were  like antifa.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
