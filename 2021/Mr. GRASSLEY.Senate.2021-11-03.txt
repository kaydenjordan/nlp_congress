 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Lankford for  letting me take 3 minutes to honor an Iowan who recently passed away, a  former Member of the House of Representatives. And I think there is  only one other United States Senator who would know who I am talking  about, and this would be Senator Schumer, who served with this former  Member of Congress from 1981 to 1995.                            Remembering Neal Smith    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to former  Iowa Congressman Neal Smith, who passed away yesterday at the age of  101.   He was a true public servant. He entered public life for the right  reasons and had no interest in self-promotion. He cared about Iowa and  tried to do his best for our State, and he did.   Neal Smith was a humble but impressive man. He was a decorated bomber  pilot in World War II. After attending Drake University Law School with  his wife, Bea, and opening a practice with her, he became active in  local government.   In 1958, Neal Smith was elected to the House of Representatives,  where he served for 36 years. That is longer than any other Iowan has  served in the House of Representatives.   When I was first elected to Congress as the only Republican in the  Iowa delegation, Neal Smith forgot about politics and was a mentor to  me. I have never forgotten that. I try to follow his example. We worked  in a bipartisan way on behalf of the people in Iowa, just as it should  be.   I remember Congressman Smith as a real defender of agriculture, small  [[Page S7707]]  business, as a great Iowan, and as a good friend.   Barbara and I extend our condolences to his family. They will be in  my prayers.   I yield the floor and thank Senator Lankford.    Mr. President, it was a pleasure to work on this  legislation with Senator Klobuchar, so we joined forces--it happens to  turn out that there are 10 of our Senate colleagues--in a bipartisan  way to introduce this legislation that we call the American Innovation  and Choice Online Act.   This bill has garnered support from all sides of the political  spectrum and, of course, is a very commonsense measure, which is meant  to increase competition on dominant digital platforms.   Today, there are only a handful of dominant companies that control  what Americans can buy, what they hear, and what they say online.   Big Tech has powers over the economy that we haven't seen in  generations or perhaps ever, and this power grows even larger, taking  over yet more of our daily lives. With this power, Big Tech is able to  pick winners and losers on their platforms.   The goal of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act is to  ensure that Big Tech can be held accountable when they engage in a  discriminatory and anticompetitive manner.   This legislation sets clear rules that businesses on dominant  platforms must follow. This will help promote competition by targeting  harmful conduct, while ensuring that innovation and pro-consumer  conduct is protected.   I want to be clear. Big Tech platforms offer great products to their  consumers. This isn't about breaking up companies or penalizing them  for being successful. This is about ensuring that small businesses have  a fair and even playing field when utilizing a dominant online  platform.   I also want to address many of the falsehoods that have been spread  by the opponents of this legislation. Nothing in this bill will require  a company to shut down their marketplace or prevent those companies  from selling their own branded politics.   Also, nothing prevents a search company from showing maps or answer  boxes in their search results. And, also, cellular phones can be sold  with preinstalled apps. This bill simply sets clear, effective rules to  protect competition and users doing business on dominant online  platforms.   I am a strong believer in the free market. The United States is still  the greatest country in the world for starting and growing businesses.  But Big Tech is making it more difficult for small businesses to  realize success on these dominant platforms. So with this legislation,  Congress must update our laws to keep up with the growing and evolving  online ecosystem.   Big Tech has the power to determine when and what we can buy, see,  and say online. Big Tech also has the power to destroy companies, small  and large, by denying them access to consumers and even to the internet  itself.   It is time that we ensure there is effective antitrust enforcement so  the American people can take the power back from these Big Tech giants.   I want to again thank Senator Klobuchar for her work with me on this  legislation. I also want to thank all of my colleagues from both sides  of the aisle who have joined in cosponsoring this legislation.   In the House of Representatives, we have Congressmen Cicilline and  Buck, who introduced a similar bill earlier this year, which has  already been marked up and passed out of the House Judiciary Committee.   The American Innovation and Choice Online Act is a bipartisan,  bicameral bill, and I hope that we can move it forward so we end up  bringing real, positive change to the benefit of all Americans.   I yield the floor and thank Senator Klobuchar once again.
