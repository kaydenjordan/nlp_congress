 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6751, the Banking  Transparency for Sanctioned Persons Act, which is a commonsense  reporting requirement that will allow our Congress to better oversee  financial sanctions against state sponsors of terrorism, human rights  abusers, and perpetrators of corruption around the world.   This bill is simple but important. Every 180 days, the Treasury  Department would be required to send Congress a report with two sets of  information. The first is a copy of any license issued by Treasury's  Office of Foreign Assets Control that authorizes a financial  institution to provide services benefitting a state sponsor of  terrorism--such as Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan--that would  otherwise be prohibited.                                time  1830    Second, Treasury would have to provide a list of any foreign banks  that conduct significant transactions for persons we have sanctioned  for serious human rights abuses and corruption, a group that includes  Russian Government officials behind the imprisonment and death of  Sergei Magnitsky, Burmese military officers responsible for ethnic  cleansing, and individuals in Latin America responsible for beating and  killing of peaceful protesters.   Such a report would be a tremendous asset for Congress, and sharing  this kind of information with Congress should be automatic, because  licenses represent exemptions to our sanction programs. Some of those  exemptions may be controversial, while others may enjoy broad support.  The point is that congressional oversight of sanctions is limited  without visibility into transactions Treasury is authorizing.   As for foreign banks' dealings with perpetrators of corruption and  human rights abuses, Congress can use this information not only to  better oversee existing sanctions, but to design a more effective  program in the future.   Some of the questions we can begin to answer by having greater  awareness of sanctioned persons' access to foreign financial services  include: Are foreign banks exposing themselves to money laundering risk  or facilitating activities that run counter to our national interests?  And should our diplomats be exerting stronger pressure on those banks'  governments in order to cut off bad actors?   Finally, I would like to note that we have been very deliberate in  ensuring that the reporting required by this bill is as easy to  administer as possible because we don't want to impose reporting  requirements that could keep Treasury from the day-to-day work of  designating bad actors. Therefore, this is a twice-a-year submission  that entails no analysis and no narrative. It is as straightforward as  scanning licenses and assembling a list to Treasury that that they  already have components of, after which we could then follow up with  questions in hearings, briefings, and the like.   I would like to thank the chairman for his support on this bill and  thank all the members of the Financial Services Committee on both sides  of the aisle for supporting this.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6751.
