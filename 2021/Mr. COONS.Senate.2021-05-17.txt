 Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to honor  William ``Bill'' Allen, Jr., local business leader, community activist,  author, and friend, for his tremendous contributions to Delaware and  the growth and success of our communities.   If you have ever met Bill Allen, you will know he has a wonderful  smile that will grab your attention when you walk in the room and will  get you smiling as well. Bill is also serious about continuing to make  important strides in inspiring and bettering our State. Throughout his  extensive career in the collections solutions industry, Bill was often  the first or most senior African American in his organizations. Bill  consistently reached new levels and set important precedents, led  change, and inspired young African Americans. The knowledge and  experience Bill gained throughout his career in the collections  solutions industry led him to start his own company, ALW Sourcing LLC,  a collections and customer contact solutions business that he leads  with a wealth of knowledge, entrepreneurship, and industry experience.   In 2000, Bill and his wife, Dr. Kim Allen, founded A Friend of the  Family, Inc., AFOF, a Delaware-based incubator for alternative learning  programs. AFOF provides students with learning differences and  behavioral challenges the tools and lessons necessary to overcome  personal, environmental, and socioeconomic challenges. Under their  leadership, the organization strengthens and empowers our community.  The success of AFOF led Bill to be featured in Business Week, the  Baltimore Business Journal, and JET Magazine.   He and Dr. Allen also teamed up to coauthor a book, ``It Flows  Through Us,'' which describes how working hard and giving back can  generate success and happiness. When writing the book, Bill focused on  making it accessible to all people so that it could be used in the  minority- and women-owned business enterprise revolution. He also  participates in this revolution through the multiple seminars he  conducts yearly to increase individuals' understanding of business,  diversity, leadership, motivation, and success. Bill's knowledge  initiatives empower and inspire people to make positive changes that  will improve lives across communities.   Bill served as the board chair of the African American Empowerment  Fund, AAEFD, at Delaware Community Foundation and as a board member for  the nonprofit charity Friends of Hockessin Colored School #107, FOHCS.  During his time as chair, he led the fund to provide $100,000 to the  Hockessin Colored School #107, a historic school that played a role in  a groundbreaking court case that became part of the landmark Supreme  Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education. A student at the school  was a plaintiff in the 1952 Delaware Court of Chancery case Belton  (Bulah) v. Gebhart, which was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court  jointly with Brown v. Board. Thanks to the funding that Bill helped  secure, the historic school is now being transformed into a center for  diversity training, inclusion, and social equity. Its legacy will  continue and its purpose has been reignited.   In my remarks at the reintroduction ceremony for this school, I  stated that in order to change our future, we must confront our past.  It is my firm belief that Mr. Allen's commitments to our community and  the revitalization of the Hockessin Colored School have played an  important role in this mission and the growth and inclusivity of our  State.   In both business and community involvement, all of Bill's  accomplishments led to his induction into the Delaware Business Leaders  Hall of Fame in 2020 as one of the first African-American inductees.  This honor was awarded to him by the Leadership Council of Junior  Achievement of Delaware, which recognized his influence as a business  role model to the students whom the organization serves. I believe that  this is a fitting testament to the great work Bill has done for our  State.   Mr. President, Bill has made invaluable contributions to Delawareans.  He has used his knowledge and experience to invest in a wide array of  communities and inspire hundreds of citizens. He is well respected for  such contributions and this recognition is well deserved.   Bill Allen, on behalf of all you have supported and inspired  throughout your career, please accept our sincere gratitude. Thank you  for your unwavering commitment to the Delaware community and for your  dedication to your work that has brought about change, set important  firsts, and inspired others. Thank you.                            ____________________
