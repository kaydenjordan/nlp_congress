 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1107, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 908) condemning all forms of anti-Asian  sentiment as related to COVID-19, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 908.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, a resolution  condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19.   Among other things, the resolution, introduced by my colleague from  New York, Representative Grace Meng, calls upon all public officials to  condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, and it calls on Federal law  enforcement officials to investigate and document all credible reports  of hate crimes against Asian Americans, to collect data on the rise of  hate crimes incidents due to COVID-19, and to hold perpetrators  accountable.   The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing crisis for our country. Over 6.6  million Americans have been infected, and almost 200,000 have died from  COVID-19. It has upended the lives of almost every American in some  way, and it will continue to do so for some time as we brace for a  potential second wave of infections.   On top of bearing the burdens that the pandemic has imposed on all  Americans, Asian Americans have been forced to carry the added anxiety  of confronting racial prejudice, including racially motivated  harassment and violence stemming from the stigma that has unfairly  associated them with COVID-19 because of the virus' origin in China, a  stigma that has been reinforced by rhetoric suggesting such a link.   According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, since  March 19, there have been almost 2,600 cases of anti-Asian  discrimination related to COVID-19.   According to the resolution, at the pandemic's earliest stage in this  country, between February 9 and March 7, there were over 400 such  incidents. These include the stabbings of an Asian-American father and  two young children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas.   Public health entities, including the World Health Organization and  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have recognized that  labeling a virus by geographic or ethnic terms unfairly stigmatizes  certain communities and ultimately harms public health. For this  reason, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar rightly  condemned the use of the phrase ``Chinese virus'' in testimony before  the Ways and Means Committee, stating that: ``Ethnicity it is not what  causes the novel coronavirus.''   It is incumbent on all public figures, including elected officials  like us, to publicly condemn bigotry and the stigmatization of racial  or ethnic groups unfairly targeted for blame. We must speak out clearly  against such attitudes and acts of hate whenever they occur, but  particularly in the face of public panic or fear during a national  emergency, when society can be especially vulnerable to racist appeals  and prejudices.   While many public figures have admirably sought to end COVID-19- related animosity, some, unfortunately, appear not to share the same  sense of moral duty. Rather than using their bully pulpits to confront  prejudice and racial hatred, they have instead chosen repeatedly to use  derogatory and prejudicial phrases and remarks, reinforcing the  exclusion and stigmatization of Asian Americans in the face of a  national crisis, a tactic that sadly has a long and ugly history in our  country.   Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric has, in the past, led to grave  injustices like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of  Japanese Americans during World War II.   In the year 2020, condemning bigotry and racial scapegoating should  not be hard for any Member of this House to do. It is long past time to  leave the days of yellow peril hysteria and unjustified blame of the  other behind.   The House can take an important step in that direction by passing H.  Res. 908 unanimously. I urge strong support for this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Kim).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Hawaii (Mr. Case).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Cisneros).     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the import of this resolution could not be more clear.  Anti-Asian sentiment will not be tolerated. Anti-Semitism will not be  tolerated. Discrimination against anyone will not be tolerated.   When language comes consistently from the White House, from other  places that stoke anti-Asian sentiment, that stoke racism, this cannot  be tolerated. And this House must declare that we will not tolerate it.   This House must be on record against the use of language designed to  stoke racism, against the use of language designed to pick out a  particular ethnic group--in this case Asians, but it is the same as if  it picked out a different ethnic group.   No ethnic group should be the target of such obloquy, of such racism,  of such opposition from the White House. None.   It is unconscionable that we have to stand here and oppose the White  House stoking anti-Asian sentiment. It is unconscionable that the White  House would do such a thing. But if it does such a thing, then it is  incumbent on this House to denounce it.   It is incumbent on this House to make sure that the American people  know that we do not stand with anyone, whether in the White House or  anyplace else, who stokes deliberately anti-Asian sentiment.   We cannot abide, we must not abide, the use of public office, the use  of public facilities, the use of the public microphone to stoke anti- Asian sentiment, no more than we would tolerate it if it were stoking  anti-Black sentiment or anti-Semitic sentiment.   None of this is tolerable. We must not permit this.   So, I say again, it cannot be allowed that, on the floor of this  House, we do not denounce the use of public resources, the use of the  White House, the use of public resources to stoke anti-Asian sentiment.    I yield to the gentleman from Ohio for a question.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   They learned their lesson. They stopped using such terms. They  learned their lesson.   They understood what this House should understand. They understood  that the use of such terms stokes racism, stokes anti-Asian sentiment,  and they stopped using the term because they learned the lesson.   All we are saying is the White House should learn the same lesson,  and they should stop using the term. And for that matter, Members of  this House should stop using the term because it deliberately stokes  anti-Asian sentiment.   The Washington Post learned that lesson and ceased using such terms.  The Washington Post learned the lesson.   We are not saying that everyone knew this initially, but it is clear.  It is now clear.   The Washington Post learned its lesson and stopped using such terms.  The New York Times learned its lesson when they realized that it was  stoking anti-Asian sentiment and stopped using this term.   We are saying that the White House and Members of this House and  anyone else should learn the same lesson and not stoke anti-Asian  sentiment by continuing the use of terms that we know stoke anti-Asian  sentiment.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Bera).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this is an important resolution that will put the  House firmly on record against the insidious  [[Page H4507]]  form of racism and racial scapegoating that we have seen since the  COVID-19 pandemic began.   It is completely unacceptable to use derogatory and prejudicial  terms, like ``Chinese virus'' or ``Wuhan virus,'' as if they merely  describe the factual reality of where the novel coronavirus that causes  COVID-19 originated.   First, this logic does nothing to justify the use of the term ``kung  flu,'' another term often used by some to describe COVID-19, a term  clearly designed to mock Asians and to associate them unfairly with  this disease.   Madam Speaker, the need for this legislation is clear. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pregnancy is not a disability, but  sometimes pregnant workers need an easy fix, such as a stool or an  extra bathroom break, to stay on the job.   These accommodations are short in duration and typically cost very  little to provide, but they can mean the difference between keeping  your job or putting your pregnancy at risk. But for as long as women  have been in the workforce, instead of being accommodated, they have  been fired or forced out on leave when they become pregnant.   These policies have become even more pronounced during the COVID-19  pandemic. We have seen a wave of employers firing pregnant workers  rather than finding ways for them to safely return to work.   These policies, as they too often do, are falling disproportionately  on women of color and low-wage, hourly workers who suddenly find  themselves without a paycheck, without health insurance, and pregnant  in the middle of a global pandemic.   The bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will fix how pregnancy  accommodation is treated under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.   Courts have said that employers must provide an accommodation to a  pregnant employee if they accommodate nonpregnant employees similar in  their inability or ability to work. That means pregnant workers must  have perfect knowledge of the medical and employment histories of every  other employee in their workplace, which is nearly impossible.   In fact, a recent study by A Better Balance found that in over two- thirds of cases, courts denied an accommodation because pregnant  workers could not meet this test.   I include in the Record a letter in support of this bill from A  Better Balance.                                                 September 11, 2020.      Re The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694).        Dear Representative: On behalf of A Better Balance, I write       to express our strong support for the Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act (``PWFA''; H.R. 2694). This legislation will       ensure pregnant workers, particularly low-income workers and       women of color, are not forced to choose between their       paycheck and a healthy pregnancy. The bill will require       employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant       workers unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the       employer, similar to the accommodation standard already in       place for workers with disabilities.        Nearly forty-two years after the passage of the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act, pregnant workers still face rampant       discrimination on the job and treatment as second-class       citizens, as I explained in detail in my Congressional       testimony before the House Education & Labor Civil Rights and       Human Services Subcommittee in October 2019 as well as A       Better Balance's May 2019 report, Long Overdue. We urge you       to support healthy pregnancies, protect pregnant workers'       livelihoods, and end the systemic devaluation of women of       color and vote YES on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and       NO on any Motion to Recommit in connection with this       legislation.        A Better Balance is a national non-profit legal       organization that advocates for women and families so they       can care for themselves and their loved ones without       sacrificing their financial security. Since our founding, we       have seen day in and day out the injustices that pregnant       workers continue to face because they need modest, temporary       pregnancy accommodations and have led the movement at the       federal, state, and local level to ensure pregnant workers       can receive the accommodations they need to remain healthy       and working. As I wrote in my 2012 Op-Ed in The New York       Times ``Pregnant and Pushed Out of Job,'' which sparked the       PWFA's introduction in Congress, ``For many women, a choice       between working under unhealthy conditions and not working is       no choice at all.''        Through our free, national legal helpline, we have spoken       with hundreds of pregnant workers, disproportionately women       of color, who have been fired or forced out for needing       accommodations, often stripping them of their health       insurance when they need it most, driving them into poverty,       and at times, even homelessness. Other women we have assisted       were denied accommodations but needed to keep working to       support themselves and their families and faced devastating       health consequences, including miscarriage, preterm birth,       birth complications, and other maternal health effects.        In the past few months alone, we have heard from women       across the country who continue to face termination or are       forced out for needing pregnancy accommodations. A retail       store employee from Missouri who is pregnant and due in       November 2020 called us after she was forced to quit her job       because her employer refused to let her carry a water bottle       on the retail floor even though she was experiencing severe       dehydration due to hot temperatures in the store this summer.       A massage therapist from Pennsylvania called us in June 2020       requesting to return to work on a part-time basis on the       advice of her OB-GYN after experiencing cramping in her       uterus. Her employer responded that they would not       accommodate her and cut off all communication with her after       that, forcing her out of work just three months before she       was due to give birth. A nurse we spoke with from       Pennsylvania who was six months pregnant requested to avoid       assignment to the COVID-19 unit. Though her hospital was not       overwhelmed by the pandemic, had many empty beds, and other       workers were being sent home, her employer refused her       request and made heartless comments mocking her need for       accommodation. She decided not to jeopardize her health and       lost pay for missing those shifts as a result. She also       worried about being called to the COVID unit shift       constantly.        Without the law on their side, these women had little legal       recourse because they lived in a state without a state-level       pregnant workers fairness law. On the other hand, when a       pregnant worker in upstate New York--where a state pregnancy       accommodation is already in place--requested to telecommute       in June 2020 due to underlying health issues, she was quickly       able to engage her employer in a good faith interactive       process and her employer approved her request, allowing her       to stay attached to the workforce and maintain a healthy       pregnancy amidst the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has       certainly shone a spotlight on the critical need for clarity       around pregnancy accommodations but let us be clear: the need       for this law preceded our current public health crisis and       will remain in place beyond the pandemic.    Current Federal Law is Failing Pregnant Workers: The Pregnant Workers                        Fairness Act is the Solution         Gaps in federal law mean many pregnant workers in need of       accommodation are without legal protection in non-PWFA       states. As we explained in our report Long Overdue, ``While       the P[regnancy] D[iscrimination] A[ct] bans pregnancy       discrimination, it requires employers to make accommodations       only if they accommodate other workers, or  [[Page H4513]]       if an employee unearths evidence of discrimination. The       Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to provide       reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities, which       can include some pregnancy-related disabilities. However,       pregnancy itself is not a disability, leaving a gap wherein       many employers are in no way obligated to accommodate       pregnant workers in need of immediate relief to stay healthy       and on the job.''        Original analysis we conducted for Long Overdue found that       even though the 2015 Supreme Court Young v. UPS case set a       new legal standard for evaluating pregnancy accommodation       cases under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, in over two-      thirds of cases decided since Young employers were permitted       to deny pregnancy workers accommodations under the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act. That statistic, as devastating as it is,       does not account for the vast majority of pregnant workers       who do not have the resources to vindicate their rights in       court. Beyond being resource strapped, most pregnant workers       we hear from do not have the desire to engage in time-      consuming and stressful litigation. They want to be able to       receive an accommodation so they can continue working at the       jobs they care about while maintaining a healthy pregnancy.     The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a Critical Economic Security,                Maternal Health, and Racial Justice Measure         Pregnant workers that are fired or pushed out for needing       accommodations face significant economic hardship. In       addition to losing their livelihood, many of these workers       lose their health benefits at a time when they need them       most, forcing them to switch providers, delay medical care,       and/or face staggering health care costs associated with       pregnancy and childbirth. We worked with one woman who was       eight months pregnant and whose hours were cut after she       needed an accommodation which meant she also lost her       health insurance. As a result, she asked her doctor if       they could induce her labor early so that she would not be       left facing exorbitant medical bills. In the long term,       being pushed out for needing pregnancy accommodations also       exacerbates the gender wage gap, as it means losing out on       many types of benefits such as 401K and retirement       contributions, social security contributions, pensions, as       well as opportunities for promotion and growth.        Most pregnant workers may not need accommodations. However,       for those who do, reasonable accommodations can avert       significant health risks. For instance, in a Health Impact       Assessment of state level pregnant workers fairness       legislation, the Louisville, Kentucky Department of Public       Health and Wellness concluded, ``Accommodating pregnant       workers, upon their request, is critical for reducing poor       health outcomes . . . Improving birth outcomes makes a       sustainable impact for a lifetime of better health.'' The       report noted that those poor health outcomes can include       miscarriage, preterm birth, low birth weight, preeclampsia (a       serious condition and leading cause of maternal mortality),       among other issues. According to the March of Dimes, in the       U.S., nearly 1 in 10 babies are born pre-term and the preterm       birth rate among Black women is nearly fifty percent higher       than it is for all other women. Preterm birth/low birthweight       is a leading cause of infant mortality in America. The       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a key measure to reduce poor       maternal and infant health outcomes.        Pregnancy accommodations are one of myriad solutions needed       to address the Black maternal health crisis. Systemic racism       has led to the shameful reality that Black women in this       country are three to four times likelier to die from       pregnancy-related causes than white women, and Black babies       are more than two times as likely to die in the first year of       life than white babies. At the same time, we know Black women       also face devastating health consequences when they are       unable to obtain needed pregnancy accommodations to maintain       their health and the health of their pregnancies. When Tasha       Murell, a Black woman who worked at a warehouse in Tennessee,       received a doctor's note saying she needed a lifting       restriction and complained of extreme stomach pain, she was       forced to continue lifting on the job. One day, she told a       supervisor she was in pain and asked to leave early. Her       manager said no. Tragically, she had a miscarriage the next       day. Tasha was not alone. Three more of her co-workers, also       Black, miscarried after supervisors dismissed their requests       for reprieve from heavy lifting. As Cherisse Scott, CEO of       Memphis-based Sister Reach, explained ``It doesn't surprise       me that this is the culture of that workplace. I think it's       important to look at the fact that since we arrived here in       chains, we [African-American women] were regarded as       producers to fuel a labor force that couldn't care less for       us. . .'' The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will ensure       pregnant workers and their health are valued and that Black       mothers, especially, are not treated as expendable on the       job.     The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a Bipartisan Bill That Has the             Support of This Country's Largest Business Groups         The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is not a partisan bill.       Not only does it have strong bipartisan support in Congress,       but thirty states and five cities including Tennessee,       Kentucky, South Carolina, West Virginia, Illinois, Nebraska,       and Utah already have laws requiring employers to provide       accommodations for pregnant employees. All of the laws passed       in recent years are highly similar to the federal       legislation, and all passed with bipartisan, and often       unanimous, support. Many, including Tennessee's and       Kentucky's, were championed by Republican legislators.        Pregnant workers are a vital part of our economy. Three-      quarters of women will be both pregnant and employed at some       point during their lives. Ensuring pregnant workers can       remain healthy and attached to the workforce is an issue of       critical importance, especially as this country faces an       unprecedented economic crisis. That is why leading business       groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Society for Human       Resources Management, many major corporations, and local       chambers around the country including, Greater Louisville       Inc., one of Kentucky's leading chambers of commerce, support       this measure. The PWFA will provide much needed clarity in       the law which will lead to informal and upfront resolutions       between employers and employees and help prevent problems       before they start. Furthermore, accommodations are short term       and low cost. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will help       employers retain valuable employees and reduce high turnover       and training costs. The reasonable accommodation framework is       also borrowed from the American with Disabilities framework       so employers are already familiar with the standard.       Furthermore, keeping pregnant workers employed saves       taxpayers money in the form of unemployment insurance and       other public benefits.      The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act Uses a Familiar Framework That   Provides Key Protections to Pregnant Workers and Clarity to Employers         The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has several key       provisions that will address the inequality pregnant workers       continue to face at work. Employers, including private       employers with fifteen or more employees, will be required to       provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees       absent undue hardship on the employer. Both the term       ``reasonable accommodation'' and ``undue hardship'' have the       same definition as outlined in the American with Disabilities       Act. Similar to the Americans with Disabilities Act,       employers and employees must engage in an interactive process       in order to determine an appropriate accommodation. In order       to prevent employers from pushing pregnant employees out on       leave when they need an accommodation, the bill specifies       that an employer cannot require a pregnant employee to take       leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided.       The bill also includes clear anti-retaliation language such       that employers cannot punish pregnant workers for requesting       or using an accommodation. This is critical as many pregnant       workers often do not ask for accommodations because they are       afraid they will face repercussions for requesting or needing       an accommodation.        Critically, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is also very       clear that a pregnant worker need not have a disability as       defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act in order to       merit accommodations under the law. Rather, the bill       indicates that pregnant workers with ``known limitations       related to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical       conditions'' are entitled to reasonable accommodations.       ``Known limitations'' is defined as a ``physical or mental       condition related to, affected by, or arising out of       pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions that the       employee or employee's representative has communicated to the       employer whether or not such condition meets the definition       of disability'' as set forth in the Americans with       Disabilities Act. This addresses two of the challenges the       Americans with Disabilities Act has presented for pregnant       workers: first, because pregnancy is not itself a disability       under current disability law, a pregnant worker who has no       complications but seeks an accommodation in order to avoid a       complication, will not be able to get an accommodation under       the Americans with Disabilities Act. Second, even though       Congress expanded the Americans with Disabilities Act in       2008, courts have interpreted the ADA Amendments Act in a way       that did little to expand coverage even for those pregnant       workers with serious health complications. As one court       concluded in 2018, ``Although the 2008 amendments broadened       the ADA's definition of disability, these changes only have       had a modest impact when applied to pregnancy-related       conditions.''        Now, more than ever, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is       an urgent maternal health, racial justice, and economic       security measure to keep pregnant workers healthy and earning       a paycheck. We cannot delay justice and fairness for pregnant       workers any longer. For the sake of this country's pregnant       workers and our nation's families, we implore Congress to put       aside its many differences and pass this legislation with a       strong bipartisan vote. We ask every Member of Congress to       vote YES on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. It is long       overdue.            Sincerely,                                                     Dina Bakst,                                          Co-Founder & Co-President,                                                  A Better Balance.  [[Page H4514]]         Madam Speaker, that is why the Pregnant Workers Fairness  Act moves away from proving discrimination and creates an affirmative  right to accommodation. Using the framework and language of the  Americans with Disabilities Act, the bill requires employers to provide  reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers, as long as the  accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the employer.   Courts know exactly how to interpret that language. Employers know  exactly what their responsibilities will be. But most importantly,  women will have the certainty they can safely stay on the job.   That is why over 200 organizations have endorsed the legislation and  why 30 States have passed pregnancy accommodations laws similar to the  PWFA.   Providing reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers helps  businesses, workers, and families. Passing this bill is long overdue.   I thank Mr. Katko for working with his Conference on this bill and  Chairman Scott, Chairwoman Bonamici, Eunice Ikene, and the committee  staff for shepherding the bill to the floor today.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.
