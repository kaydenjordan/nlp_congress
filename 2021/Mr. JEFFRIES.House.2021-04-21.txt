 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for his  yielding and for his leadership.   The foundational model of this country is e pluribus unum, out of  many, one. It doesn't say out of many Europeans, one. It doesn't say  out of many Anglo-Saxons, one. It doesn't say out of many Confederate  sympathizers, one. It doesn't say out of many Christians, one. It  certainly doesn't say out of many nations, except Muslim countries,  one.   E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. That is what makes America a great  country. And no matter what xenophobic behavior is coming out of the  halls of power in this country, we are not going to let anyone take  that away from us; not now, not ever.   Vote ``yes'' on the NO BAN Act so we can continue our country's long,  necessary, and majestic march toward a more perfect Union.
