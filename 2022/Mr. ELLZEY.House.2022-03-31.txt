 Mr. Speaker, I come before the House of Representatives  to bring attention to National Agriculture Month. And, of course,  before I begin my prepared remarks, I want to talk about what we see  going on in Ukraine and Russia.    Ukraine is the breadbasket of that region. And 30 percent of all of  the world's grain, wheat, is produced in that region. And as we talk  about this today, and in a few months we are going to be talking about  it even more, about how the farms and ranches of the United States feed  the entire world.   Over the past couple of years our farmers have faced unprecedented  obstacles from COVID, COVID lockdowns, labor shortages, supply chain  disruptions, high fuel prices, and record-high fertilizer prices. But  as always, they have overcome those challenges, and they have kept  Americans and the world fed during a time of great uncertainty.   Each American farmer feeds more than 165 people. Texas leads the  Nation in the number of farms and ranches, with 248,416 farms and  ranches covering 127 million acres. The ag industry is the pillar of a  healthy and prosperous nation. And in the 6th Congressional District of  Texas, we have a long history of farming and ranching. We are home to  families like the Beeklys, the Patmans, the Buchholzes, the Borns, and  the Dineens.   Many of them have earned the title of a ``Texas Century Farm'' or  Texas Century Ranch.'' Those titles are only given to families that  have served our country as farmers and ranchers for over 100 years.  Families who get up before dawn to tend to crops and herd cattle. They  are part of over 5,000 farms and ranches in my district.   So if you fed your family today, thank a farmer. Thank a rancher. And  in Texas, thank a neighbor.
