 Madam Speaker, just so staff knows, this will  probably be a bit abbreviated because of all the chaos we have going on  around us.   There is something I wanted to start with. Typically, we come to the  floor to spend time talking about what is happening in the country  economically and demographically and what we must do to keep our  promises. I sit on the Ways and Means Committee, and I do trade and tax  policy.   Before we put that up, I need to touch on something that is  incredibly frustrating. Being from Arizona, obviously, we have a border  issue. We talk about it; we do nothing.  [[Page H4426]]    How many have seen the news in the last couple of days that we have  gun battles going on just south of Douglas, Arizona? We may have 9 or  10 people who have lost their lives. We had a teenager get hit by a  stray bullet. We have had a couple of folks--apparently, one crawled to  the border and is now in an Arizona hospital. A couple are in Arizona  hospitals.    Where is the press? Where is the discussion of what is going on?  Apparently, we have a war going on in Agua Prieta, just south of  Douglas, between these cartels that not only move drugs, but they also  exploit human beings.   These are the very cartels that are taking humans, smuggling them and  trafficking them up to the border. They are using assault weapons and  killing each other. Of course, we would care about that, wouldn't we?  Except it doesn't get any news here because it doesn't fit the  narrative.   If you love and care for people, could we at least have an honest  discussion of what the President has asked for, with some money for  humanitarian aid to take care of those who have presented themselves at  the border for refugee status? Understand the violence that is spilling  over into my State of Arizona and what is going on.   I guess I come to this microphone just frustrated that this story  broke yesterday in Arizona. Where is the national outcry? Where is the  national understanding of the chaos that is happening along our  southern border and the lives that are being lost? Do we or do we not  care about people?   There were two things I wanted to do, and I know we are up against a  very tight time, so I am just going to do one of them.   We have this theory that basically says, if you look at U.S.  demographics, in 8.5 years, it is two workers, one retiree. In 8.5  years, 50 percent of the budget from this body, less interest, will be  to those 65 and older.   Demographics aren't Republican. They are not Democratic. They are  math.   We must do a number of things to keep the economic vitality of this  society going if we are going to keep our promises. One of those things  in our five points is the way we deal with regulations. We have this  one area we talk about, whether it be tax policy, trade policy, or  regulatory policy. Just in a couple of minutes here, I wanted to  explain what smart regulation is.   So often when hearing the rhetoric, we will have: Well, we need to  deregulate. We need to reregulate.   That is wrong. We all walk around with these supercomputers in our  pockets. It turns out, technology is the rational place where  regulation should go.   Here is my thought experiment. Let's use our own neighborhoods. We  are the businesses in those neighborhoods. We need to get air quality  permits for manufacturing. Does filling out a bunch of paper and  shoving it in file cabinets make air quality cleaner in our  neighborhoods? Do file cabinets full of paperwork at the local, county,  State, wherever our regulators are, does that make the air quality in  our communities better? Of course not. It just creates a lot of  documents so that we have someone to sue for the trial lawyers and  those things.   I want to propose the concept of crowdsourcing environmental  information, particularly for air quality. It turns out, we are living  in a time where there are now sensors we can attach to our phones that  are highly accurate that will do PM10, hydrocarbons, and volatile  organics. What would happen in our communities if we were willing to  take this tradeoff?   We are not going to make everyone fill out lots of paperwork. We are  going to promote businesses, let them grow. But here is the trick: If  they screw up, we catch them instantly.   Also, the clowns painting cars behind everyone's houses in their  backyards, we are going to catch them, too.   This thought is very simple. We have a YouTube cartoon that is about  1.5 minutes that walks through this concept of crowdsourcing  environmental data. It shows that it is time to use this type of  technology. Think of the economic growth tradeoff.   We are not going to fill up file cabinets full of paperwork. Because  we are going to be crowdsourcing environmental data, when there is a  bad actor, or someone's scrubbers are out of compliance, or there are  clowns painting cars in backyards, we will catch them instantly.   Wouldn't that be a lot more powerful, where environmental regulators  of communities, States, and counties are now a quick reaction force  that goes to where the bad acts are happening instead of basically  being paperwork domiciles?   That is an example of smart regulation. It makes communities  healthier. It makes air quality better. It still has businesses growing  because they are not buried under consultants and mounds of paper. That  is an example of smart regulation.   How do we drag this institution into understanding the incredible  opportunities that technology is bringing in crashing the price of  healthcare and making the environment healthier? In the coming weeks, I  am going to come back to dive into this much deeper, but let me salt  the mine a little bit for a thought experiment.   What would happen if we had technology that could protect houses of  worship, schools, this body, and public buildings? It turns out that it  exists today.   I want to propose that this body put together an XPRIZE for nonlethal  protection of our buildings and our houses of worship. We already know  there are experiments out there with pods that go on the wall, so if  someone comes in and is engaged in a bad act or discharges a firearm,  instantly, just like the Taser darts, it lays them down. Yes, innocent  people will get hit with them, but they don't die.   It turns out that there are technology solutions that will make us  safer.                                time  1700    How do we drag the conversations around this place to understand  there are really great, exciting opportunities for all of us out there,  whether it be in smart regulation, whether it be the end of killing  using technology, whether it be the fact we are about to get  dramatically healthier, and that the cures that are about to come on  the market for diseases that have been with us for so long, we are in a  time of amazing disruption?   How do we future-proof our policies, and how do we get this body to  stop thinking everything is either Democrat or Republican, but  understand there are actual solutions, you just have to be forward- thinking with technology?   With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
