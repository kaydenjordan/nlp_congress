 Madam President, I came to the floor to talk about the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. But first, let me just express my  gratitude to the Senator from West Virginia for his longtime commitment  to come up with a bipartisan solution. This is not easy.   And there are a lot of examples of good-faith attempts to try to come  up with an answer that can get the requisite number of votes. And I  know the Senator from West Virginia knows how hard that is. But it  hasn't deterred him from contributing to our efforts, and I think our  product that we are voting on is better for that. I want to say thank  you.    Madam President, I thank my friend, our friend, from West  Virginia for those generous remarks.   As we all know, a lot of people have been working on this issue, for  the last few weeks especially, intensely. And this included, obviously,  a lot of people beyond those that I have the time to name here. But we  finally introduced our proposed legislation last Tuesday, exactly 4  weeks after the last terrible shooting in Uvalde, TX. I am not a  patient person by temperament or personality. So I was hoping we would  get here faster. But the truth is, since it requires consensus and  persuasion, sometimes it takes a little longer than you hoped for. And  I appreciate the space that both the majority leader and the Republican  leader have given us to come up with something that will achieve a  result.   So often around here, people do things and say things not with the  intention of actually passing legislation but with the intention of  making a political statement, or messaging, as it is sometimes called.  That is not what we are doing here. We are not looking to posture or to  try to embarrass anybody. We are trying to find a solution to a very  real problem. And I think what we have come up with will, in the end,  pass the test, which I know so many of us believe is the standard. And  that standard is: Will it save lives? Will it save lives? And I believe  the answer to that is yes. And that makes this worth doing.   Well, from the beginning, I was optimistic that we could reach a  bipartisan agreement, but I know that on both sides of the aisle, there  were some places that we could not go. As the Senator from West  Virginia said--a proud defender of the Second Amendment, as am I--I was  not going to go anywhere in this negotiation that jeopardized the  rights of law-abiding Americans under the Second Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution.    Some people act as if the Second Amendment is somehow different than  the rest of the Bill of Rights--the freedom of speech, the freedom of  press, the freedom of association, the freedom of religion. Well, it is  right there all in the same 10 first amendments to the U.S.  Constitution, called the Bill of Rights. So it is entitled to no less  respect than those other constitutional rights contained in the Bill of  Rights.   But I think we have come up with a way to make good public policy and  also to maintain that commitment to the Constitution. Some people want  to create a false choice. I don't think we need to go there because  there is not a false choice, as I said, between the Constitution and  the Second Amendment and making good public policy. They don't have to  overlap or interfere with each other. Both can stand on their own  merits. Well, as I said, law-abiding gun owners are not the problem.  And that was a redline for me.   During the course of our negotiations, our Democratic colleagues did  push for a range of provisions that I believe stood no chance of  becoming law, particularly in a 50-50 Senate. We know that if Democrats  want to do everything their way or Republicans want to do everything  our way, almost by definition in a 50-50 Senate, nothing will happen.   And to me, that was one of the most important things we are doing  here. One is demonstrating that our institutions--in this case, the  U.S. Senate--can actually work at a time when a lot of people are  questioning whether our institutions can work and also questioning  whether it is possible to come up with some bipartisan piece of  legislation rather than fail as we have so many times before and each  side sort of returning to their corner of a boxing ring and trying to  message it to their base and not actually get a result.   So there were a lot of things that the President has asked for in  this bill. For example, a ban on so-called assault weapons, which are a  semiautomatic long gun, named, I guess, because of focus groups or  polling assault weapons, but it is really a semiautomatic rifle. And  there was also some discussion about high-capacity magazines. Neither  of those are part of this legislation.   Now, I know there are Members who would perhaps love to have that,  but they understand that to press that point to its logical extreme  would mean we would not have anything at all. There is also no  mandatory waiting period. There is no potentially unconstitutional  requirement that gun owners store their weapons in a particular way.   Unless a person is adjudicated mentally ill or is a violent criminal,  no one's Second Amendment rights will be impacted by this legislation,  period. We know already that the National Instant Criminal Background  Check System--which is the gold standard, in my  [[Page S3116]]  view, to make sure we draw the line in the right place between law- abiding gun owners and those who cannot, under existing law, purchase a  firearm. For example, if you have been adjudicated in a mental  institution, you can't buy a firearm. If you have been convicted of a  felony, if you have been dishonorably discharged from the military, if  you are addicted to drugs--all of those are current questions in the  National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which if you answer  yes to, then you cannot legally purchase or possess a firearm.   Some wanted to include more categories, but we did not. We  essentially are, by doing what we have done here, saying we are going  to make sure that existing law is enforced but not add additional  requirements.   Well, some of our colleagues like to say that to keep guns out of the  hands of dangerous individuals, we need to limit the rights of law- abiding citizens. But as we know, the bad guys--the criminals--aren't  going to respect the law; they are going to get the guns by any means  they can, including illegally.   Frequently, they obtain firearms on the street or through straw  purchasers. Background checks don't deter them because they don't buy  them from a Federal firearms licensee, which does a background check.  They buy it from a member of a street gang or someone else.   So we have rejected those attempts to add restrictions, as I say, on  law-abiding gun owners, but we have added stiffer penalties for straw  purchasers and gun traffickers. That, I believe, is the most effective  way to deal with the problem of street sales of illegal guns through  trafficking and straw purchasing. That is a way to improve public  safety.   Following the shooting in Uvalde 4 weeks ago, I said I wanted to look  at reforms that might have prevented this terrible tragedy from  occurring.   To me, that is the best way to approach these cases because it is  hard, sort of in the abstract, to say what it is we could do that might  save lives. Frequently, we can look at the fact pattern of what  happened and say: Here is where there was a failure, and here is  another place there was a failure. Unfortunately, in Uvalde, there were  multiple points of failure.   One is a lack of our access to juvenile records. This young man  showed up after he had his 18th birthday. Right now, the criminal  background check system doesn't look back before you were 18 to see  whether you had a mental health adjudication or some disqualifying  criminal conviction.   That is a problem because if somebody who we know, in retrospect, is  sort of a ticking timebomb as a result of his troubled past, there is  no way under the current system to get access to that information.   So one of the things we have done here is to say: Let's see if we can  work with the States to make sure that they supply to the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System information that had it  occurred as an adult post-18 would clearly disqualify someone from  purchasing a firearm. This is a little bit of a challenge because every  State kind of does things differently, and there is no way we can  compel the State to provide the information, but I would think that  Governors and State legislatures would want to work with us to try to  keep guns out of the hands of people who we know are a threat to  themselves and a threat to public safety.   Our bill incentivizes the States to upload whatever juvenile records  they have to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to  ensure that any disqualifying criminal convictions or mental health  adjudications are available.   This is, to be clear, not an expansion but a clarification of the  types of conduct and records that would disqualify somebody if you were  an adult that are not currently available because we don't look past  the 18th birthday--behind the 18th birthday to juvenile records.   So what we are doing is simply ensuring that those records, which  would already disqualify somebody had it occurred if they were an  adult, are available and could be considered as part of that background  check.   If the background check for a buyer under 21 returns a potentially  disqualifying record, what we have provided in this enhanced background  check is an opportunity for the FBI to ask more questions.   And under our legislation, we don't change this part of it. The NICS  system--the National Instant Criminal Background Check System--has 3  days to do a background check. But because it is computerized, 90  percent of them are done just in a matter of seconds, but on occasion  the FBI has other information they need to investigate.   This was a real problem, for example, in Charleston, where Dylann  Roof, somebody we know had a misdemeanor drug conviction--and on  further inquiry, the FBI would have found out he was addicted to  narcotics, which is also a disqualification. But because there was no  opportunity to expand the background check beyond just the 3 days under  current law, it wasn't part of the NICS system. And, unfortunately, he  bought a gun and killed a lot of innocent people at Mother Emanuel  Church there in Charleston.    So giving the FBI, for this cohort of 18- to 21-year-olds, an  opportunity, if they come across something that needs further  investigation, to give them up to an additional 7 business days to look  into it.   I will give you another example. Let's say they come up with a record  that demonstrates there was an assault. Well, there are different types  of assaults against someone. It may be a bar fight or punching someone  in the nose or it could be domestic violence. Well, the first is not a  disqualifier under the law, but if the assault conviction actually  turns out to be domestic violence, it would be. And so that is the kind  of information that we are giving the FBI an opportunity to explore in  this extension of the background check.   But this is not a mandatory waiting period, and it doesn't apply to  gun buyers of all ages. For example, if somebody is 19 years old and  they do the background check and they do what we require here, which is  inquire of the juvenile record repository and the repository for mental  health adjudications and local law enforcement, and they find nothing,  then the transaction can occur in a matter of hours or a matter of  days.   There is no mandatory waiting period. And this really addresses only  that cohort of 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds, which has become a common  profile for young shooters who have shot innocent people everywhere  from Uvalde to Sandy Hook in Connecticut and other places.   The profile, unfortunately, is very sad and very tragic, people who  are a danger to themselves and others, and that is the reason why we  thought this enhanced process was important.   We also included comprehensive due process requirements relating to  firearms. I have talked about the fact that this is a constitutional  right, and of course the Constitution guarantees due process of law.  And a lot of folks are, frankly, concerned about these red flag laws,  these crisis intervention orders when somebody is demonstrated to be a  danger to themselves and others.   And the concern is that not all of these red flag laws contain robust  due process requirements. What are we talking about? Well, due process  generally is understood to include notice, the opportunity to be heard,  the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence in  front of an impartial judicial officer.   So, in order to make sure that none of the grant funds would be  available to States that did not have robust due process requirements  and had red flag laws, as 19 States and the District of Columbia do, we  have very strong due process conditions on the grants that are  available.   But many States don't have red flag laws. For example, Texas does  not, but we sure have a lot of crisis intervention programs that are  sort of focused on the same sort of problem.   We have mental health courts, veterans courts, drug courts. We have  something called assisted outpatient treatment for people who, under  court order, can be an outpatient and be required to show up for their  counseling or treatment but also to take the medications that their  healthcare provider requires them to take if they are going to manage  their mental health challenges. That is done under a court order but as  an outpatient. So it is another way of sort of addressing this  [[Page S3117]]  problem of people having unmanaged mental health challenges and, in  some cases, becoming a danger to themselves and others.   We firmly rejected the idea that the Federal Government would impose  a national red flag law. And we did not view it as appropriate for the  Federal Government to make the grant funds that are available through  the Department of Justice be seen as an incentive to sort of nudge  States or encourage States to pass their own extreme risk protection  orders.   Those are decisions that are made at the State level, not here. But  like I said, we provided robust due process requirements of any grants  that go to those States. And it may be, as one of my colleagues said  this morning, in his State, they have red flag laws, and he thinks that  money could be used to ensure that the rights of law-abiding gun owners  are protected by a robust due process.    And for States that don't have red flag laws, as I mentioned, there  are other ways this money can go to help and address a similar problem.  So all States will have access to these funds through the Department of  Justice Byrne JAG law enforcement grant program.   So while some have said that taxpayer dollars are being used to  violate someone's Second Amendment rights without due process, that is,  clearly, a false accusation. Unfortunately, we know that when there is  so much money to be made and so many people to be recruited to one  cause or another when it deals with this general subject matter, that a  lot of reckless and irresponsible and false statements get made, which  is the reason I am here explaining what is in the bill and what is not  in the bill.   One of the things that was very important to our Democratic  colleagues is the definition of the ``boyfriend loophole.'' Just by way  of explanation, under current law, before we passed this bill, if you  are married to someone, if you are cohabitating with someone, if you  have a child with someone and are not married or cohabitating or if you  are in a relationship which is, for all practical purposes, similar to  a marriage but not official, if you commit a domestic violence offense  in your State and are convicted of that misdemeanor domestic violence,  you are forever barred from purchasing or possessing a firearm.   One of the things we negotiated, frankly, because I think it just  makes a lot of sense, is that for this category of boyfriends, so- called, roughly defined as recent or current serious relationship of a  romantic or intimate nature, if you find yourself in one of those  relationships and you commit an act of domestic violence, one of the  things we negotiated is 5 years later, with a clean record, then you  can have your Second Amendment rights restored.   And I think that is an important protection, again, of Second  Amendment rights. Well, we would not agree that someone who was  convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence against a girlfriend 30  years ago would be forever barred from their Second Amendment rights or  someone who just had a casual dating relationship.   But as I said, we did include a provision to restore the Second  Amendment rights to certain individuals who have a clean record of not  committing any additional criminal acts, including domestic violence,  for a period of 5 years.   We all know that there are plenty of people who make mistakes but  then turn their lives around, and this legislation opens up the anatomy  for individuals to have their Second Amendment rights restored if they  do that.   We have worked throughout this process with a lot of different  people, from the school safety portion to the mental health portion,  and we have worked with law enforcement, and we have worked with a  variety of groups, including some of the groups that represent gun  owners as well as those who have advocated reform of our gun laws. I  thought it was important for us to hear from everybody.   And now it may be that in the end, some of these outside groups do  not love 100 percent of what we are doing here. We know that no piece  of legislation is perfect. By definition, it is a compromise and a  consensus to try to find that common ground. And so some outside groups  may say: Well, we can't support that because it doesn't give us 100  percent of what we want, but frankly there is never a bill that passes  that gives one side or the other 100 percent of what they want.   So just to conclude, just to repeat myself for emphasis, this bill  does not infringe on law-abiding citizens rights under the Second  Amendment. It doesn't actually expand the background checks system. It  doesn't impose mandatory waiting periods or any other restrictions.   There is a lot of misinformation and, believe me, I think that is  what social media was created for, for spreading misinformation or  disinformation.   So there is a lot of misunderstanding about what is in this  legislation, which is the reason I wanted to come to the floor and set  the record straight.   This bill does, however, include important targeted reforms, complete  with robust due process protections, that I believe in the end will  keep our children and our communities safe while respecting Second  Amendment rights.   Over the last couple of days, we have had a chance to have even  further and more robust discussions among not only Republicans, but  Democrats, and I appreciate those who perhaps may have been skeptical  to what we were trying to do here--their willingness to keep an open  mind, to ask us hard questions, and to force us to come up with good  answers that will address their concerns. That is how we pass  legislation here in the Senate; and my hope is that through those good- faith negotiations and debates and discussions, we can continue to  build additional support for this legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, tomorrow will mark 1 month since the  tragic shooting in Uvalde, TX.   A high school dropout with a history of violence and mental health  struggles purchased 2 AR-15s within days of turning 18, and he passed a  background check.  [[Page S3138]]    He then shot his own grandmother because she wanted him to go back  into the classroom rather than drop out of school, and then went to the  Robb Elementary School through an unlocked door.   He then opened fire on two fourth-grade classrooms, killing 19  students and 2 teachers.   The American people were shocked, outraged, and devastated by this  attack and collectively asked: How can we prevent this from happening  again?   Well, the discussion surrounding this topic causes emotions to run  high, and I understand why.   For too long, some politicians have tried to pit the right to live in  a safe community against the constitutional right to keep and bear  arms. They make it seem like our country can only have one or the  other--either the Second Amendment or safe schools and churches and  grocery stores. And, of course, this is a false choice.   Law-abiding gun owners are not the problem. Men and women who buy  guns to protect themselves and their family to hunt or engage in  sports--they are not a public safety problem.   Following the shooting, I promised to do everything in my power to  try to answer that call to do something. I don't believe in doing  nothing in the face of what we saw in Uvalde and we have seen in far  too many communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our  responsibility as representatives of the American people here in the  U.S. Senate.   At the same time, I reiterated my bottom line, which is: I would not  support any provisions that infringed on the rights of law-abiding gun  owners. Again, they are not the problem.   But I knew that this effort was about the art of the possible;  looking at areas where we could agree and setting aside those areas  where we could not.   I was fortunate to find partners who were thoughtful and realistic  about how we could pass this bill.   I want to thank Senator Murphy, Senator Sinema, Senator Tillis, as  well as a larger group of Senators without whom this legislation would  not be on the cusp of passage. Thank you. Thank you for not listening  to the naysayers and the critics and those who would spew  disinformation and outright lies about what we are doing here and for  standing up to the responsibility that we all have as U.S. Senators to  do our very best to make progress, to try to answer the call in the  face of these tragedies, and try, in the end, to save lives, which is  what this is all about.   Now, less than 1 month after the shooting in Uvalde, the Senate will  vote soon on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This legislation  will protect our schools, protect our communities, and safeguard the  Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: No parent should ever  fear for the safety of their child at school, and no child should be  afraid to go to school in fear of their safety.   This legislation responds to that in a positive and affirmative way.  This bill includes targeted, commonsense measures to prevent violence  and to save lives while respecting our Constitution.   (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)   Madam President, the dirty little secret is America is experiencing a  mental health crisis. Our mental health delivery system is a scandal.  Too many people are not getting the sort of attention and care they  need in order to manage their mental health challenges. And many of  them can be saved from the fate of Salvador Ramos or Adam Lanza if they  can get access to timely care and the medication that will help them  manage their mental illness. So this bill will represent the single  largest investment in community-based mental health care in American  history.   That is huge. That is enormously important. And to me it may be the  most important aspect of what we do here.   So police officers answering a 9-1-1 call from somebody in a mental  health crisis, they don't have to take that person to jail where they  won't get help. They can take them to a community-based mental health  delivery system--to a clinic. And a person experiencing a mental health  crisis, they don't have to go to the emergency room. They can go to a  clinic and get the sort of care and help they need in order to manage  their condition, whatever it may be.   This bill will also provide support and services for our schools. Our  schools should be sanctuary--a sanctuary--for our children, not a place  where they plan on what will happen during the next shooting and how  they can hide under their desks or try to make their escape. Schools  should be a sanctuary. And this bill will provide the kind of services  that will help identify students in crisis and help intervene to  provide them the assistance they need.   This bill also provides major investments in school safety and  security. It includes physical safety measures. We probably can't  eliminate human error like we saw in Uvalde, TX, but we can promulgate  the best practices, which we have done in this bill, from the best  minds based on evidence--what works and what does not--to make sure we  keep unauthorized visitors out of the hallways and the classrooms as  well as evaluate current protocols and, like I said, develop best  practices.   Again, those who say we need to infringe on the rights of law-abiding  citizens under the Constitution in order to make good policy are  offering a false choice. Passing good public policy and supporting the  Constitution are not mutually exclusive.   One of the ways we are providing assistance to the States is through  crisis intervention grants which will provide the States with funding  to implement programs to help those in crisis and prevent them from  committing self-harm or harm to others.   We have rejected the idea of a national red flag law, even though 19  States and the District of Columbia have chosen to do that themselves,  and one of the ways we can help is to make sure that these funds assist  State officials in training them on how to make sure that the due  process rights of an individual are protected, as they should be.   This legislation also closes a gaping hole in the background check  system which is the lack of juvenile records. This is a real challenge  because most juvenile records are sealed or expunged. But we know that  Salvador Ramos, who went in at 18-years-old and passed a background  check--he was a ticking timebomb. Everybody knew he was struggling with  his mental health challenges, and he was slowly circling the drain  because he didn't get the help that might have prevented his self-harm,  not to mention the harm to others.   But if a person's record includes a criminal conviction or mental  health adjudication that prohibits them from purchasing a firearm as an  adult, it shouldn't matter whether they were 17 or 18 at the time. That  information should be available on the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System, and that is what this bill will encourage. Our  bill incentivizes the States to upload this information to ensure that  disqualifying criminal convictions or mental health adjudications are  available.   Unless a person is convicted of a crime or adjudicated as mentally  ill, their Second Amendment rights will not be impacted by this  legislation, period.   Let me close by saying, I am grateful to Senator Murphy, who has been  a good-faith partner. He would like to do a lot of things in addition  to what we have done here, but he was pragmatic and realistic enough to  know that if we were actually going to be successful, we weren't going  to be able to do everything that he wanted. Conversely, there were  things that we did on our side that were outside of our comfort zone  that, frankly, we are having to explain to people, but that is what a  good-faith negotiation looks like. And again, I think, on balance, the  good we are doing here and the potential we have to save lives is worth  any sort of concession we might have had to make during the  negotiation.   Let me also express my gratitude to Senator Sinema, the Senator from  Arizona, who has been a key partner in the negotiation as well as  Senator Tillis, the Senator from North Carolina. But the truth is, a  lot of people were involved in this. And I want to thank all of our  colleagues who helped us round out this legislation and make sure it  delivers the benefits that we sought. We also worked with a variety of  stakeholders from education to mental health groups, to law  enforcement, as  [[Page S3139]]  well as gun rights groups. And I appreciate everybody who has helped us  make this product better. And obviously we don't agree on a lot of  things, but I am encouraged about how much common ground we were able  to find.   Our bill has earned the endorsement of more than 100 mental health  and education groups, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness  and the National Association of School Psychologists. It has received  the support of law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal  Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National  District Attorneys Association, and the Major Cities Chiefs  Association. It has been backed by domestic violence groups such as the  National Network to End Domestic Violence and the National Coalition  Against Domestic Violence.    I believe we have in the Gallery tonight people who have suffered  unthinkable losses of loved ones in some of these mass shooting  incidents. But I want to tell them that their advocacy has turned their  pain into something positive. I believe the best antidote for the sort  of unthinkable loss that they have suffered is the knowledge that  something good will come out of their tragedies, something that will  save lives.   This broad support for this legislation shows that it is a meaningful  comprehensive response to the tragedies we have experienced. And I am  proud of what we have been able to do together. And I am very  optimistic about the impact it will have on our schools and communities  across the country. So, thank you, colleagues, for working together in  good faith in a bipartisan way.   I think in one way we have demonstrated to people that our  institutions can work. Many have come to doubt whether we are capable  of making our institutions work, including the world's greatest  deliberative body, the U.S. Senate. And we have proved that we can,  when sufficiently inspired by the people in the Gallery and others,  when they say do something to come together and find common ground that  will help keep our communities safer, protect our children, and save  lives.   I look forward to voting yes and moving this bill one step closer to  the President's desk for signature.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to thank the National  Sheriffs' Association for its tireless work on the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act. I ask unanimous consent that their letter of support  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 National Sheriffs' Association,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 22, 2022.      Hon. Charles Schumer      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader,      US. Senate.        Dear Leaders: On behalf of the National Sheriffs'       Association, representing over 3,000 Sheriffs across this       great nation, we write to lend our support to ``The       Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.'' The Sheriffs do request       that the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy (MIEP) be addressed       in a colloquy as the bill is debated. As you know, the       federal law does not differentiate between a convicted inmate       and a person incarcerated prior to conviction. This anomaly       needs to be corrected.        Sheriffs see, up close, the daily carnage of gun violence       carried out by criminals and individuals suffering from       mental illness. We appreciate the authors coming together on       a bill that can actually save lives, which is written in such       a way that allows the States to craft their own unique       answers to the questions raised by gun violence.        Important to Sheriffs and their communities:        Supporting better access to mental health services in       schools is an important part of early screening for 40       million Medicaid students nationwide. Furthermore, in our       discussions we have determined that school property hardening       is a critical and necessary step in preventing mass school       shootings.        Reviewing juvenile records improves current law and may       help detect persons not eligible for firearm purchases while       protecting their Constitutional rights.        Allowing flexibility in the administration of the new       purpose Byrne JAG grant program will help States, and       therefore counties, implement crisis intervention courts       which may take many forms such as Veteran courts, drug courts       and outpatient treatment.        We also find that the due process provisions for extreme       risk protection, ``red flag'' orders, maintain the 5th and       14th amendments and provide the rights and tools necessary to       defend oneself.        There are many other provisions of the legislation that are       also important but too numerous to mention here. The Sheriffs       are available to discuss this bill with any member of your       Caucus/Conference who might have questions. Thank you for       your work on this legislation.            Very respectfully,                                              Jonathan Thompson,                                         Executive Director and CEO,                                    National Sheriffs' Association.
