 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  individual from my district for his work to keep both Iowans and  Americans healthy.   Alan Johnson, a professor in the Department of Psychological and  Brain Sciences at the University of Iowa, has been selected for the  2021 Excellence Award for Hypertension Research by the American Heart  Association's Council on Hypertension.   This award by the American Heart Association is given to members of  the scientific community who have had a major impact in research that  has contributed to better understanding the causes and effects of  hypertension.   Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common cardiovascular  condition that affects millions of Americans a year and is a major  contributor of both strokes and heart attacks.   I am proud of Professor Johnson for his decades of research into the  effects, causes, and treatments of this condition, and I congratulate  him for earning this prestigious award.      Thank You to Stead Family Children's Hospital Staff and Volunteers     Mr. Speaker, September is Childhood Cancer  Awareness Month, and I would like to take a moment to thank my district  for their work in treating and researching childhood cancer.   A staple to my district and to the Iowa City community is the  University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital, located right  across the street from Kinnick Stadium. You all might know it well from  the ``wave,'' one of college football's greatest traditions.   The Stead Family Children's Hospital specializes in treating  pediatric patients, winning several awards for their specialties in not  only pediatric cancer but also orthopedics and cardiology, among  others.   Our gratitude for helping these children extends beyond the staff of  Stead Family Children's Hospital. Many University of Iowa students and  members of the Iowa City community use their free time to volunteer  just to brighten a child's day.   Thank you to the men and women in Iowa who are working to treat and  research childhood cancer and to those who use their time to comfort  children who are currently battling it, a disease no child or parent  should face alone.                      Hills Elementary School Wins Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  importance of childhood education and how a school in my district is  taking extra strides to ensure their students' success.   At Hills Elementary School in Hills, Iowa, one out of four students  are in the process of learning English as their second language. This  is far higher than the average rate in Iowa being 12 percent.   Though many might see this language disparity as a barrier to student  achievement, this year, Hills Elementary was selected as one of 325  schools to win a National Blue Ribbon School Award from the U.S.  Department of Education, with 81 percent of students at the school  showing improvement in their academics.   Beginning in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon School Award has been  used to recognize American schools for their academic excellence.   I couldn't be prouder of both the students and faculty at Hills  Elementary,  [[Page H5469]]  and I wish the best for them as they continue their journey of academic  achievement.   I would also like to take a moment to wish a happy belated birthday  to my legislative assistant, Kendyl Willox, and a happy belated  birthday to my good friend and colleague, enthusiastically, the  gentleman from Long Island, Representative  Andrew Garbarino.                            ____________________
