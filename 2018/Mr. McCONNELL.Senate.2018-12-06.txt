 Mr. President, I have a number of important topics to  discuss this morning, but first and foremost, I want to personally  thank everyone in this building who gave so much of their own time and  energy to facilitate the rituals that filled this Capitol for the last  several days.   From the moment that news of President Bush's passing was made  public, intricate plans were set in motion in both the House and Senate  to arrange a public tribute worthy of a national treasure and a rare  patriot like George Bush. Needless to say, the entire congressional  family should be proud of the result.   As our 41st President lay in state earlier this week, the Bush  family, world leaders, and tens of thousands of Americans were welcomed  to the Capitol to pay their respects. I know my colleagues will join me  in thanking the  [[Page S7324]]  great many people who helped make such a beautiful remembrance  possible: to the staff of the Architect of the Capitol, all the offices  under the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate and her team,  and the Press Gallery; to the volunteers from my own staff and from  other congressional offices who freely gave their time; to the staff of  the Capitol Visitor Center who ensured that tens of thousands of people  could share this experience; to the men and women of the Capitol Police  who watch over us all; to the U.S. military, the envy of the world.  Special thanks to Stef Muchow, my director of operations, who played  such a tireless role in conducting this orchestra, going back through  the entire weekend leading up to Monday, and to so many others who  worked through the weekend and around the clock to help the legislative  branch coordinate a dignified sendoff befitting this remarkable man  whom we honor. I thank you, and the Nation thanks you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the  Senate voted yesterday to advance the nomination of Bernard McNamee to  serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Today, we will vote  on his confirmation. I encourage every one of my colleagues to join me  in supporting this abundantly well-qualified nominee.   After Mr. McNamee, we will continue moving ahead with the personnel  business. We will vote on the confirmation of Kathleen Kraninger to  lead the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Ms. Kraninger brings  a wealth of experience to an Agency in need of a renewed, consumer- focused mission. I urge each of my colleagues to join me in voting to  get her started in this important work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, for 8 years,  President Obama landed blow after blow in his War on Coal. As we all  know, it wasn't just the coal companies that endured the pain; hard- working families--many who live in economically distressed communities  that relied on mining jobs--became the casualties of this ideological  agenda. In my State of Kentucky, for example, those policies inflicted  serious damage that is still being felt years later.   That is why I was so grateful to hear that later today, the Trump  administration will begin the process to undo and replace another Obama  anti-coal regulation. Throughout the Obama administration, my  Republican colleagues and I did everything we could to stop this  assault on vulnerable communities. Where this particular rule is  concerned, I personally led the charge, including as the lead sponsor  of a resolution to cancel it altogether.   Republicans knew these policies would stymie American competitiveness  and do little to actually help the environment. Despite our best  efforts, President Obama's EPA worked overtime to shutter existing coal  plants and, with this rule in particular, stop new ones from being  built. It was the fulfillment of one of his most troubling campaign  promises, which many of us in coal country remember very well. Here is  what he said:         If somebody wants to build a coal-fired power plant, they       can. It's just that it will bankrupt them.    When we blocked the legislation he originally pitched, President  Obama chose to go it alone and try to implement aggressive regulations,  often bending the rule of law in the process. When we used the tools  available to us to bring relief to American families, we were met each  time with vetoes. But everything changed when the American people  elected President Trump. We have worked hand in hand to end the War on  Coal and to bring relief.   Earlier this year, the President unveiled his plan to dismantle the  so-called Clean Power Plan, a policy designed to shut down nearly every  active coal plant. Now President Trump's EPA is also targeting another  regulation that would have made it nearly impossible to build any new  plants in the future. This is a crucial step toward undoing the damage  and putting coal back on a level playing field.   On behalf of coal families throughout Kentucky, I applaud the Trump  administration. This runaway regulation needs to be rolled back and  replaced with a more reasonable and achievable set of standards. Coal  deserves a level playing field, and that is what this White House is  trying to accomplish. I look forward to reviewing the proposal in the  coming days and continuing to work with President Trump on this  critical issue.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this is that time at the end of a  Congress when inevitably some of our Members go on to something else  and leave this body. I want to take this opportunity this morning to  pay tribute to another distinguished Member of the Senate who is  leaving us at the end of this year.   Senator Bob Corker is one of the most hard-working and, frankly,  relentless Members of this body. He is a builder by trade and a fixer  by nature. Senator Corker is always a man on a mission. Our  distinguished colleague hails from a State with a long history of  impressive Senators. Tennesseans such as Howard Baker, Al Gore, Bill  Frist, and, of course, our colleague Lamar Alexander all developed  national reputations as leaders. But after 12 years of working with  Bob, I could not feel more comfortable saying that he himself will now  become a part of that great Tennessee legacy. He has met that high bar,  and he set it high himself.   No sooner could any Senator turn his or her attention to some  important but stalled initiative--some dead-end negotiation, some  thorny national problem--then you would see Bob Corker diving into the  fray and attacking the problem with everything he had.   The limitless work ethic, the entrepreneurial drive--these things  have defined Bob Corker since long before he was sworn in as a Senator.  He started working odd jobs at age 13. At 25, he had saved up enough  money to cofound his own construction company--25 years old--and strike  out for himself. That firm grew from an $8,000 lark into a major  operation that spanned more than a dozen States.   Bob was a natural. He was constantly sniffing out opportunities and  tackling them with vigor. Along the way, he picked up what some close  to him now joke is an addiction to the feeling of a closing handshake-- that sign that needs were met, a deal was done, and both parties would  walk away happy.   The term ``workaholic'' might be putting it mildly. I am told that  after one particularly hairy negotiation ended in success, Bob  exclaimed, ``I'd sell it back to him--if I could turn around and buy it  again!''   Unlike many of his colleagues, Bob did not necessarily always aspire  to public service.   In fact, it took a direct appeal to his builder's instincts to set  this political career in motion.   Bob saw a message in a church bulletin. They needed volunteers with  construction experience to help a mission in Haiti. Bob went along,  along with his father, and he came back with the drive to keep doing  real good for real people.   That conviction eventually took him to city hall in Chattanooga,  where people still talk about the transformative wave of education  reform, economic development, and public improvements that was  unleashed during his time as mayor.   Tennesseans liked what they saw. They decided the next chapters of  Bob Corker's serial success story should be written right here on their  behalf in the U.S. Senate.   So if I even tried to relate a comprehensive catalog of everything  Bob Corker has gotten accomplished in the Senate, this speech would be  our last act of business before New Year's, but a few highlights stand  out especially.   It was early in Senator Corker's first term when the financial crisis  threw our economy into chaos, but this fired-up freshman immediately  started working with committee chairs and new friends across the aisle.  He became a pivotal player, putting his private sector acumen to great  use in helping craft policies to begin restoring stability.  [[Page S7325]]    He has been a leading voice on housing reform, of course, and the  combination of his background with his post on the Foreign Relations  Committee has led to some unique Bob Corker accomplishments. Just this  year, he has been hard at work on the BUILD Act to overhaul how America  makes loans to new projects in the developing world.   He was also a key champion of the electrify Africa bill that became  law in 2016, laying groundwork for a more stable power grid across that  continent.   There are also other subtler ways he has remained the consummate  businessman. Tennesseans know that many of the good things their junior  Senator has achieved for his home State didn't even involve  legislation. Every bit the former mayor, Bob has continued to hustle to  convince every new job and new investment in sight why his home State  is the place for them--phone call by phone call, meeting by meeting.   So the Senate is preparing to say goodbye to one of our most  energetic and accomplished Members. We will miss his enthusiasm and his  expertise, but we will also miss his famous generosity and the great  kindness everyone close to Bob jumps at the chance to describe.   He is thoughtful to those he knows well and to those he has just met.  I have it on good authority that on at least one occasion, Bob met a  promising young man working in a checkout line and signed him up right  there on the spot for a job interview with his chief of staff.   Most recently, we know Bob Corker as the brilliant chairman of the  Foreign Relations Committee. He has traveled constantly. He has engaged  issues around the world with an enormous degree of skill and capacity.  He is a powerful voice for American interests and those of our allies  and a forceful, influential thorn in the side of those who might wish  us harm.   He has also used that position to champion vulnerable people around  the world. His spearheading of the End Modern Slavery Initiative Act,  focusing resources and attention on a humanitarian crisis affecting  literally millions, will be a core piece of that legacy.   I know Bob prides himself on bringing more regular order back to the  committee and getting it back to basics--legislation, treaties. Under  his leadership, the committee passed the first authorization bill for  the State Department--listen to this--in 14 years.   Predictably, that Bob Corker work ethic is on full display when he is  traveling the world on our Nation's behalf. I hear that when Bob was  leading a trip to Israel and Palestine a few years ago, he heard about  smuggling tunnels between Egypt and Gaza and decided to go see them  himself.   So the way I heard it, he arranged for ground transportation to Gaza,  examined the system, and was back in Tel Aviv later that day to discuss  the situation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.   I will admit, though, that I am plenty excited to see what this  hugely accomplished individual will get into next, and there is plenty  of talk about what mission is next in the queue.   I have heard his name is in the hat for an opportunity envied by many  in this Chamber, and that is the chance to spend a lot more time with  family. I am sure Elizabeth and the family will oblige with a smooth  confirmation process.   I have to admit, whatever comes next, I really doubt we will be able  to call it a retirement in any ordinary sense of the word. You see, I  have heard what happens when Bob Corker tries to relax.   Apparently, there was one summer when he endeavored to take up  waterskiing. You know--nice, lazy days; soak in the sunshine. Well,  that didn't last very long. Bob went all in. He practiced and practiced  and kept at it all summer, and soon he was a masterful but somewhat  exhausted and burned-out water-skier. Once the challenge was gone, on  to the next thing, on to the next deal, on to the next construction  project.   So, Bob, we will miss you a lot. The Senate and the great State of  Tennessee will miss your service, but we just simply can't wait to see  what you build next.    Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.J. Res. 143.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  joint resolution be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the joint resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1046.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.
