 Madam Speaker, as we wrap up this week in Congress, I  would like to address some issues that I feel have not been discussed  as much as they should be in the Chamber this week, and I look forward  to the issues being highlighted when we return from our break 10 days  from now.   First of all, I would like to discuss the very concerning memos  coming out of the Richmond office of the FBI. The FBI has kind of  embarrassed us over the last year, in that there are areas in which I  would consider more political in nature, but the FBI, perhaps like  their counterparts in China or Russia, seem to go after people for what  they think more than what they do.   We found out in the last month that they have decided to equate  traditional Catholics with groups that ought to be monitored so that  they don't do anything too untoward.   In their memo, they implied that perhaps traditional Catholics,  without evidence that I know, may be opposed to affirmative action,  like the majority of Americans. They may not be all on board with the  LGBTQ agenda. They may not be thrilled with President Biden's  immigration policy. Horror of horrors, they might like to attend a  service with Latin Mass.                                time  1300    I am not Catholic personally, but I have friends who I think would  consider themselves conservative Catholics. The idea that they would  consider conservative Catholics in line with being an enemy of the  state is incredibly scary. I know traditional Catholics will not do  very well in communist China today, and that is perhaps not surprising.  That is one of the reasons why we worry about what goes on in China. It  is very scary that this administration would be targeting conservative  Catholics for additional monitoring, and it is something that we should  be very mindful of and something we should insist on.   They have said that they are revoking the memo, which is nice. But  when you just say that we are getting rid of the memo because it  doesn't meet our exacting standards, it implies that you are getting  rid of the memo because it is true and you feel bad that your true  feelings about conservative Catholics have now been made public.   I have not seen any press release from the FBI, and I hope to see it,  in which people are removed from the FBI, saying we don't want you  there anymore. If you view your job as not one in which we are going to  track down people who are counterfeiting or tracking down people who  are selling fentanyl in the State but instead are going to spend your  resources monitoring conservative Catholics, that is of great concern.   Like I said, I personally am not Catholic, but I will tell you, after  seeing that memo from the FBI, if I was a member from an Assembly of  God church, a Wisconsin Lutheran Synod church, most Baptist churches,  evangelical churches, or Orthodox Jewish, I would be scared of where  our country is going.   I insist that the FBI open up their files and tell us exactly who  drafted these repugnant memos and whose idea it was out of Washington,  out of Richmond, who knows, that the FBI should be involved in  targeting conservative Catholics.   I hope the rest of the people in this body, including my leadership  team, talks about it every day until we get back or until we get a  better explanation from the FBI of exactly what was going on and who,  in particular, were the employees of the FBI who thought it was a good  idea to monitor conservative Catholics, of which apparently one piece  of evidence is attending Latin mass.   Now, I think we should also have a look at a story that began about 2  years ago. We can kind of follow it along and see the degree to which  President Biden's administration is following the demands made of them  about 2 years ago.   About 2 years ago, when the Senate was 50/50, with a Democrat Vice  President, U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth and Mazie Hirono said that  they were tired of confirming any White men appointed by President  Biden. That is kind of a scary thing. Actually, they said it would be  okay to confirm White men if they were gay.   After 2 years were up, a legal journal did a study and found out that  2 years into the Biden administration, only 5 out of 97 judges were  White men. We were able to determine that 1 of the 5 is gay. We don't  know about the others.   I think that is a little bit scary. I think if you are going to take  the legal community collectively--remembering that you don't really  appoint people to the Federal judiciary when they are 26 years old--so  when we look at the community of people age 35 and up and say, we are  going to try to find the best judges we can, I would think more than 5  out of 97 judges would be White men who are not gay. But that is what  we have. Actually probably less than 5. It is 4 or 3 or whatever.   I think it is something for the media to pick up on and ask some more  questions here.   Does the Biden administration really feel that only 5 of 97 judicial  openings would be best filled with a White man?  [[Page H1687]]    I would be asking questions, since apparently Senator Duckworth and  Senator Hirono felt it was important to give preference to gay men over  straight men. I would ask how many of the few White men appointed are  gay and how many are straight. I think that is something that if the  media was on the ball, they would be asking that question.   We do know that there are strong elements on the left that don't like  traditional families. We know the close ties between the Democrat Party  and Black Lives Matter and how early on Black Lives Matter said they  don't like western prescribed traditional families. I always objected  to the way Black Lives Matter says that, because I think we have  traditional families with a mom and dad at home through all sorts of  different backgrounds, not just in Western Europe. But they,  themselves, describe it as western prescribed traditional families.   I hope that beyond this rather obscure legal journal, we would have a  little more investigation by the press and perhaps investigation by  some of the relevant committees.   Are we continuing down the path of apparently actively discriminating  against White heterosexual men?   I mean, that is clearly what these two Senators wanted. I think it is  very concerning that they are getting exactly what they wanted. It is  like the Biden administration is just following their tune.   Hopefully, we will see more articles about this in the paper over the  next couple weeks. If I do not get what I want here, hopefully  Republican leadership will weigh in and force the Biden administration  to comment on this issue and the backgrounds of some of their  appointees.   Given the obsession, or their apparent view of the world, the Biden  administration does view people as just representative of where their  ancestors lived 200 years ago.   I don't view it that way. I think most Americans view people as  individuals. If you ask what do you think about John or what do you  think about Mary or what do you think about Peter? You talk about their  views on things. Maybe you talk about their upbringing or where they  grew up, but you don't say the most important thing about that person  is whether their ancestors are from Spain or England or India or  wherever.    Unfortunately, the Biden administration basically seems to throw away  the rest of the resume and focus primarily on ethnic background. That  is unfortunate.   One way we can see it is in their proposed budget. They seem to put  diversity police in all of their different agencies. It is something  that is growing more and more in our universities, as well.   Some of these diversity police are making $200,000 a year, which is  something that scares me in its own right. If you are going to be  making $200,000 a year, a lot of people will say anything. If your  $200,000-a-year job depends on the rather warped idea that we should  hire, fire, or promote people based on where their great, great  grandparents are from, these people are going to be running around the  country telling businesses, telling students, that when you meet  somebody, the most important thing is their ethnic background. We have  seen the result of having these people running around the university  and the obsession with this view of the world.   We did have a hearing this week looking at universities, and we will  talk about universities again in a second. But there are a lot of  universities, who complain that tuition is too high, who purport to  care about the high student loan debt out there, who have no problem  hiring people for $150,000 or $200,000 a year to preach to children  that they ought to walk around with a chip on their shoulder because of  their background, despite the fact that clearly people are coming from  all around the world and succeeding in America.   It is kind of a defeatist thing to tell people that they are going to  be discriminated against based on ethnic background. I have talked  before about people from all around the world showing up at a swearing  in ceremony where people become American and looking at all the people  who are hitting the ground running from all around the globe.   I always talk about, in my own district we have a huge Hmong  population. I look at how successful they are, how hardworking, and how  they are living the American Dream. Then you hear about these people  making $200,000 at our university campuses to tell people they ought to  walk around with a chip on their shoulder and saying what a horrible  country America is.   In any event, I hope all alumni around the country pay attention to  what is going on in their alma maters and make sure they are not  wasting the students' precious tuition dollars on hiring these people.   Now, we have seen the result of these people recently, or this  intolerance that they promote, in two separate universities. We are all  familiar with what happened at Stanford University. A judge showed up  there carrying ideas that if not a majority, close to a majority of  Americans hold. They weren't big on transgender people going into the  other persons' bathroom and what have you.   They whipped up almost a physical confrontation at Stanford, which,  when I get online, is supposed to be the second-best law school in the  country, at least according to somebody. These potential lawyers, if  they come from Stanford, they are going to wind up becoming Federal  judges, very important jobs. They are shouting down people with views  on transgender people different than the population as a whole. I don't  know how these people are going to get back to home base and become  productive lawyers, much less productive judges or productive  bureaucrats in the future.   We did have a hearing on this the other day, but I think we should  have more hearings, specifically about what is going on with Stanford.   We found similar intolerance of First Amendment free speech at  Georgetown, another supposedly good law school. We had a student step  forward, William Spruance, and talk about what happened to him when he  questioned the guidelines with regard to masks. If you get on the  internet, there are all sorts of people who will say different sort of  things about masks, different things about vaccines. But apparently,  because he stepped outside the orthodoxy at Georgetown Law School, he  was threatened and he had to undergo a psychological evaluation.   Doesn't that sound like something from the Soviet Union?   If you disagree with the state, you have to see a psychiatrist  because you must be mentally ill if you don't understand what a great  guy Joseph Stalin is.   Sounds like that is what we have going on here at Georgetown; send  somebody for a psychiatric evaluation if he doesn't agree with the  conventional view on how to deal with COVID.   I hope that there is widespread outrage. We like to think people who  graduate from college are taught to be open-minded and look at  different views on things. But instead, apparently coming out of  Georgetown, you are taught everybody must fall in line with the state  or fall in line with the leadership of the law school, and if you  don't, we will weigh in. Despite the fact that you may have spent 2 or  3 years of money and time going to the law school, we are going to do  what we can to make sure you don't become a member of the bar  association and you won't be able to use that degree. Because far more  important than your grades or what you know is going on in school is  that you know that once you become a lawyer, you wind up being obedient  to the state.   It should be of great concern to the bar association across the  board. I think the American Bar Association ought to look at what is  going on both in Stanford and Georgetown, which--I think, maybe because  of what they were 20 or 30 years ago--still have a good reputation. I  am sure they will still sucker some kids into going there.   But what is going on with the intolerance at both of these law  schools is something that should be looked at, and I hope perhaps  individual bar associations around the country also want to monitor  this, as to what we can make of the intolerance in both of these law  schools.                                time  1315    My final comment as far as what is going on this week is something I  have  [[Page H1688]]  talked about in the past and want to talk about one more time. That is  what is going on in Ukraine.   My major concern with the Biden administration is I don't think they  are trying to end this war. I mean, we are where we are, but the longer  the war goes on, the closer the alliance between Russia and China goes.  In the relatively recent background, we had a thousand McDonald's in  Russia. I know people in my personal life who had jobs in Russia. We  had Russians coming here doing jobs on our farms. The college-aged kids  from Russia would come here with special visas working in the vacation  industry.   Obviously, right now relationships are falling. With regard to China,  over time, relationships are getting worse and worse, which is a  dangerous thing. We have had peace with China for well over 60 years. I  don't know why we can't do another 60 years.   President Biden is not making, I believe, an effort to wrap up this  war. It shouldn't be that difficult. Ukraine has the second lowest  birth rate of any country in the world. If there is any country that  doesn't want to lose some of its young people it ought to be Ukraine.   Nobody can tell me that Vladimir Putin thought that when he entered  Ukraine the war would be going on this long. It is another country with  a low birth rate. It is a country that is losing people as they  immigrate to other countries.   Both Ukraine and Russia should have motive to end this war, and  eventually it will end. The sooner it will end, the better. I am afraid  the Biden administration seems satisfied to just sit there, let things  go on, every day more young Russians and more young Ukrainians die. Not  only is that a tragedy in its own right, but every day that this war  goes on, it is going to be that much harder to reach peace.   I strongly wish that President Biden would use this interlude before  we try to put more billions of dollars on Ukraine that he would--if the  United States can't do it, and I can understand why we can't broker  peace because we don't look like we are neutral in this fight--beg the  Turks or the Israelis or the French or somebody who has more standing  to step in and see if we cannot find an end to this war before it  becomes much more catastrophic; before maybe the United States becomes  involved; before Russia decides to shoot something at Western Europe,  or use its submarines off of American shores.   I strongly hope that the press, when they get a chance to interview  President Biden, ask him: What are you doing or do you feel it would be  good for this war to end, or are you just going to throw up your hands  and pretend you are an innocent bystander? If the war goes on another 4  or 5 years, it is all fine by President Biden.   Those were four issues that I don't think we paid enough attention to  during the course of the week.   I hope the press corps gives them some attention during the next week  when we are back in our districts, and I hope our leadership brings  more attention to them when we return from our districts in 11 days  from now.   Madam Speaker, we will go for one more topic right now while my good  friend returns from his office.   There is an effort made right now in America with regard to school  lunches to shift from milk to sugary drinks. This is something else we  don't pay a lot of attention to, but a lot of children get a lot of  their food from school lunch.   I would be hard-pressed to find anybody who would say that we are  better having kids drink sugary, gooey drinks than wholesome milk. Milk  has been around since the Bible, right? Israel, the land of milk and  honey.   Apparently, there is an anti-milk feeling out there. I do know that  gooey, sugary drinks are sold by big corporations that are very active  in all segments here in Washington. I hope that this is something else  the press will pick up on.   Just because little children can't vote doesn't mean that this ought  to be a banner headline, at least once a month, as to whether the next  generation of children is raised on gooey, sugary drinks or wholesome  100 percent milk, which has been such a big part of the diet of  Americans since our founding.   We hope that our bureaucracy holds the line and does good research  into the good and the bad of sugary drinks, as well as the nutritious  value of 1 percent whole milk.   Again, if any members of the press or the Chair want to look into  this, I think it will be very important. We have spiraling out of  control healthcare costs in this country. The health of the next  generation is largely going to be determined--or to a large degree be  determined--by what is going on with the youngest children.   We are at a precarious time in our country in which the drug  companies want to prescribe en masse anti-obesity drugs to little  children. I heard this week that parents are being told that sometimes  their children, as young as 8 or 9, are going to begin to be prescribed  anti-obesity drugs.   I can understand why that is a gold mine for the drug companies. We  are such an over-drugged country already, and if they can make our  young people a little more pudgy--the idea that they would have to take  anti-obesity drugs for the next 70 years of their life--the eyes of  some of these pharmaceutical executives must just brighten up at the  idea that that has become the norm of America.   I suggest that we step back for a second, analyze what is healthier  and what is less likely to make you obese, and encourage healthy foods.  I think we are also talking here with regard to the WIC program. I hope  we weigh in both on the WIC and the food stamps and the school lunch  programs, all with more nutritious foods.   If we get back more of the nutritious foods that the average American  was eating 60 years ago, we wouldn't have to worry about giving all the  young children anti-obesity drugs because people of my generation lived  their whole life without them.   I can understand it might be more profitable for some people, they  have a lot of obese kids. We don't need that. It is bad for them. I  hope the press really monitors what is going on as we try to step away  from whole milk and other, what I will call, natural foods, instead of  pushing their way toward sugary, processed food. I think that is one of  the reasons why America's children right now are so much heavier than  they were when I was a child. We look forward to that situation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
