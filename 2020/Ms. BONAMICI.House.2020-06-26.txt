 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 76, the veto override.   The Obama administration wrote the original borrower defense rule to  provide defrauded students with the debt relief they are entitled to  under the Higher Education Act.   Rather than protect students, however, DeVos rewrote the rule to make  it nearly impossible for students who are victimized by deceptive  institutions to get the relief they deserve. That is not justice.   Mr. Speaker, five months ago, I urged my colleagues to support the  resolution to reverse Secretary DeVos' harmful new borrower defense  rule. I was glad it passed with bipartisan support.   We are here today because the President has chosen to veto the  resolution and stand with Secretary DeVos and unscrupulous institutions  that cheated students. This is indefensible.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a challenging time for our country, but this  should not be hard. Let's stand with the victims of deception, the  students we represent across the country, not with unscrupulous  institutions, not with Secretary DeVos, and not with Donald Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join together and override this  veto.
