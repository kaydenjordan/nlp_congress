 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 95th birthday  of Lou Pecora, a beloved member of our Orange County community.   Lou was born in Pennsylvania where his family business was making  boots for coal miners. Many of his friends went to Wall Street, but  Lou's passion was on Main Street where he found his love for education.   Lou began as a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University where he  taught business to English majors, preparing young professionals with  all the skills necessary to succeed in a changing world.   It took getting stuck under a bridge during a snowstorm in  Pennsylvania for Lou to decide to finally move to the West Coast.  Naturally, he decided to move to our great city of Santa Ana, and he  has been there ever since.   Lou believes in living a good life. He believes in friends, good  friends, and giving back. He and his partner, Joe, were together for 55  years, and they have been embraced by our community because of their  charisma and charm.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Lou a happy 95th birthday, and I wish him many  more.                            ____________________
