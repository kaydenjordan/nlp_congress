 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor World Refugee Day, a  day that is very special to the famous city of Utica, New York, in the  heart of the 22nd Congressional District, a place that I have  represented and lived my entire life.   Utica was recognized recently as the home to refugees, and I am so  honored  [[Page H4986]]  to be a part of this great tradition in Utica.   In quite an unusual portion of my background, I had the opportunity  to spend time in the former Yugoslavia. I also was the sole employee at  the former Yugoslav Consulate before the tragic war in Yugoslavia,  which broke the country up in the early nineties.   As a part of my commitment to and interest in the people from  Yugoslavia, I was instrumental in helping bring a huge number of  Bosnian refugees to Utica, New York, back in the early nineties and  into the late nineties. And I am so pleased that I was able to have the  opportunity, with my family business, to create the very first Bosnian  newspaper in Utica, known as Mostovi, which means bridges in Bosnian.   Today, the Bosnian refugees make up one of the largest, if not the  largest, Bosnian refugee communities in the Nation. They have done a  wonderful job in Utica in successfully starting businesses and  contributing greatly to our community, along with many other refugees.   I just wanted to take this moment to recognize Utica and to thank our  tremendous Bosnian refugees for their contributions to our Nation and  especially to our community because without them, we would never see  the prosperity and the growth that we have seen in our small-business  community from their ingenuity and their kindness and their generosity  to us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Faso for his leadership,  and also for the great comments from Congressman Collins in the western  New York district and for coming up with this really great piece of  legislation.   It is no secret that New York residents pay among the highest taxes  in the Nation. Combined State and local taxes consume over 13 percent  of the average household income.   Decades of tax-and-spend policies have depleted the wallets of  hardworking middle class families and forced many small businesses-- including family farms; once a tradition in New York--into closure, and  driven lifelong residents out of our State in record numbers forever.  These burdensome taxes, coupled with crushing regulations, have led to  the worst business climate in the country. Small businesses, which  create over 70 percent of the new jobs, face the threat of extinction  in New York.   Year after year, New York continues to be ranked the highest in out- migration in the entire Nation. Nearly 200,000 people have left the  Empire State, and two of the worst hit regions--the Mohawk Valley and  the southern tier--are located in the 22nd District. Additionally, the  two largest cities in our district--Utica and Binghamton--are ranked  last and second to last in economic growth.   Hardworking families and our job creators desperately need tax  relief. That is why I am working with the New York delegation and the  Republican congressional delegation to lead the charge by cosponsoring  the Property Tax Reduction Act sponsored by Mr. Faso and Mr. Collins  and cosponsored by the rest of us.   As a note, I would just like to mention that, as a former member of  the State assembly, I did sponsor legislation very similar to the type  of relief being proposed in this wonderful piece of legislation known  as the Property Tax Reduction Act. That legislation was cosponsored in  a bipartisan way with Democrats who also recognized the need to change  the paradigm in New York State.   The Property Tax Reduction Act will bring the largest local mandate  relief initiative to my area in my lifetime, potentially saving the  taxpayers in the 22nd District more than $167 million annually in  unfunded State Medicaid mandates. This bill relieves county governments  from the burden forced upon them by Albany bureaucrats led by our  Governor.   Currently, in New York State, the law requires approximately $2.3  billion, as was mentioned earlier, that is taken from our local county  governments and given to the State for the Medicaid program. This  amounts to about $140 million per week.   In 2015, Oneida County was forced to divert more than 80 percent of  the property tax levies to subsidize Albany's bloated budgets. This  amounts to $54.4 million annually in Oneida County losses every year to  cover the cost of their share of Medicaid.   In Broome County, more than half of the county's $70 million in  property tax revenue, about $37 million, was taken from the county last  year and diverted to Albany--a loss of more than, as I said, $37  million. This is money that would otherwise go to reduce property  taxes, fund our schools, make much-needed improvements to  infrastructure, and support our first responders, among many other  programs, that we need on a county level.   Combined property and sales tax rates as a percentage of value rank  many of New York's counties among  [[Page H4989]]  the highest taxed counties in the Nation, with Oneida County being  ranked 19 in the latest Tax Foundation survey. No other State in the  country abuses its local governments and taxpayers quite like Albany  does in order to fund its most expansive and really overly generous  Medicaid programs in the Nation.   New York's Medicaid program has the highest incidents of fraud,  abuse, and waste in the country. If other States can provide high- quality healthcare to vulnerable citizens without taking advantage of  local taxpayers, so can New York. The imposition of over $2.5 billion  in Medicaid costs on to the counties is nearly seven times costlier  than what counties in California pay, despite having higher enrollments  and expenditures.   The Property Tax Reduction Act requires Governor Cuomo and the State  to pay its full share of the Medicaid program that it should be paying  in full and that it also forces on to the county and local governments.   This bill does not propose cuts to the programs in the 22nd District.  Rather, it requires Albany to put its fiscal house in order. It  requires Albany to take stock of the money that it has been using,  sending these unfunded mandates to our strapped local governments.   This legislation, as the sponsor has indicated, gives the State ample  time to realign the budget, to rein in out-of-control spending, and to  give the taxpayers relief once and for all at the county level.   If Governor Cuomo chooses to hurt the citizens by slashing programs  that upstate New Yorkers want and need with a mammoth State budget that  was over $152 billion this year for fiscal year 2017, that is his  choice, not something that has been brought on by that act. His failed  leadership continues to produce budgets laden with unconstitutional  executive pork and wasteful spending.    In fact, let's just take a look at a couple of the items. Over $370  million in Albany's budget these past few years was spent on the  corrupt and mismanaged StartUP New York program, which produced only  one-third of the promised jobs. Over $1.3 billion in tax breaks have  been handed over to Hollywood filmmakers in the last 2 years. In all,  Albany spends over $8 billion in taxpayer money on a job-creation  program with little results to show for it.   The bill will simply force the State to work over a period of several  years to responsibly reduce the unfair and unreasonable Medicaid  liability that has been forced on to our counties. Upstate New York is  in desperate need of property tax relief.   This bill is the first step in making the relief a reality. County  executives and local governments across the State have voiced their  support of this legislation.   While hardworking families struggle, Albany sits idly by. That is why  we are taking the lead on the Federal level to help revive our region  and bring business and people back to beautiful upstate New York. By  giving county governments a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reduce  property taxes, this bill will save millions of dollars and hard-earned  tax dollars for working families.   On behalf of the 22nd District, I just want to thank my colleagues  for really taking the effort to bring this to the floor and showing  true leadership in the face of difficult circumstances in finding a  real solution, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for all of us as  taxpayers in New York to finally have some relief, to grow our business  community, and to find some kind of dynamism in our economy. I thank  again the sponsors, Mr. Faso and Mr. Collins.                                time  2000     I want to mention one thing that I think is really  important. Both Congressman Faso and I served as members of the State  Assembly prior to serving in Congress. One thing that we both know is  that we are truly interested in helping people who are needy.   It isn't about the people who are truly needy; it is about the people  who are abusing the system and taking resources that are desperately  needed by our seniors and by people who really are, as I said, truly  needy. This is a way of providing more resources to them without having  the fraud, the abuse and waste, the mismanagement in Albany, and  forcing Albany into being more fiscally conservative, protecting our  counties so that we can provide those services for our communities.   I just want to make sure that we characterize that, because that is  something that we all care about as people who take an oath of office,  not just to uphold our Federal Constitution but also our State  constitution. We take that seriously.   I know we are all committed to helping those people, but also  remembering that we need to respect the taxpayers. The taxpayers need  to have proper management of their funds.   I want to commend the gentleman for his work and efforts in making  sure this comes to the floor and making sure we get this passed on the  Federal  [[Page H4990]]  level, because it has been a struggle for all of us through many years.  Having this come to reality is going to be, honestly, one of the  greatest mandate relief packages that I have experienced in my  lifetime, and I am grateful.
