 Madam Speaker, the pro-abortion lobby cheered last week as  House Democrats rushed through H.R. 3755, the abortion on demand until  birth act.   Throughout the course of the debate last Friday, I listened as my  colleagues across the aisle took to their bully pulpit and sang the  praises of the abortion industry in America.   The talking points that afternoon were so distorted from reality that  it was as if members of the abortion lobby were the ones that wrote  them.   Some Members claimed that passing this bill was a duty that must be  fulfilled to restore the rights of women. Others claimed it was a duty  that upheld the oath they took to defend the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, no matter the justification that was given, the  American people can see that this is yet another elaborate smokescreen  coming from the majority.   But what really shook me to my core was how abortion was being  normalized in those moments. Women's health was being used as a  euphemism for abortion, as if the health of the baby that is destroyed  is inconsequential, not to mention that half of the babies that are  aborted are female. You cannot claim that this issue is one of  ``women's health'' when that is the case.   The same sentiment applies to the phrase ``reproductive freedom''  that was thrown around multiple times. Explain to me how the process of  destroying an innocent baby resembles freedom for the baby. It is  outrageous to link abortion and the concept of freedom together.   These are the kinds of deliberate spin tactics that attempt to hide  the horrors of abortion from the American people. No set of elaborate  talking points from pro-abortion advocates can truly mask the societal  ill that is abortion.   Unfortunately, that only skims the surface of how abortion is being  advertised. The left's narrative on abortions has evolved to the point  where this immoral procedure is now associated with pride. Abortion is  not prideful. It is not a form of empowerment. Abortion is robbing a  human being of God's most precious gift: life.   While the left's narrative grows only more devious, the voices of  those who survived abortions, or whose parents chose life, continue to  be silenced. The stories of these men and women are invaluable, and  they deserve to be heard by everyone. That is the truth of the matter.   Madam Speaker, Republicans fundamentally understand that life begins  at conception and ends at natural death. We believe that life is a  precious and sanctified gift that God has bestowed upon us.   I am proud to stand alongside so many constituents of North  Carolina's Fifth Congressional District, as well as my Republican  colleagues in the people's House, in fighting to protect life.   The unborn deserve nothing less than unwavering advocates who stand  for them. I will always serve as a strong voice for the unborn, and I  do not plan on stopping anytime soon.                            ____________________
