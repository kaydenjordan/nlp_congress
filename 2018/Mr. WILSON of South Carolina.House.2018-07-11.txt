 Mr. Speaker, this week, Investor's  Business Daily published an editorial titled: ``Colorblind Boom in  Jobs.''   The editorial begins: ``It may be a surprise, but President Trump is  nowhere near as unpopular among minority voters as the biased  mainstream media suggest. Why is that? In a word, jobs.   ``Trump, it turns out, has been the most consequential President in  history when it comes to minority employment. In June, for instance,  the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell  to 4.6 percent, its lowest level ever. . . . ''   African American unemployment of 6.5 percent ``represents the second  lowest unemployment reading ever for Black Americans.   ``As for Asian Americans, unemployment similarly bounced off its all- time low. . . . ''   ``The truth is, the ripping jobs growth that began when Trump entered  office and picked up steam after his tax cuts has been good for  everyone in America--even liberal media pundits.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Best wishes, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with an impeccable record of  service to be on the Supreme Court of the United States.   Happy birthday, Jackson Gossett.                            ____________________
