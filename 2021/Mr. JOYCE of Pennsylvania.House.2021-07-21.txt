 Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R.  2467, the PFAS Action Act. This bill takes the wrong approach to  dealing with these complex and complicated chemicals.   A de facto ban on all PFAS substances will do nothing but prevent  secure disposal of existing chemicals and harm innovation of new, safer  products.   As a physician, I have personally seen the benefits provided by these  products. PFAS materials have a variety of uses in healthcare, ranging  from heart valves, cardiac stents, to coatings on contact lenses.    Thanks to technology developed using PFAS materials, surgeries, such  as those that are needed to repair a child's congenital heart defect,  no longer require risky open-heart surgery and can simply be done  through the arm.   Of course, we don't want dangerous chemicals in our water supply. But  to outright ban an entire family of products is not the answer. We  would not ban the entire periodic table because it includes arsenic and  mercury. We need a science-grounded, risk-based approach that  identifies the most harmful chemicals and treats them as such, rather  than have Congress regulate the entire family as a single group.   Inclusion in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act has the potential to slow down the cleanup process of  PFAS, divert resources from current higher-priority public health  issues and create another unfunded mandate for critical public  utilities and local governments.   Instead of interfering, it is time to let government agencies do  their work. And so I urge my colleagues, join me, vote ``no'' on H.R.  2467.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand for  the people of Cuba who are marching against the Communist government  that has oppressed them for decades.   In recent weeks, the Cuban activists have been kidnapped, jailed, and  murdered for daring to stand against the Communist regime.   Now is the time to stand against this brutality. We must urge world  leaders to cease all support for the Communist regime in Cuba.   We must ensure that Cubans can communicate freely with each other and  with the outside world. We must forcefully denounce the Cuban  dictatorship that has committed these crimes.   The Cuban people are rising up in the name of opportunity, the  opportunity that they see just 90 miles away on the American shores.   As the Cuban people protest in the streets, they are chanting,  ``Libertad,'' liberty. They are carrying American flags, and they are  calling out for freedom.   Now is the time for us to stand with them. It is time to put an end  to the murderous regime that has held the people of Cuba hostage for  the past 61 years.   Freedom. Freedom for all. Freedom for Cuba. Let them see what we have  here. Let them attain that freedom.                            ____________________
