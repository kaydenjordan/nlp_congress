 Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to this rule, which  was pushed through the Rules Committee as a closed rule and did not  make in order an amendment, which I support, offered by my colleagues,  Mr. Price, Mr. Connolly, and Mr. Engel.   Their amendment, like H. Res. 11, objects to the U.N. Security  Council Resolution 2334, which I believe was an unfair and one-sided  resolution that placed undue blame upon the State of Israel for the  impasse on peace negotiations.   Like the Obama administration, I am frustrated by the lack of  progress in recent years toward achieving a two-state solution to the  Israeli-Palestinian crisis. However, I do not believe that the  resolution passed by the Security Council contributes in any way to  positively moving this process along.   Let's not mistake the fact that the Palestinian Government, which  currently includes the terrorist faction Hamas, has done little to  support peace negotiations. By refusing to publicly recognize Israel's  right to exist as a Jewish state, condoning terrorist activity and  pursuing unilateral actions at international institutions in violation  of the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians have continuously placed  roadblocks to achieving peace.   Let me be clear, the ongoing settlement activity sanctioned by the  Israeli Government is also counterproductive to the peace process. If  the Israeli Government wants to remain a beacon of freedom and  democracy in the Middle East, they must recommit themselves to  achieving a peaceful two-state solution where a Jewish Israel exists  peacefully with the Palestinian state.    With the events of recent years, I am extremely fearful that the two- state solution is, if not dead, in critical condition. There are those  within both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments who are actively  working to ensure its demise. I think, as Members of Congress who  strongly support Israel, we should be doing everything we can to convey  to both the Israelis and the Palestinians that we will not stand by and  watch them torpedo the hope of a peaceful solution to this crisis.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 26 would exempt  rules concerning public health or safety from the burdensome  requirements of this legislation.   Simply put, when a rule is necessary to protect the health and safety  of the public, it is critical that the rule be put into effect without  unnecessary delay.   If this legislation is enacted without this amendment, it will create  an untenable regulatory environment that will make it nearly impossible  for agencies to safeguard the public welfare.   This legislation could bring to a grinding halt critical rulemaking  such as rules relating to the transportation of hazardous materials by  the Department of Transportation, clean air regulations by the EPA, and  worker-protection standards by OSHA.   For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  implemented an economically significant rule that, by May 2018, all new  vehicles must have rearview cameras. This regulation will help drivers  have better visibility behind their car, greatly reducing the  likelihood of backover crashes which largely involves small children.   But under the REINS Act, this rule would require a joint  congressional resolution with an unrealistic timeline for  implementation. For every year this rule would be delayed, the Traffic  Safety Administration estimates that there would be, on average, 15,000  injuries and 267 fatalities resulting from backover crashes.   Proponents of this legislation may argue that H.R. 26 contains an  emergency exemption which allows a major rule to temporarily take  effect following an executive order stating that there is an imminent  threat to public health and safety. Even when the threat is not  imminent, the danger to the public health and welfare may be great and  the fundamental responsibility to protect the public remains.                                time  1615    This legislation would substantially hinder the ability of agencies  to fulfill this obligation, placing Americans at greater risk for the  benefit of powerful corporate interests. In its present form, the  Coalition for Sensible Safeguards and the alliance of more than 150  consumer, labor, faith, and other public interest groups predict that,  by allowing Congress to even veto uncontroversial rules that protect  public health and safety, the REINS Act ``would make the dysfunction  and obstructionism that plague our political process even worse.''   In echoing this sentiment, the American Sustainable Business Council,  which represents over 200,000 businesses, opposes H.R. 26 because it  would recklessly place the burden of proof on the taxpayers in order to  protect themselves on environmental, health, and safety issues and  would shift responsibility away from powerful corporate interests.   While my amendment will not cure all that ails this legislation--and  there is a lot--it will address one of its most glaring flaws and  preserve the ability of agencies to protect public health and safety. I  urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman just made an assertion  that, in fact, nothing in this legislation does anything to frustrate  the goals of protecting health and safety; but, of course, it does. It  prevents the implementation of rules which, in fact, protect public  health and safety.   If my amendment were to pass, that statement would be true--it would  do nothing to frustrate it--but without this amendment, it prevents the  implementation of a rule that would, in fact, protect public health and  safety. It is a reasonable exemption that will ensure that we protect  the well-being and the health of our constituents. I urge all of my  colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
