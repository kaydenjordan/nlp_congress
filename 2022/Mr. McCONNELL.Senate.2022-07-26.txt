 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 93 percent of the American people are  concerned about inflation; 42 percent say they are struggling just to  stand  [[Page S3663]]  still financially; 63 percent say that gas prices, inflation, bills, or  the economy are their biggest concerns. That is because 100 percent of  the American people live in a country experiencing the worst inflation  in more than 40 years, and 100 percent of the American people live in a  country where things did not have to be this bad but for Democrats'  deliberate policy choices.   Don't take it from me. Listen to Larry Summers, Treasury Secretary to  President Clinton and NEC Director to President Obama. Here is what  Larry Summers had to say:         There wouldn't have been nearly the same kinds of supply       chain problems . . . if we weren't giving people who were       laid off unemployment insurance that was far more than the       salaries they had been earning . . . if we weren't mailing       checks willy-nilly . . . there would have been less spending,       that would have meant less bottlenecks.    He continued:         Printing money and distributing it well ahead of the supply       of goods is a prescription for inflation--and that's what we       did. We injected enough money into the economy to make total       spending grow at an 11.6 percent rate last year. When you       have 11.6 percent growth rate in spending, then on any       reasonable theory of how much capacity there is, you're going       to have a lot of inflation. And that's what we did.    That is a top Democrat talking, but he is intellectually honest. He  tried to advise Washington Democrats not to dump nearly $2 trillion  onto the economy, but, of course, they didn't listen. And now working  families are stuck with skyrocketing costs and bills as a consequence.   You would think the worst inflation in 40 years would be enough to  convince Democrats to stop running these painful experiments on  American families. But, if you can believe it, almost every House and  Senate Democrat would like to follow up this historic inflation with  massive new tax hikes. The same people who spent us into inflation want  to tax us all the way into recession.   So let's hope this small handful of Democrats who see the insanity of  this approach continue to stand strong for our country.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this past Saturday  brought yet another escalation in Russia's brutal war in Ukraine. The  ink had barely dried on a deal securing safe passage for Ukrainian  grain exports when Russian missiles hit the port city of Odesa.   Ukraine produces one-fifth of the world's high-grade wheat. Russia's  Black Sea blockade and the destruction of Ukraine's crops have left  vulnerable regions of the world literally on the verge of crisis. But  Vladimir Putin only managed to resist the urge to commit senseless  violence for about 24 hours.   Now, the fact that Putin was even compelled to negotiate was thanks  to the introduction of HIMARS long-range rockets and Harpoon anti-ship  missiles into Ukraine's arsenal. If Ukraine had had weapons like these  earlier, the blockade of Odesa could have been prevented in the first  place.   The Biden administration says its decision making throughout the  process has been deliberate and nuanced. History will likely judge  otherwise. The months before Putin's escalation clearly called for  boldness and resolve, to say nothing of the months since. But, too  often, the administration's first instincts have been to plot along  slowly and vacillate.    The Ukrainians have fought bravely to stop Russia's advance despite  being undermanned and outgunned. Just think what they could have  accomplished if the West had acted boldly to support Ukraine as storm  clouds were first gathering, or right away when the storm broke.   But, now, no one should need a reminder of the far-reaching impacts  of the war in Ukraine. Our eastern flank allies certainly don't. They  have been preparing to defend themselves literally for generations, and  from the beginning of Russia's latest offensive, they have reached deep  into their own inventories to help equip Ukraine.   Elsewhere in Europe, treaty allies have finally taken an important  lesson about investing in deterrence and self-defense to heart.  Countries like Germany have made historic commitments to increase  military spending. The Germans, Swedes, and others have also broken  historic precedent to share their stockpiles with Ukraine.   And, of course, Russia's war has led other major European states to  announce their intention to join the ranks of the strongest alliance in  world history. Last week, our colleagues on the Foreign Relations  Committee advanced the necessary protocols to ratify Sweden and  Finland's accession to NATO. There is now nothing preventing the  Democratic leader from calling these measures up for immediate  consideration and passage by the full Senate. The legislatures of other  NATO allies like Canada, Norway, Poland, and Germany have already  ratified them.   The United States would be fortunate to have two new treaty allies as  impressive and capable as Finland and Sweden. Both countries' high-tech  economies and extensive American-made systems will improve the  alliance's interoperability and instantly improve the state of burden- sharing the day they come in.   American leadership in the world has made possible the peace and  security our country enjoys today. That leadership is helping encourage  our allies to make sufficient investments in their own capabilities to  face down the shared threats, but American leadership is only as strong  as our willingness to make robust investments in our own capabilities.   President Biden has submitted a defense budget request that fails to  keep pace with growing threats and fails to keep pace with Democrats'  own inflation, and Senate Democrats are giving short shrift to the need  for a strong, bipartisan Defense authorization bill.   Russian aggression isn't the only threat to American interests today.  Rogue states like Iran and North Korea continue to march toward  devastating weapons. China's provocative behavior in the Indo-Pacific  continues to raise the stakes for long-term competition.   So there is no time--no time--to waste on either of these measures-- neither the Sweden and Finland protocols nor a strong, bipartisan NDAA.  We need to do all three as soon as possible.
