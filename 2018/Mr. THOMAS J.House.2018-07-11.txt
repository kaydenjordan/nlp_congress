 ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life of Nathaniel ``Nat'' Reed of Jupiter Island, a Florida  environmental icon who died today at the age of 84.   Mr. Reed loved nature and the Florida environment and devoted most of  his life to fighting for Florida's natural wonders like the Everglades.  My finest memory of him will be hunting quail near Hobe Sound.   As an aide to former Governor Claude Kirk, Mr. Reed successfully  stopped the construction of an airport in the Florida Everglades  because the construction would have meant devastation to the Everglades  and Big Cypress Swamp.   Mr. Reed appreciated wildlife and was also one of the authors of the  Endangered Species Act, which protects many animals, including several  in Florida. He later ended up founding 1000 Friends of Florida, to  preserve special places in our State.   Nat Reed is an institution in the State of Florida, and he was a  wonderful mentor to me. Our State lost a real leader and a friend to  many, and he will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
