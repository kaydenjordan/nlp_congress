 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Whole Veteran  Act. I thank the chairman of the Veterans Affairs' Committee, Mr.  Takano, and the ranking member, Dr. Roe, for their support for this  act, along with all members of our committee.   This is a bipartisan bill with a bipartisan goal, which simply is to  reform and continue to improve VA healthcare. Our bill will do that in  two very important ways.   First, we aim to make the VA a leader in the future of healthcare.  Many doctors have looked at how America's healthcare system is too  expensive and too reliant on prescription drugs. It turns out that not  all doctors think that the best way to deal with chronic pain, PTSD, or  depression is to simply hand out more pills.                                time  1530    In fact, we believe that the future of healthcare is going to involve  a mix of old and new methods of treatment.   In the future, patients who are suffering will get access to yoga,  acupuncture, or meditation before they are ever exposed to these  addictive drugs. This is safer and it is also cheaper, and we believe  that, in the long-run, it is going to be better.   The NIH, which is the government's gold standard when it comes to  research, has looked at these treatments and found that yoga is  effective for back pain, that acupuncture is highly effective for  chronic conditions like osteoarthritis, and study after study has  documented the benefits of meditation and healthy eating when it comes  to anxiety, when it comes to stress, when it comes to chronic pain and  all of the drivers of the suicide crisis that we are seeing today. In  the right combination, these treatments will allow us all to spend less  on healthcare and to feel better in the future.   But perhaps, Madam Speaker, the most important part of our bill is  that it gives veterans more real choices and greater power to manage  their own healthcare.   I visited a Whole Health Clinic here in Washington, D.C., and the  veterans who were partaking in that clinic, they like it because they  get to pick which treatments work well for them based on how it makes  them feel. They pick the teachers they like and they go to the classes,  where they meet other veterans who they get to know and spend time  with, and it keeps them coming back.   One of the greatest challenges is how we keep people coming back to  the VA for treatment once they have got it.   To stop veteran suicide once and for all, one of the most important  things we have to do is go out and get all the veterans who are living  in isolation and not using the VA for care.   Thirteen of the 20 veterans who are committing suicide every day are  outside of the VA's reach. We have got to find them, and we have got to  give them a reason to come back. This is what the whole health program  does. It gives our veterans a reason to come back and stay in the VA  that they didn't have before.   We don't know right now which parts of the whole health program work  the best and which ones still need more work. Our bill will start to  answer that question. But we do know one thing, which is that there is  no time to lose.   Veterans serve this country because they want to prevent the  suffering of others, and now too many of them are suffering themselves.  We owe it to them to try anything that will work.
