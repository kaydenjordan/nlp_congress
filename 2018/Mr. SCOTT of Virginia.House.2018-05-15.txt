 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5242. This legislation under  consideration today will improve our understanding about the role of  school resource officers. But we must acknowledge that this bill barely  scratches the surface of what is actually required to keep our schools  safe, and I urge this body to do more.   In the wake of February's tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School in Florida, many have called for a so-called Federal focus  on hardening of our schools, which includes increasing Federal dollars  to hire more police officers and embracing the most harsh punishments  for school discipline, and even allowing school teachers to carry  firearms, despite the overwhelming evidence that many of these  initiatives do more harm than good.   In fact, anyone hoping for a discussion of evidence-based methods for  preventing school violence must be profoundly disappointed at our  reaction since February.   Anyone hoping that the call for harsher school discipline would be  sensitive to how it would be applied to students of color and those  with disabilities must be disappointed.   Anyone hoping this Chamber would find the political will to take a  stand with parents, students, and the overwhelming majority of  Americans to take action on sensible gun legislation must be  disappointed.   We have failed to act as one after another of these unthinkable  tragedies have become commonplace.   In the decades since the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School,  States and districts have rushed to increase school-based law  enforcement presence. The Parkland tragedy serves as a painful reminder  that this effort has not, despite its best efforts, eliminated mass  school shootings.   Nearly two decades later, mass shootings in schools still persist,  while student behavior has been criminalized, leading to millions of  students entering the school-to-prison pipeline.   H.R. 5242 would direct the Departments of Justice and Education to  conduct voluntary data collection on school districts' hiring of law  enforcement officers. And I would remind my colleagues that we have a  tool that collects a lot of data, not only on the presence of school  officers, but also on how they impact school equity.                                time  1700    I urge my colleagues to stand in defense of the Civil Rights Data  Collection. That is the Civil Rights Data Collection which collects  data on equity in education, data such as access to advanced placement  courses, data on suspensions, data on access to pre-K and other  questions of access and equity, and would call on the Trump  administration to affirm its intent to maintain the integrity of that  collection.   Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to stand with students and  parents in defense of civil rights under the guise of school safety.  The Trump administration has signaled its intent to revoke the  Education-Justice discipline guidance that provides districts with the  tools to address racial disparities in discipline in a way that would  not jeopardize school safety and ensure that school law enforcement  officers are trained to serve in a school setting.   Without a shred of evidence, Secretary DeVos has blamed mass school  shootings on civil rights protections and the guidance that clarifies  district-level obligations under Federal civil rights law.   I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on President Trump and  Secretary DeVos to discontinue their misinformation campaign and  maintain the entire so-called rethink discipline package. As districts  rush to hire resource officers, this body must commit to maintaining  resources that empower districts to do so without negatively impacting  equity in education.   Mr. Speaker, I also urge this body to increase investments in  education. Teachers and students need access to mental health services,  counseling, and evidence-based violence prevention programming.  Teachers need comprehensive support, including increased salaries. The  conversation on school safety that speaks only to hardening of the  schools and hiring law enforcement officers will harm far more people  than it will protect.   Lastly, I urge this body to consider and pass commonsense gun safety  legislation. Gun violence in and outside of the school is a public  health epidemic that merits bold and bipartisan congressional support.  Meanwhile, this bill does provide for the collection of data and the  hiring of police officers in our schools. This information can be  helpful as we decide how to best allocate resources to address school  safety.   Mr. Speaker, I therefore support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.  [[Page H3949]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Louisiana for introducing this bill. I urge my colleagues to support  it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
