 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill to  the floor.   I rise in support of Mr. Kean's bill.   Mr. Speaker, after President Obama's appeasement and inaction, Putin  took Crimea without firing a shot and invaded the Donbas, 15,000 people  were killed back in 2014. It was President Trump that started sending  Javelins and other lethal weapons to Ukraine to defend itself and  continued important training and logistical support of the Ukrainians  that had preceded his efforts.   It was President Trump that signed into law this annual funding every  year  [[Page H4826]]  of his Presidency. That is why this small nation of Ukraine with its  brave people, amazing drive, and passion for freedom have demonstrated  to the world that it is the best military in the territory of Ukraine.  Russia has stumbled from being the second largest power in the world  militarily to maybe barely the second best in Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, the price for less than 1 week of Federal spending  authorized by this Congress--less than 1 week of Federal spending--we  have seen the Ukrainians decimate the Russian military strength and set  it back decades.   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure tonight. I support the  reassessment of Ukraine's strategy to win and win promptly, too. Heads,  Ukraine wins. Tails, Russia, the invader, loses. We need to make sure  they have the right strategy and that it has got the right way to win  and win promptly.   I support the careful and prudent inspector general funding attached  to this bill to make sure that American taxpayer funds are spent in the  right way to have a decisive defeat of the Russians.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we adopt this bill with a strong bipartisan  vote.
