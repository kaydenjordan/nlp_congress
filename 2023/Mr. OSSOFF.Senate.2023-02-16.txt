 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Latin  American Chamber of Commerce of Georgia's 25th anniversary.   Over the last 25 years, the Latin American Chamber of Commerce of  Georgia has strengthened the State's Latin American community by  championing efforts that boost economic development, expand access to  new business opportunities, and promote civic engagement. Founded as  the Mexican American Business Chamber in 1998, the LACC today is one of  the largest Latin American organizations in the State of Georgia. The  chamber plays an important role in the extraordinary contributions of  Georgia's Latino community, and it stands as a pillar of unity and  diversity that keeps moving the State forward. Georgia's Latin American  diaspora community is diverse and fast-growing, and it is a privilege  to represent Georgia's Latin American community in the U.S. Senate.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize the Latin American Chamber of  Commerce of Georgia on its 25th anniversary and commend them for their  dedication to Georgia's Latino community.                            ____________________
