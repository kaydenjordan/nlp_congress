 Mr. Speaker, the chairman and ranking member  of the House Homeland Security Committee have negotiated in good faith  over several weeks a bipartisan bill--H.R. 3233--to establish a ten- member national commission to investigate the January 6th attack on the  Capitol.   I'm voting yes.   If enacted into law both the Republican and Democrat leaders would  each select five commissioners who would be tasked with investigating  the ``facts and causes'' of the attack.   The Commission may issue subpoenas, but subpoenas may only be issued  by agreement between the Chair and Vice Chairperson of the Commission-- one Democrat and one Republican--or by the vote of a majority of the  members of the Commission.   Any interim report, or the final report--which must be submitted to  the President and Congress no later than December 31, 2021--must be  agreed to by a majority of Commission members.   According to the text of H.R. 3233, the final report should include  ``findings, conclusions, and recommendations, which may include changes  in law, policy, procedures, rules, or regulations, to improve the  detection, prevention, preparedness for, and response to targeted  violence and domestic terrorism and improve the security posture of the  United States Capitol Complex and ensure the security of Members of  Congress and staff.''   The attack on January 6 resulted in a tragic loss of life and  physical injury. 140 Capitol and D.C. police officers were injured on  January 6th, including 15 who were hospitalized. Three police officers  later died--including a brave Capitol police officer from New Jersey,  Brian Sicknick, who died of a stroke on January 7th and two other  officers died by suicide. Four rioters died--one was shot by police.   It is my hope that the Commission will establish the truth and  provide a way forward to ensure that such an attack never happens  again.
