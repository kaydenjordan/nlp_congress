 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of my  bipartisan legislation that improves the safety of air travel. I also  thank my colleague, Mr. DeSaulnier, for his support and leadership on  this legislation, as well.   In 2022, the United States was home to 8 of the top 10 busiest  airports in the world. This means that, as Americans, we have no room  for error when it comes to aviation safety.   Although aviation is the safest form of travel, we must always strive  to be better. This is why we must address the notice to air missions,  or NOTAMs, system.   NOTAMs provide current, up-to-the-minute data to pilots on any aspect  of their flight. Unfortunately, NOTAMs are often buried in lengthy  reports, conflating important safety information with more common  alerts. These inefficiencies have the potential to create life- threatening situations, which have just been mentioned.   On January 11, 2023, all U.S. domestic flights were grounded for the  first time since 9/11. The latest reports from the FAA suggest that the  unintentional deletion of files caused this chaos.                                time  1300    No one person or one file should be able to take down our whole  flight safety system, but the NOTAM system is old and antiquated so it  comes as no real surprise.   Unfortunately, leadership at the Department of Transportation is more  concerned with woke politics and changing the name of the system,  rather than appropriate upgrades for aviation safety.   Mr. Speaker, I have been advocating for NOTAM upgrades for 4 years  now. My legislation, which creates a task force at the FAA with  important input from safety experts and industry professionals to  address both efficiency and resiliency of the NOTAM system, has passed  out of the House both in the 116th Congress and in the 117th Congress  in a bipartisan fashion, only to die in the Senate.   I encourage my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to pass my  legislation before another failure of the NOTAM system occurs. Our  pilots, crew members, and passengers are counting on us.   Mr. Speaker, we do have a change in the 118th Congress. The  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is being led by two of my  friends. Chairman Sam Graves is ready, able, and willing to change how  the committee works and actually bring forth legislation that is good  for the American people and good for our transportation. I have full  faith in my good friend, Ranking Member Larsen to do the same. We have  worked together in the past, and I see this committee succeeding with  the leadership that I have previously seen by the chair and the ranking  member.
