 Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to quickly add my thanks to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), who started this effort  in the last Congress with another colleague of ours, and I was  fortunate enough to join that team when I arrived here. Without his  dedication from the start, we would not be at this moment today.   I would also thank him for his example of leadership in the Marine  Corps and in Congress, which has inspired a generation of marines like  myself. And while we don't agree on everything, we always look for ways  to work together.   It is my belief in just listening to these speeches, particularly  from the veterans who serve in Congress, that there is so much that we  can work together on; and there are forces that are trying to divide  us, but there is still so much that we can agree upon.   So while this may seem like a small step, I would submit that this is  big. And I hope this is the beginning of more work that we can do on  behalf of the country, and that is what it should be about at the end  of the day.   So I just thank all of my colleagues. I thank the chairman for his  help. I couldn't be more proud that, in a divided time, we came  together to do something good on behalf of past generations of veterans  and on behalf of the next generation.
