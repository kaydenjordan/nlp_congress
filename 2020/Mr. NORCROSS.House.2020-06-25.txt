 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the importance of the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and I am honored to stand with my  colleagues here in Congress, and certainly with the Congressional Black  Caucus, to combat the epidemic of racial injustice.   As we know, this bill creates unprecedented reforms, needed reforms.  But the first step is to admit we have a problem, and apparently we  haven't done that as a Chamber in the whole.   This is not a standalone issue. It is one that continues today. It is  about ending racial profiling, transforming the culture of policing. It  is not us versus them. It is we, together.   My hometown of Camden, just 10 years ago, had the highest murder rate  in North America, called the most dangerous town, but reinvented their  police department--not alone, but together, changed their culture, now,  working together, always reviewing what they are doing: How can we do  this better? Sixty-three percent less murders, 73 percent drop in the  crime rate.    It can be done, but we have to do it together.   The President and Senate Republicans, seriously short. They merely  are suggestions, an insult to us in this House.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
