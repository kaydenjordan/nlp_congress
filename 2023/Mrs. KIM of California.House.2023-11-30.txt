 Madam Chair, I thank Chairman McCaul for  yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5961, the No Funds for  Iranian Terrorism Act, to keep Iran from accessing the $6 billion in  assets that were unfrozen in September.   This bill imposes sanctions on international financial institutions  that process, participate in, or facilitate transactions using or  involving the $6 billion in unfrozen Iranian assets that were  transferred from South Korea to Qatar in exchange for five hostages  kept in Iran in September.   While I am glad the hostages came back to their homes, we cannot  incentivize more hostage taking by the Islamic Republic of Iran.   The administration claims that this funding could be used only for  humanitarian purposes, but Iranian President Raisi has countered that  the Islamic Republic of Iran can use the assets ``wherever we need  it.'' Those are his words.   Allowing Iran to access these funds would be foolish. Hamas' October  7 attack on Israel showed the world how much destruction Iran is  capable of through its illicit finance of terrorist organizations.   We also now see Iran's proxy militia and terrorist organizations  carrying out attacks on U.S. troops and military assets in Syria and  Iraq.   Congress must take strong action to bolster our sanctions policy and  stop Iran from accessing assets that it can use to carry out its  terrorist agenda across the Middle East.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
