 Mr. President, I am on the floor to talk about the status  of America's healthcare system. As we speak though, the country is  obsessed with the question of the firing of FBI Director Comey and the  appointment last night of a special counsel who is going to seek to get  to the bottom of this question as to whether there was coordination  between the Trump campaign and the Russian Government and their  attempts to influence an American election.   There have been secret meetings happening in the Senate among  Republicans--reportedly 13 Republicans, to be specific--attempting to  craft a new version of legislation that passed the House of  Representatives, now, I guess, 2 weeks ago, that would rob healthcare  from 24 million Americans. According to the Congressional Budget  Office, it would drive up costs for everyone immediately by about 15  percent to 20 percent and jeopardize the protections that are built  into the law for people with preexisting conditions.   There is no CBO score on the latest House proposal because  Republicans decided to ram the bill through without the ability of  anyone to read the legislation. No one read that bill. Let's be honest.  It was filed hours before it was voted on, and no one knows the cost of  that bill because they didn't wait for a CBO score.   It is simply unbelievable that the House of Representatives decided  to reorder one-fifth of the American economy without reading the  proposal or without understanding its cost, but Republicans in the  Senate are attempting to pass their own version of a repeal-and-replace  bill. We await the results of these secret partisan meetings.   I think Democrats have been pretty clear that we would like to be in  this conversation. We want to preserve what works in the Affordable  Care Act, and there is a lot that works. A new report out just a couple  of weeks ago shows an astonishing decrease in the number of people who  face personal bankruptcy in this country. Why? Because half of personal  bankruptcies in the United States of America, prior to the Affordable  Care Act being passed, were due to medical debt. So the reason that  less people than ever before are having to declare personal bankruptcy  is because medical bills don't bankrupt them anymore because of the  Affordable Care Act. Let me guarantee you, that number will spike back  up if anything approximating the House bill passes.   We think there are good things in the Affordable Care Act. Our  constituents agree. Polling now routinely tells you the majority of  Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act, not replace it, but we  want to be part of a conversation in which we talk about keeping the  things that work and addressing the parts of the healthcare system that  don't work. Costs are still way too high. We would like more  competition on these exchanges. So let's have a conversation about  that.   As of today, Democrats are being shut out of the process. If you are  represented by Democrats in the U.S. Senate, you have no voice in this  process because Republicans have chosen to do it just amongst their own  party. I think that is a shame. I understand in the end, Democrats  passed a product in 2010 with Democratic votes, but anybody who was  here remembers that there was a long process by which President Obama  and Democrats in Congress tried to work with Republicans and brought  the bill through the committee process. The HELP Committee and the  Finance Committee had exhaustive meetings, hearings, and markups. In  the end in the HELP Committee, upon which I sit today, there  [[Page S3026]]  were over 100 Republican amendments that were accepted and included in  the piece of legislation that eventually passed on the floor of the  Senate.   As far as we know, this secret process happening behind closed doors  will include no Democrats now and will not go through a committee  process. If they ever come up with something that can come up with 50  votes, it will be rushed to the Senate floor. That is outrageous. We  want to be part of this process.   I am on the floor not to talk about what will happen if a bill  robbing healthcare from millions of Americans, jeopardizing protections  for people with preexisting conditions, comes to the floor of the  Senate, I want to talk about what is happening right now because  President Trump made it very clear, just a few days after he was sworn  in, that his desire was to kill the aspects of the American healthcare  system that are affected by the Affordable Care Act. By the way, that  is almost the entirety of the American healthcare system because that  bill did--in addition to extending coverage to 20 million Americans-- grant protections from insurance abuse to hundreds of millions more.   A January 20 Executive order issued by the President said that ``it  is the policy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal'' of the  law. It said:         To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary of       HHS and the heads of all other executive departments . . .       shall exercise all authority available to them to waive,       defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of       any provision or requirement in the Act that would impose a       fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or       regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare       providers.    President Trump made it clear that his motive from the start was to  destroy the Affordable Care Act. My colleagues, he has consistently  kept up that attack. I am often bringing President Trump's tweets to  the floor because, well, they continue to exist on social media. It is  nice to be reminded of the fact that, over the course of the first 100  days in office, President Trump has been routinely--routinely-- attacking the American health care system, saying: ObamaCare will fall  of its own weight; be careful--i.e., if you are thinking of signing up,  be careful--discouraging people from signing up for these exchanges.    Once again, ObamaCare is dead, says the President of the United  States, despite the fact that 19 million people rely on the exchanges  for their healthcare coverage. Here is another one: ObamaCare will  explode. Do not worry; he has it taken care of, he says. Finally,  ObamaCare is in a death spiral.   So these are the routine, almost daily attacks, rhetorically, that  this administration has waged against the Affordable Care Act. He has  commanded his agencies to pick it apart in any way that they can. So,  to the extent there is any diminution in the health of these exchanges,  to the extent that insurers are thinking about not participating or are  pushing up their rates, there is only one reason for it. It is the  active sabotage campaign that the Trump administration is engaged in to  try to destroy the Affordable Care Act.   This is purposeful. This is intentional. This is planned. That  Executive order, unlike some other Executive orders, was not just an  exercise in political and public relations, because the next month, in  February, the IRS announced that it would not reject tax forms from  people who failed to answer the question of whether they had health  insurance. So the IRS took a definitive step to undermine the  Affordable Care Act by telling consumers they were not going to enforce  the individual mandate.   Now, here is a news flash: Republicans think the individual mandate  is a good idea. After attacking it for the last 6 years, the House bill  they passed includes an individual mandate. It does. It is in a  slightly different place. Instead of the penalty applying when you lose  healthcare, in the House, all they did was just shift the penalty to  when you sign up for healthcare again. All they did was move the  mandate from when you lose healthcare to when you repurchase  healthcare. But it is still there.   The administration is seeking to undermine the existing mandate.  Insurance companies have noticed. Senator McConnell came to the floor a  week or so ago to take note of the pretty serious premium increases  that were requested in Maryland, in part, by Blue Cross Blue Shield.  But the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield in Maryland was very clear about  why they were increasing rates.   He said the uncertainty around the individual mandate plays a  significant role in the company's rate filing because failure to  enforce the mandate makes it far more likely that healthier, younger  individuals will drop coverage and drive up the costs for everyone  else.   Insurance companies are noticing that the administration is picking  apart the protections that can keep rates down in the exchanges and,  thus, they are filing higher rates. But with less people in the  exchanges than anticipated, insurance companies are also rethinking  participation. This is intentional as well. Shortly after taking  office, the HHS Secretary pulled the advertising for the Affordable  Care Act in the last week of open enrollment. We know exactly what  happened here because we have the data on who was signing up before  Trump took office and after Trump took office.   Before Trump took office, open enrollment was exceeding open  enrollment for the prior year. After that decision was made to pull  funding for advertising, open enrollment cratered. The former marketing  chief for healthcare.gov estimates that 480,000 people did not sign up  for coverage in the last week because the ads were pulled and because  the President of the United States was out their actively telling  people that they should ``be careful'' before signing up for the  exchanges because he was going to kill it.   So almost half a million Americans did not sign up for these  exchanges. A half million Americans don't have health care today,  potentially, because the Trump administration stopped advertising the  exchanges and because the President of the United States told people,  essentially, not to sign up.   Finally, let me talk about what is happening right now with respect  to something called cost-sharing reduction payments. A big part of the  Affordable Care Act--and really the foundation of the Affordable Care  Act--is subsidies that are given to individuals, often passed straight  through to insurance companies, in order to help folks who are lower  income buy insurance.   Guess what. Republicans think this is a good idea too. I know that  because we stole the idea from Republicans. This was initially a  Heritage Foundation plan that was adopted by Mitt Romney in  Massachusetts. It was the Republican alternative to the Clinton  healthcare bill in 1993. So this idea of individuals getting subsidies  is a Republican idea that Democrats stole.   Republicans included it in the House bill. The subsidies are lower,  but they are still there. The subsidies come in two forms. One, there  is a tax credit to individuals based upon their income, and, two, for  lower income individuals there is a payment that goes to the insurance  companies that mitigates the amount of money that you have to pay out  of pocket--just two different kinds of subsidies.   These subsidies are relied upon by the insurance companies to  continue to offer these products. The Trump administration is paying  the subsidies but is trickling them out 1 month at a time, constantly  making public pronouncements that question whether they will continue  to make those payments.   Here is what OMB Director Mick Mulvaney told reporters. He said the  administration could pull the plug on subsidies at any time. He said:  We haven't made any decisions. The payments are due, I believe, the  20th or the 21st of every single month. We have not made any decisions  at all on whether we will pay in May.   Think about if you are an insurance company executive deciding, A,  whether to put a plan on an exchange or, B, if you put a plan on an  exchange, how much to charge, and the White House is telling you: You  may not get the subsidies that are called for under the law, and we may  give you no warning in pulling those subsidies. We are going to pay  them for May. We might not pay them for June. Maybe we will pay them  for July and August. Maybe we will pull them for September.   How would you make a decision on how much to charge consumers? Why  [[Page S3027]]  would you enter into a contract with a State or Federal-based exchange?  So whether it is the attack on the individual mandate, whether it is  the decision to pull advertising, or whether it is the games being  played with cost-sharing reduction payments, there is a coordinated  effort inside the White House today to destroy the American healthcare  system to the extent that much of the system has the Affordable Care  Act at its foundation.   President Trump was pretty clear about this the day of the failure of  the first healthcare bill in the House of Representatives. He  essentially telegraphed that he was going to try to undermine the  Affordable Care Act as punishment to Democrats, and that if he hurt  enough people, eventually Democrats would come to the table and  negotiate with him. Well, I have a message for the President of the  United States: That is not how it is going to work. You are not going  to blackmail Democrats by hurting our constituents by undermining the  Affordable Care Act.   We want to be part of this discussion about improving the healthcare  system. We do. We want to work with Republicans. It will be a much  smaller and likely less revolutionary bill than Republicans are  considering today, but it will have both party's fingerprints on it. We  are not going to be part of a bill that strips healthcare away from  tens of millions of Americans, and we cannot support this  administration while it seeks to undermine the Affordable Care Act on a  daily basis.   If these exchanges fail--I don't think they will, but if the  exchanges fail--or if rates go up, there is only one place to put the  blame--on an administration that is actively, regularly, and on a daily  basis trying to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   I yield the floor.
