 Mr. Chair, these tours are very important. In fact, the  gentleman from Texas talked about the technology. In the Grand Canyon,  they have this quiet technology where you can barely hear them on the  ground.   There are limitations on these tours already in many of the parks.  The problem here is the bureaucracy can't help the private sector. I  love the gentleman's aspect about no limitations because that is going  to make it happen. It is going to make it happen because they are going  to try to put limitations on them.   This makes sure that everybody has the opportunity to experience  these. On top of that, air tours require no ground-based infrastructure  at the park, which expands accessibility without the need for roads,  trails, signs, bathrooms, garbage cans, or other services. These are  important.   They also generate a sizable amount of money because every tour  generates some kind of fee back to the Federal Government. At $34  trillion and growing, I think we could all use a little bit of that  extra money.   If you look at it from the eyes of a businessman and allowing these  air tours to help out, you are going to find out that America is  singing ``Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah'' all day long, seeing the beautiful  landscapes.   Mr. Chair, I join with my friend from Texas and say please vote for  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I participated and went up to New York to see  this site. There are 2,200 men in a camp right next to soccer fields,  right next to ice-skating rinks. There is going to be a problem here.  In fact, just a couple weeks after that, it flooded. This whole area  flooded.   So New York City is going to take a national park--this is the first  time this has ever happened or occurred--they don't do a NEPA; they  don't do full evaluations, but they are going to turn 2,200 military- aged men into this shelter.   They are higher than a kite if they think that there are not going to  be problems. That is what the gentlewoman wants. She wants to have the  same things done at this time, at this place as any other place it  would be done, such as a NEPA. This is not a good idea to do this in  this area. It is going to have a harmful effect on those kids, those  children that participate there.   So I agree with the young lady from New York. This is a bad idea. Bad  timing. Bad place. Let's follow the rules.                                time  1415     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment 91, which  prohibits funds to finalize, implement, or enforce the proposed rule by  the EPA titled: ``Reconsideration of the National Ambient Air Quality  Standards for Particulate Matter.''   The EPA's proposed rule will lower the particulate matter or PM  standards to a level Maricopa County and other counties in Arizona  could never meet. The PM present in Arizona is not due to  manufacturing. It is naturally occurring. There is no way to lower the  PM in the desert.   Approximately 50 percent of Arizona is a desert. As a desert, it is  prone to accumulations of frequent dust, including frequent dust  storms. Maricopa County, for example, records one to three massive dust  storms called haboobs every year. The current ambient air quality in  southern Arizona rarely meets the EPA PM 2.5 standards due to the  widespread naturally occurring dust particulate matter throughout the  area. During a dust storm, the PM levels increase dramatically. Over  100 times the non-dust storm days, and it is well-documented by the  National Weather Service.   The proposed rule is unreasonable, incomprehensible, and it is not  based on environmental science. The proposed rule would have  substantial impacts on large swaths of the Western United States, not  just Arizona.   For example, if the standard were set to the proposed levels,  populated areas of Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and New  Mexico would be designated as nonattainment and subject to stringent  regulatory requirements and penalties.   The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which made its  recommendations to the EPA, failed to account for the naturally  occurring and ambient PM concentrations throughout the Western United  States.   The EPA must consider the world in its natural state. In Arizona, and  even in Michigan, particulate matter in comparatively high levels exist  in the natural state.   Without any contribution from mankind, there will be dust and  particulate matter in Arizona that exceeds the proposed and current  regulations adopted by the EPA.   How an agency that is supposed to be based on science can ignore the  National Weather Service data and the data from Maricopa County is  perplexing.   We expect better from our agencies, and we certainly expect an agency  to reconsider the differences between a rainforest and a desert. For  these reasons and more, I ask my colleagues to support Amendment 91  prohibiting funding to finalize or enforce the EPA's proposed rule  titled, Reconsideration of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards  for Particulate Matter.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Yeah. Obviously, the young lady does not understand the  desert. She hasn't been in the desert. You can't just water the desert.  That is why it is the desert. Particulates are in the air. And so, if  you are an asthmatic, if you have got problems breathing, you don't  belong in the desert. But you can't lower those standards without going  through extraordinary circumstances.   You know, we do a lot of watering in the desert anyway, but the  particulates are in the air. It is naturally occurring. So I think this  is just ridiculous that there would be opposition from anybody in  regard to this. If you doubt me, come out to Arizona. I will be happy  to show you a haboob, show you the ambient quality.   This is by far an amendment that we need to adopt. I implore my  colleagues to adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment 92, to  prohibit the Biden administration from implementing, administering, or  enforcing the recent Grand Canyon National Monument designation and  corresponding mineral withdraw for almost a million acres.   The monument designation flies in the face of multiple-use doctrines  for public land. Further, it creates no new revenue, and neither  creates nor empowers any employment. Make no mistake, the Grand Canyon  National Park is already protected under the Grand Canyon Protection  Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and multiple other regulations and  laws.   Further, the roughly million acres of newly designated land is far  outside the actual Grand Canyon, believe it or not.   I am also a proud sponsor of the Northern Arizona Protection Act,  which nullifies Biden's designation of corresponding mineral  withdrawal.   The almost million acres of designated land fall within my district  and my colleague from Arizona, Mr. Crane's. But at no point were we  consulted. And our constituents' opposition was ignored. Arizona  already boasts more national monuments than any other State. We do not  want any more monument designations.   The Federal Government already controls far too much land in Arizona,  and this restriction is unacceptable.   Despite repeatedly expressed concerns and questions from my  constituents, county supervisors, local groups, and the House Committee  on Natural Resources, the Department of the Interior has refused to  address any of them.   Instead, without consultation with my constituents or their  Representative in Congress, Biden and Secretary Haaland have  permanently withdrawn more than a million acres from its intended  multiple-use doctrine.   Under House Rule X, the Committee on Natural Resources has general  oversight of any matter relating to its jurisdiction, including the  management of Federal lands and the development of mineral resources.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I have  made repeated inquiries to the Secretary of the Interior regarding this  proposed designation. Yet still, the Secretary of the Interior has not  responded to repeated inquiries from my Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations, further bypassing Congress and the legislative process.  Biden's designation is nothing short of a full-scale attack on the  livelihoods of many of my constituents. It sets back our Nation's  national security and even strengthens Russia.   Biden's proclamation imposed a nearly million-acre land grab  permanently banning mining in an area almost the size of Delaware. Some  falsely frame the designation as an effort to protect the Grand Canyon,  which of course is completely disingenuous. No one wants a mine within  the Grand Canyon. The designated area is miles away from the boundaries  of the buffer area--let me repeat that--the buffer area of the Grand  Canyon National Park. The area in question is home to the highest grade  and largest quantity of uranium deposits in the United States. So this  amendment does not just effectively affect Arizona, it harms our  national security for the entire country.   The designation plays right into the hands of Russia, who along with  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are literally trying to corner the global  uranium market.   China is also joining in on this game, buying up uranium mines in  Africa. Everybody knows that in order to go green, you have to use  nuclear. We better get on board.   There is no question this designation will hurt local revenues, kill  jobs, and undermine American energy security. It does not protect the  Grand Canyon. It is opposed by the people of my district, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in opposition.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, you know, I love the fact that we have  individuals from across this country, it is a beauty, but it is also  detrimental to us here in this aspect. No one has taken an airplane  over this general area. They don't know what they are talking about.   So number one, being ancestral, anything can be that way. Teddy  Roosevelt set this thing up called public lands. And in due process,  what he did is he established also at the same time the multiple-use  doctrine, the Taylor Grazing Act requiring these lands to be not just  used but to be improved and to be used for multiple purposes. That is  mining. That is energy development. It is not conservation. Let me  repeat, not conservation.   So when people start talking about these monuments, you got to come  out to Arizona. We have got more than any other State combined. So  let's get after this. But this is very important for national security,  and this designation does not need to go through. I ask that people  vote for this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
