 Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), I offer amendment No. 154.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would  restore funding for the mental health programs cut in this bill.  Specifically, it would reverse the $142 million in cuts to SAMHSA's  mental health block grant and restore funding for Project AWARE State  grants and Healthy Transitions, which were both eliminated in the  underlying bill.   For so long, mental health issues were relegated to the shadows,  approached with the shame and misunderstanding that only exacerbates  pain for people and their families; but today, we know how widespread  these issues are, and we need to approach them without stigma and treat  them the same way we would treat other illnesses.   According to Mental Health America, one in five adults has a mental  health condition, yet more than half of Americans with a mental illness  receive no treatment. Many families without health coverage or whose  coverage will not cover mental health or recovery programs rely on  services funded by SAMHSA's mental health block grant. This amendment  would restore those funds.   This amendment also restores funding for Project AWARE and the  Healthy Transitions grant program, which were created in the aftermath  of the Sandy Hook school shooting, which took the lives of 6 adults and  20 beautiful children. In response to this tragedy, the administration  and Congress came together to support several new programs to help  communities identify and treat behavioral disorders.   The Project AWARE program, often referred to as a mental health first  aid, seeks to increase awareness of mental health issues among our  children, train teachers and other school staff to identify and respond  to mental health issues, and connect children to the appropriate  behavioral health services.   The Healthy Transitions program improves access to treatment and  support services for young adults with serious mental health  conditions.   Together, we can make our communities more welcoming, compassionate,  and safe for everyone, and restoring this funding is an essential part  of that effort.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for yielding me time.   While this amendment increases career and technical education  funding, a worthy goal that I support, it comes at the expense of  funding for critical higher education programs that support low-income  and minority students.   Career and technical education funds help ensure students are well  prepared for further education employment in high-skilled, high-demand  jobs in the 21st century economy.   In days before the election, President Trump, in reference to CTE,  said: ``We're going to start it up big league.''   Secretary DeVos, a few months ago, said: `` . . . this administration  is committed to supporting and highlighting career and technical  education.''   Despite these promises, the Trump-DeVos budget cuts CTE by $168  million, or 15 percent.   I am glad to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  proposing to increase our investment in this critical area, but I am  deeply concerned that the amendment proposes to slash $70 million in  funding.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would  decimate the ability of the Department of Education to meet the needs  of Americans by indiscriminately transferring $44 million to the  spending reduction account. This does nothing to improve the bill,  which is already underfunded. The majority has imposed a $5 billion cut  to the Labor-HHS bill below the 2017 omnibus level. Further cuts are  completely unnecessary.   That is not all. This $5 billion is also below the nondefense levels  allowed under the Budget Control Act. We have the resources available,  but the majority refuses to allocate them to essential programs funded  through this bill. The Department will simply have to do less with  less. That is not good for the American people, and it is not good for  our constituents.   A Department with fewer resources to oversee the Student Aid  portfolio, and as Mr. Scott pointed out, the Office of Inspector  General's ability to promote efficiencies within the Department and  investigate fraud, will be hampered.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment, which would cut the NLRB's budget by nearly $100  million below the House bill, which is already $25 million below the  fiscal year 2017 level.   Under this amendment, the NLRB would be required to furlough 1,500  employees for at least 140 days. That means 1,500 employees across 26  States would be unpaid for nearly 5 months. As a result, the NLRB would  develop a backlog of 10,000 to 12,000 cases, which would indefinitely  delay the resolution of pending cases of unfair labor practices.   Perhaps my colleagues don't realize that most of the NLRB's work is  not controversial. At the regional level, about 21,000 charges are  filed every year, and 95 percent of those charges are dismissed or  resolved within 60 to 70 days after an investigation of facts. In other  words, 19 out of 20 charges filed are resolved without litigation.   For charges at the regional level, 90 percent of the cases with  probable merit are settled, which means they are resolved without  needing to be heard before the NLRB's five-member board.   For cases taken to the board, about 70 percent of the decisions are  unanimous, meaning they are bipartisan. That is how the process is  supposed to work.   Why would we cripple an agency that is tasked with enforcing Federal  labor laws? Does the majority believe that labor laws should not be  enforced? Should a worker who is unlawfully fired for exercising their  rights be met with a sign on the door that says, ``Closed. Will reopen  in 5 months''?   Closing the NLRB for 5 months would exacerbate disputes between  employers and employees, and create a harmful disruption to our  economy.   Mr. Chair, I urge that we reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the Education and the  Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is an insult  to the millions of American workers who deserve to be treated fairly  and in a timely manner under the law.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition  to this amendment which would block the NLRB's election rule, an  attempt to undermine collective bargaining rights. The NLRB enacted  this rule to modernize and streamline the process for voting on union  representation.   To be clear, the NLRB undertook a very deliberative rulemaking  process. It was transparent, and it included input from stakeholders  and the public.                                time  2045    The majority's claim that this rule enables ambush elections is  false. These are commonsense adjustments that eliminate unnecessary  delays that have hindered the union election process for decades.   The election rule provides for the timely exchange of information so  that issues can be resolved quickly. It improves workers' ability to  hear from all sides prior to making a decision, and it reduces  frivolous litigation.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member  of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), a member of the Education and the  Workforce Committee.    I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. The  underlying bill is already underfunded. The majority has imposed a $5  billion cut to the Labor-HHS bill below the 2017 omnibus level.   This cut is as unnecessary as it is indiscriminate because it  indiscriminately cuts programs in this bill without thought to the  relative merit. For instance, this amendment would result in fewer  infants and toddlers receiving Head Start's services, fewer students  receiving financial aid to help afford college, fewer biomedical  research grants, and cuts to public health emergency response. The list  goes on and on.   Investment is what we need to help build and strengthen our middle  class, and this amendment threatens that.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge Members to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I do not oppose this amendment. In fact, I support my  colleague's effort to improve access to early childhood mental health  promotion, intervention, and treatment. But I think it is important  that we come back to why we are here tonight and why this $5 million  for mental health programs is not included in this Labor-HHS bill under  consideration.   The reason is because this bill is being cut by $5 billion from FY17  levels. This is the end result that we get when the majority's efforts  to slash nondefense spending come to fruition. We are forced to choose  between lifesaving programs, such as mental health and substance abuse  programs, and programs that invest in our future, like early childhood  education or job training.   We ought to be negotiating a bipartisan budget deal to lift the  sequestration caps on both defense and nondefense programs. Then we  could begin working on a bipartisan base that will allow us to  adequately fund mental health and substance abuse prevention.    Mr. Chairman, again, I rise not in  opposition to this amendment, but I support this effort by my colleague  as well.   Let's increase behavioral health integration into pediatric primary  care, for I, too, have seen the shortages of mental health providers in  my home State  [[Page H7305]]  and the very real and devastating impact that that has on families.    This is a false crisis. There is $5 billion that we have cut from the  FY17 levels, but this false crisis has very real impacts on the lives  of children and their families.   Let's get to the work of negotiating a bipartisan budget to lift  sequestration caps on both defense and nondefense, and draft a  reasonable Labor-HHS bill that adequately funds mental health and  substance abuse prevention programs. We have the opportunity and we  need to seize it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition  to this amendment, which would remove protections for workers who  report workplace injuries and prevent OSHA from collecting data  necessary to identify and target the most hazardous workplaces and  serious safety and health problems.   Let's look at 2015. There were nearly 5,000 workers killed on the job  by traumatic injuries and an estimated 50,000 deaths from occupational  diseases. Each day, 150 workers in this country died because of  exposure to workplace hazards.   In 2015, there were 3.7 million workplace injuries reported, with  more than half of them serious, but these numbers don't show the whole  problem. Studies have shown that up to half of all workplace injuries  are not reported on the OSHA injury log. One of the reasons is that  some workers fear that they will be retaliated against or fired if they  report an injury.   The new OSHA rule strengthens protections for workers who report  injuries, which will allow workers to report them more freely and  result in more complete reporting.   OSHA's injury tracking rule is an important worker protection measure  that does three things. First, it prohibits employers from retaliating  against workers who report workplace injuries. Second, it continues  longstanding requirements that certain employers in high-risk  industries submit summary injury and illness data to OSHA, which now  must be done electronically. And, third, it requires large employers in  high-risk injuries to submit more detailed injury and illness data to  OSHA.   These are critical protections for workers. They should not be  overturned.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), my friend, the distinguished  ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, Congress should support  OSHA's efforts to protect workers and use their data to target safety  and health efforts to the most dangerous workplaces.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this rider and to move  forward with the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
