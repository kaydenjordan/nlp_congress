 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Brian Cooper,  who is retiring from the Office of the Parliamentarian after 35 years  on Capitol Hill. Brian's first job came in 1982, when he was hired in  the stock room of the Longworth Building working in Publication and  Distribution Services.   Since then, Brian held a variety of positions in Congress, where he  learned the intricacies of the legislative process, and the inner  workings of House operations--skills that earned him a job at the House  Parliamentarian Office, where he currently serves as Chief Clerk. A  consummate professional, Brian has spent his career committed to  assisting with an orderly and accurate legislative process, observed in  a fair and nonpartisan manner.   Madam Speaker, I ask my congressional colleagues to join me in  congratulating Brian Cooper on his long-deserved retirement and wish  him all the best as he pursues his passions, including his artistic  endeavors, traveling, spending more time with his family, and cheering  on his favorite Baltimore sports teams.   Bon voyage and Godspeed to Brian Cooper.                            ____________________
