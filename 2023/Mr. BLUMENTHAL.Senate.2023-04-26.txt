 Mr. President, I am so honored by that introduction  and to be here on the floor with a great colleague--a champion in the  House as well as now in the Senate--Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.   I thank the senior Senator from Maryland--we are both senior Senators  from our respective States--for yielding first to me. More importantly,  I want to thank him for his leadership on human rights and civil rights  here in the United States. He has been such a powerful advocate. But  also, around the world, through the Helsinki Commission, I have had the  great privilege of working with him and serving with him on that  Commission, where he has put front and center the crimes against  humanity committed in Ukraine as well as in other parts of the world  where the rule of law, unfortunately, is lacking. So I am very, very  proud to be with him on the floor today.   Like my colleague Senator Durbin, who has been rightly lauded by  Senator Cardin for his work on rights, I rise to ask this body and all  who are hearing this message to commit to making the Equal Rights  Amendment the law of our land--part of the Constitution.   Outside of the right to vote, the Constitution has no mention of  gender equality. It was enshrined--the right to vote--just over a  century ago with the 19th Amendment, but the U.S. Constitution does not  include an explicit provision on equal rights for women, and that is a  sad omission that cannot be allowed to stand. We must fix it.   The ERA, as you know, was introduced to Congress in 1923 by  suffragist leader Alice Paul, who believed that after securing the  right to vote, women needed legal protection against discrimination.  That fact is no less true today than it was then. In 1972, the ERA was  passed by Congress. In 2020, Virginia became the 38th and final State  required by the Constitution to ratify it. In January 2022, we passed  the 2-year waiting period. President Biden has supported making it the  law of the land. We should heed President Biden and this body in doing  so--in recognizing the importance of a resolution ratifying the ERA.   Now, the hard, blunt truth here is that significant progress in sex  equality has been made thanks to a generation of advocates--actually,  several generations--but women and girls still face horrendous, life- changing barriers and challenges derived from structural sex  discrimination every day. I became more aware of it as a dad to a young  woman, listening to her, seeing the world through her eyes, as well as  my wife, Cynthia--both of them strong advocates and, thankfully, my  three sons as well, who are ardent champions of gender equality.   In the workplace, the gender gap has hardly budged. You are, I am  sure, aware that women now earn about 84 cents for every dollar a man  earns. That is a statistic from the Department of Labor. The disparity  is even larger for women of color. For every dollar a man earns, Native  American women and Latinas earn 57 cents and Black women earn 67 cents.  That is in the greatest country in the history of the world. We should  be ashamed and embarrassed--ashamed and embarrassed.   The ERA is a critical step toward ensuring equality and protecting  women's fundamental rights, including the right to abortion and  contraception.   The Supreme Court overturned five decades of precedent and eliminated  the constitutional right to abortion in Dobbs saying Roe was wrong--a  decision that will go down in infamy as one of the most destructive to  the Court's credibility, as I mentioned today, and a tribute to the  disingenuousness of three nominees before this body--the three most  recent nominees--who said they would respect precedent and then voted  to completely overturn Dobbs within a couple of years.   About one in three girls and women in the United States of  reproductive age are living in States where abortion is either  unavailable or severely restricted, and the adverse consequences of  poor women's health are already clearly visible.   Amanda Zurawski today testified before the Judiciary Committee about  how she nearly died, nearly perished from sepsis because of Texas's  cruel, barbarous prohibitions against women's healthcare through  abortion.   Without the freedom to control their own lives, bodies, and futures,  the true meaning of equality will remain elusive and out of reach. As  Justice Ginsburg put it, full and equal citizenship ``is intimately  connected to a person's ability to control their reproductive lives.''   The ERA would also provide additional tools against violence  committed all too often against women. Gender-based bias is a form of  sex discrimination as well as a violation of human rights. Thirty-five  percent of all women who are killed by men are a result of violence  from intimate partners with guns. One in three women has experienced  some form of physical violence by an intimate partner. One in five  women in the United States has been raped.   You can dispute the specific numbers, but the overwhelming truth of  sex discrimination in violence, in denial of healthcare, in job  inequality, in pay discrimination is there for all to see. We all know  it exists. We must act against it.   That is why I am proud to stand here with my colleagues and argue  that ratification is an idea long overdue. It is not an idea whose time  has come; it came long ago. We have an obligation to act as a matter of  conscience and conviction. If we care about women in the United States  of America in the 21st century, we need to bring the law into the 21st  century and do what should have been done long ago to protect women's  health and security, as well as fundamental equality.   Let me just close with a favorite quote of mine from Susan Anthony.  She stated:         The true republic--men, their rights and nothing more;       women, their rights and nothing less.    Sex equality deserves a permanent home in the Constitution. The time  to make it happen is now.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Maryland, Senator Van Hollen.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of Chief Mutawi Mutahash (Many Hearts) Marilynn  ``Lynn'' Malerba, who was recently named the Chamber of Commerce of  Eastern Connecticut's 2023 Citizen of the Year.   Chief Malerba has an impressive list of accomplishments. In 2010, she  became Chief of the Mohegan Tribe in Connecticut, the first female  Chief in the Tribe's modern history. Before her current role, Chief  Malerba held many leadership positions, including chairwoman of the  Tribal council and executive director of health and human services for  the Mohegan Tribe. Before her work in Tribal government, Chief Malerba  also had a long career as registered nurse, earning a doctor of nursing  practice at Yale University and eventually serving as the director of  cardiology and pulmonary services at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in  New London, CT.   Currently, Chief Malerba serves as the 45th Treasurer of the United  States, the first Native American to hold this office. As Treasurer,  Chief Malerba has direct oversight over the U.S. Mint and Fort Knox and  is a key liaison with the Federal Reserve. She also oversees the Office  of Consumer Policy at the Department of Treasury and serves as a senior  adviser to the Secretary of Treasury on community development and  engagement.   From her long career as a healthcare professional, to her leadership  of the Mohegan Tribe, and now her national role as U.S. Treasurer,  Chief Malerba has made Connecticut immensely proud. I applaud her  selection as the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut's 2023  Citizen of the Year, and I hope my colleagues will join me in  celebrating Chief Malerba's remarkable achievements.                            ____________________
