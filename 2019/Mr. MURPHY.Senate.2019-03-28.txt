 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  pay tribute to Gary Yohe, a Connecticut resident  [[Page S2086]]  and preeminent national expert on climate change, who is retiring from  Wesleyan University.   Professor Yohe has had an impressive and distinguished career. After  receiving his PhD in economics from Yale University, he devoted his  career to climate impact and mitigation research. He worked as a senior  member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, receiving a  share of the 2007 Nobel Prize, served as vice chair of the National  Climate Assessment Development and Advisory Committee under President  Obama, and has testified before the Senate on multiple occasions to  explain the risks and impacts of climate change. Professor Yohe  continues to serve as a member of the New York City Panel on Climate  Change and has been a member of the faculty at Wesleyan University for  more than 40 years. On a more personal note, he has been a great  resource to my office, and I hope he will continue to contribute to  public policy after his official retirement.   I would like to congratulate Professor Yohe on his retirement from  Wesleyan University and take this moment to thank him for his  contributions to the scientific community.                            ____________________
