 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on  Congress and the Biden administration to hold China accountable for its  role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence suggests that this virus,  like too many other things in the world, was made in China.   Despite the growing evidence surrounding China's lack of transparency  and mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, House Democrats continue to  stonewall Republican efforts to investigate the origins of COVID-19.  Republicans have made numerous calls for the need to investigate the  origins of COVID and hold China accountable, but the majority has yet  to hold a single hearing on it.   This is shameful. Americans deserve transparency, and they deserve  answers. We must hold China accountable for its coverup of this deadly  virus that has taken the lives of 3.8 million humans worldwide,  including 600,000 American lives.   Under the Trump administration, we had an investigation in place to  investigate the origins of COVID-19, but that necessary investigation  was ended by this Biden administration. Instead of holding our  adversaries accountable, the current administration is bowing down to  them. They have chosen a strategy of appeasement rather than  accountability.   If America wants to remain a leader on the global stage and if we  want to remain a safe and secure nation, then we must hold China and  other adversaries absolutely accountable.   My Republican colleagues and I stand ready to work across the aisle  to deliver the transparency and answers that Americans deserve. I hope  that our colleagues across the aisle will join us in our efforts.                                time  1830
