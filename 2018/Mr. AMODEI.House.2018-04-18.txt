 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with birthday wishes for the  premier municipality in the Nation--not the Big Apple, not the Windy  City, not the City by the Bay, or the Big Easy.   I am talking about the Biggest Little City in the World, Reno,  Nevada. Reno turns 150, celebrating its sesquicentennial.   Congratulations to you Mayor Hillary Schieve and the city council.   Happy birthday, Reno, Nevada.                            ____________________
