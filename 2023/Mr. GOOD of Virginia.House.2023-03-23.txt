 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  gentleman from Virginia, former University of Virginia basketball  coach, Terry Holland.   Coach Holland was hired in 1974 at the young age of 31 to be the head  coach of the UVA Men's basketball program after they had only  experienced three winning seasons in 21 years.   Under his leadership, UVA would win more than 300 games in 16 years,  make two Final Four appearances, win an NIT Title, an ACC Tournament  Championship, and three ACC regular season titles.   Not surprisingly, Coach Holland also won two ACC Coach of the Year  awards. He retired from coaching in 1990 then returned in 1995 to serve  as the athletic director at UVA. Then, in 2014, he permanently retired,  leaving behind a legacy of service and dedication.   Sadly, about 4 weeks ago, on February 26, at the age of 80, Coach  Holland succumbed to Alzheimer's disease.   His exemplary life truly impacted the lives of his student-athletes,  his coaches, his colleagues, his competitors and, of course, his loyal  fans, along with the entire University of Virginia community.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I support passage of the  underlying bill, but I also rise in support of this amendment, which I  think would truly empower parents.   Adding a private right of action places the ultimate protection of  parental rights back where it belongs, in the hands of parents, not  Department of Education bureaucrats.   For too long, the public school system has undermined parental  involvement in education decisions, and parents have been helpless to  hold them accountable.   The union-driven COVID policies in our schools served as a wake-up  call for many parents, and school boards across the country have tried  to stop them from raising their voices in protest.   A private right of action would make a meaningful change to the  balance of power so parents can rightfully have a say in what their  children are being taught.   This amendment wouldn't unleash lawsuits against schools. The private  right of action could only be used if the school is not forthcoming  with the commonsense provisions of this bill. If the school shares  curriculum, teaching materials, and their budget openly, then there is  no problem. If the school notifies parents about actions from the  school administrator to change a child's pronouns, then there is no  standing under this bill. There is also a limit that the private right  of action must be filed within 30 days of the violation.   Parental rights precede government. Our government was created to  protect our God-given rights. When government is working to subvert  those rights, it is the right of the people to put new guardrails in  place to secure our precious liberty.   Guaranteeing a private right of action will ensure public schools are  held accountable to the important tenets of this bill.   Madam Chair, I urge support for the amendment.
