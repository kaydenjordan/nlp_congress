 Mr. Speaker, I missed votes today because  I was in my district with Vice President Pence to tour the emergency  response initiatives to the recently declared state of emergency, due  to flooding in the Tulsa Area.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 235,  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 236, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 237, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 238, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 239, and ``nay'' on rollcall  No. 240.                            ____________________
