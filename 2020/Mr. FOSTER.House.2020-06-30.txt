 Mr. Speaker, on Thursday of last week, I was proud to  join my colleagues to vote for the historic George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act.   This legislation represents the first of many steps we need to take  to achieve structural change in our criminal justice system, our  police, and our society. The American people are demanding action, and  they are not interested in more studies or talking points or half  measures.   I have been inspired by what I have seen in the Illinois communities  that I represent, in places like Naperville, Aurora, and Joliet, where  people of all backgrounds have come together to say enough is enough. I  have been proud to stand with those in my district and across the  country who are calling for change, and I am proud to help amplify  their voices.   We are all frustrated that prior action was not taken to prevent the  horror that we have witnessed far too often of Black Americans being  unjustly killed at the hands of law enforcement.   For a lot of people, the video of George Floyd being killed when a  Minnesota police officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes was  shocking and put this problem front and center, as did the senseless  and brutal killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville.   But for Black Americans, this is not a new problem. It is just more  of the same, more senseless, unjust killings of Black Americans by  abusive police officers, who often seem to be protected by law  enforcement systems plagued by structural racism.   Black Americans shouldn't have had to wait this long for Congress to  take action. They deserve a Congress that is responsive to this  longstanding crisis, and they deserve a President who wants to lead our  Nation to a more just place for people of color instead of the  opposite.                                time  0930    No, Mr. President, white power is nothing to celebrate.   So I am proud that the House took action and a step in the right  direction with the Justice in Policing Act, which includes key reforms  like banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants, mandating the use of  body cameras, ending racial and religious profiling by the police,  demilitarizing the local police departments, and strengthening  accountability measures to hold abusive police officers accountable for  their actions.   Most Members of this House can share stories of similar incidents in  their own districts, often leading to the deaths of their constituents  that should have been prevented. And I know that my colleagues join me  in honoring the memory of Black lives that have been unjustly lost to  police brutality.   As I cast my vote, I carried with me with one of Naperville's very  own, Sandra Bland. Sandra grew up in Naperville before moving to Texas  to pursue her education and earn a degree in agriculture. She then  returned to Illinois, where she was a brave activist who worked for  social justice and community engagement.   A few days after celebrating the Fourth of July with her family back  in Naperville, Sandra went back to Texas to begin a job at her alma  mater, Prairie View A&M, a historically Black State university.   On July 10, 2015, she was pulled over on an empty suburban street for  failing to signal a lane change. She was arrested and 3 days later  found hanged to death in her jail cell.   Sandra Bland should never have been arrested. She should be alive  today and looking forward to celebrating another Fourth of July with  her family this weekend, just like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and  the countless Black Americans who have been the  [[Page H2679]]  victims of discrimination and brutality throughout the history of our  country.   Two months before her death, Sandra Bland posted a video raising  awareness about this important and deadly issue. ``Black lives  matter,'' she said. ``They matter. In the news that we've seen as of  late,'' Sandra said, ``you could stand there, surrender to the cops,  and still be killed.'' That is what Sandra said 2 months before it  happened to her.   Well, I am here on the floor of the House to say that Sandra Bland's  life mattered, George Floyd's life mattered, Breonna Taylor's life  mattered, and Black lives matter, and it is past time that the laws of  our Nation reflect it.                            ____________________
