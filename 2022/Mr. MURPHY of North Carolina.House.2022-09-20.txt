 Mr. Speaker, I hereby remove my name as  cosponsor of H.R. 2460.    Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I want  to say how deeply I appreciate Mr. Price's hard work over the last  couple of years on S. 1098. I thank him very much for his efforts on  this key and very bipartisan issue.   It is clear that there is bipartisan support that victims of spousal  abuse should be able to sever these consolidation loans without penalty  or delay. I don't think that is the question. The question here is the  change in the calculus because of what President Biden has done.   While I support the intention of this bill to separate these loans,  President Biden's unconstitutional, only-able-to-be-done-because-of- his-abuse-of-power student loan giveaway has drastically changed the  context in which we consider this bill. The President, in his actions,  has undermined what was a clear bipartisan effort.   S. 1098 gives the administration the authority and creates a pathway  which could be used for loan forgiveness, again taking money from  people who didn't benefit from a college education and making those  individuals pay for it.   Once these loans are separated into the Direct Loan Program, these  loans will be eligible for Biden's near-trillion-dollar student loan  giveaway. Republicans made a good-faith effort to amend this  legislation to protect taxpayers, but Democrats refused to close this  loan forgiveness loophole.   Our Republican solution, the Simplified Joint Consolidation  Separation Act, will allow borrowers to separate their loans in a more  timely manner to expedite financial freedom while protecting taxpayers  by focusing on the administration's authority to directly aid those  most in need.   This targeted, commonsense legislation should garner immediate  support from both sides of the aisle and will actually correct the  issue that we all want solved.
