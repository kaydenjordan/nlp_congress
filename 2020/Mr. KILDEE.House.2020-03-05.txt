 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Wounded Warrior  Program, which is a bipartisan initiative that provides opportunities  for injured veterans and servicemembers to continue their service to  our country by working right here in the United States Congress.   I am proud to have passed legislation, supported by Republicans and  Democrats, to expand the Wounded Warrior Program. By investing in these  paid fellowships, we can expand job opportunities for veterans and  bring, importantly, their critical insight to the work that we do right  here in Congress.   For the past 2 years, I have had the distinct privilege of having a  Wounded Warrior fellow, Danielle Stevens, in my office. Throughout her  time in my office, she has served my district by advising me on  important legislation and, very importantly, being an advocate for  veterans in casework that she has been involved in, including veterans  who lost earned benefits, had them taken away from them due to clerical  errors. Danielle Stevens was able to work to get those benefits  restored, changing the lives of those families.   Later this week, she will be leaving my office to continue her public  service at the U.S. Marshals Service. I thank her for her service to  our country. This is an example of the success of this program.                            ____________________
