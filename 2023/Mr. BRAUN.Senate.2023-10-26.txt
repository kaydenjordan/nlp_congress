 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1182 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, Americans are hurting more than I think in  any other time since I have been here for sure: high inflation--I  calculate in the 5 years I have been here, we have added 15 trillion to  our national debt--struggling to make ends meet and I think inflation,  and all of this is DC's fault.   Starting in 2021, Congress kept passing huge spending bills. We have  never gone off of it since then. We now borrow a trillion dollars every  6 months; it used to be annually. Massive spending packages sail  through this place because they are packed with pet projects. We have  even brought back earmarks. Earmarks give Representatives, give  Senators, the incentive to be big spenders. We should cut every earmark  out of this bill and ban them permanently and quit loading up our kids  and grandkids with the debt to pay for all this.   Shameful, in my mind.    First of all, I echo the comments of Senators Collins and  Murray on the tragedy in Maine. We see it all too often.   When it comes to this place, we don't do budgets anymore. We haven't  done them--that we have adhered to--in over 20 years.   We piled up--to give you a little taste of debt--$5 trillion in debt  in 2000. We added another $6 trillion, I believe, or $5 trillion by  2008. We added another 8 from 2008 to 2016. Where is it going to end?   Yes, Congressional Directive Spending would be OK if it was in the  context of actually doing budgets and not borrowing all this money from  our kids and grandkids.   This is symbolic mostly, but going back to earmarks just says we are  putting a rubber stamp on the dysfunction that drives this place in the  first place.   I yield.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1182     And I ask for the yeas and nays.
