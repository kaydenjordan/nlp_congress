 Mr. Chairman, we oppose H.R. 5 because we stand with the  school boards and the PTAs, the parents and the teachers, the students,  and 13,000 school superintendents whose letter opposing this  legislation I would ask to be included in the Record.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from The School  Superintendents Association.                                                     March 22, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy and Minority Leader Jeffries: AASA,       The School Superintendents Association, representing 13,000       school district leaders across the United States, writes to       share our view of H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights.        Superintendents know that parents are their children's       first and most important educators, which is why effective       family engagement at the state and local level is one of the       key determinants of student and school success. As       superintendents who serve at the pleasure of school boards       selected by parents, families and community members, it is       critical that every child and family who walks through our       doors on a daily basis feels welcome and supported in our       buildings and classrooms. We know an educational environment       that connects and engages families will ensure greater       success for all students. We believe that every family should       have the opportunity to be an active participant in their       child's educational experience and connect directly with       their child's professional educators, while working in       concert with school staff and administrators to maximize       their child's success.        As a national organization representing the CEOs of school       systems, our view has always been that local control in K-12       education is not only what is best, but what is most       appropriate. It is for this reason that we must oppose H.R.       5. As champions of local control, AASA has long opposed       topdown, prescriptive federal education policies that dictate       how districts utilize limited federal funding, pressure       districts to adopt specific standards or curriculum or create       national teacher or educator standards and requirements.        Parents are the locus of local control in education as they       provide input on local policies and practices created at       school board meetings, connect directly with superintendents,       principals and teachers in class and school-wide events, and       have access to any and all educational materials, platforms       and curriculum their children are utilizing inside and       outside of school.        The Parents Bill of Rights is full of district mandates       without any funding for these new and burdensome requirements       that will be a place a disproportionate hardship on small and       rural schools. Provisions that would require a district to       print out the curriculum for parental review and comment,       send notices about every guest speaker that may address a       class, require mental health personnel to contact parents if       a student discloses any mental health concern and share a       list of every professional development opportunity the       district provides to educators and staff are just a few       examples of extreme federal overreach in local education       policy.        Aside from AASA's federalism concerns and the many new       unfunded mandates that H.R. 5 creates, there are also       practical implementation concerns with how the legislation       would disrupt learning in classrooms and make it incredibly       challenging for educators to meet the significant educational       needs of students. For example, giving parents the ability to       opt out of the collection, disclosure, or use of personal       information collected from students and commonly used       education technology in the classroom would make it nearly       impossible for schools to meet the educational needs of       students and use a host of online diagnostic, differentiated       and adaptive assessments and tools to measure a student's       understanding, proficiency and growth academically. This       change would leave teachers not only ill- equipped to address       learning loss in a post-pandemic educational environment       thereby exacerbating educational inequities, but forced to       find and make use of resources, curriculum, and assessments       from several decades ago.        H.R. 5 would make it more challenging to ensure our schools       are safe and welcoming environments for every student. The       legislation would make it more challenging to direct students       to appropriate mental health supports in schools thereby       risking the safety of all students and educators. As an       example, a counselor who suspects a child may be abused would       be required to notify parents and get a signed parental opt-      in before the counselor can assess the child's health, safety       and well-being at home. The bill would also undermine       districts' ability to collect anonymized survey data to gauge       student safety and well-being in school and it would make our       transgender and nonbinary students more likely to disengage       or drop out of school.        While we appreciate the robust discussion about student       privacy and support a reauthorization of Family Educational       Rights and Privacy Act and Protection of Pupil Rights       Amendment that will clarify critical issues and update the       law to appropriately respond to the twenty-first century       learning environments in our schools, the changes to FERPA       and PPRA proposed by H.R. 5 are not those AASA can support.       Similarly, we welcome a conversation on how to reauthorize       the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but we do not       support piecemeal changes to critical provisions in Title I       of the law and urge Republicans and Democrats to come       together--as they always have--to craft comprehensive ESEA       policies to better our nations' schools, increase student       achievement and ensure our schools are welcoming places for       every child and family.        Thank you for considering our views and it is our hope that       we can work with both sides of the dais to find common ground       this Congress on the policy and funding issues of greatest       importance to school district leaders.            Sincerely,                                                 Sasha Pudelski,             Director of Advocacy, AASA, The School Superintendents                                                        Association.     Mr. Chair, we stand with local governments against this  outrageous power grab by MAGA Republicans in Washington who are  supporting book banning, suppression of historical facts about slavery,  Jim Crow segregation, racial violence, and favoring top-down  micromanagement of our local schools across America.   Is there really a problem for parents like us with finding out what  is in our public school libraries?   Well, before you pass a massive new Federal law and a massive new  unfunded mandate for our local governments, why don't you take the time  to make a phone call?   That is what I did. I called up the person who runs the school  libraries for Montgomery County, Maryland, which has more than a  million people there. I learned from Andrea Christman, who oversees all  the media centers for our county, that the entire catalogue of 2.2  million books is online, freely available, and current as of today.  Anybody can go online and find it right now.   If all the info is out there, as local governments want it to be,  then what is this about?   Well, it is about book banning, of course.   Mr. Chair, 2 years ago, more than 1,600 books were banned in the  United States of America.   Here are three of the key books that the rightwingers have been going  after.   Khaled Hosseini's ``The Kite Runner,'' about the dangerous  fanaticism, authoritarianism, and abuse of the Taliban, a rightwing  religious fundamentalist movement all about censorship and repressing  women's control over their own bodies and their own fertility.   ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' Margaret Atwood's extraordinary dystopian  novel about a rightwing misogynist movement which uses high technology  and depraved religious ideology to control not only the minds of their  followers, but their private and public lives and the fertility of  women.   Of course, George Orwell's, ``1984,'' because they have no sense of  irony. They are always trying to censor this one.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Chair, we need more politicians reading books and fewer  politicians trying to censor books in America.   It is amazing to me to see politicians who oppose a universal violent  criminal background check and who defend assault weapons after the  massacres at Columbine; after Parkland, Florida; at Sandy Hook in  Newtown, Connecticut; after Uvalde; after Santa Fe, Texas, that they  are now going to keep America's children safe by banning ``The  Handmaid's Tale'' and ``1984.''   Mr. Chair, we can do better for the children of America.
