 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life  of Dr. Allan Bernstein, a former Tustin mayor known as ``Doc''. He  passed away on May 24, 2023.   Dr. Bernstein devoted many years to serving the city of Tustin,  serving on the city council from 2012 to 2020 and as mayor in 2017 and  also in 2020. He also served on several State and county boards and  committees.   He was committed to seeing Tustin thrive and always looked after the  best interests of his residents, businesses, and staff.   Doc was a dear friend of mine, and I know he truly cared about the  Tustin community. I join our Tustin community in mourning his passing  and send my deepest condolences to his wife, Randi; son and daughter- in-law, Adam and Karlee; and his mother, Ruth.                            ____________________
