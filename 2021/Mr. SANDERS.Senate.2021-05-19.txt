 Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I  will object to the unanimous consent request by Senator Scott and offer  my own resolution. Unlike Senator Scott's resolution, mine is short and  to the point, and I think it expresses the feelings of the overwhelming  majority of people in our country and, in fact, throughout the world.   This is what our resolution says:         Whereas every Palestinian life matters; and        Whereas every Israeli life matters:        Now, therefore be it resolved that the Senate urges an       immediate cease-fire to prevent any further loss of life; and       further escalation of conflict in Israel and the Palestinian       territories, and supports diplomatic efforts to resolve the       Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to uphold international law and       to protect the human rights of Israelis and Palestinians.    I would like to thank my colleagues Senator Warren, Senator Van  Hollen, Senator Kaine, Senator Carper, Senator Heinrich, Senator  Murphy, Senator Merkley, Senator Ossoff, Senator Leahy, and Senator  Markey for cosponsoring this resolution.   I would also like to point out that those of us who are supporting an  immediate cease-fire are certainly not alone. We join with nearly  unanimous calls from the European Union, with United Nations Secretary  General Antonio Guterres, with Pope Francis, and with many others. In  other words, all over the world people are seeing the terrible tragedy  that is taking place in the region, and they want an end to it as  quickly as possible through a cease-fire.   Now, I happened to have read Senator Scott's resolution, and I was  particularly struck by one sentence in it on page 2. What it says:         The Senate mourns the loss of innocent life caused by       Hamas' rocket attacks.    That is on page 2. Now, I certainly agree with that, and I think  every Member of Congress agrees with that. The loss of 12 innocent  Israeli lives is, in fact, a tragedy.   But what about the loss of 227 Palestinian lives, including 64  children and 38 women? Does Senator Scott not believe that the loss of  those Palestinian lives, 64 children and 38 women, among others, is not  a tragedy?   I believe that we should be mourning the loss of Israeli life, but we  should also be mourning the loss of Palestinian lives or perhaps some  people think that Palestinian lives don't matter. I would hope not.   And let us be very clear that when we talk about the tragedy that is  now taking place in Gaza, what we are talking about is not only the  terrible loss of life. As I hope most people know, Gaza, before this  war, was an extremely poor and desperate community, and the latest  Israeli bombardment has only made a bad situation much, much worse.   Let us remember, Gaza has been under a blockade since 2007, imposed  by Israel and Egypt. Most people are unable to leave. Basic necessities  are extremely hard to obtain.   Gaza is the home to about 2 million inhabitants. Its population  density is among the highest in the world--just a  [[Page S2771]]  huge amount of people squeezed into a very small area. More than half  of the population of Gaza, some 56 percent, live below the poverty  line. Seventy percent of the population is receiving aid, according to  estimates by the United Nations. Food rations constitute most of that  aid. Unemployment in Gaza is around 45 percent; 48 percent of the  population is under the age of 18; and 70 percent--let me repeat--70  percent of the young people in Gaza are unemployed, with no hope for  the future.   And because of this war, the bombardment from Israeli planes, the  situation has gotten even worse.   Today's New York Times reports that the Israeli bombardment has--this  is from the New York Times--``damaged 17 hospitals and clinics in  Gaza.'' Got that? Seventeen hospitals and clinics have been damaged.   The bombardment has ``wrecked its only coronavirus test laboratory,  sent fetid wastewater into its streets and broken water pipes serving  at least 800,000 people. Sewage systems inside Gaza have been  destroyed. A desalination plant that helped provide fresh water to [a  quarter of a million] people in the territory is offline. Dozens of  schools have been damaged or closed, forcing some 600,000 students to  miss classes. Some 72,000 Gazans have been forced to flee their  homes.''   That is from the New York Times this morning. Perhaps the situation  has gotten even worse. I don't know. I want everybody to think for a  moment what it means to be living in a very small territory, with  dozens and dozens of planes attacking and bombing. What does it mean,  in particular, to the children of Gaza?   Jess Ghannam, a professor of psychiatry at the University of  California San Francisco who specializes in the psychological effects  of armed conflict on children, told USA Today:         [What] children in Gaza are exposed to on a regular basis       exceeds anything, anything that any children anywhere else in       the world experience. There's basically no place to go for       these children. They are unable to escape.    When you put people under this sort of continued, intense pressure,  with no hope for a better future, you cannot be surprised when violence  erupts. Indeed, 3 years ago, in May of 2018, I wrote a letter, with 12  of my colleagues, urging the Trump administration to do more to  alleviate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In that letter, we  cited Israeli defense officials--Israeli defense officials--who were  warning that if the crisis was not addressed, it could lead to yet  another eruption of violence.   Why didn't we take notice then? And when this latest war ends, will  the United States once again turn away? Will we consign those children,  once again, to the horrible conditions they are forced to live under  today? And I would hope that my colleagues appreciate that we must not  do that.   Senator Scott's resolution says a lot about Hamas terrorists in Gaza.  And let us be clear, Hamas is a terrorist organization. It is a corrupt  organization, and it is a repressive organization. But here is the  irony: It is resolutions like Senator Scott's that help Hamas. Hamas  would be overjoyed if Senator Scott's resolution were to pass.   Now, why is that? Let us understand that one of Hamas's goals is to  show Palestinians that they represent the real resistance to the  occupation. Senator Scott's resolution would help them do just that. By  making this all about Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, Senator Scott is effectively  echoing Hamas's own argument that Hamas is the true face of  Palestinians' struggle, and I reject that, because, my friends, day  after day, year after year, decade after decade, nonviolent Palestinian  activists struggle against the daily violence and harassment of  occupation--violence and harassment subsidized, by the way, with  billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars.   Let us be very clear. No one is arguing that Israel or any government  does not have the right to self-defense and the responsibility to  protect its people. We should understand that, while Hamas's firing  rockets into Israeli communities is absolutely unacceptable, today's  conflict did not begin with those rockets. It goes much, much deeper.   For years we have seen a deepening Israeli occupation in the West  Bank and East Jerusalem and a perpetual blockade on Gaza, all of which  makes life increasingly unbearable for the Palestinian people. The  truth is that these policies, like this current war, will continue to  strengthen--to strengthen--extremists on both sides, including Hamas.  If you want to strengthen Hamas, support this war.   We, Congress, must understand that in more than a decade of his  rightwing rule in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated an  increasingly intolerant and authoritarian-type of racist nationalism.  In his frantic effort to stay in power and avoid prosecution for  corruption, Netanyahu has legitimized extremist forces, such as the  Jewish Power party, by bringing them into the government.   Moreover, we should understand that these dangerous trends are not  unique to Israel. What was going on and what is going on in Israel, in  my view, is a political tragedy, but it is part of a trend that is  going on around the world, including here in the United States, where  we are seeing the rise of authoritarian nationalist movements.   These movements exploit ethnic and racial hatreds in order to build  power for a corrupt few, rather than prosperity, justice, and peace for  the many. For the last 4 years, these movements have had a friend in  the Trump White House, and on January 6, those forces attacked this  very Chamber.   It is no accident that the only European Union country that did not  join the nearly unanimous statement yesterday calling for a cease-fire  was Hungary. Hungary did not join the rest of the European Union, and  Hungary, of course, is led by the ethno-nationalist authoritarian  Viktor Orban, a strong ally of both Netanyahu and Donald Trump.   Now, some may choose to be on that side, but that is not the side I  choose to be on. We must be on the side of those who want to build a  society based on real security and political equality and based upon  the principles of economic justice, racial justice, political justice,  social justice, and environmental justice. I believe we must stand in  solidarity with those Palestinians and Israelis working to build a  future of equality and peaceful coexistence and not with the intolerant  extremists on either side, who wish to destroy that future.   In this moment of crisis, the United States should be urging an  immediate cease-fire. My colleagues, I strongly believe that the United  States has a major role to play in helping the world build a more  peaceful and prosperous future, one in which human rights are upheld  and the life of every human being is valued.   We should be leading the world in combating the existential threat of  climate change. We should be leading the world in making sure that  every person on Earth, no matter what country he or she lives in,  receives a vaccine to protect them from the COVID-19 virus, and, yes,  we should lead the world in attempting to bring the Israeli people and  the Palestinian people together.   If the United States is going to be a credible voice on human rights  on the global stage, we must recognize that Palestinian rights matter.  Palestinian lives matter.   Madam President, I object to the Scott resolution.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 225, submitted  earlier today; further, that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble  be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
