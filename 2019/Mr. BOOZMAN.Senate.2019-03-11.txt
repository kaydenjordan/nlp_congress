 Mr. President.    Mr. President, the American Legion, the Nation's largest  wartime veterans service organization, is celebrating its centennial  this year. I rise today to recognize this milestone.   For the past 100 years, the American Legion has been a leading  advocate for veterans and their families. The Legion has played a role  in crafting legislation, shaping policies, expanding services, and  creating generations of civic-minded Americans.   Founded in Paris following World War I, the American Legion was  officially chartered by Congress on September 16, 1919. Since its  founding, Legionnaires have proudly worked to strengthen our country  and our communities, while upholding the promise our country made to  those who have worn our Nation's uniform.   The list of achievements that the Legion has helped fight for is long  and includes the creation of the U.S. Veterans' Bureau in 1924, the  forerunner of the Veterans' Administration. Decades later, the Legion  was active in elevating to Cabinet-level status the U.S. Department of  Veterans Affairs.   Following the American Legion's lead, Congress adopted a flag code to  formally lay out the protocol for carrying and displaying our Nation's  banner. The Legion continues to actively support the constitutional  amendment to protect the American flag from desecration.   During World War II, the American Legion drafted legislation that  would become the GI bill. Legionnaires were instrumental in securing  passage of this landmark legislation that helped returning troops  further their education, buy houses, and start businesses. It also  established hiring privileges for veterans.   The Legion continues its strong advocacy for improving these and  other benefits. Its efforts were vital in the passage of the Post-9/11  GI bill and the enhancement measure passed in 2017, which bears the  name of a former American Legion commander, the Harry W. Colmery  Veterans Educational Assistance Act.   After a century of service, Legionnaires remain just as committed to  advocating on behalf of our veterans today.   Last month, I met with members of the American Legion Department of  Arkansas who were visiting the Nation's Capital to voice their support  for the organization's 2019 priorities. This includes supporting the  VA's efforts to reduce veteran suicides, improving healthcare for women  veterans, fighting veteran homelessness, ensuring GI bill benefits, and  ensuring benefits to veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange. I am  optimistic about the progress we will make on these important issues  because of the excellent and active work of the American Legion  Department of Arkansas, which has more than 10,000 members in nearly  150 posts throughout the State.   The Arkansas Department of the American Legion was incorporated on  May 12, 1919. National headquarters records show it was the first  incorporation of the organization in the United States. There is a  proud history of involvement in all corners of the State, ranging from  the annual fallen heroes ceremony to the Law Enforcement Officer of the  Year program.   I have had the privilege of participating in Legion events around the  State, including honoring the Arkansans who paid the ultimate  sacrifice, celebrating the milestones of the posts, and recognizing  young Arkansans who have been distinguished by Legionnaires. The Legion  rightfully prides itself as being actively involved in the community  and teaching Arkansas youth how to be good citizens. Through a variety  of programs and activities--Boys and Girls State Programs, support of  the Boy Scouts of America, and the American Legion Baseball Program, to  name a few--it encourages fostering a dedication to civic  responsibility, promoting American values, and serving others.   For 100 years, the American Legion has worked tirelessly to improve  the lives of veterans and their families. In honor of their centennial,  Congress approved minting a coin to recognize its milestone. I was a  proud cosponsor of the bill and support its passage to commemorate the  legacy of the American Legion and the thousands of men and women who  have supported its mission and upheld the four pillars of its founding:  veterans affairs and rehabilitation,  [[Page S1759]]  national security, Americanism, and children and youth.   As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have seen up  close Legionnaires' and the American Legion Auxiliary's dedication and  the results their efforts have produced in Arkansas and across our  entire country. I am proud to recognize the American Legion on its 100  years of advocacy and celebrate this century of service with the 2  million members who are making a difference each day as Legionnaires.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Matey nomination expire at 2:30 p.m. on  Tuesday, March 12; further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.
