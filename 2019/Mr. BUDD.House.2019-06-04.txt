 Madam Speaker, I have noticed a trend lately with the bills  that we are voting on. They all have attractive names: the Save the  Internet Act, the Equality Act, and now the thing that we are voting on  this week, the American Dream and Promise Act.   I rise in opposition to this bill because great titles don't equal  great policies. H.R. 6 doesn't really provide a legal pathway for the  DACA population. Instead, it gives green cards to, potentially,  millions of illegal aliens. There is no age limit, and the bill is so  broad that it prohibits DHS from using evidence found in Federal or  State gang databases as the reason to deny an application.                                time  1330    The bill also does nothing to address the humanitarian crisis at our  southern border, absolutely nothing.   Madam Speaker, I visited the southern border earlier this year and I  saw the crisis firsthand. I talked with our Border Patrol agents, who  need Congress' help.   Many things are needed to fix our immigration system, but what isn't  needed is a political messaging bill that has no chance of passing the  Senate or being signed into law.   Madam Speaker, clever bill titles don't equal good policy, and good  intentions don't always lead to good outcomes. I swore an oath to  defend the rule of law, and that is what I will continue to do.
