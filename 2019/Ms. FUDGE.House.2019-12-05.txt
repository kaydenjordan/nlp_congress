 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and congratulate  Sari Feldman on her recent retirement as the executive director of the  Cuyahoga County Public Library.   Ms. Feldman began her tenure at the Cleveland Public Library in 1997  as head of community services, later serving as deputy director. In  2003, Ms. Feldman was named the executive director of the Cuyahoga  County Public Library where she oversaw one of the country's busiest  public libraries for 16 years.   Ms. Feldman's leadership was instrumental to strengthening the  libraries across Cuyahoga County and ensuring they were prepared to  engage and serve the community in the 21st century.   Throughout her time as executive director, she directed an expansive  $110 million capital improvement program for the county's libraries and  navigated the library system through significant cuts in State funding  without reducing hours or service.   From 2015 to 2016, Ms. Feldman also served as the president of the  American Library Association, a testament to her importance not only to  northeast Ohio but to the entire Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Feldman for her enduring leadership,  service, and dedication to engaging and empowering the Cuyahoga County  community.   I congratulate her successor, Tracy Strobel, the new executive  director for the Cuyahoga County Public Library.   As a northeast Ohio native with decades of experience, I trust Tracy  will continue to advance Cuyahoga County Public Library's mission of  being at the center of community life where reading, lifelong learning,  and civic engagement thrive.                            ____________________
