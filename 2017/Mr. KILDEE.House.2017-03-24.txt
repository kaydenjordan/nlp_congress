 Mr. Speaker, well, here we are. Today is the day when  this House will vote on whether or not access to health care is a  fundamental right in this country or should be limited to those of  means who can afford it, whether access to lifesaving preventative care  is something that Americans ought to be able to depend upon.   Now, we haven't seen the final language of the bill--it is still  being worked on--although we are voting on it today, but here is what  we know:   It will result in higher costs.   It will force families to pay higher premiums and higher out-of- pocket costs.   It will provide less coverage; and, in fact, just in the last couple  of days,  [[Page H2374]]  even less coverage, by eliminating essential health benefits like  preventative care, like hospitalization, like prescription drugs.  Somebody might have a healthcare card, but it won't provide them health  care when they need it.   It will have a crushing age tax. If you are 50 to 64 years of age,  get ready. You will pay enormously higher costs as a result of this  ill-conceived piece of legislation.   This steals from Medicare, undoes the promise.   This is a bad piece of legislation. It ought to be rejected.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is the day. In hearing my friends on  the other side of the aisle describe their efforts to improve health  care, I just wonder if we have the right bill on the floor. Because  looking at all the external analysis--the CBO, which I know you want to  discount, but there are many other organizations--what do they say  about this legislation?   It is a terrible bill. It increases costs that Americans will bear.  Despite the fact that we hear about decreasing premiums, all the  reports say that this will increase premiums and increase out-of-pocket  costs that Americans will have to put out in order to protect  themselves from disease.   It will provide less coverage. Twenty-four million Americans will  lose coverage. But even for those who might be able to have health  insurance without essential benefits assured, that will just be a  health insurance card, but not access to an emergency room, not access  to maternal care, not access to prescription drugs, not access to  hospitalization. Basically you will be able to get diagnosed, but you  won't get health care.         This is a terrible bill. We ought to reject it today.
