 Mr. Speaker, this is an Article I  moment. The President has sowed doubt about this country's historic  commitment to two-state diplomacy, diplomacy that aims at a secure,  democratic, and Jewish future for Israel, and that aims at a state of  their own and self-determination for the Palestinian people.   It is extremely important for this Congress to assert itself as a  coequal branch of government at a time when this historic American  commitment is being questioned and undermined.   This resolution makes clear that Israeli settlement expansion is  unhelpful and that unilateral annexation of the territory is  destructive of the prospects for peace. The resolution also reaffirms  U.S. support for the security of Israel. And it makes clear that it is  unacceptable for the President to cut off Palestinian aid, as he  unilaterally has done, despite this aid being duly appropriated by this  body.   This is unacceptable. We need to assert ourselves as an institution  and reaffirm support for the two-state solution, which is really the  only reliable path forward.
