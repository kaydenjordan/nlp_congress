 Mr. President, today I want to recognize Adele Griffin, a  longtime Senate staffer in my Jacksonville office, for her years of  hard work; for me, my staff, and the people of the State of Florida.   A fifth-generation Floridian, Adele previously worked under Senator  Mel Martinez and Senator George LeMieux before her time in my office.  Adele has been a dedicated and diligent leader who took special pride  in addressing the many issues facing northeast Florida over the years.   I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Adele  for all the great work she has done and wish her a happy retirement.                            ____________________
