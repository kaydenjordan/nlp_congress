 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Small Business  Month to recognize Homer's Music, a small business and top tourist  attraction in Nebraska's Second District.   This year, they celebrate 50 years of service to and entrepreneurship  in our community. During those 50 years, Homer's Music had expanded to  nearly a dozen locations in Nebraska and Iowa, but only the original  Omaha location remains today.   Established in 1971, Homer's Music is one of the founding tenants in  Omaha's Old Market, which is comprised of century-old, four- and five- story brick warehouses that were renovated into shops, restaurants, and  bars. In fact, The Old Market is also celebrating its 50th anniversary  this year as well.   Homer's Music has been recognized as Nebraska's best music retailer  and was featured in national publications, including The Wall Street  Journal and The New York Times. While they are known for selling  vintage records, their love for music and its history remains timeless.   It is one thing to own a business, but it is another to keep it alive  for decades. Despite the ongoing pandemic that has financially impacted  many local shops and businesses throughout America, Homer's Music has  remained intact.   Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and society, many of  which are family or minority-owned. Today, and every day, we thank all  small businesses in our community and across Nebraska for their  passion, entrepreneurship, and advancement to our State's economy and  culture.   Madam Speaker, I close with congratulations to Tom Weidner and family  and to Mike Fratt and his team for accomplishing 50 years in business,  and here is to 50 more.                            ____________________
