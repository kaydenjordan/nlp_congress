 Madam Speaker, I thank my gracious colleague for yielding,  though we do not hold the same position on this piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, when our fellow Americans get a cell phone contract,  when they get cable, when they get internet, they are subject to forced  arbitration. Virtually every single American lives under a forced  arbitration provision today, and most do not know it.   Do we really think that people have the ability to go negotiate  against AT&T or Comcast or in many cases big businesses that employ a  great deal of Americans? Of course, they don't.   And so what that means is that we have a two-tier system of dispute  resolution. Regular folks get to show up at Article III courts the  taxpayers fund to resolve their disputes, and meanwhile oftentimes big  business gets a concierge lane to be able to resolve matters in their  favor and oftentimes to preclude the resolution of a matter at all.   Think about instances of wage theft where big businesses can take  just a little bit of money and not pay their employees. Well, an  individual employee would have a very hard time getting a lawyer and  making a case on that, and so they need the class action tool to be  able to get redress for their grievances. The forced arbitration  provisions that impair so many of our fellow Americans limit that class  action tool, and then people end up getting really screwed in the  process.   I support the legislation. I am proud to be the Republican lead, and  it is my belief that if Article III courts funded by the taxpayers are  good enough for the rest of us, they ought to be good enough for big  business. I thank the gentleman for his indulgence.
