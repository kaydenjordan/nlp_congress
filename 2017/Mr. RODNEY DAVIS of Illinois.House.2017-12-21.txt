 Mr. Speaker, my congratulations go out  to Chairman Frelinghuysen and to Chairman Shuster for putting these  FEMA reforms into law that were long overdue. I thank the gentlemen for  their support.   I rise in support of H.R. 4667, the critical disaster assistance  legislation to help those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria this year.   I have said on the floor of this House numerous times that I believe  it is important for Congress to come together when disaster strikes to  help those impacted. Helping our fellow Americans after a disaster is  the right thing to do.   And, don't forget, you never know when a disaster may hit your State.  That is why I am thankful to Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairman  Shuster for including language important to my home State of Illinois  in this bill. My bill, the Disaster Declaration Improvement Act,  requires FEMA to place greater weight and consideration on the severe,  localized impact of the damage following a disaster.                                time  1530    I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, for working  with me on this bipartisan bill.   FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining  the need for public and individual assistance. However, there is no  standard to determine which factor is more important than another,  which leads to a highly subjective process, and one that has left rural  counties in very populated States, like Illinois, left without help  from the Federal Government.   It is because one major factor used by FEMA is a State's population.  Currently, FEMA multiplies a State's population by $1.39 to use it for  the threshold to determine need, meaning, for Illinois to receive  assistance, damages would have to be $18 million or more.   As you can see by this chart, that is more than or nearly double that  of all  [[Page H10391]]  of our neighboring States. There have been multiple times where a storm  hits both Illinois and our neighbors, but Illinois is the only one  denied assistance.   One of the most recent examples is, 2 years ago this Christmas, flood  damage throughout 16 counties cost $15 million in damages. Missouri,  who was also impacted by this same storm, received assistance, but  Illinois did not.   This is wrong. My constituents pay into the Disaster Relief Fund to  help other States. It should be there when they need it.
