 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, I pay tribute to a remarkable Iowan. She  is one of the longest serving newspaper columnists in America.   She has an uncommon work ethic, having never missed a deadline in 70  years. Her weekly commentary in the Shenandoah Valley News has  blanketed her close-knit community in southwest Iowa for seven decades.   Now--get this--at age 100 years young, Evelyn Birkby--mother,  farmer's wife, radio commentator--better yet, radio homemaker for KMA  Radio--columnist, and author--is now retiring.   Her readers will miss her byline and storytelling. Her neighborly  columns about ordinary life in rural America have brought extraordinary  joy to generations of Iowans.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
