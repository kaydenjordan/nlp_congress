 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our bill, the  REMOTE Learning Act, to protect veterans' education benefits.   Last year, Congress prevented cuts to veterans' tuition payments as  students transitioned to online learning. This helped folks stay in  school during the pandemic, which remains one of the most challenging  times to pursue higher education.   Unfortunately, these benefits are at risk once again. By law, the  Department of Veterans Affairs is required to cut housing benefits for  student veterans who are taking classes remotely. This doesn't make  sense during a global pandemic.   While some colleges and professors have chosen to keep classes  remote, many student veterans have opted to live on campus. We need to  act now to ensure our veterans receive the necessary flexibility to  achieve academic success.   The REMOTE Learning Act will extend remote learning waivers, ensure  veterans receive full housing benefits, allow universities to continue  recruiting foreign students so that student bodies can remain diverse,  and minimize paperwork for tuition reimbursement.   Our veterans deserve a world-class education. They deserve to earn  their degrees on time. Some of these brave servicemembers have waited  their whole lives to get their degrees. The negative effects of the  pandemic shouldn't hinder them from doing that. We have a  responsibility to help.   I want to thank Chairman Takano and Chairman Levin for their  leadership on this bill and for all the hard work they have done to  protect our veterans. It is time to pass this bill and give the  veterans the benefits they have earned.
