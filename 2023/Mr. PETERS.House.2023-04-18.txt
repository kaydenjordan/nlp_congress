 Mr. Speaker, the recent court decision on medication  abortion is the clearest example yet of the horrific consequences of  the Republicans' anti-abortion crusade. While many said a national ban  was not the goal and that this would be a States' issue, abortion care  could be restricted even in pro-choice States.   Mr. Speaker, that begs the question: What is next? Birth control?  Plan B? Will anti-vaxxers ask the courts to take down lifesaving  vaccines? Will extremists litigate any drug that utilized stem cell  research?   San Diego is home to some of the most innovative biomedical companies  in the world, and so many of these companies have come out to oppose  this decision, to say that the ruling threatens their ability to create  the cures of tomorrow.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are uncharacteristically  quiet about this. They let this genie out of the bottle. They need to  find the political courage to put it back in.                            ____________________
