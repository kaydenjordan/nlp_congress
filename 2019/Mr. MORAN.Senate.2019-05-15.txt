 Mr. President, this week, as we know, our Nation observes  National Police Week, a time when we pay tribute to our law enforcement  officers, especially those who died in the line of duty. Today I rise  to honor their dedication and their significant and tremendous  sacrifice.   On Monday evening, thousands of people gathered on the National Mall  to pay tribute to the 371 officers who gave their lives in the line of  duty. Four officers from Kansas were among those memorialized on  Monday.   Last June, Wyandotte County sheriff's deputies Theresa King and  Patrick Rohrer were shot and killed while preparing to transport a  prisoner. Theresa King joined the Wyandotte County Sheriff's Office in  2005. A working mother of three children, Theresa, or ``TK,'' was known  for coming to work every day with a smile and a willingness to help out  in any way that she could. She is a founding member of the Kansas City- based Lancaster-Melton Peacekeepers Civitan Club, a group of law  enforcement officers and their families dedicated to honoring slain  officers.    Patrick Rohrer, a husband and father of two children, joined the  Wyandotte County Sheriff's Office in 2011. Patrick was known as a  dedicated deputy that never lost his sense of humor and often peppered  his colleagues with his favorite ``Star Wars'' quotes. He was also  known for his competitive spirit.   Patrick had been a varsity letterman on the swim team at Shawnee  Mission  [[Page S2873]]  Northwest High School. His family's motto became ``Keep on Swimming.''   I will echo Wyandotte County's Sheriff Don Ash's words in  memorializing the deputies: ``Theresa and Patrick were heroes in every  sense of the word'' when they put ``their lives between a cold-blooded  killer and the citizens they swore an oath to protect.''   In September, Deputy Sheriff Robert Kunze of the Sedgwick County  Sheriff's Office was fatally shot during an encounter with a suspect in  a stolen vehicle. He, too, was a husband and father who had served with  the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office for 12 years and had previously  served with the Shawnee County Sheriff's Office for 6 years.   Robert Kunze's impact on the department was made apparent when  Sedgwick County's Sheriff Jeff Easter referred to his death as the loss  of a ``family member.'' Robert was known as an exceptional law  enforcement officer and has been remembered by his colleagues as having  a contagious laugh that always made others feel welcome.   This year we also memorialized Jefferson County undersheriff George  Burnau, who died in the line of duty on April 29, 1920. His dedication  set an example for generations of law enforcement officers in Kansas  and around the country, those that followed him.   I would like to honor one additional law enforcement officer who is  serving on my staff as a Department of Justice fellow. ATF Special  Agent Matt Beccio has become an integral part of our team over the past  year, giving sound advice on issues relating to Justice and traveling  to Kansas to meet with local law enforcement officials. His firsthand  enforcement experience and passion for bettering the lives of law  enforcement officers across the country have been tremendous assets to  our office. This week Matt led members of my staff in participating in  Police Week's 5K memorial run alongside Kansas law enforcement and  their colleagues from across the country.   Thank you, Matt, for your dedication and for using your role in our  office to better support your colleagues in law enforcement.   During National Police Week and throughout the year, we are reminded  that law enforcement needs our support. We must provide them with the  resources they need to do their jobs. As chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice and, particularly,  those law enforcement grants, I am committed to doing so.   We know we must provide the tools that law enforcement needs to build  and strengthen the bonds of trust with those they serve and provide our  best efforts to address the underlying challenges and the challenges of  our society and of our country that face each and every community.   We honor the service and sacrifice of our Nation's fallen law  enforcement officers, not only for the sake of those who have departed  but as a reminder to all of us that remain.   May God bless our law enforcement officers and protect them from harm  as they faithfully perform their duties each and every day.               65th Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education    Mr. President, on the of 65th anniversary of the Supreme Court  decision on Brown v. Board of Education, I rise to pay tribute to the  Topeka, KS, families, led by the Browns and all Kansans who took part  in challenging the injustice of racial segregation.   For 60 years, leading up to Brown, much of America adhered to the  Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson that established the  doctrine of ``separate but equal.'' However, when applied to school  buildings and the education of our children, nothing about it was  equal.   In 1951, Linda Carol Brown was in the third grade and would walk six  blocks to a bus stop that would take her to Monroe Elementary, more  than a mile away from her home, despite the fact that Sumner Elementary  was seven blocks from her home. Even after repeated applications for  attendance at the neighborhood school, the Browns and other families  were rejected. They were rejected because of the color of their skin.   In that year, 13 parents, led by Linda's father Oliver, filed suit  against the Topeka Board of Education on behalf of their 20 children.  Combining other cases throughout the country, Thurgood Marshall argued  on their behalf before the U.S. Supreme Court--the Court that he would  later join as a Justice.   On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court unanimously issued its landmark  decision announcing that Plessy's ``separate but equal'' doctrine  violated the Fourteenth Amendment. While full integration would take  years to accomplish, the events set in motion by these determined  parents were irreversible, and they are worthy of our respect and honor  today.   Nowhere was this truer than in the city where it all started. Before  the case had even reached the Supreme Court, the Topeka Board of  Education began integrating its primary schools.   Kansas had its pre-Civil War bloodshed to determine whether the  Territory would enter the Union as a free State or slave State, and  Wichita was home to one of the first sit-ins to integrate drugstore  lunch counters. But it is Brown v. Board of Education that is our  State's greatest connection to the Nation's pursuit of racial justice.   That these events happened in Kansas reflect the imperfect history of  our State and of our Nation, but also the resolve of individual Kansans  and national organizations like the NAACP to right wrongs and to make  ``a more perfect union,'' as our Constitution contemplates.   On this anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, we remember the  legacy left behind by Linda Brown and her parents. Linda Brown just  passed away last year, and we honor her, her family, and all those  involved in the civil rights movement.   This legacy is one that requires all Americans--each of us--to uphold  the self-evident truth that all men and women are created equal. Let us  remember the legacy of Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, and in doing  so, I ask every American to commit to racial justice and equal  opportunity.                               Disaster Relief    Mr. President, I rise to speak about the devastation I have seen as I  toured flooded areas of Kansas, as well as parts of Missouri, Nebraska,  and Iowa, and the need for Congress to pass a disaster bill to provide  assistance to impacted agricultural producers.   Kansas farmers and ranchers have endured several challenging years.  Since 2013, net farm income has been cut in half due to low commodity  prices. The flooding across Kansas and the Midwest has been one more  setback in the long list of challenges facing our farmers and ranchers.   In the days following the worst flooding, I visited areas of Kansas  that were underwater. I saw farm ground that cannot be planted or put  into use until significant time, effort, and resources are invested in  restoring that land. Continued rainfall across the State and region has  threatened to cause additional flooding in many areas as well as  delayed planning for many farmers.   It is important and it is necessary that Congress meet the challenge  of providing assistance to those producers, many of whom lost  everything. As negotiations continue on a disaster bill, I would like  to highlight the importance of providing funds for the Emergency  Conservation Program and amending the current disaster program to help  cover the cost of lost stored grain.   The Emergency Conservation Program was authorized to help producers  restore land damaged from natural disasters, including floods. Kansans  are, unfortunately, familiar with ECP as a result of assistance our  State received to help rebuild fences following the devastating  wildfires of 2017 and 2018. However, this program does not currently  have sufficient funds to cover producers impacted by this year's  floods.   I asked Secretary Perdue about the ECP budget shortfall at a recent  Ag Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, and as expected, he gave his  full endorsement and support for Congress to provide funds for ECP in  this disaster bill. Secretary Perdue recognizes that funds must be  provided to ECP and other ag disaster programs to help producers  restore damaged land and remove flood debris. Congress must also  provide assistance to producers who lost stored grain due to floods.   Oftentimes, the farmer's income or revenue is not money in the bank  but instead grain stored in a bin waiting to  [[Page S2874]]  be sold. With market uncertainty due to trade disputes, farmers have  more grain in storage than usual, waiting for prices to increase. When  that grain is wiped out by floods, it is similar to the family's  savings account being drained of its cash.   Currently, disaster programs are not equipped to help these producers  who lost a year's worth of work and income when their stored grain was  damaged or destroyed. Congress has the opportunity in the disaster bill  to give USDA the authority to cover the loss of stored grain and to  help these producers get back on their feet.   While faced with these great challenges, farmers and ranchers  continue to provide the food, fuel, and fiber to our Nation and the  world. Agriculture is one of the most demanding ways of life. It is  full of uncertainty, but it is also a very noble calling.   It is imperative that Congress pass a disaster bill to help producers  who lost goods to floods and other disasters and to make certain  farmers and ranchers across the Nation know that we appreciate what  they do to provide for our Nation.   I yield the floor.
