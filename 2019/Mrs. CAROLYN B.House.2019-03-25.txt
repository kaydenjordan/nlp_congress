Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my  colleagues on the Women's Caucus in celebrating Women's History Month.   I am very fortunate to come from New York State, the birthplace of  the women's rights movement in Seneca Falls, and a State that has given  many great women leaders to this country, such as Elizabeth Cady  Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Bella Abzug, Geraldine Ferraro, and Shirley  Chisholm.   But the truth is that many women who have made extraordinary  contributions to our country are largely left out of the telling of our  Nation's history. That is why I am reintroducing bipartisan legislation  this week to establish a Smithsonian Women's History Museum in  Washington, D.C., and I hope that all my colleagues will join me in  this goal.   It comes down to a basic question: How can we empower women if we do  not even recognize them? There is not one comprehensive women's museum  anywhere in the United States of America. The U.S. needs and deserves a  women's history museum that will inspire men and women of all ages for  future generations during Women's History Month and all through the  year. It  [[Page H2787]]  is important. I hope we can make it happen in this Congress.                            ____________________
