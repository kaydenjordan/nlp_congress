 Mr. Speaker, today I join millions of my fellow Americans  in recognizing National Estuaries Week, which extends from September 14  to September 21.   We know that estuaries are those places where freshwaters or rivers  meet the seas. Estuaries are also places where biodiversity is often at  its zenith. They are the ecologies of our coastal communities. Wherever  a watershed empties into the sea, we find an estuary.   My home in Florida is part of an estuary called the Indian River  Lagoon, where the fresh and salt waters mix behind barrier islands to  form what experts recognize as the most biodiverse estuary in the  United States of America. My community and district depend on the  lagoon to support a broad array of activities to meet our economic,  environmental, and recreational needs.   My neighbors and I understand how much we depend on the lagoon. We  strive to protect the sea turtles and the habitat of the manatees. When  they are thriving, we know that fishermen, boaters, businesses, and,  most importantly, our families will thrive.   For years, I have worked for the health of the Indian River Lagoon  and tried to help other communities keep their estuaries healthy. The  challenges of the Indian River Lagoon are the same challenges faced by  all the other estuaries.   Last Congress, I joined with Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici to found  the Congressional Estuary Caucus to support the National Estuary  Program, foster research in estuary restoration and protection, and  bring other resources to bear on sustaining our estuaries.   National Estuaries Week is a special time for a national celebration  of our estuary efforts and for local estuary programs within the  national program to bring the importance of estuaries to their  communities and involve other citizens in their work.   An important part of these goals is to communicate the value and  importance of our estuaries and our coasts to key decisionmakers at the  local, State, and Federal levels. That is what we are doing right now.   Our friends at Restore America's Estuaries tell us that last year's  celebration was a tremendous success, as organizations and volunteers  from across the country gathered at their local bays or riverfronts and  classrooms to celebrate and learn about the importance of our estuaries  and how they benefit our daily lives. More than 30,000 volunteers  across 21 States, Canada, and Guam participated in over 105 different  estuary events.   Many of this year's events are posted online, and they give us a  stunning picture of how each estuary, while being a national asset, is  also a unique treasure to its communities. For example, in Palm Bay in  my district, the Marine Resources Council, the Indian River Lagoon  National Estuary Program, The Nature Conservancy of Florida, Act 2  Technologies, and the Tampa Bay Estuary Program held a rain barrel  workshop and auction, heard from a distinguished panel of water quality  experts, and dined on a fine barbecue meal. A speakers panel open forum  focused on audience participation, facilitating questions and concerns,  as well as the opportunity to present ideas and potential problems and  solutions for our waterways.   We also celebrate National Estuaries Week as a time to recommit our  effort in the caucus to achieve full funding for the National Estuary  Program and to bring those resources to the communities that live on  the estuaries' edge.   We can and we must work to assure that our estuaries and our  environment are sustained.  [[Page H7780]]                                ____________________
