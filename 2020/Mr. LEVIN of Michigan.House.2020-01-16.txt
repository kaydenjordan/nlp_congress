 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  joint resolution, and I congratulate the gentlewoman from Nevada for  her leadership on this issue.   Secretary DeVos and this administration have proven that they will go  to the ends of the Earth to defend predatory for-profit colleges at the  expense of our students and taxpayers.   This holds true for the DeVos borrower defense rule, which creates  unnecessary obstacles for students seeking debt relief from predatory  for-profit colleges. It even punishes students with approved claims by  allowing these colleges to deny students their transcripts and refuse  to verify their earned credits.   Passing this joint resolution is a crucial step, and I urge my  colleagues to support it. But we also must build on this work by  bringing our Higher Education Act reauthorization to the floor. Next  up, we have to pass the College Affordability Act with even stronger  protections for American students.   Mr. Speaker, I want to add a personal note. From 2007 to 2011, I ran  the workforce system of the State of Michigan. In those years,  fraudulent, for-profit higher education programs emerged as a major  problem in Michigan and in our Nation. As a former State program  director, I can tell you that our States do not have the resources or  the authority to remedy this problem. The Federal Government must act.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
