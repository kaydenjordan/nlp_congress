 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, even as we consider the package of  appropriations on the floor this week, we must also think about how  both parties can reach an agreement on all 12 bills we need to pass  before Thanksgiving. It is way past time for Democratic and Republican  appropriators to sit down and hammer out bipartisan agreement on  allocations to the various agencies, known as 302(b)s. That is how we  got this done in the past. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have  successfully negotiated two budget deals. The key to those agreements  was that the President allowed Congress to do its work and stayed off  to the side. I believe that, again, if left to our own devices,  Congress could work out an agreement to fund the government.   As everyone remembers, the President's meddling and erratic behavior  caused the last government shutdown--the longest in our Nation's  history. The best way to avoid another shutdown would be for the  President to keep out of the appropriations process and for Republicans  to stop the games and get serious about negotiating in a bipartisan way  forward.   I believe there was a meeting yesterday, and there may be some  progress. I think some progress was made. Let's continue moving in that  direction, the four corners of the Appropriations Committee--House and  Senate, Democrats and Republicans--and put together an agreement we can  all support.                             Trump Administration    Mr. President, on the whistleblower, as the House of Representatives  continues its impeachment inquiry as to whether the President  jeopardized national security by pressuring Ukraine to interfere with  our 2020 locations, the White House, their allies in Congress, and the  media have resorted to despicable tactics to falsely discredit  individuals who have provided the House testimony.   Yesterday, LTC Alexander Vindman, an Active-Duty Army officer serving  on a detail in the White House, testified before Congress. Since  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's testimony was announced and especially in  the past 24  [[Page S6264]]  hours, he has been vilified by individuals in the media and elsewhere.  Although he has served our country for more than 20 years, although he  is a recipient of the Purple Heart after being wounded while serving in  Iraq, he has been called derogatory terms, and some have even gone so  far as to call him a spy and question his loyalty to the United States.   These attacks are outrageous. They are unacceptable, and they are not  unlike the attacks the President and his allies have levied against the  whistleblower whose account first alerted Congress to the President's  misconduct with Ukraine. The President has publicly suggested the  whistleblower is treasonous and a spy.   Separately, recent public reports suggest that a Republican member of  the House Intelligence Committee is actively trying to expose and leak  the whistleblower's identity. This is so, so wrong. Disclosing or  causing to be disclosed the identity of a whistleblower is such a  breach of faith of our whistleblower laws, which are designed to see  that the truth gets out. Anyone seeking the release of the  whistleblower's identity is frustrating the truth and is potentially in  violation of Federal law. Not only that, the disclosure of the  whistleblower's identity may result in reprisals and threats to their  personal safety and the safety of their families.   Today, I am sending a letter to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of  the Army asking them to provide us with what actions the Army is taking  to ensure that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is afforded appropriate  protections. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and whistleblowers like him are  standing up for the Constitution they swore an oath to defend. Their  lives and families must not be put in jeopardy by an outrageous attack  or disclosure.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, now on healthcare, today the Senate will hold a vote  on a resolution to repeal a Trump administration rule promoting junk  health insurance plans, which offer a way around protections for  Americans with preexisting conditions. The administration has worked to  make it easier for States to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize these  junk insurance plans, many of which don't cover essential benefits,  like maternity care, preventive screening, and mental healthcare. These  junk plans leave families vulnerable and are nothing but a boon to  health insurance companies.   For nearly 3 years, Republicans in Congress and the Trump  administration have sabotaged Americans' healthcare. Funding to sign up  Americans for health insurance has been eliminated. Programs to help  low-income Americans afford insurance has been canceled. President  Trump's budgets have threatened deep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.  Now, the Trump administration is suing to repeal the entirety of the  healthcare law.   Yesterday--just yesterday--new data showed that 400,000 fewer kids  have health insurance now, most of whom are under 6--innocents. When  they have bad health, they need help. That breaks your heart. The  effect of all this sabotage is very, very real.   Now, think about this issue, about protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions. Think of a mom or dad who has a son or daughter  and they discover that he or she has cancer. They go to the doctor, and  the doctor says: Look, I have this very expensive medication or this  expensive treatment that will help cure your child, but the insurance  policy doesn't cover it.   The family doesn't have enough money to pay for it, and they watch  their child suffer. That should not happen in America. We want to  prevent it from happening.   That is why we hope our colleagues will join us in this CRA to  overturn what the administration has done that would allow that  terrible example to go forward.   Let me continue on healthcare for a minute. Despite making explicit  promises to defend protections for Americans with preexisting  conditions in campaign ads--I even heard some speak about it as  recently as yesterday--Republicans have voted to undermine these  protections in Congress on several occasions. There is no getting  around the fact that junk insurance plans offer a way around these  important protections and drive costs up for everyone else.   Do Republicans want to use taxpayer dollars to fund these junk plans  and add to insurance company profits?   I hope not, but we will see today. Today, my Republican colleagues  face a test. They can vote to defend healthcare protections for  Americans who need it most or they can stand with President Trump and  vote to allow these junk health insurance plans with so many  devastating effects on so many families flood the market.                                    Syria    Mr. President, finally, on Syria, we were informed yesterday that  after multiple requests, the Senate will finally receive an all-Member  briefing by the administration on the situation in northern Syria this  afternoon. I am glad the briefing is taking place, but it is  regrettable that it has even taken this long.   Secretary Pompeo also will not participate, which is profoundly  disappointing, given that we must hear from the Secretary of State at  times and on issues such as this.   Nevertheless, those members of the administration who will be there  today must answer several important questions. What is our strategy  moving forward on northern Syria? How are we going to protect troops  and our national interest? And, most importantly, exactly what is our  plan to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and to make sure that those  who are still imprisoned don't escape and those who have already  escaped don't hurt us?   These urgent questions go to the heart of America's national  security, and we need them answered today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2755         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
