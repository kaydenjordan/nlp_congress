 Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge my  experienced and talented friend from Louisiana in his maiden speech,  speaking about something that reflects his experience. Briefly, his  experience, aside from being an outstanding citizen, was as a secretary  of revenue in Louisiana, a State treasurer in Louisiana, and an  attorney and a law school professor.   So now there are his committee appointments, which include the  Banking, Appropriations, and Judiciary Committees, which are tailor- made for what he does. As a product of a small town and as someone who  as treasurer in our State has been so aware of the economic development  issues, no one would know better than he what a critical role small  banks play in generating the capital and delivering the capital to a  small business that grows to be a bigger and a bigger and a big  business, while along the way employing more folks.   So, as we as a nation grapple with how to create better-paying jobs,  it is fitting that Senator Kennedy would begin by speaking directly to  how to create better-paying jobs. I welcome him as a colleague. I look  forward to working with him for things that would benefit our State,  our Nation, and the people who live here.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
