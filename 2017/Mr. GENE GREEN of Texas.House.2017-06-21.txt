 Mr. Speaker, in the last month, Republican  Senators have worked in secrecy on a bill that will repeal the  Affordable Care Act. Now they are preparing to vote on that bill next  week without any public hearings, no debates, no open forums. Instead,  the Senate Republican majority have failed to be transparent with their  constituents and the American people. No one knows what is in the bill.   Based on the last CBO score, we know that TrumpCare will lead to 23  million more Americans uninsured and gut protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions and force hardworking Americans to pay higher  costs for less care.   Mr. Speaker, in the words of President Trump, this bill is a mean  bill. Even our former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has said to  slow down.   Why must this bill be so secretive? Because our colleagues across the  aisle know that the more light that is shed on their true intentions,  the more people will realize this is not a healthcare bill at all, but  a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, and it will be paid for  by our elderly and our poorest constituents.   Mr. Speaker, that bill is a bad bill.                            ____________________
