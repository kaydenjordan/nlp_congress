 Madam Speaker, the state of our Union is atrocious.  There are crises everywhere we look: record-high inflation; record-high  illegal border crossings; a supply chain crisis that has stalled our  economy; soaring energy prices; a devastating and deadly withdrawal  from Afghanistan; an emboldened Russia trying to overthrow a sovereign  country and a democratic ally, Ukraine. This is what a full year of  complete Democratic control and failure has brought the American  people.   The President is completely backward. The policies he and his  congressional Democrat allies have pushed us into haven't gotten us out  of these crises. They have actually pushed us into these crises under  his first, short 1-year term in office.   The speech we saw last night was completely detached from reality.                                time  1800    What the American people are hearing from the Democrats is not what  they are seeing, and it is not what they are experiencing. They can no  longer afford to suffer these crises brought on by incompetent,  arrogant, and out-of-touch leaders.   Sadly, the speech last night indicates that this administration plans  to double down on their nonsense and spread lies and misinformation to  the American people. All the American people want is truth,  transparency, and consistency instead of manufacturing accomplishments  to talk about at the State of the Union, like the convenient overnight  change in the science, or shall I say, political science as a wind must  have blown in from the Senate and, miraculously, COVID doesn't exist  anymore.   President Biden needs to own up to all of the problems he has created  and actually come up with some real solutions to get our country back  on track. There is still time to do that.   If he is unable to do that, I implore him, please. Pick up the phone.  Call me. I am happy to help.
