 Mr. Speaker, as the Judiciary Committee sits at this  time to uphold the rule of law, I want to make sure that the American  people understand the role of the United States Congress, that is, to  represent the people, to engage in oversight and truth.   As a student of the Mideast, a visitor of the Mideast on behalf of  this country on any number of occasions, and, of course, throughout the  Iraq war, and, of course, also visiting that area of the world during  the Afghan war, I know what our soldiers go through. Boots on the  ground.   I can never live their life, but I am very concerned about the  presence of the U.S. military by way of a naval ship that is in the  Mideast at this time. No explanation has been given to the American  people.   The Secretary of State makes a surprise visit to Iraq.   I simply want to say that the powers of war are entrusted to the  United States House of Representatives, the United States Congress.   It is inappropriate for there to be saber rattling by this  administration with Iran with no explanation as to why we send young  men and women into harm's way. We should not use one approach to start  a war to overcome an approach dealing with the investigation of the  rule of law. I oppose any such saber rattling.   We need to understand what is going on in the Mideast. We have to  protect the men and women of the United States military, though, they  fight for us.                            ____________________
