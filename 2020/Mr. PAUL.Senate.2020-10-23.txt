 Mr. President, for 100 years, the Rotary Club of  Bowling Green, KY, has been committed to the highest standards of  humanitarian service. The results of this century of engagement can be  seen in successful projects throughout my hometown of Bowling Green,  but also abroad, where our local Rotary Club has partnered with Rotary  International to globally eradicate polio and to meet other enormous  public health and safety needs. I was privileged to participate, along  with one of my sons, in a project to bring clean, chlorinated water to  an underserved community in Guatemala and to see, firsthand, the impact  that the Rotary Club of Bowling Green is having in the lives of  families and children in that country. This is a tremendous  organization that deserves our recognition. I commend its current  president, Alan Palmer, his board, and the current members--who give  generously of their time, resources, and talents--for leading this  organization into a new century of service.                            ____________________
