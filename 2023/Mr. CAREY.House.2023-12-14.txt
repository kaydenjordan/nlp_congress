 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of two brave  firefighters in my district who recently perished in a tragic accident.   Fire Chief Ralph Stegbauer and Captain Jeff Skaggs were longtime  members of the Concord-Green Township Fire Department and proud sons of  Fayette County.   Each man put their lives on the line daily for their community,  whether it was responding to house fires at 3 a.m. or serving as first  responders to roadway accidents, Chief Stegbauer and Captain Skaggs  served selflessly.   Chief Stegbauer, a retired health department worker and teacher, left  his mark on all those he encountered. A loving husband and proud father  of two children, Chief Stegbauer always sought to build up those who  were around him.   Captain Skaggs also had a long history of not only serving Fayette  County, but the country as a whole. He served in the United States  military as a Ranger, and later was given the rank of E5 sergeant.   Friends and family remember him as the first person to offer help to  anyone who was in need. His community regarded him in the same way:  never too busy to lend a helping hand.   These two men exemplified what it meant to be an Ohioan. They worked  hard to support their families, but still found time to give back to  their communities.   They put their lives on the line as volunteer firefighters and first  responders, never asking for anything in return. Their tragic passing  has left a hole in our community, and they will be missed dearly.   Their selfless public service also inspires all of us to work harder  to make our communities just a little better. At Christmastime, please  keep their families in your prayers.                            ____________________
