 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of  Nevada's Third Congressional District, I rise today in support of the  21st Century Community Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act.   We are now over 3 weeks into the school year in my district, and it  is clear that we need to do so much more to support our students,  parents, and schools.   Whether it is at-home or in-person learning, the pandemic is throwing  challenges at our kids that make learning more difficult and, in some  cases, nearly impossible. This isn't just a struggle for students, but  also for parents who are also juggling work while supervising remote  learning for their kids.   We can't just ask parents to make the best of a bad situation. It  should be on Congress to help our working families. Whether in a school  building or in a living room, we need to create a supportive, engaging  environment for our students, while giving parents the flexibility to  still work and provide for their families--and that is what this bill  does.   It will provide additional academic support for K-12 students by  offering access to safe, supervised learning during the day to take  some weight off the shoulders of working parents. This will be done by  bringing together schools, community organizations, nonprofits, local  government, and after-school providers to expand access to academic  resources and create flexibility for families.   I urge my colleagues to vote for the 21st Century Community Learning  Centers Coronavirus Relief Act to give our students and parents the  flexibility and the resources they need to make this school year count.
