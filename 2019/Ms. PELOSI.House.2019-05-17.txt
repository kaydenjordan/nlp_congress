 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am so  proud that the gentleman is in the Chair, as well as others who will  preside in the course of this historic debate today, Angie Craig being  one of them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for giving us this opportunity today to expand freedom in  America.   I commend Congressman Cicilline for his extraordinary leadership, his  courage, and his persistence in introducing this legislation that is so  important to our country, and doing so with the support of the  Congressional Black Caucus. To see him standing there with the rest of  us, honored to join Congressman   John Lewis on the day of announcement  a while back, a year and a half, 2 years ago, and now in the majority  for us to have the privilege to bring this legislation to the floor, I  thank Congressman Cicilline for being a champion of equality in our  country.   Again, I salute the Congressional Black Caucus,   John Lewis, and so  many others, including Mr. Cleaver, who will speak later today.   It is a deeply powerful moment to be on this floor to talk about this  important legislation. What I would like to do is take the opportunity  in the time that I will use to salute the countless activists,  advocates, outside organizers, and mobilizers who have courageously  demanded the full fairness and justice that are the rights of all  Americans.   On this floor, many of us, including Mr. Hoyer, we all go way back  when we sparred for funding for HIV and AIDS. We were successful not  only because of our inside maneuvering but because of the outside  mobilization.   We were successful in passing fully inclusive hate crime legislation.  Barney Frank led the way for us inside, but the outside groups were  mobilizing, mobilizing, mobilizing.   Under the leadership of President Barack Obama--and we salute him for  it--we were able in the Congress in the majority to pass the repeal of  Don't Ask, Don't Tell, to put that into the dustbin of history. It was  successful because of the activism of our outside groups and advocates.    Then, of course, the horrible Defense of Marriage Act, I don't know  what marriages they were defending, but the  [[Page H3943]]  Defense of Marriage Act that was proposed by some of our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, the Supreme Court gave us that answer  about justice in our country.   Then there was the ending of the hateful ban on transgender military  service.   For this Congress, this has been the scene where we have fought the  fight on legislation, fought the fight to present the case in the court  of public opinion and to bolster the case in the Supreme Court.   On this monumental day, my thoughts are with Phyllis Lyon and the  late Del Martin, who shared their lives together for decades. They were  mentors for civic engagement to many of us in San Francisco for  decades. Some of that civic engagement related to LGBTQ rights. They  were an inspiration, as I say, to many of us.   People say to me, ``It is easy for you to be for some of these things  because you are from San Francisco. People are so tolerant there.'' I  say, ``Tolerant? That is a condescending word to me. This is not about  tolerance. This is about respect of the LGBTQ community. This is about  taking pride.''   That is what we do today. For Phyllis and Del and other older LGBTQ  couples, LGBTQ workers striving to provide for their families, for the  young people, the LGBTQ youth, this is a transformative moment.   Fifty years after LGBTQ Americans took to the streets outside of New  York's Stonewall Inn to fight against harassment and hate, we take  pride in the progress we have forged together.   Our Founders, in their great wisdom, wrote in our beautiful preamble  of the blessings of liberty, which were to be the birthright of all  Americans.                                time  1030    To bring our Nation closer to the founding promise of liberty and  justice for all, we today pass the Equality Act and finally fully end  discrimination against LGBTQ Americans. LGBTQ people deserve full civil  rights protection in the workforce and in every place, in education,  housing, credit, jury duty service, and public accommodations. No one  should be forced to lose his or her job, their home, or to live in fear  because of who they are and whom they love.   This is personal. It is not just about policy. It is about people.  Earlier this year I received a letter from a trans woman living in San  Francisco who has faced threats, stalking, and harassment because of  who she is.   She says in her communication:         The fear is very much there. All I want to do is live my       life like anyone else. Please keep seeing me.    Today and for all days, we say to all of our friends: We see you, we  support you, and we stand with you with pride.   We look forward to a swift, strong, successful, and, hopefully,  strongly bipartisan bill today for equality. This is not just an act of  Congress that we are taking for the LGBTQ progress to the community.  This is progress for America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
