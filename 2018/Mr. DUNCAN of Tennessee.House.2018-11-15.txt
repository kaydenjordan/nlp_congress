 Mr. Speaker, as I near the end of my 30  years in the Congress, it is only natural to reminisce just a bit.   During my first term in the House, a roving photographer for Roll  Call stopped me to ask a sort of humorous question. He asked: If there  was a statue of you in the Capitol, where would it be and what would it  say? I said: It would probably be in the basement, and it would say:  Lucky to be here.   I have always felt very lucky to have this job, and everyone on both  sides of the aisle have been very kind to me. But I want to pay tribute  this morning to the three people most responsible for me being here.   A friend of mine in Knoxville told me a few years ago that I won the  lottery with parents. I had never thought of it in that way, but it is  true. My grandparents in Scott County, Tennessee, were wonderful  people, but they had no money, 10 kids, an outhouse, subsistence farm-- pure Appalachia.   My dad hitchhiked into Knoxville with $5 in his pocket to go to the  University of Tennessee and worked his way through. Twenty years after  coming to Knoxville, he was elected mayor and led the peaceful  integration of our city. He got about 95 percent of the African  American vote in three nonpartisan races for mayor.   He then preceded me in Congress, serving 23\1/2\ years and becoming  the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. A former  Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania told me one time: Your dad was  the only man I knew who never had an enemy in this town.   I once described my father as the kindest, sweetest, toughest,  hardest working man I ever knew, and I meant tough in a good way. I got  a really nice handwritten letter from Peyton Manning about that  article. He said he had flown out of Knoxville the day it was in the  paper and that he could tell from that article that I had the same kind  of relationship with my dad that he has with his.   My mother was 2 years older than my father and, after college in  Iowa, came to Knoxville to visit an older sister who had married an  engineering graduate from the University of Iowa and who had gotten a  job at TVA. Her sister talked her into staying, and she met my dad at a  YWCA dance.   Dad told one of his brothers that night that he had met the woman he  was going to marry, and 3 months later, in Iowa City, Iowa, they were  married, in May of 1942. The odds against a farm boy from Tennessee  meeting and marrying a girl from Iowa City must have been billions to  one, but theirs was truly a marriage made in heaven.   No one ever loved me as much as my mother did, and several times I  have told women from the Midwest that I have a very high opinion of  women from that part of the country because I thought my mother was the  sweetest woman in the world.   My wife, Lynn, was a waitress in Knoxville's finest restaurant when I  met her. She later said she married me even though I gave her the  lowest tips of any of her regular customers.   Lynn has been my strongest supporter and biggest critic, my number  one adviser. I honestly believe, if she had been elected to Congress  instead of me, she would have gone much further than I have. She is  certainly the speaker of our house and the love of my life for more  than 40 years.   During my 30 years in Congress, I was in Washington a lot and gone a  lot,  [[Page H9535]]  even when I was home. She had to raise four children, and all four have  made us both very proud. During much of that time, she worked at full- time jobs, worked in all of my campaigns, and took care of most things  at home. It certainly was not easy.    Once President Trump, when he was running, told her: Your husband  sounds just like me. Lynn told him: Yes, I know--great for the country  but hell to live with.   I could not have had a better wife and certainly could not have  stayed in Congress for 30 years if she had not done all she has done  for me and our children.   She gave me four children and nine grandchildren, all now living in  Knoxville. What a blessing. Our daughter, Tara, has been for several  years the head of the Knox County probation office. She has two  children. Whitney has three daughters and is a leader in all the  activities of the Christian Academy of Knoxville.   Our son, John, was elected as trustee for Knox County, receiving the  highest vote total of anyone on the ballot that year, including me. He  did a great job, serving 3 years, and then took over running my  campaigns in 2014 and 2016 and representing me all over the district.  He also is a successful realtor. Our son, Zane, worked for several  years as a railroad executive and now serves on the Tennessee Parole  Board. The boys both have two children, and the nine grandchildren  range in age from 3 to 15.   I told my youngest granddaughter, Emma, who is 7 years old, at my  younger son's wedding party: One of the happiest days of my life will  be when I get to come to your wedding. She looked at me like I had said  something really silly. She said: Oh, Papa, you couldn't do that. You  would be dead.   But I am not dead yet, and I am going home mainly to spend more time  with those nine grandchildren.   Lou Gehrig, the great baseball player, once said he was the luckiest  man in the world, even though he knew he was dying with ALS. I am much  luckier and very, very thankful.                            ____________________
