 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to thank those young men and  women who have served the people of Illinois and the country as staff  assistants, legislative correspondents, and legislative assistants.   I include in the Record a list of their names.         Blanford, Thomas; Blanford, Meredith; Boyer, Davis; Cardon,       Flavio (Amaya); Chang, Albert; Chiang, Alex; Clanahan, Chase;       Culp, Grant; Daulby, Jen; Davidsmeyer, CD; DeWitt, Bret;       Esposito, Tony; Flanigan, Matt; Goldenstein, Jim; Hatzis,       Luke; Haverly, Jordan; Jamison, Reno; Johnson, Matt.        Kirsh, Ari; Lange, Kelly (Childress); Lloyd, Amy (Mathews);       Madden, Steve; Mateer, Mike; Mesack, Michelle (Yahng);       Miniat, Charlie; Nordquist, Matt; Olson, Bill; Olson,       Richard; Pfister, Sam; Reinhard, Courtney (Anderson);       Risolute, Scott; Sarley, Chris; Schonert, Neil; Tvrdy, Joe;       Uram, Steve; Wolf, Saralyn (Tucker); Youssefiani, Darius.     Mr. Speaker, staff assistants are the first person a  visitor sees or hears in my D.C. office. First impressions are lasting  impressions, so even though they are the lowest on the totem pole, they  are very important.   Staff assistants welcome visitors from the district. They help direct  them and, many times, conduct tours of the Capitol. They help  constituents with hotel information and lists of other tourist venues.   Flags flown over the Capitol are highly sought after. These flags are  requested for memorial events and thank-yous. Many times they are  needed in a timely manner and, most times, have a specific date that  the flag should be flown. Staff assistants ensure that this is done.   The tough part of the job is answering the phones. Sometimes these  calls are overwhelming and will get rolled to another staff member.  Many times the callers are just plain mean and nasty. Just like in  baseball, if the caller says the magic words, they are gone. There is  no need to put my staff in that position. It is sad that adults act  this way and young adults have to put up with it.   The next position in my office is the legislative correspondent. For  me, these folks are concerned with writing and mailing letters in  response to inquiries. Since I do not do bulk mailings, this job is  even more important in that individual letters received by my office  receive an individual response by me. Most of the time, I have  constituents thanking me for responding. Very few times did we drop the  ball, and if we did, I would circle back with my staff and we would get  a letter out.   The legislative correspondent has the legislative assistant's help  with the letter, which will be reviewed by my legislative director and  the chief of staff. The legislative correspondent gets an idea of the  width and the breadth and the depth of policy issues that constituents  are concerned with. It is a great place to start.   Sometimes, on a very contentious issue, I will draft the letter  myself. These letters have to come from the heart.   Legislative correspondents usually move to the legislative assistant  position. Legislative assistants start specializing in specific policy  areas. They may have some background in these areas, or they can be  totally foreign to them. This is where a college degree based upon  research, analysis, and writing pays off.   As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my subcommittees  have to be covered. But it is not uncommon for staff members to carry a  diversified portfolio of issues that they have to follow.  [[Page H4721]]    Can you imagine having to follow the evolving world of energy issues  while also being responsible for education, veteran affairs, and  foreign policy? This is a smaller example of the larger issues Members  have to be on top of every day. The only way we can do that is with the  help of our legislative assistants, and for that, I thank them.   From this position, some have continued to become legislative  directors, work on a committee, become chief of staff, work in the  private sector, or return home to start other careers. Some may even  find their way back to D.C. as a Member of Congress. This does happen.   What a great benefit to have these young men and women sacrifice  their time to serve the country. It is stressful; there are long hours;  their compensation is limited, especially considering the high cost of  living in D.C.   Whenever they leave this place, they will have an appreciation that  governing is difficult and that most Members come to D.C. with a real  desire to serve, just as they did. They have my thanks.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is  great to be with my friends on the floor.   I saw an E&E story earlier this week titled ``House divided over  impact, wisdom of clean energy bill.'' Where but in D.C. can you take  an 8-page bill and turn it into a 900-page bill? Not only that, it  authorizes $135 billion with no offsets, and it divides your own  Caucus? You can't outspend some Democrats.   When I testified against this bill at the Rules Committee on Monday,  my friend Chairman Pallone kept making the point that all he wanted to  do was get to a conference with the Senate. Congressman   Tom Cole  asked if the House position wouldn't be stronger with a bipartisan  bill? I think the answer is yes, it would, but that is not what we have  here today.    Let me debunk this myth of bipartisanship. There are 38 bills from  the Energy and Commerce Committee in this package, 38. Committee  Republicans are neutral on four of them, and we support 11 and either  oppose or have serious concerns with the remaining 23.   Of those 38 bills, we had no regular order on 15 of them. The  chairman used to beat us about the head and shoulders about regular  order. And I know this is an irregular time, but 15 of these bills had  no regular order, no hearing, no subcommittee mark, and no full  committee mark. Only two had legislative hearings.  [[Page H4867]]    Even worse, at least three of the bills included were bipartisan  deals that passed the committee or the House, and then Democrats went  back on those deals and changed the language. Now we find out that an  environmental stressors title was added in the manager's amendment that  received no deliberation in the committee.   But let me outline a few problems other than size, cost, and process,  if that is not enough.   Instead of removing barriers to pipelines and transmission lines,  this bill inserts new review criteria to infrastructure permitting  decisions. These provisions don't just target fossil fuels; they delay  deployment of the green energy Democrats say they want   The RPM Act included in this bill allows the EPA to establish a new  Federal registry to monitor sales, track parts, and aid enforcement  against not just race cars, but every car and truck on the road.   The included HFC provisions totally and disingenuously flaunt the  Interstate Commerce Clause by failing to preempt State laws. The  included accelerator provisions invite activists to further change the  HFC standards through the EPA. The 5-year essential use exemption for  products like asthma inhalers, fire suppression systems, and self- defense sprays is laughable when you find out that this exemption does  not even become available until 2034, after HFCs have become less  available and more expensive.   The Blue Collar to Green Collar energy workforce grant program  included in this bill excludes eligibility for not just fossil fuels  but nuclear energy. So not only would a rush to green put people out of  work, this grant program would fail to provide equal opportunities for  the biggest zero-emission energy sector.   Let the buyer beware. This rush to green is exactly what the State of  California has done to their electricity grid.                                time  1645    What do you see? We see rolling blackouts and we see higher costs.   In this environmental justice world, it is a government-mandated  injustice to poor communities, poor communities that already spend a  higher percentage of their income on energy costs and will face even  higher costs and with less reliability and, with that, less opportunity  with the direction that this package takes us.   This is very, very unfortunate.
