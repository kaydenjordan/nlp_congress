 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for yielding  and compliment him for his leadership on this topic.   Just like rebuilding our transatlantic relationship on NATO and our  partners for military work and just like our work in exporting energy  now, natural gas and oil, to Europe to offset the Russian dominance,  this work, this political work, is essential. I thank my friend from  New York, and I was proud to be an original cosponsor on this  legislation.   I want to tell you, on a recent visit in the last few months I had to  Krakow, Poland, I was with the Kosciuszko Institute there in Krakow,  which has studied Russian cyber attacks throughout Central Europe  extensively.   They were telling all of us that they are the front line of  propaganda, cyber attack, testing and training for what we have seen in  the United States and around the world.   The institute cited Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, the Ukraine in  2011, and the 2013 Energetic Bear attack as well-known public examples  of how Russia is using Central Europe to perfect their strategies  before deploying to other Western countries, including what we  witnessed here in the United States.   By the Congress addressing and passing Mr. Suozzi's bill, we can help  Europeans on the front lines of the fight against the Russian  corruption, propaganda, and cyber intrusion machine.   I thank my friend for the time he so generously gave to me.                            ____________________
