 Mr. President, we are now several months into a global  pandemic that has caused terrible human and economic suffering.   Here in the United States alone, more than 2.3 million Americans have  been infected, and more than 120,000 have died.   That is more Americans killed in the Korean, Vietnam, Afghanistan,  and Iraq wars combined and more than those killed in one of our most  deadly wars, World War I.   I recently spoke with Melinda Gates about the foundation she and her  husband Bill established and its efforts regarding the coronavirus  pandemic.   Bill warned years ago to prepare for just this kind of pandemic,  including directly with Donald Trump just before taking office.   Not surprisingly, their foundation has provided millions to global  efforts to find a vaccine and treatment for the coronavirus.   One such event was an EU-hosted virtual conference in May with many  of our key allies that raised more than $8 billion to be spent over 2  years to further promising vaccine and treatment efforts.   The EU and Norway each gave $1 billion; the French, Germans, and  Brits combined also gave nearly $1 billion; the Canadians pledged $850  million; the Swiss $400 million, and the Dutch, $200 million. Japan and  others also made sizeable pledges.   The Gates Foundation gave $125 million, with Melinda wisely telling  the gathering, ``This virus doesn't care what nationality you are . . .  As long as the virus is somewhere, it's everywhere.''   And what was the contribution of the United States? Nothing.   The U.S. Government under President Trump didn't participate in this  shared effort that could help save American lives.   But that is not all. On this 40th anniversary of the World Health  Organization's historic achievement to eradicate smallpox, President  Trump also  [[Page S3304]]  withdrew the United States and suspended U.S. funding from this key  global health organization.   That is right, amid a deadly, worldwide pandemic with devastating  impacts on the American people, President Trump decided this was the  time to walk away from the body heading a global response.   I cannot think of more counterproductive, ill-informed, and petty  decision when it comes to addressing this pandemic.   Twice in the last 2 months, I came to the floor to ask consent on a  simple and timely resolution sponsored by nearly half of this Chamber's  Members.   It urged increased American participation in these global coronavirus  vaccine and treatment efforts.   After all, we don't know where a vaccine or effective treatment may  ultimately be discovered. With so much medical and scientific  knowledge, it may be here in the United States. I hope so.   But why not team up with our allies on joint programs that maximize  and speed up the chances of success? Do we really want the American  people left out of such efforts?   For example, today there are more than 100 coronavirus vaccine  candidates in development worldwide. The United States launched  Operation Warp Speed to focus on 14 of them, including promising ones  like those from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Modern.   We are proud to have some of the world's best researchers and  experts--from the NIH and our leading universities to private  industry--but it is quite plausible the safest and most effective  vaccine will be developed in Germany, China, or elsewhere.   But when the United States pursues a go-it-alone approach while the  rest of the world is working together, where will that leave us?   Look no further than the worldwide demand and competition we faced  accessing PPE. The supply chain for vaccine products like glass vials,  stoppers, and syringes will demand global cooperation.   Just ask NIH's Drs. Fauci and Collins, who said, ``The ability to  manufacture hundreds of millions to billions of doses of vaccine  requires the vaccine-manufacturing capacity of the entire world. ``    But ultimately it is simple math. Most of the vaccine candidates  currently in human trials have not originated in the United States,  joining global efforts makes sense and is the point of my resolution.   Sadly, the majority objected both times.   Therefore, I am pleased to announce that this week, the resolution  has finally passed the full Senate, and I want to thank Senators Lee  and Risch for working with me on a path forward.   This final resolution now states the obvious: that the United States  should work with key partners around the world to find an effective and  timely coronavirus vaccine and treatment.   On this historic 40th anniversary of the global cooperative effort  that eradicated smallpox, I can think of no more timely message from  the Senate.   I only wish we had said so sooner.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, the House of Representatives  will vote on the override of President Trump's veto of my resolution  overturning Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's borrower defense rule.   Congress passed the resolution on a bipartisan basis in both  Chambers. Ten Republicans joined Democrats to overturn the rule in the  Senate.   Unfortunately, in just the eighth veto of his Presidency, President  Trump rejected the measure.   Unless Congress overrides his veto--with a two-thirds vote in both  the House and the Senate--the DeVos borrower defense rule will take  effect.   It means that student borrowers who are defrauded by their schools  will have almost no chance of getting their Federal student loans  forgiven.   Estimates show that only 3 percent of all student loans associated  with school misconduct and fraud will be forgiven under the DeVos rule.   That is because it places unreasonable new burdens on defrauded  borrowers.   First, the DeVos rule eliminates all group relief.   It makes every individual borrower who is defrauded gather and submit  their own evidence instead of being able to apply as a group when they  have experienced similar misconduct.   To prove their claims, borrowers must provide evidence that the  school intended to deceive them, had knowledge of the deception, or  acted with reckless disregard for the truth.   How are defrauded borrowers supposed to prove that?   In addition, borrowers under the DeVos rule are required to show  financial harm above and beyond the fact that they now carry huge  amounts of debt as a result of their experience.   They have to prove that they have been trying to find a job, weren't  fired, or didn't fail to meet other employment standards. It is unfair  and excessive.   Who are these borrowers who are being defrauded? More than 318,000  student borrowers have applied for borrower defense relief from the  Department of Education.   They come from every State in the Union. Sadly, many of them are  veterans. That is why more than 30 veterans organizations, including  the American Legion, called on President Trump to sign our resolution  to overturn this terrible rule.   In his statement ``imploring'' Trump to sign, American Legion  National Commander James ``Bill'' Oxford said:         Student veterans are a tempting target for . . . for-profit       schools to mislead with deceptive promises while offering       degrees and certificates of little-to-no value. Under [the       DeVos rule], it is nearly impossible for veterans to       successfully use a borrower defense [to have their loans       forgiven when they've been defrauded].    Unfortunately, just days after Memorial Day, President Trump ignored  the pleas of veterans and vetoed the resolution.   This issue isn't going away anytime soon.   More students are going to be defrauded by for-profit colleges and  are going to be left high and dry by the DeVos rule--unless Congress  votes to override Trump's veto.   The Department of Education estimates that nearly 200,000 borrowers  will be subject to illegal practices by their schools next year alone.   Those estimates were before the current pandemic, which creates a new  opportunity for predatory for-profit schools to take advantage of  students.   Last week, a New York Times article entitled ``For-Profit Colleges,  Long Troubled, See Surge Amid Pandemic.''   The article notes how the industry saw a similar surge during the  2008 financial crisis when Americans were losing jobs and turning to  flexible, highly advertised, for-profit college programs to continue  their education in an attempt to make themselves more marketable to  employers.   Unfortunately, these programs are too often of dubious quality, the  promises they make are often false, and the cost leaves students buried  in debt.   For-profit college stocks are beginning to see increases as investors  smell the opportunity.   The CEO of for-profit American Public Education, Inc., which owns  American Public University and American Military University, put it  plainly when she said, ``The pandemic has created an unexpected  opportunity.''   Predatory for-profit Ashford University is hiring hundreds of new  recruiters to take advantage.   We are seeing these for-profit schools use the same tactics they  developed during the last recession.   Only this time, if the DeVos rule goes into effect, these defrauded  borrowers will be stuck with crippling student debt for a worthless  degree for the rest of their lives.   I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article to which I  referred to be printed in the Record following my remarks.   My colleagues in the House will have the chance to hold schools  accountable and not leave students and veterans holding the bag for the  misconduct of their schools.   I urge Republicans and Democrats to come together, stand with  students and veterans, and vote to override the President's veto.   How many of us have given speeches about how much we support our  military and veterans?   Well, tomorrow is the time to prove it by voting to override the  President's veto and overturning the DeVos borrower defense rule.  [[Page S3305]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, June 17, 2020]        For-Profit Colleges, Long Troubled, See Surge Amid Pandemic                (By Sarah Butrymowicz and Meredith Kolodner)         In March, as colleges and universities shuttered campuses       under a nationwide lockdown, Strayer University updated its       website with a simple message: ``Great things can happen at       home.''        Capella University, owned by the same company as Strayer,       has run ads promoting its flexibility in ``uncertain times''       and promising would-be transfer students that they can earn a       bachelor's degree in as little as a year.        Online for-profit colleges like these have seen an       opportunity to increase enrollment during the coronavirus       pandemic. Their flexible programs may be newly attractive to       the many workers who have lost their jobs, to college       students whose campuses are closed, and to those now seeking       to change careers. The colleges' parent companies often have       substantial cash reserves that they can pump into tuition       discounts and marketing at a time when public universities       and nonprofit colleges are seeing their budgets disintegrate.        Few of the largest for-profit colleges operating primarily       online have track records to justify the optimistic       advertising pitches. Some have put students deep in debt       while posting dismal graduation rates amid a history of       investigations by state and federal agencies, including many       that have led to substantial financial settlements.        Still, there is evidence that interest in the schools has       increased.        ``I hate to call anybody a winner in this crisis,'' said       Jeffrey M. Silber, managing director at BMO Capital Markets,       a financial services company, ``but I think growth will       increase this fall and could continue thereafter.''        For-profit colleges have long devoted large sums to       advertising, spending almost $400 per student in 2017,       according to research from the Brookings Institution. For       nonprofit institutions, that figure was $48, and for public       colleges it was $14.        ``Unfortunately, because of the financial distress a lot of       not-for-profits are facing, they may have to cut back on       marketing,'' Mr. Silber said. ``I think the for-profits may       be at a competitive advantage.''        Ashford University has received so many new inquiries in       recent months that it has announced plans to hire 200       additional ``enrollment advisers'' to field them. Another       school that operates largely online, Grand Canyon University,       says it has had a surge in enrollments. (Grand Canyon has       nonprofit status in Arizona and with the Internal Revenue       Service but is designated as a for-profit institution by the       U.S. Department of Education.) Capella and Strayer have       reported increases in requests for information.        The trend concerns many student-protection advocacy groups,       which point out that the colleges that stand to gain are       among those with the most troubling records. For the most       part, the largest online for-profit universities have poor       graduation rates--often no higher than 25 percent, and       sometimes as low as in the single digits. Several have been       accused of intentionally misleading students about potential       job prospects to persuade them to enroll and often to take on       tens of thousands of dollars in debt.        Eileen Connor, the legal director at the Project on       Predatory Student Lending at Harvard Law School, said she was       worried by the prospect of a resurgence for online, for-      profit schools.        ``In times of economic downturn, that's when the for-profit       colleges start to thrive,'' she said. Online colleges ``have       a running start, especially now, when there's an economic       downturn keeping people in their homes,'' she added. ``That       is a perfect storm for the thing that they're trying to do.''        These schools often attract low-income, nontraditional       college students who tend to have lower completion rates than       those who enroll straight from high school and attend full       time. Many have family pressures that interfere with study.        In recent earnings calls, many companies emphasized the       quality of the education they provide. Karl McDonnell, the       chief executive of Strategic Education Inc., the parent       company of Capella and Strayer, told investors in March,       ``We're going to continue to focus on maintaining the highest       possible academic quality figuring that that's really the       best way to sort of position yourself vis-a-vis any kinds of       regulatory or legislative initiatives.''        In the first quarter, Strategic Education took in $46.5       million in profit, up from $36.7 million over the same       quarter last year. Its executive chairman, Robert Silberman,       told investors that the company had a ``fortress balance       sheet with over $500 million in cash.''        Before the broad market decline last week, Strategic's       stock price had climbed steadily since early April, as had       those of other publicly traded companies that own       universities and college-related education services,       including Grand Canyon Education Inc., Perdoceo Education       Corporation and Zovio. But for many of their students, the       future is precarious.        At Capella, only 11 percent of undergraduates earn a degree       within eight years, according to the most recent federal       statistics. At Strayer, graduation rates range from 3 percent       at its Arkansas campus to a high of 27 percent in Virginia.        Fewer than a third of students at Perdoceo campuses       graduate within eight years. The company's schools were       recently barred from receiving G.I. Bill money from new       students after the Department of Veterans Affairs found that       they had used sales and enrollment practices that were       ``erroneous, deceptive or misleading.''        Ashford University, owned by Zovio, had a 25 percent       graduation rate, according to the most recent federal data.       Those completing degrees had a median debt of $34,000 on       leaving. Zovio is being sued by the California attorney       general, accused of making false promises to students and       using illegal debt collection practices. The company denies       any wrongdoing.        For-profit schools made a similar play for students during       the 2008 recession, as people searching for work in a       shrinking job market sought new credentials at low cost.       Enrollment at for-profit colleges climbed 24 percent at the       height of the recession, according to an analysis by BMO       Capital Markets.        Along with that surge came increased scrutiny. Government       investigators concluded that two of the biggest for-profit       operators, Corinthian Colleges Inc. and ITT Technical       Institute, had mismanaged or failed to account for millions       of dollars in federal financial aid. They were subsequently       barred from receiving such aid, which led to their collapse.       The companies were also accused of pushing students to take       loans they could never expect to repay.        The Obama administration put rules in place to shut down       programs whose graduates didn't earn enough to pay back their       student debt and to make it easier for students who had been       defrauded to have their loans forgiven. Experts say       conditions are ripe for new growth in the for-profit sector       because the Trump administration has rolled back those       changes.        ``A lot of the pieces are in place to be right back where       we were in 2008, and the regulations that had come out of       lessons learned are being whittled away,'' said Yan Cao, a       fellow at the liberal-leaning Century Foundation who studies       higher education.        The Trump administration's Department of Education has       disputed criticism of its oversight of forprofit colleges. It       notes that it has expanded information on its websites to       help students make informed choices.        Shawn Cooper, an Air Force veteran, said he was twice given       approval for his dissertation project at Capella and worked       on it for months, only to be told that he needed to start       over with a new topic. He said he was forced to leave,       despite a 4.0 grade-point average.        Mr. Cooper says he owes more than $100,000 in student loans       after his time at Capella. ``At the end of the day, I feel       like it's all just a facade on their end,'' he said. ``Get       people in, take their money and get them out, usually without       anything to show for it.''        A lawsuit was filed against Capella seeking class-action       status for students like Mr. Cooper who say the school       intentionally and needlessly prolonged their doctoral       programs, costing them tens of thousands of dollars. Last       year, a judge allowed three counts in the suit to continue,       all regarding the time it took a ``typical'' student to       complete programs, but dismissed most other counts, including       those about how long the programs were ``designed'' or       ``structured'' to take.        Strategic Education officials did not reply to requests for       comment.        Angela Selden, the chief executive of American Public       Education Inc., which owns American Public University and       American Military University, told investors that the company       has started spending part of its marketing budget originally       earmarked for later this year. ``The pandemic has created an       unexpected opportunity,'' Ms. Selden said.        Wallace Boston, the president of American Public's two       universities, said both schools offered a highquality       education. ``People who are critical of the sector on a whole       tend to be looking at things on the surface, and marketing is       one of the things they pick on the most,'' Mr. Boston said.       ``I don't think that those critics are justified unless they       do their homework.''        Relative to some other online-only institutions, the       American Public University System is cheaper, at $6,880 a       year in tuition and fees, and has higher graduation rates.       Still, 22 percent of American Public University's 36,000-plus       students graduate after eight years, according to the most       recent federal data.        Mr. Boston said the university allowed students to take up       to a decade to complete their programs. The most recent 10-      year graduation rate was 35 percent, he added.        Tyler Hutchinson, of Brigham City, Utah, enrolled at       American Public University in 2017. He had three children and       worked part time, so the flexibility of taking online classes       offered hope a degree in environmental science that would       lead to a well-paying job.        But Mr. Hutchinson, 31, dropped out after one semester       because, he said, the college did not disburse his federal       financial aid. The school also sent him a bill for more than       $1,000 for classes the next semester that he had never signed       up for, he said--a bill that has been sold to a collection       agency.        Mr. Boston said the university could not provide       information about a student without  [[Page S3306]]       the student's consent. Mr. Hutchinson gave his consent by       email, but a spokesman said the university needed a formal       consent filing and would have no further comment.        Having been laid off at a convenience store and with his       work as a United States Census worker suspended because of       the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Hutchinson has no income.        ``When they advertised, what got me was the work-life       balance. And with financial aid, it was really attractive,''       he said. ``Even though I really enjoyed it, the financials       were such a burden we just decided to discontinue.''        American Public Education Inc.'s net income of $2.4 million       in the first three months of 2020 was more than double that       of the same period last year, and on June 9 its stock price       hit its highest closing point in a year.                                   ____                Relevant Section of the Inspector General Act                  Inspector General Access Act Strikes b(3)   5a U.S. Code Sec. 8E.

The Congress finds the following:        (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent       years and remain at high levels due to the impact of the       COVID-19 pandemic. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job       preservation and retirement security are placed at greater       risk.        (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and       retirees and limit their losses  [[Page S3315]]       in bankruptcy cases have not kept pace with the increasing       and broader use of bankruptcy by businesses in all sectors of       the economy. However, while protections for employees and       retirees in bankruptcy cases have eroded, management       compensation plans devised for those in charge of troubled       businesses have become more prevalent and are escaping       adequate scrutiny.        (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently       needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more       complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses       and industries.

As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job       preservation and retirement security are placed at greater       risk.        (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and       retirees and limit their losses  [[Page S3315]]       in bankruptcy cases have not kept pace with the increasing       and broader use of bankruptcy by businesses in all sectors of       the economy. However, while protections for employees and       retirees in bankruptcy cases have eroded, management       compensation plans devised for those in charge of troubled       businesses have become more prevalent and are escaping       adequate scrutiny.        (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently       needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more       complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses       and industries.
