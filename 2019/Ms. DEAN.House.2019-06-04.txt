 Madam Speaker, I am delighted to welcome to this Chamber my  [[Page H4229]]  close friend, Rabbi Larry Sernovitz, whom we have just heard offer us a  beautiful, wise prayer.   I first met Rabbi Sernovitz in Abington, in my home district, where  he served Temple-Beth Am. When I was first elected to public office as  a township commissioner, it was Larry, it was the rabbi, who offered a  powerful benediction that evening on the importance of education,  social justice, humility, and courage. Larry has been a close friend  and counselor ever since.   Through Larry's rabbinical work, he has lifted his devotion to  community, faith, and family. Larry lives the creed, ``Love the  stranger.''   As a founder of Nafshenu in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, he seeks to  create a community that places people and their hopes and their dreams  first.   Most importantly, Larry is a dedicated husband to Rebecca and a  loving, steady dad to Sam, Daniella, and Eden, who join him today.   It brings me great joy to welcome my good friend Rabbi Larry  Sernovitz and thank him for his wise prayer.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Mr. LaQuita Brown, Ryan Keith Cox, Tara  Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Joshua O.  Hardy, Michelle ``Missy'' Langer, Richard H. Nettleton, Katherine A.  Nixon, Christopher Kelly Rapp, Robert Williams, Herbert Snelling--these  are the victims of Friday's mass shooting in Virginia Beach.   That phrase, ``Friday's mass shooting,'' should sound bizarre, but it  doesn't. This year is averaging more than one mass shooting per day in  our country.   How long would it take to read all of the victim's names?   How long would it take to process the grief, to wrap our hearts  around the scale of this tragedy?   And how long will it take for our leaders to act?   This year, the House passed legislation to require universal  background checks and to close the Charleston loophole, but these  measures have gone to the graveyard of bills that the Senate has  created.   Each of these reforms will save lives; none of them threatens our  Second Amendment rights.   I will close with the words of John Donne: Do not ask ``for whom the  bell tolls; it tolls for thee.''                            ____________________
