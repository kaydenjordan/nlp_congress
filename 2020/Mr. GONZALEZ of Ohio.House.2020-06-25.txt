 Mr. Speaker, while I will not be supporting  this bill today, I do want to commend my colleagues for bringing this  debate to floor.   Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Richmond, and many others who I have watched on  television back in my office have spoken with a conviction and a truth  that cannot be denied.   As a former professional and college football player, I have been  hearing these painful stories for my entire adult life from my own  teammates. I have seen it myself when I went out in the community with  some of my African-American friends.   While I can never fully understand its effects or its impact, I know  it is real. We have to address it around our dinner tables, in our  communities, and here on the House floor. Black lives have always  mattered.   I also know a few other important things.   Number one, the American people are starving for us to work together  in a bipartisan way to get a passable bill on the President's desk and  signed into law.   This has been one of the most brutal times in our life. First the  coronavirus, then the economy, so much uncertainty, and finally the  brutality enacted on George Floyd as he was murdered on the streets of  Minneapolis. The legitimate protest movements getting overshadowed and  overrun by anarchists who simply wish to destroy America and burn it  all down. This has been a brutal summer, and it is only June.    Number two, with very few exceptions, this House is united in wanting  to deliver for the country. I have spoken to dozens of Members on both  sides of the aisle, and this body wants to act. Every call that I have  been on since the murder of George Floyd has been a near-universal  desire for action and meaningful reform. We believe our bill does that.  I know there is disagreement there, though. But I also know we are not  that far apart.   Finally, we all know that today's bill will not become law. I know my  colleagues are sincere in their desire to enact this law, but we know  that this will never see the light of day in the Senate, and there is  no chance that it will be signed into law.   Yesterday, on the Senate floor, we saw Senator Scott deliver a  powerful, impassioned plea for compromise and debate, true negotiation.  We all know that that is the only way that we can live up to our duties  as Members of Congress and deliver for the people of this country who  so desperately need a win right now.   We live in divided government, whether we like it or not. To the  majority, I would say: You are the majority. This choice is yours.  Please do not let it slip away.                                time  1600
