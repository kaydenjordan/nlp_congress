 Madam Speaker, this week, a champion for STEM education,  [[Page H5348]]  and a dear friend of mine, will retire from his long-time role as  president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, more  affectionately known as UMBC.   Over the past 30 years, Dr. Freeman Hrabowski has transformed STEM  education at UMBC, most notably by expanding resources for women and  students of color.   UMBC was barely 10 years old when Dr. Hrabowski arrived as vice  provost in 1987. Later, he was chosen as executive vice president and  then named president in 1992, helping make UMBC a nationwide leader in  STEM learning and a nationwide leader in education generally as well.   Over the last decade, UMBC has graduated more African Americans with  doctorates in science and engineering than any other university in the  United States. The school also produces the highest number of African- American undergraduates who go on to earn Ph.D.s in the natural  sciences and engineering.   These achievements occurred in no small part thanks to Dr.  Hrabowski's leadership, which made a critical difference as UMBC grew  and expanded its academic programs.   At UMBC and beyond, he has dedicated his career to realizing the  promise of students of color in STEM, and students generally as well,  no matter their background, are assured access to high-quality science  education.   In 2011, Madam Speaker, Dr. Hrabowski chaired the National Academies  committee that produced a key report on expanding minority  participation in science. In 2012, he was tapped by President Obama to  serve as the chair of the inaugural President's Advisory Commission on  Educational Excellence for African Americans.   When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Dr. Hrabowski sprang into  action. Not only did he work to ensure that UMBC was contributing to  research and taking safety measures, he and his wife, Jacqueline,  personally volunteered for the phase 3 Moderna vaccine trial. Together,  they campaigned to reduce vaccine hesitancy in Maryland, particularly  in communities of color.   Madam Speaker, one of the lead researchers who developed the Moderna  vaccine, Dr. Corbett, was a UMBC graduate and the keynote speaker at  our annual Maryland Fourth and Fifth Districts' Black History Breakfast  this year.   In addition to his leadership of UMBC, Dr. Hrabowski has authored  numerous books on STEM education and lifting up academically successful  students of color so they can reach for success in their careers.   In a field where representation is lacking and where opportunities  have not always been equitable, he has been at the forefront of the  effort to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, can  pursue their dreams and ambitions.   Dr. Hrabowski has been recognized nationally and internationally for  his impact. He was the recipient of the Carnegie Corporation of New  York's Academic Leadership Award in 2011, one of the highest honors for  an educator in this country.   He has been named as one of the 100 most influential people in the  world, as one of America's most impactful leaders, and as a top-tier  university president.   Indeed, many universities in the Big Ten, many universities in the  Ivy League, many universities in other parts of our country have  opportuned Dr. Hrabowski to come to be their president. His love and  commitment to UMBC, however, kept him there and focused on developing  it as an extraordinary institution of higher learning.   I believe that the last part is the one of which Dr. Hrabowski is  most proud; that is, a top-tier university president. While he has been  rightfully lauded as a global leader in STEM, first and foremost, he is  an educator.   Frederick Douglass once wrote that it is easier to build strong  children than it is to repair broken men. Over his long career in  education, Dr. Hrabowski has laid the foundation for many thousands of  young people to become the best version of themselves.   UMBC today graduates a diverse group of exceptionally bright and  capable students who are quick to follow their dreams in large part  because of Dr. Hrabowski's talent, focus, and effort. He has been  working so hard to make his dream of educational opportunity and  excellence a reality, and he has succeeded in many ways.   His legacy will surely be cemented in the innumerable achievements of  his students that they have made over the last 30 years and will surely  continue to do so for decades to come.   Madam Speaker, as he prepares to leave UMBC at the end of this year,  Dr. Hrabowski has set the school on a path of success and continued  innovation. All Marylanders, and all Americans, can be proud of his  unwavering commitment to his students, to UMBC, and to his unshakable  belief in the power of young people of color to achieve and contribute  in the fields of STEM.   The future of science, technology, engineering, and math education  nationwide is stronger not only at UMBC but throughout this country as  a result of his leadership.   Those of us fortunate enough to count Dr. Hrabowski among our friends  are all the better for knowing him. I hope my colleagues in the House  will join me, Madam Speaker, in congratulating Dr. Hrabowski on his  retirement this week and thanking him for his groundbreaking work over  the last 30 years.   He is retiring from UMBC, Madam Speaker, but I am sure that he is not  retiring from his life of advocacy for those who seek opportunity and  the realization of the American Dream.   He is an extraordinary individual, an extraordinary speaker, an  extraordinary human being. I am certain that he will continue to  benefit Maryland and our country as an educator and a visionary for  many years to come.    Godspeed, Dr. Hrabowski.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This is an emotional debate. It is an emotional debate because we  lose, on a daily basis, family members, neighbors, friends, and fellow  citizens to a bullet or multiple bullets--killed by gun.   I do not subscribe to the theory that some promote that the more guns  we have, the safer we will be. I believe that is somewhat like the O.K.  Corral theory that if you have a faster gun, then you will be safe.  Eventually,  [[Page H5373]]  somebody will have a faster, bigger, and more surprising gun than we.   Madam Speaker, like all Americans, I found the mass shooting at  Uvalde, Texas, heart-wrenching, tragic, and unacceptable. Although the  news was excruciating to watch, it was anything but surprising given  our history with deadly firearms. Sadly, we didn't even have time to  mourn the 19 children and two teachers who were killed in Uvalde before  news broke of another mass shooting--over and over and over and over  and over and over again.   At some point these statistics have to move us to respond in an  effective way. My friend from North Carolina suggested hardening the  schools. We have hardened this Chamber over the objections of some when  we know that no gun should be in this Capitol other than those  possessed by law enforcement, Capitol Police.   According to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive, there have been as  many as 33 mass gun violence incidents in the 14 days since the attack  on Robb Elementary. We have more guns in this country than any other  nation on Earth. The Second Amendment guarantees that we have a right  to a gun, but the Supreme Court in Heller said: But there are  limitations to that right.   I strongly support an individual American's right to have a gun in  his or her home--their home--to protect themselves and their business.  But the Court said: Be reasonable.   In the past week alone, 7 days, we have seen mass shootings in  Chattanooga, Tennessee, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Tulsa,  Oklahoma. Not even 10 days before the shooting in Robb Elementary, a  domestic terrorist killed 13 people in a grocery store in Buffalo, New  York.   In every corner of this country, Americans are begging--begging-- Congress to protect our kids and our people. Many of us like to say,  This is the people's House.   The people are speaking to us and crying out for action.   A gentleman who spoke before me said something about saying prayers.  I believe in prayer. But I also believe the admonition that John  Kennedy said when he said: ``Let us go forth to lead the land we love,  asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on Earth, God's  work must truly be our own.''   Today, in this House--the people's House--we need to act to protect  the people.   Madam Speaker, I want to direct your attention to this chart again.  Look at the numbers--hundreds of deaths. In addition to the  unconscionable trauma these attacks inflicted on the parents, children,  wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, and other loved ones of the  victims, they have one thing in common: the perpetrator got the gun  legally.   In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the perpetrator got the gun approximately 3 hours  before he shot Dr. Phillips. He was filled, obviously, with passion,  hate, and anger at the pain that he apparently was suffering physically  and perhaps emotionally.   So what did he do?   He went down and quickly got a gun--an AR-15 to be exact--and went  and shot not only Dr. Phillips but three other people in the process.  Those are 285 deaths we could have prevented if we had commonsense gun  laws in place.   Of the 45,000 people who died from gun violence last year alone--we  are talking about making people safe--45,000 deaths--they are not  safe--how many would have also been spared had our laws been stronger?   Frankly, I, myself, would favor reinstituting the 1994 assault  weapons ban for which I voted. And I lamented the fact that when my  Republican colleagues were in charge of the House, Senate, and the  Presidency, they allowed that law to go out of existence. None of us  can speculate what the cost of that was, but there is no doubt in my  mind there was a cost. In fact, that bill reduced mass shootings then,  and it would do so again now.   There is much I believe we ought to do as the Representatives of the  American people in this House. The House, though, has already taken  action on two very critical gun safety measures supported by 9 out of  10 Americans. We don't have 9 out of 10 Americans who are Democrats in  this country. Neither side does. But if you have any credence in  polling data that says what Americans think, 9 out of 10 think that  comprehensive background checks should be the law of the land. I don't  know a commonsense argument against that.   We passed the Charleston loophole. This gentleman who bought that gun  3 hours or thereabouts before he killed Dr. Phillips would have had  time to cool off and to perhaps have second thoughts, to perhaps have  saved the life of a doctor whose job it was to save lives. We sent  those bills over, and Senate Republicans, however, have refused to  allow even debate on either of these bills--even debate on either of  these bills that are overwhelmingly supported by the American people.   I know that my Republican colleagues are as disturbed by the murder  of children as Democrats are. I believe that. I hope that is the case,  but I believe it. But I am confounded by the unwillingness to respond  in an effective way even on asking that everybody get checked out, so  we know they are not criminally insane or a felon or an abuser or on  the terrorist watch list; but it is no to comprehensive background  checks just to see if somebody is a danger to themselves or others.    I know that our colleagues across the aisle shed tears when their  constituents die from gun violence, as we do. This should not be a  Democratic or Republican issue but an issue of our common humanity and  our common sense. If we work together, we can achieve a safer America.   We have seen promising signs from the Senate that a bipartisan  agreement may be possible. I surely hope it is. But this House will not  and should not wait to act. That is why we are voting on this  Protecting Our Kids Act today.   This legislation is, in my view, long overdue. I participated in a  sit-in on this floor to try to galvanize the Congress. It didn't work.  Sadly, it didn't work. To the disappointment of the American people, it  didn't work.   This comprehensive bill is the product of tireless efforts by many of  our colleagues to address issues that contribute to our gun violence  epidemic.   Thanks to Robin Kelly, the Protecting Our Kids Act will crack down on  gun traffickers who take guns, where? Into the big cities and spread  them around. Now, they sell them; they don't give them away for free.  But it is the traffickers who break the laws--not of Chicago, but  perhaps don't break the laws of where they bought multiple guns for  those who can't buy guns.   Similarly, Representatives Cicilline and Espaillat pushed to include  provisions that would regulate elusive ghost guns. Now, I chaired the  Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government that  oversaw the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division, and we couldn't  even make sure that ordnance--bullets--could be traced because the NRA  was opposed.   Representative Titus ensured that we would ban bump stocks, a weapon  component that allowed a gunman to kill 60 people in Las Vegas in 2017  and wound hundreds more.   Was he a hunter? Was he a sportsman?   Additionally, this bill will restrict high-capacity magazines which  enable shooters to inflict maximum destruction in the minimum amount of  time, thanks to language included by Representative Deutch. Because of  Chairwoman DeLauro, Chairwoman Jackson Lee, and Representative Slotkin,  this bill also protects our kids from gun violence at home by  implementing gun storage safety standards.   Common sense and common purpose protects our kids.   This act also includes Representative Anthony Brown's measure to  raise the legal age for purchasing assault weapons and shotguns from 18  to 21. You can buy an AR-15, apparently, or some other multiple-shot,  quick-shot weapon, but you can't buy a drink in many jurisdictions.   Is that common sense?   This legislation never would have come together without the  leadership of Chairman Nadler. I thank the chairman for his leadership,  and I thank the committee for their work on this bill. I thank  Chairwoman Jackson Lee of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and  Homeland Security, and I thank Chairman Thompson of the Gun Violence  Task Force.   This bill, as well as additional legislation from Representatives  McBath and Carbajal that will be considered subsequently on Thursday,  takes major  [[Page H5374]]  steps forward to make our communities and our children safer.   Is it perfect?   Will it stop all the killing?   No, it won't. We know that.   Is there a perfect answer?   No.   Is making schools safer bad?   No. We support that.   I don't know that we support making them into armed camps, as some  would suggest, because I think that would make them less safe in many  respects.                                time  1530    So I urge all of my colleagues to put our country, our constituents,  and our kids first. Let us rise above party and partisanship and  special interests as we seek to do what is right, what is necessary,  and what an overwhelming majority of the American people are looking to  Congress to achieve.   Isn't that what we are supposed to do, represent the people?   I am hopeful we can find a bipartisan path forward to enact long- overdue reforms to make our communities safer from gun violence because  a bullet doesn't care about your race, your faith, your age, your  orientation, or any other factor.   And yes, people do care about those things and manifest it in the  worst way possible. But they do it with an instrument that will allow  them to kill a lot of people very quickly.   The American people care what we do here today. The American people  care that their Congress is doing everything possible to keep them  safe, to keep our children safe. The American people care.   Each of us today has a chance to show that we care. God's work on  Earth must truly be our own. Vote for this bill. Make our kids and  communities and people safer.
