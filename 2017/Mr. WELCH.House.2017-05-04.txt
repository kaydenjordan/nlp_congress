 Mr. Speaker, President Trump was elected by rural America.  This bill betrays rural America three ways:   Health care, 24 million-plus are going to lose their health care,  many of them in rural America;   Second, it takes healthcare dollars and it turns them into a $7  million tax cut for the wealthiest 400 families in this country;   Third, the tenet of rural America is: we are in it together. That  means if you are born with a preexisting condition, you have a  preexisting condition, we are going to be there for you.   This bill turns its back on rural America, the people who stand up  for one another and believe we are in it together, you are not on your  own.
