 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2409, bipartisan legislation I introduced with Congressman Kilmer.   I want to thank Congressman Kilmer for his work with me on this bill.  I also want to recognize the very stellar leadership of Chairman Roe on  the VA Committee and Ranking Member Takano, as well as all the VA staff  seated behind me and those not seated behind me, but who work every day  to make that a highly performing committee here in the House.   When our brave servicemembers are preparing to relocate or deploy  because of Active Duty orders, they should not have to navigate costly  and time-consuming cancelation fees and policies. Under current law,  protections are granted to servicemembers with military orders for  certain civil agreements, including rental leases or cell phone  contracts; but they cannot terminate their cable, satellite television,  and Internet access service contracts while deployed without incurring  early-termination fees.   Our legislation, very simply, fixes this by updating the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to include pay TV and Internet service  contracts. While some States already do provide relief for pay TV or  Internet services, this legislation would update the act to enact a  policy at the Federal level, ensuring servicemembers and their families  receive uniform assistance no matter in which State they reside.   Mr. Speaker, I would again like to thank Chairman Roe for his support  and his work to pass H.R. 2409. I would also like to thank Andrew and  Erica in my office for their work on this important bill as well.   Mr. Speaker, it is our responsibility to help provide peace of mind  to our servicemembers and their families when they prepare to deploy,  so I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
