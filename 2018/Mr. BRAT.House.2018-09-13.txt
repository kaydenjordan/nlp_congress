 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Pastor Rosalinda Rivera,  and her friends, of Chesterfield County, Virginia, to the House Chamber  today.   As an associate pastor at the New Life Outreach Church, the church  her parents, Carmen and Victor Torres founded in 1972, she has helped  reach those who are in search of a better way of life.   In addition to her role in the church, she is involved in many other  organizations to serve those in need. Whether it is helping young  people overcome the challenges of addiction at New Life for Youth,  helping young mothers restore relationships with their children at  Mercy Mom's House, or inspiring groups all over the U.S. with her  writing and ministry, her service has been one spent devoted to the  service of others.   She has turned the lives of countless people around, giving them  faith, hope, and purpose. Her work is a testament to the Judeo- Christian tradition, which calls all people to love and care for others  in the same way that God loves and cares for each of us.   Thank you, Rosalinda, and God bless you.                            ____________________
