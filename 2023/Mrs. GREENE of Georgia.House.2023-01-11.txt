 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  resolution.   Being a mother is the greatest gift in the world, and childbirth is a  true miracle of God.   In 2019, pregnancy centers served roughly 2 million women, men, and  youth. They provided services such as medical care, education,  mentoring, and material support like diapers, car seats, and clothing.   From 2016 through 2020, pro-life pregnancy centers partnered with  pregnant women at risk for abortion to save over 800,000 lives.  Approximately 75 percent of women at risk for abortion who view an  ultrasound of their baby in the womb at a pregnancy center ultimately  make the choice to continue their pregnancy.   Merrick Garland calls parents who want to protect their kids from  sexual indoctrination in schools domestic terrorists but refuses to  protect facilities that help pregnant women carry their babies from  being attacked by far-left extremists.   Since the Dobbs decision was leaked in May 2022 alone, approximately  40 churches and 60 pro-life pregnancy centers have been firebombed and  vandalized across the country by pro-murder extremists. The costs of  damages for each attack range from less than $100 to more than  $250,000. Shameful.   Some of the things they have said--they have spray-painted on a  church in Lansing, Michigan, ``abort the court'' and ``death to  Christian nationalism.'' Death for Christians that care about our  country? I don't think so.   They also caused $50,000 in damages in Bethesda, Maryland, setting  fire to three churches. It is shameful.   Jane's Revenge, which is a terrorist group, said: ``If abortion isn't  safe neither are you.''   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  resolution.
