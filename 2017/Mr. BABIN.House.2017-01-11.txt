 I thank the gentleman from North Carolina, my good friend  and RSC chairman, Mark Walker, for this Special Order opportunity  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are hurting right now with their health care.  ObamaCare supporters are quick to point out some Americans who have  actually been helped by ObamaCare. After spending over $1 trillion of  borrowed money, I would certainly hope that there are at least some  people who have been helped by this terrible law that was forced on us  over 6 years ago by the Democrats and without one single Republican  vote.   Thousands of my constituents are demanding to be rescued from  ObamaCare. They have shared their individual stories with me about how  it has hurt them--higher premiums, excessive deductibles--how it has  disrupted cancer treatments, forced them to change doctors, and how it  has even cost many their jobs.   Here is what real people are saying--my constituents. This is what  they are telling me:   A young couple with three children, living in Tyler County, Texas,  shared how their premiums have gone up year after year. They began with  a $900 monthly premium and with a $2,500 deductible. The very next  year, the premium went to $1,100, and the deductible went up to $5,000.  Then, in 2015, they were forced from a PPO into an HMO at $1,000 a  month with a $6,600 deductible. These are individual deductibles. That  is $33,000, plus the $12,000-per-year premium. That is an extraordinary  burden on a young family. This family tells me about their problem  every time they see me, and they see me a lot because this is my  daughter and my son-in-law and my three grandchildren.   Gale in Deer Park, Texas, and Alisa from Crosby, Texas, wrote to tell  me how their ObamaCare mandates have forced their employers to cut  their work hours. They are losing hundreds of dollars in income each  and every month. This 30-hour mandate means that this college student  has lost out on hundreds of dollars in pay that she could have earned  over the recent Christmas break.   Tim in Baytown, along with several others, wrote to share with me  that it cost him his job. Paul from Harris County and Frank in Jasper  shared how they have been significantly experiencing higher costs and a  decrease in coverage. Roy in Pasadena says that his deductible is now  over $12,000. Ben and Carol, like thousands of others in southeast  Texas, have had their healthcare plans canceled.   This calamitous unaffordability and poor coverage have inundated  folks everywhere, like Linda in Vidor, who have to choose between their  medications and food; like folks in El Lago--David and Sheryl--and  Brian in Houston. It continues to tragically affect folks every single  day. Sharell from Jasper County has faced a doubling of her premiums,  and Carol in Baytown shared how she has seen substantial increases in  her premiums and her deductibles.   Retirees who have worked their entire lives, like Jack from Orange  and Glenda from Hardin County, wrote to tell me how they are finding it  difficult to afford their healthcare costs. Let's not forget that  ObamaCare cut hundreds of billions of dollars and services from  Medicare, hurting the elderly.   Many who are sick have reached out to me, such as Randal of Harris  County, who had their medical treatments disrupted by ObamaCare. I hear  all the time the firsthand accounts of hardworking folks who are at  their wits' end under this monstrosity.   I am voting to repeal ObamaCare in order to provide relief to Brian,  Brad, LaLa, Gale, Alisa, Abby, Tim, Paul, Frank, Roy, Linda, David,  Sheryl, Brian, Sharell, Carol, Jack, Glenda, Randal, and the tens of  thousands more Texans just like them.   Perhaps Paul in Deer Park sums it up the best:         It made it worse for me. It increased the costs, and it       decreased my coverage.    That is the story I have heard for 6 long years, and it is why this  failed program must be repealed and replaced with a plan that restores  healthcare freedom to all Americans--health plans that are affordable  and that meet their families' needs--a plan that they choose, not the  Federal Government. Americans need relief now.
