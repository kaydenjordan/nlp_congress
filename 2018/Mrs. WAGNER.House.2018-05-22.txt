 Mr. Speaker, since returning to a Republican majority 8  years ago, the Financial Services Committee has set out to introduce  and pass progrowth legislation that lessens the burdens unfairly put on  community banks and credit unions and the customers they serve.   Today's bill will allow for these institutions to do what they do  best: focus on their communities. Mr. Speaker, this is something to  celebrate.   Under the leadership of Chairman Hensarling, our committee has  continuously made the case that the former administration's efforts  were not only misguided, but made basic financial services less  accessible to small businesses and low- and middle-income Americans.   With passage of today's bill, that changes. American families' and  businesses' access to credit will improve. This is credit they can and  will use to buy a new car, achieve the dream of homeownership, expand  their businesses, and, most importantly, create jobs.   It is my sincere hope that we continue the momentum of today's vote  and work with our Senate counterparts to roll back Washington red tape  to further our Nation's economic growth and to continue to give  hardworking Americans better access to affordable financial products.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this much-needed  bipartisan legislation.
