 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the Lee amendment to repeal the  Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq.   In 2002, this Chamber voted to invade Iraq on what would later prove  to be false and misleading intelligence provided by the Bush  administration. We removed Saddam Hussein, established a democratic  government in Iraq, and declared a formal end to the mission in 2011.   However, that 18-year-old authorization is now being used by the  President to escalate a conflict with Iran, a conflict that the  American people strongly oppose and one that Congress never authorized.   The Constitution states plainly that Congress shall have the power to  declare war and peace. This amendment exercises that constitutional  authority, reflects the will of the American people, and is the first  step to finally ending our endless wars and bringing them to an end.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the Lee amendment.
