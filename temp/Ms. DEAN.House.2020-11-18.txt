 Madam Speaker, I wear a mask so my granddaughter, Aubrey,  can return to third grade in-person schooling as soon as possible.   I wear a mask so that one day I can go to church and be surrounded  again by a community in prayer.   I wear a mask to look forward to the day when my entire family can  get together.   I wear a mask so more people do not have to experience the feeling of  loss my family felt when my mother-in-law, Joan Cunnane, passed away  from the COVID virus.   Wearing a mask is not a political statement; it is a simple way of  saying: ``I value the lives around me.''   Nearly 250,000 Americans are dead because of this brutal virus, and  it is up to each of us to do our part.   Today, I put on my mask as an act of public health, of compassion, of  care, and of respect, as a way of asking not what others can do for me,  but what I am always saying behind my mask: ``What can I do for you?''                            ____________________
