 Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to our Coast Guard.   One of my favorite sayings in life is, if you want to talk the talk,  you have to walk the walk.   Politicians like to talk, we like to give speeches, yet we talk about  our Coast Guard, how noble they are, how brave they are, how they stand  up for us, these strong men and women, but, currently, our Coast Guard  men and women are suffering and are without pay.   It is also true for our FAA and our Federal corrections officers.   I ask everyone to support my bills, H.R. 350 and H.R. 419, so that  they can get paid.   Whether Democrat or Republican, our duty as Americans is to treat  these men and women who serve our great Nation with decency and with  honor and respect, and may God always bless them.                            ____________________
