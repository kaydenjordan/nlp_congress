 Mr. Speaker, let's look at the historic timeline. The  Reagan administration and other administrations have failed in the past  to veto anti-Israel resolutions, and that failure has not been helpful  to the cause of peace. Over the last two decades, Israel has frozen or  removed settlements in an effort to negotiate peace, all to no avail.   On November 29 of last year, this House unanimously urged our U.N.  Ambassador to veto any U.N. resolution that sought to impose peace  settlement terms. But a month later, our U.N. Ambassador ignored the  input of this House and allowed the U.N. to adopt a one-sided  resolution that sought to impose peace terms on the parties.   Worse yet, that U.N. resolution equates the Western Wall, Judaism's  holiest site, with outposts deep in the West Bank that are illegal  under Israeli law.   Today we consider a House resolution that has over 30 Democratic  cosponsors. It is not a pro-settlements resolution. It strongly and  repeatedly reaffirms our support for a two-state solution, achieved  through direct negotiations, and it objects to a U.N. resolution that  set back the cause of peace. Vote ``yes.''   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the longtime chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding and for offering this important resolution, along with the  ranking member, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.   President Obama's decision to abstain and not veto Security Council  Resolution 2334 seriously undermines the peace process, abandons Israel  at a critical hour in its life as a nation, and does serious injury to  the historical record.   The egregiously flawed U.N. text says that all Israeli settlements  after the 1949 armistice line including East Jerusalem and West Bank  have no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under  international law.   The pending House resolution repudiates 2334 and makes clear that a  durable and sustainable peace agreement between Israel and the  Palestinians will only come through direct bilateral negotiations, not  one-sided, anti-Israel U.N. resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, the U.N. resolution could open Israeli leaders and even  average Israeli settlers to criminal prosecution. Israel's enemies are  likely to exploit 2334 by seeking prosecutions in venues like the  International Criminal Court for construction activities, even though  the vast majority of this activity takes place legally, pursuant to  Israeli law.   A few hours ago, the European Jewish press reported that ``Leaders of  the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations  called for France to cancel or, at least, postpone what they called an  `ill-conceived, poorly timed and damaging' event--the Paris Mideast  conference--scheduled for January 15.''   I hope that we will also call upon our government not to go to this  right before a transition of the White House and the Presidency and  mischief that could be forthcoming from that.   They pointed out in their statement that ``Israel has long sought  direct talks'' and ``it is time for the Palestinian leaders to stop  evading their responsibility and seeking to use international fora to  avoid the only true path to a lasting peace''--and that is a negotiated  settlement.   Nathan Diament of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of  America pointed out that the U.N. has a long-established bias against  Israel. As my good friend from Florida said a moment ago, 20 anti- Israel resolutions against just 4 in 2016--a bias and a discrimination  against Israel.   President Obama's decision to abstain and not veto Security Council  Resolution 2334 seriously undermines the peace process, abandons Israel  at a critical hour in its life as a nation, and does serious injury to  the historical record.   The egregiously flawed UN text says that all Israeli settlements  after the 1949 armistice line including East Jerusalem and the West  Bank have no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under  international law.   The pending House resolution repudiates 2334 and makes clear that a  durable and sustainable peace agreement between Israel and the  Palestinians will only come through direct bilateral negotiations not  one-sided anti-Israel UN resolutions.   With over three thousand years of Jewish history bound up in East  Jerusalem and the West Bank, it is preposterous to assert that Israel  has no legitimacy in defending its connections to this extraordinary  heritage. Sadly, these kinds of prejudiced and revisionist claims are  all too common in the United Nations where UNESCO voted just a couple  months ago on measures that excise any mention of Judaism and  Christianity's ancient ties to East Jerusalem.   Mr. Speaker, the UN Resolution could open Israeli leaders and even  average Israeli settlers to criminal prosecution. Israel's enemies are  likely to exploit 2334 by seeking prosecutions in venues like the  International Criminal Court (ICC) for construction activities, even  though the vast majority of this activity takes place legally, pursuant  to Israeli law.   By calling on countries to distinguish between the State of Israel  and Israeli settlements, 2334 enables the narrative of the anti-Semitic  boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, or BDS movement, that is  aimed at delegitimizing Israel.   And in mere days, the error of 2334 could be further compounded.   A few hours ago the European Jewish Press reported that ``Leaders of  the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations  called for France to cancel or, at least, postpone what they called an  `ill-conceived, poorly timed and damaging' event--the Paris Mideast  conference--scheduled for January 15th.''   ``The international community should not plunge forward with the ill- conceired and poorly timed Paris conference,'' CPMAJO Chairman Stephen  M. Greenberg and Vice Chairman and CEO Malcolm Hoenlein said in a  statement . . . According to the Conference of Presidents, there are a  number of compelling reasons to postpone the Paris event, including the  impending transition to the Trump administration, just five days later.  ``It makes no sense that the next administration is precluded from  participating in a discussion of an essential component of U.S. foreign  policy with which it will be engaged,'' they explained.   `` `Israel has long sought direct talks, it is time for the  Palestinian leaders to stop evading their responsibility and seeking to  use international fora to avoid the only true path to a lasting peace,'  they added. Hoenlein cautioned it was possible the Obama administration  could--following the recent passage of the anti-Israeli settlement  Security Council resolution--take a `further damaging step against the  Jewish state before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.' ''   Nathan Diament, Executive Director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish  Congregations of America, wrote me a letter today and said, ``On  December 23, 2016, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2334, a  blatantly anti-Israel resolution condemning Israel's building of  settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It has long been U.S.  policy that any progress toward an agreement in the region must be  based on direct negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders,  not a vote of third-party nations at the UN.''   ``Unfortunately the UN has a long and established bias against  Israel. In 2016 alone, the UN General Assembly adopted 20 anti-Israel  resolutions and just four against other countries: North Korea, Syria,  Iran and Russia. The World Health Organization condemned Israel as the  world's only violator of `mental, physical and environmental health,'  while the U.N. Women condemned Israel as the world's only violator of  women's rights. The International Labor Organization condemned Israel  as the world's only violator of labor rights. These same UN committees  were silent on the issue of human rights violations in China, Libya, or  the Congo.''   ``Clearly, the UN has an agenda to undermine and delegitimize the  state of Israel, and in that regard UN support for Resolution 2334 was  not surprising. What was surprising--and deeply concerning--was the  silence of the United States on this issue. Rather than exercising its  veto power, the United States chose to abstain from voting, and thereby  threatened the trust and support Israel has long placed in its most  important ally. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Obama has  repeatedly assured American Jews and others concerned about Israel's  security and welfare that his commitment to U.S. support for Israel's  security was `unshakeable.' By allowing the UN Security Council's  resolution to pass in the final weeks of his Administration, President  Obama undermined his legacy and threatened the longstanding alliance  between the United States and Israel.''   ``Whether the abstaining vote was a parting statement from the Obama  Administration or the influence of anti-Israeli forces at the UN, the  incoming Trump Administration and the  [[Page H151]]  115th Congress must make the United States' support of Israel and our  common goals of peace, democracy, and fighting terrorism--a pillar of  its foreign policy. Today's resolution condemning UN Resolution 2334  will send an important message to the world that the United States  stands with Israel and will continue to support our common goals.''   Mr. Speaker, before concluding, I would like to note that many of us  in Congress have been warning about these kinds of reckless gambits for  months. Three-hundred and eighty of us in the House signed a letter in  April to President Obama specifically calling on him to veto any one- sided resolution like 2443 if it were raised in the Security Council.  In late November, the House voted overwhelmingly for H. Con. Res. 165  further stressing the need for the United States to stand by Israel and  veto biased Security Council measures.   I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 11 to denounce this  dangerous Security Council action. I look forward to working with  President-elect Trump to align U.S. policy with the overwhelming  consensus in Congress: that we are and remain committed to Israel's  sovereignty and security.                                             OU Advocacy Center,                                    Washington, DC, January 5, 2017.      Hon. Chris Smith,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Smith: On behalf of the Union of       Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (Orthodox Union)--      the nation's largest Orthodox Jewish umbrella organization--      please accept our gratitude for your support of today's       resolution opposing UN Security Council Resolution 2334, and       thank you for submitting this letter to the official record       of the House of Representatives.        On December 23, 2016, the UN Security Council passed       Resolution 2334, a blatantly anti-Israel resolution       condemning Israel's building of settlements in the West Bank       and East Jerusalem. It has long been U.S. policy that any       progress toward an agreement in the region must be based on       direct negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders,       not a vote of third-party nations at the UN.        Unfortunately, the UN has a long and established bias       against Israel. In 2016 alone, the UN General Assembly       adopted 20 anti-Israel resolutions and just four against       other countries: North Korea, Syria, Iran and Russia. The       World Health Organization condemned Israel as the world's       only violator of ``mental, physical and environmental       health,'' while the U.N. Women condemned Israel as the       world's only violator of women's rights. The International       Labor Organization condemned Israel as the world's only       violator of labor rights. These same UN committees were       silent on the issue of human rights violations in China,       Libya, or the Congo.        Clearly, the UN has an agenda to undermine and delegitimize       the state of Israel, and in that regard UN support for       Resolution 2334 was not surprising. What was surprising--and       deeply concerning--was the silence of the United States on       this issue. Rather than exercising its veto power, the United       States chose to abstain from voting, and thereby threatened       the trust and support Israel has long placed in its most       important ally. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Obama       has repeatedly assured American Jews and others concerned       about Israel's security and welfare that his commitment to       U.S. support for Israel's security was ``unshakeable.'' By       allowing the UN Security Council's resolution to pass in the       final weeks of his Administration, President Obama undermined       his legacy and threatened the longstanding alliance between       the United States and Israel.        Whether the abstaining vote was a parting statement from       the Obama Administration or the influence of anti-Israeli       forces at the UN, the incoming Trump Administration and the       115th Congress must make the United States' support of Israel       and our common goals of peace, democracy, and fighting       terrorism--a pillar of its foreign policy. Today's resolution       condemning UN Resolution 2334 will send an important message       to the world that the United States stands with Israel and       will continue to support our common goals.        Again, thank you for your support of Israel and today's       resolution. I urge all members of the United States Congress       to stand with Israel and vote in favor of the McCarthy-Royce       resolution.            Best Regards,                                                    Nathan Diament,                                                Executive Director.    Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).
