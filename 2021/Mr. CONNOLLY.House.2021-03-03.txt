 Madam Speaker, this bill isn't about what we just  heard. This bill is a moment of potential redemption for a country  riven by racial division, riven by a history of racism going back to  slavery, the Reconstruction era, post-Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the  violent oppression of people because of the color of their skin.   We, in this body, have an opportunity to redeem our country and its  history. Let us unite behind that cause and that opportunity at  redemption.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1280, the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act of 2021.   The peaceful protests for racial justice last summer compelled a long  overdue reckoning for our country to take action to fulfill America's  promise of equality no matter the color of your skin.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor this proposal to end police  brutality and address the systemic racism that has marred American law  enforcement for generations.   With this legislation, we finally say enough is enough: We've had  enough of racial and religious profiling; Enough of no-knock warrants  and chokeholds; and Enough of police using military-grade equipment on  our American streets.   We are a country crying out for an end to the centuries-long scourge  of racist brutality that has stolen so many black lives from our  communities.   The Justice in Policing Act will help erode the culture of impunity  within too many of our police forces by bringing much-needed  accountability and transparency to our law enforcement institutions.   I urge my colleagues to support it.
