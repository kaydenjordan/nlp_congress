 Mr. President, I would like to call attention to the  estimated 5 million Americans suffering from gastroparesis and  recognize the observance of National Gastroparesis Month, which takes  place in August.   Gastroparesis is a chronic digestive disease caused by the stomach's  inability to empty properly in the absence of any observable blockage.  Symptoms of gastroparesis, which include nausea, vomiting, and the  inability to finish a normal-sized meal, can lead to malnutrition,  severe dehydration, and difficulty managing blood glucose levels. This  debilitating and sometimes life-threatening disease affects people of  all ages, including thousands of patients in my home State of  Wisconsin, but it is four times more likely to affect women than men.   There is no known cure for gastroparesis, and the condition is poorly  understood. Some treatments, such as dietary measures, medications,  procedures to maintain nutrition, and surgery, can help reduce  symptoms; however, patients often face delayed diagnosis and struggle  to manage their gastroparesis and access treatment. Increases in  related hospitalizations and emergency room visits can be linked to  rising rates of this disease, which may negatively impact the  capabilities of our health care community.   Nonprofit advocacy organizations like the International Foundation  for Gastrointestinal Disorders, or IFFGD, are leading the charge to  further research, raise awareness, and provide education and support to  help those affected by gastroparesis. IFFGD was founded in my home  state of Wisconsin, and I am proud of the work they do for  gastroparesis patients across the country.   In an effort to improve our understanding and awareness of  gastroparesis, I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in recognizing  August as National Gastroparesis Awareness Month. Thank you.                            ____________________
