 Mr. President, at a press conference on Tuesday, President  Biden was asked if the United States was ready for the surge of people  expected to come across the border after title 42 COVID-19 restrictions  are lifted. His answer?         It is going to be chaotic for a while.        It is going to be chaotic for a while.    Well, that, unfortunately, could describe the situation at the border  during his entire Presidency. The Biden administration has been defined  by chaos at the border for 2 long years and counting--2 years of  recordbreaking numbers of individuals attempting to cross our southern  border illegally; more than 5 million attempted illegal crossings in  total, an average of 6,300-some individuals per day--6,300 individuals  per day. To put that number in perspective, during the last  administration, the average number of illegal crossings per day was  approximately 1,800.   All of these numbers just refer to individuals who were actually  apprehended. There have been well over 1 million known ``got-aways''  during the Biden administration--individuals the Border Patrol saw but  was unable to apprehend. In fact, one in five border crossers is a  ``got-away,'' meaning that huge numbers of people are entering our  country illegally, without our knowing who they are or what their  purpose is in coming here.   The fact that we have seen 80 individuals on the terrorist watch list  attempt to enter our country illegally via the southern border since  just October is a powerful reminder that not everyone trying to enter  our country illegally is simply looking for a better life. And it is  profoundly troubling that so many unknown individuals are evading the  Border Patrol and making their way into our country. It is a problem  that has been compounded as scores of Border Patrol agents have been  pulled off the frontlines to provide humanitarian assistance.   So we have had 2 years--2 years--of chaos at our southern border, 2  years of chaos that has exacted a tremendous cost. Our border  communities are overwhelmed. Our Border Patrol agents are overwhelmed.  And the chaos at our border is unquestioningly facilitating illegal  cross-border activity, including the smuggling of deadly drugs like  fentanyl into our country.   We didn't get here by accident. President Biden hasn't just happened  to have presided over a recordbreaking influx of illegal immigration at  the southern border. No, sir. The chaos we have been experiencing is a  direct result of the President's policies.   From his campaign on, President Biden was focused on distancing  himself from the immigration policies of his predecessor and satisfying  the open borders caucus that makes up a huge part of today's Democratic  Party.   On his very first day in office, President Biden rescinded the  declaration of a national emergency at our southern border. He halted  construction of the border wall. He revoked a Trump administration  order that called for the government to faithfully execute our  immigration laws. His Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines  pausing deportations except under certain conditions. And that was all  on his first day.   Needless to say, the effect of all of this was to declare to the  world that U.S. borders were effectively open, and the President's  policies since that day have done little to correct that impression,  which brings us to today.   Today, the Biden administration is ending the use of pandemic-era  title 42 authorities, which have enabled U.S. Customs and Border  Protection to quickly turn back at least some illegal immigrants at the  border. Title 42 has played an essential role in preventing the crisis  at our border from becoming a full-blown catastrophe, and with its end,  the flood of illegal immigrants coming across our border is expected to  become a torrent.   I mentioned that during the Biden administration, we have seen an  average of 6,300 migrants a day attempting to illegally cross our  southern border. Well, get this: The administration is expecting that  number to possibly double once title 42 is lifted, to as many as 13,000  illegal crossings per day--13,000 per day. If border communities and  the Border Patrol were overwhelmed before, it is difficult to even  conceive how things will be for them now.   The Biden administration is busy putting eleventh hour policy changes  in place in an attempt to stem the expected surge, but how much of it  will be too little, too late remains to be seen.   The President's prediction that things at the border will be chaotic  for a while does not exactly inspire confidence that the administration  is on top of this situation nor did the NBC article yesterday morning  noting that the Biden administration is preparing to release the  migrants into the United States with ``no way to track them''--``no way  to track them''--as a way to deal with the overcrowding at the border.         We're already breaking and we haven't hit the starting       line.    That is a quote from a Department of Homeland Security official in  that story.         We're already breaking and we haven't hit the starting       line.    So, as I said, the Biden administration is not exactly inspiring  confidence, especially since the President continues to reject  commonsense measures that could actually help keep numbers down, like  reinstating the Migrant Protection Protocols, often referred to as  ``Remain in Mexico,'' which will require illegal immigrants to stay in  Mexico while their asylum cases are adjudicated.   We have already seen an early surge in anticipation of title 42  ending, with the Border Patrol's apprehending more than 11,000  individuals at our southern border on Tuesday. And I am deeply  concerned about the border communities and the Border Patrol agents who  will have to deal with what the lifting of title 42 brings--and not  just about border communities because, while border communities have to  deal with the greatest immediate challenges, the consequences of  unchecked illegal immigration at our southern border are felt all over  the country.   New York City has seen a flood of illegal immigrants as a result of  President Biden's border crisis, and New York City Mayor Eric Adams  recently stated that his city is ``being destroyed by the migrant  crisis.'' It seems that the Biden border crisis is even too much for  the sanctuary cities that helped stoke it.   Our current fentanyl crisis is also a good reminder that illegal  activity at our southern border affects every State in the Nation. I  have talked to sheriffs in South Dakota--about as far from our southern  border as you can get--who are dealing with fentanyl that has been  trafficked across the border from Mexico; and as I said earlier, that  trafficking is undoubtedly being facilitated by the chaos at our  southern border.   Mr. President, this has been a grim speech, but it is a grim  situation. It has been 2 years of crisis at the southern border under  the Biden administration, and we are well on our way to catastrophe.  President Biden has the power to do something about this, but after 2  years of ineffective or, simply, absent leadership from the President,  my hopes that he will take the steps necessary to secure our border  aren't high. We will see what the coming days will bring.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the  Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Hoeven), the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Budd) would have voted ``nay'' and the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall) would have voted ``nay.''
