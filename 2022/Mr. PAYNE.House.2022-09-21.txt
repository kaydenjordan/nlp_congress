 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate September as  Peripheral Artery Disease, or PAD, Awareness Month.   PAD is a disease of the arteries that can cause blockages in the arms  and legs, and it could lead to limb amputations. There are more than  160,000 PAD patients who lose limbs to this disease every year. African  Americans are three times more likely to have a limb amputated than  other Americans. That is because these patients are less likely to  receive proper screenings and treatment for PAD.   That is why I created the Congressional PAD Caucus and serve as its  co-chairman. I wanted to create awareness of this disease in Congress  so we can provide resources for better screenings and treatments. Once  we do that, we can save limbs and lives every year.                            ____________________
