 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in recognition of  the passage of H.R. 7574, the Strengthening America's Strategic  National Stockpile Act, which builds on the bipartisan work done by the  Energy and Commerce Committee on pandemic preparedness issues.   I am honored to have co-led this bipartisan bill with my colleague  Congresswoman Slotkin from Michigan. I also thank Ranking Member  Burgess and Chairwoman Eshoo, who has been a longtime champion on  biodefense issues, and importantly, the Energy and Commerce Committee  staff for their tireless bipartisan work on this legislation.   I think all of us can agree that biodefense must be a bipartisan  issue. COVID-19 has clearly exposed weaknesses in our Nation's public  health infrastructure.   I have spent a good part of my career in Congress focused on  biodefense and pandemic response legislation.   I became a U.S. attorney back in 2001, just one month after the 9/11  attacks on our country. Shortly after that were the anthrax attacks  here on our Nation's Capitol. In my U.S. Attorney's Office, we actually  received a hoax anthrax attack, which served as a stark reminder of the  importance of staying vigilant and the threat that even a single  individual can pose.    As former chairwoman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on  Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, we worked on  things like Project BioShield.   When we talk about biodefense, people often think about things more  commonly known: chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats.  Pandemic threats though are yet, as we are learning, some of the most  dangerous threats to everyday Americans.   Every bit as complex as cyber threats, more of an imminent threat in  the 21st century than even conventional conflicts, biothreats can come  from anywhere. Bad actors, malicious organizations or nation-states,  random industrial accidents, or even an act of nature can be the  original source. And once events like this begin to unfold, they can be  extremely hard to predict and respond to.   That is why I am glad that we continue to focus on this and have been  proud to have been part of coleading the package, which we hope will  dramatically improve our Nation's ability to respond to these threats.  I am very proud that Congress came together to get this done.   The Strategic National Stockpile is a cornerstone of our Nation's  biodefense infrastructure. It is responsible for keeping large  quantities of pharmaceuticals, medical countermeasures, personal  protective equipment, and other lifesaving products for rapid  deployment in the event of an emergency.   This bill builds on the bipartisan work done by the Energy and  Commerce Committee when last year, in June 2019, the Pandemic All- Hazards Preparedness Act was reauthorized and signed into law by  President Trump. Our committee's work has continued to improve our  Nation's response to pandemic events.   I commend Ranking Member Walden and Ranking Member Guthrie of the  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for their incredible work on  Energy and Commerce Committee's Second Wave Preparedness Project. This  critical report will serve as the most detailed analysis thus far of  our Nation's public health response to date, and some of their  recommendations were in this legislative package.   The Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile Act  addresses these shortcomings and will improve the ability of the SNS to  manage and maintain its inventory, empower it to partner with industry  to reshore some of our most critical manufacturing infrastructure,  dramatically increase transparency of the stockpile, and create  innovative new programs to help States create their own stockpiles.   I thank all the Members of the House for their unanimous support of  this important legislation because biodefense must be bipartisan to  keep this country safe.                            ____________________
