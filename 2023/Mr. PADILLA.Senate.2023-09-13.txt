 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Office of  Disaster Recovery and Resilience Act. This legislation would better  equip and formalize the Economic Development Administration's role in  post-disaster economic recovery.  [[Page S4443]]    EDA has a long history of supporting disaster recovery and resilience  efforts and is uniquely positioned to coordinate Federal support due to  its network of partners in impacted communities. EDA's role in disaster  recovery is to facilitate the timely and effective delivery of Federal  economic development assistance to support near- and long-term  community economic recovery planning and project implementation,  redevelopment, and resilience.   This bill would establish a dedicated Office of Disaster Recovery and  Resilience at EDA to coordinate the Agency's post-disaster economic  recovery activities, create a disaster team for the deployment of  individuals to carry out such activities after a disaster or emergency  declaration, and require 100 Percent Federal cost share for major  disaster recovery projects.   EDA currently serves as the coordinating Agency for the Economic  Recovery Support Function, ERSF, under the Federal Government's  National Disaster Recovery Framework, NDRF. In this capacity, EDA  provides leadership, coordination, and oversight for primary and  support Agencies for the provision of grants, loans, training, and  other forms of assistance to support economic recovery efforts in  disaster-impacted communities and regions.   Congress has relied on the Agency to implement economic recovery  activities since the 1990s, providing a total of $3.2 billion in  supplemental funding for EDA's disaster relief and economic resiliency  efforts for natural disasters--most recently in calendar years 2017,  2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022. The Agency also received billion in  additional funding tor COVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts.   Yet, EDA's role in disaster assistance has never been formalized.  Having a dedicated bureau or office to direct and implement the  economic recovery support function activities of the Agency could  expedite deployment of resources and improve service delivery to  communities by retaining institutional knowledge that can translate  between communities, preserving leadership at the Agency, and deploying  staff and funds more rapidly.   I thank Senator Boozman for introducing this important legislation  with me in the Senate. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in  supporting this bill for the long-term economic strength and resilience  of our communities.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Booker, Mr. Lee,          Mr. Ossoff, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Lummis, Ms.          Baldwin, and Mr. Brown):   S. 2788. A bill to amend section 3661 of title 18, United States  Code, to prohibit the consideration of acquitted conduct at sentencing;  to the Committee on the Judiciary.
