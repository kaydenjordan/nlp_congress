 Madam Speaker, I am disappointed in the way that our  colleagues are so cavalierly avoiding the facts.   These commonsense measures, had we passed them before, could have  saved over 400 people killed in mass shootings since Columbine.   I am disappointed in the cavalier mischaracterization of  jurisprudence. Justice Scalia said that the rights secured by the  Second Amendment are not unlimited. My colleagues know that the changes  in this law that we are proposing today will not undermine the Second  Amendment in any way.   Madam Speaker, I have two documents that inform everything I do here.  One is the Constitution of the United States, and the other is this  list that I wrote on February 14, 2018, of every one of the 17 members  of my community slaughtered by a killer with an AR-15 in his high  school.   We have heard a lot about foundational rights, foundational  liberties, as if the Second Amendment is the sum total of the  Constitution. Madam Speaker, the First Amendment matters as well, and  for these 17, they have no right to practice religion and to pray for  themselves or all of those who are killed every time we offer thoughts  and prayers. And for these 17 and everyone killed by gun violence, they  cannot peaceably assemble as the First Amendment gives the right to all  Americans. And, Madam Speaker, most of all, they cannot petition the  government for redress of their grievances, not these 17, not the 19  from Uvalde, no one killed by gun violence.   Today, we can help redress the grievances of all those lost to gun  violence by passing this important legislation. We must, and we will.
