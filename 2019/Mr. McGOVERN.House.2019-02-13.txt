 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 122 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 122         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 37) directing the removal of       United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic       of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress. The first       reading of the joint resolution shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the joint resolution       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the joint       resolution and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the joint       resolution shall be considered for amendment under the five-      minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original       joint resolution for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-4. That       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered       as read. All points of order against that amendment in the       nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to that       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order       except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment may be       offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such amendments are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the joint resolution for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the joint resolution to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any       Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any       amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the joint       resolution or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute       made in order as original text. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.        Sec. 2.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of February 17, 2019, relating to a measure       making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2019.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time through the       calendar day of February 17, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.        Sec. 4.  The chair of the Committee on Appropriations may       insert in the Congressional Record not later than February       17, 2019, such material as she may deem explanatory of       measures making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal       year ending September 30, 2019.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my  good friend, who is the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.  [[Page H1534]]                               General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 122, providing for consideration of  H.J. Res. 37, under a structured rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs. It also provides same-day authority for fiscal year 2019  appropriations measures, suspension authority, and authority for the  Appropriations chair to insert explanatory language into the  Congressional Record, all through February 17.   Madam Speaker, the Constitution specifically empowers Congress with  the responsibility to declare war; and for more than 4 years, there has  been a Saudi-led, U.S.-supported conflict happening in Yemen that is a  war by any logical definition.   Nearly all of the bombs that have fallen say the same thing: ``Made  in the United States of America.'' They fall on weddings. They fall on  hospitals and on homes. They fall on funerals, refugee camps, and  school buses. It is an aerial bombing campaign that hammers children,  families, and civilian neighborhoods every single day.   The U.S. military has supported this reign of terror with logistics,  intelligence, ground support, midair refueling of bombers, and the sale  of bombs and munitions dropped on Yemen.   The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project estimates that  more than 60,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen  over the last 2 years. This total is increasing by more than 2,000  people every single month.   Madam Speaker, 85,000 children under the age of 5 have died from  hunger and disease; 18 million people there are food insecure; and 75  percent of Yemen's population is in need of humanitarian assistance.   The United Nations has said Yemen is suffering from the fastest  growing cholera epidemic ever recorded, as well as the world's biggest  food emergency.   These are not abstract numbers. These are human lives--tens of  thousands of children lost.   Given all of this, Americans would be forgiven for believing that  Congress actually declared our involvement in this war, but we have  not. We abdicated our responsibility to the executive branch instead,  across multiple Presidents, Democratic and Republican alike.   Some may dance around this fact by calling what is happening there a  conflict, but let's call it what it is. It is a war. And our  involvement in this war is unconstitutional.   Despite being one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, others,  like the President, don't mention Yemen at all. In his State of the  Union Address last week, President Trump, right here in this Chamber,  discussed his ineffective wall with Mexico, encouraged Congress to stop  upholding our oversight responsibilities over his administration, and  highlighted how Americans will once again be sent into space.   It was the longest State of the Union Address in nearly 20 years, but  the President didn't utter the word ``Yemen''--not once. He couldn't  even spare 2 minutes to update this Congress and the American people on  our involvement there. Are you kidding me?   The President may not want to talk about it, but a free press has  been delivering the grisly details day after day, in spite of the  roadblocks the Saudis have thrown up to limit media access to Yemen.   Perhaps none spoke more vocally than the late Saudi dissident and  Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi. He called for an end to this  conflict in a column titled: ``Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Must Restore  Dignity to His Country--By Ending Yemen's Cruel War.'' That was  published in The Washington Post just weeks before his death.   Let's be honest. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi was a murder. All  evidence makes it clear that it was likely at the behest of Saudi Crown  Prince Mohammad bin Salman. A recent New York Times article even  revealed that American intelligence agencies intercepted a conversation  where bin Salman threatened to use a bullet on Mr. Khashoggi if he  didn't end his criticism of Saudi Arabia and this conflict.   Madam Speaker, is this really the kind of regime Congress wants as  our Nation's partner?   There was even a report that Saudis and the UAE are transferring  American-made weapons to al-Qaida fighters and other rebels. This would  expose sensitive national security technology that could endanger the  lives of our military.   President Trump has said of Saudi Arabia: They have been a great  ally.   Really? Really? This is a country that is responsible for killing and  dismembering a Washington Post reporter.   Madam Speaker, if this is what the President considers a friend, then  I would hate to see what he considers a foe.   Even Republicans are angry with this administration's apparent  affinity towards Saudi Arabia. Politico reported: ``Senate Republicans  are fuming at President Donald Trump for telling lawmakers that he  would disregard a law requiring a report to Congress determining who is  responsible for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.''   No Member of Congress should be okay with a President showing such  disregard for the laws that we pass, and we certainly shouldn't look  the other way when it comes to the murder of a resident of the United  States.   I say to all my friends on the other side of the aisle: If you want  to send a message that United States foreign policy respects human  rights, join with us on this resolution.   Prior Republican Congresses have used every legislative trick in the  book to prevent this debate. They even took the unprecedented step of  stripping war powers resolutions related to our involvement in Yemen of  their privileged status--not once but twice.   These tactics may have delayed us, but they did not deter us. Speaker  Boehner may have been content ceding our constitutional duties to the  executive branch. Speaker Ryan may also have been happy to do so.  Thankfully, Speaker Pelosi is not. She is empowering this Congress to  do its job.    I am glad that, under her leadership, this Congress has strengthened  its political will and is reasserting our Article I constitutional  responsibilities. This is the system our Founders intended, and it is  what our constituents expect of all of us.   This Congress is not turning a blind eye to U.S. involvement in  Yemen. This Congress is not looking away from the civil war the world  sees unfolding on its television screens.   I want to thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus and, especially,  Congressman Khanna for leading this matter. Congressman Khanna has been  the conscience of Congress when it comes to our involvement in Yemen.  He has pushed us again and again and again to do something as these  atrocities mount.   We not only have a constitutional responsibility to pass the  underlying resolution, we have a moral responsibility.   No Congress should be complicit in the bombing of children or the  bombing of water treatment plants during a cholera outbreak or the  decimation of hospitals during a humanitarian catastrophe or the  creation of a blockade that leads thousands of people to die by  starvation.   Considering this measure in the opening weeks of this Congress  represents a clear break from the old ways of doing business, where  matters of war and peace were routinely swept under the rug.   I am proud that this is a structured rule that makes in order a  bipartisan amendment and a minority amendment. The bipartisan amendment  is mine, and, among other things, it says that nothing in this  resolution may be considered as authorizing the use of military force  and nothing may alter the 2001 AUMF because, as important as this  measure is, it is also targeted specifically to our involvement only in  and affecting the war in Yemen.   It is something Republicans and Democrats agree on. Members ranging  [[Page H1535]]  from conservative Republican   Tom Massie to progressive Congresswoman  Barbara Lee have signed on as cosponsors. It should not be  controversial.   Madam Speaker, there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S.  involvement in Yemen needs to end, so I urge all my colleagues to seize  this opportunity that we have fought for for so long. Vote ``yes'' on  this rule and the underlying joint resolution. Let's finally end our  Nation's complicity in the greatest humanitarian crisis taking place on  our planet today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just so there is no misunderstanding, in this resolution, it is  written, Section  [[Page H1536]]  3: ``Nothing in this joint resolution may be construed to influence or  disrupt any military operations and cooperation with Israel.'' I mean,  it is written here for everybody to see.   Secondly, my good friend talked about the consequences of moving this  legislation forward. Let me tell you what the consequences of not  moving this resolution forward are. It means that we are totally  content to sit back and say nothing and not admit that our government  has its fingerprints all over one of the worst humanitarian crises in  the world. It means that we will be complicit in the continuing  destruction and murder in Yemen.   If this country stands for anything, if the United States of America  stands for anything, we need to stand out loud and foursquare for human  rights. For too long, especially under this administration, human  rights have become an afterthought.   What makes us great is the fact that we do have a high standard when  it comes to human rights, that we are there to speak up for those who  are being persecuted and those who are being murdered.   This is a statement, this is a signal, to the administration and to  the Saudi Government that when it comes to human rights, there are  people in this Congress--hopefully, a bipartisan group of people in  this Congress--who are not going to be silent, who are going to demand  that things change.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Georgia, for his kind  words. I have a great deal of respect for him, as I do for the ranking  member, Mr. Cole. I am hoping that this week maybe we will have a  bipartisan moment where we all stand together and keep the government  open and prevent another shutdown.   But on this bill in particular, the bill that we are taking up here  today is virtually identical to the bill that passed the United States  Senate last year with a bipartisan vote. That bill that  [[Page H1537]]  passed the Senate last year was prevented by the then-Republican  majority from even being considered on this House floor on at least two  occasions. So I can appreciate the fact the gentleman may not agree  with the statement we are trying to make today or the bill that we are  putting forward here today, but the process, I think, has been pretty  good.   It just had a hearing in the committee of jurisdiction. It had a  markup. We had a long hearing in the Rules Committee. All the germane  amendments were made in order, a bipartisan amendment and a Republican  amendment, and we are going to debate it here today under regular  order. So the process has been very, very, very good.   I think, for many of us, we are bringing this forward in large part  because we believe that this institution has been silent for too long.   I am not here to defend the Houthi rebels or, certainly, to cover up  for any Iranian meddling here, but I will say this: We know that 85,000  children under the age of 5 have died of hunger and disease since 2015.  Eighty percent of all children in Yemen require humanitarian  assistance, according to UNICEF, the U.N.'s children's agency.   We need to do everything in our power to encourage a political  solution to this terrible humanitarian crisis. I mean, this is  unbelievable. Every person who cares about human rights should be  outraged by what is going on.   We are having this debate here today to say that enough is enough and  to let the Saudi Government hear loud and clear that we will no longer  be complicit in this.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms.  Gabbard).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, on process, just so everybody understands, we are bringing a  bill to the floor today under a structured rule that has a bipartisan  amendment and a Republican amendment.   What my Republican friends are suggesting is that they want to bring  up a bill, and all amendments are blocked, with the exception of one if  offered by a Republican, sight unseen.   Boy, old habits die hard. This is the way they were in the majority.  And thank God they are no longer in the majority, but, wow, what a  lousy process this is.   Then secondly, I want to say that we are having a debate about Yemen,  about one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, where the  Saudi Government is bombing weddings and funerals and school buses,  where thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of people are on the  verge of starvation, where children are dying every day.   The previous question has nothing to do with Yemen. I mean, it is as  if this entire horrific catastrophe that is now unfolding in Yemen  doesn't even exist. I mean, how sad.   This is an important issue, and we have a responsibility to debate  and to vote on this issue, because we have been involved in supplying  so much assistance to the Saudi Government, and not even a mention, not  even a mention of this.   Maybe this doesn't matter to my Republican friends. Maybe they are  perfectly fine turning a blind eye to this horrific horror show that is  happening in Yemen. But I am going to tell you, I think most people in  this country, when they are made aware of what is going on and they are  made aware of our involvement, are horrified. This is not what the  United States Government is about.   So, in any event, it is a little bit disappointing.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Khanna), the author of H.J. Res. 37, and I want to thank him for  his leadership on this.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, the  distinguished ranking member on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for  his comments. I just would inform the gentleman that, you know, another  bill that passed the Senate with a bipartisan vote is the bill that we  are discussing here today on Yemen.                                time  1300    The other thing I would say to my friends on the other side of the  aisle, one of the things that we are trying to do is return to regular  order, something that I think a lot of people don't know what it looks  like. A number of the bills that the gentleman is referring to had no  markup. Let's go through the committee process. Let's do markups, and  let's do this the way we are supposed to do it.   I appreciate that my friends don't want to talk about the horrific  situation in Yemen, but that is what we are going to do here today  because it is horrific, and it is about time that this body take a  stand.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me say to the gentleman from New York that I  appreciate his comments, but that is not what we are talking about here  today.   I would just say to him, while we appreciate the cooperation of the  minority in the Rules Committee and trying to facilitate a process  dedicated more to regular order--and we are going to continue to work  that way--that he should make sure that these bills have hearings and  markups and that the Members of the House have an opportunity to be  able to deliberate on them, and then bring them to the Rules Committee  and we can have that debate.   But I am going to say to the gentleman, this is a new day. We,  hopefully, will discuss process less and ideas more.  [[Page H1540]]    I would also say that we have an emergency right now when it comes to  Yemen. It is one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. I am a  little bit struck by the fact that the last couple of speakers haven't  even used the word ``Yemen'' once.   So, in any event, there is a right way to bring legislation to the  floor. We want to have regular order. We want to do this the right way.  We did this bill the right way. It did pass the Senate. We had a  hearing, we had a markup. It came to the Rules Committee. We made in  order a bipartisan amendment, a Republican amendment, one that I  strongly disagree with; but, nonetheless, we hope we can defeat it on  the floor. If not, that is the way it goes.   That is the process we ought to adhere to. And I would say that, if  we adhered to a better process, we are going to end up with better  legislation and more, hopefully, bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the work of Ranking Member Cole on  these issues. We may not agree on this specific bill, but we have  worked together on matters like the Authorization for Use of Military  Force for many years. He is always thoughtful in urging Congress to  reclaim authority on matters of war and peace, and I do look forward to  working with him in the months ahead.   Let me just remind my colleagues about how this bill came to the  floor.   It was introduced in January. There was a hearing in the Foreign  Affairs Committee. They held a markup, and the Rules Committee did a  hearing and made amendments in order.   Some of my Republican friends may not agree with the underlying bill,  but there shouldn't be much disagreement about the process, because  this is how the process should work. We even made in order a Republican  amendment from Congressman Buck that I strongly oppose. That amendment  would allow the President to maintain unfettered intelligence sharing  with any foreign country, even when the sole objective is to help  determine which targets to bomb in offensive airstrikes not authorized  by Congress.   I don't believe we should preemptively cede our own purview over  intelligence sharing, and certainly not as part of a resolution  designed to reassert Congress' constitutional war authority.   Maybe this amendment passes--I hope it doesn't--but it will be  debated, voted upon, and this House will decide.   Let me say to my colleagues what is happening in Yemen is horrific.  It should shake every Member of this institution to their core:  bombings of weddings, funerals, and school buses; thousands dead;  children starving--a humanitarian nightmare.   I don't know what is going to happen over in the Senate, but I know  what this institution should do, and that is reclaim our  responsibilities and make clear that the Constitution matters, that  human rights matter; the lives of people in Yemen and the children in  Yemen, they matter. This Chamber, under this majority, is going to  provide a consequence for the actions of the Saudi Government.                                time  1315    And I hope that this resolution is just our first step in responding  to the humanitarian issues across the region. I look forward to the  Foreign Affairs Committee holding more hearings and markups and  bringing more bills to the Rules Committee.   I have introduced a bipartisan bill with 20 colleagues that will  immediately stop all military aid and armed sales to the Government of  Saudi Arabia. I think it is the right thing to do when our democratic  values are on the line. I would like to see that come up for a vote,  but I want to have a hearing and a markup before it comes to this  floor.   But, Madam Speaker, this Congress needs to start somewhere so we can  step up our response as a country.  [[Page H1541]]    I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question. I urge a ``yes'' vote  on this rule and the underlying resolution.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:        At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 336) to make improvements to certain defense and       security assistance provisions and to authorize the       appropriation of funds to Israel, to reauthorize the United       States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015, and to halt       the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any further amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; (2) one       amendment if offered by Representative McCaul of Texas or his       designee, which shall be in order without intervention of any       point of order or demand for division of the question and       shall be separately debatable for 10 minutes equally divided       and controlled by the proponent and an opponent; and (3) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 336.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
