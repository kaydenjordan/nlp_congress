 Mr. Speaker, E Pluribus Unum, out of many, one.   Our Nation's motto reflects the truth embodied by the Asia Pacific  Cultural Center for the last 25 years; that our region's diversity is a  blessing; that the people in the cultures that have come from so many  places should be celebrated. And, importantly, that the celebration of  that diversity can be a force for uniting us.   Since 1996, the Asia Pacific Cultural Center has served as that  unifying force in our region, providing programs to support and honor  the Asian and Pacific Islander people. It has brought us together.   Over the years, so many of us have learned from APCC programs.  Personally, I have participated in traditional ceremonies at Samoan  Cultural Days and at the Korean Chuseok Festival. I have tried and even  made all kinds of cuisine. I have joined the APCC in healing after  tragic moments in our country. Like others, I have joined them in joy  and celebration.   I would like to recognize the organization's tremendous leadership,  including Lua Pritchard and Patsy Surh O'Connell and congratulate the  APCC for 25 years of service and dedication to our community. Here is  to many more.                            ____________________
