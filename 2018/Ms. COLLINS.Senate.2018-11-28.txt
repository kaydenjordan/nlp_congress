 Mr. President. As Chairman of the Senate Aging  Committee, I rise today to introduce the ``Guardianship Accountability  Act of 2018,'' a bill that would assist States in improving  guardianship oversight and data collection. I am pleased to be joined  by our Committee's Ranking Member, Senator Bob Casey.   Protecting older Americans from financial fraud and exploitation is  one of my top priorities. According to the National Center for State  Courts, an estimated 1.3 million adults are under the care of  guardians--family members or professionals--who control approximately  $50 billion of their assets. Guardianship is a legal relationship  created by a court that is designed to protect those with diminished or  lost capacity. In many cases, however, the system lacks basic  protections leaving the most vulnerable Americans at risk of  exploitation.   Today, the Aging Committee released a bipartisan report to help  change the tide, implement reforms, and restore trust in guardianship.  Titled, ``Ensuring Trust: Strengthening State Efforts to Overhaul the  Guardianship Process and Protect Older Americans,'' the report is the  culmination of the Committee's year-long work investigating the  guardianship system.   Throughout the course of the year, we heard harrowing tales from  families around the Nation who have struggled with abusive guardians.  We also spoke with families who had heartening stories to share--of  dedicated and faithful guardians stepping up to protect the assets of  seniors with dementia and other conditions affecting capacity. A good  guardian can provide years of support for a protected individual,  ensuring a full life directed, wherever possible, by the person's own  choices and preferences. Once a guardianship is imposed, however, the  individual's rights are removed, and oversight to protect the  individual from abuse, neglect, and exploitation becomes critical.   Our Committee has gathered information, analysis and recommendations  from States, courts, and organizations representing older Americans and  those with disabilities around the country, and received more than 100  comments pointing to gaps in the system and, most important, offering  solutions. The Committee found a pattern of barriers to proper  oversight and a need for greater use of alternatives to guardianship.  We identified persistent and widespread challenges that require a  nationwide focus in order to ensure the guardianship system works on  behalf of the individuals it is intended to protect. The Committee's  report outlines policy recommendations at local, state, and federal  levels that would improve outcomes for Americans subject to  guardianship.   The Guardianship Accountability Act addresses many of our report's  recommendations. The bill would direct the Elder Justice Coordinating  Council to establish a National Online Resource Center on Guardianship  to collect and publish information relevant to guardianship for use by  guardians, individuals subject to guardianship, courts, states, local  governments, and community organizations. The resource center would  also publish model legislation and best practices developed pursuant to  the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, compile and publish  training materials for guardians, share research related to  guardianship, and maintain a database on State laws regarding  guardianship and the use of less restrictive alternatives. In addition,  the bill would also expand the availability of Federal demonstration  grants, established by the Elder Justice Act, to include use for the  development of State guardianship databases, training for court  visitors, and sharing of information on guardian background checks.   Combating financial abuse and exploitation of seniors requires law  enforcement and social service agencies at all levels of government to  work collaboratively together, which the Guardianship Accountability  Act promotes. I'm proud to have worked on this bill with Senator Casey,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 3671. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency to revise certain ethylene oxide emissions standards  under the Clean Air Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Environment and Public Works.
