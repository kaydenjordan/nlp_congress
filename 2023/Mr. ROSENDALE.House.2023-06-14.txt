 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, record-breaking floods  devastated much of southern Montana, shattering communities in and  around Yellowstone National Park.   The destruction caused by these rushing waters was immense, washing  away homes, businesses, and property that Montanans had spent  generations building. But it did not wash away their hope.   I had the chance to survey the aftermath and speak with residents who  had been impacted by this tragic natural disaster. Many understood that  it would take months, maybe even years to recover.   What surprised me about my conversations with those who lost so much  to these historic floods was not their desperation, but their courage.   The people of Montana have always been stronger than the challenges  that they face. Local leaders in Park, Stillwater, and Carbon Counties  did not let the disaster destroy their communities. Instead, they came  together to support their friends and neighbors when they needed it the  most.   Local leaders like Sherry Weamer were instrumental in directing the  rebuilding of Red Lodge when floodwaters overwhelmed the area. These  efforts were also led by dedicated public servants, like Yellowstone  National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly.   Communities in southern Montana rely on tourist traffic from  Yellowstone to survive. When floodwaters closed two entrances to the  park, Superintendent Sholly sprang into action and accelerated the  opening of the Old Gardiner Road, restoring access to Yellowstone just  4 months after the floods.   I spoke with countless Montanans whose lives were turned upside down  by the Yellowstone floods, and I have made it my mission to ensure  leaders in Washington support them.   Although our work to restore our gateway communities is far from  over, I am proud of the work that we have done so far.   I thank Sherry Weamer, Superintendent Sholly, and the countless  Montanans who stepped up to help their communities during this  difficult time. Their work is an example of Montana, and it is a  privilege to represent them in the United States House of  Representatives.                            ____________________
