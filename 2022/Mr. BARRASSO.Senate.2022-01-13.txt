 Mr. President, first, I would like to ask unanimous  consent that I be able to speak for up to 5 minutes, followed by  Senator Sullivan, who is on the floor, for up to 15 minutes and then  Senator Sasse for up to 7 minutes before the scheduled recess.    Mr. President, I would hope that everyone in this body  has listened to Senator Sinema's important speech on the filibuster  just now. I really appreciated her clear-eyed rationale--her rationale  to preserve the minority voices in this body and to find common ground  in this Chamber. I thank her.   Mr. President, I also come to the floor today to support the  sanctions on Vladimir Putin's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. Now, I urge all  of my colleagues to vote in support of S. 3436, the Protecting Europe's  Energy Security Implementation Act.   You know, last week, the President of Ukraine and the Prime Minister  of Ukraine endorsed this legislation. The Prime Minister said the  following:         Nord Stream 2 is no less an existential threat to our       security and democracy than Russian troops on our border.       Senators shouldn't vote to protect Russia and Nord Stream 2.       This is a security matter not only for Ukraine, but for the       entire region.    I believe the Prime Minister of Ukraine is exactly right.   The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is being built by Gazprom. For people  who aren't familiar with that, Gazprom is the Russian state-owned  natural gas company. Now, the pipeline would double the amount of  Russian gas going to Germany via the Baltic Sea.   This pipeline is an existential threat to our ally Ukraine. It is a  threat to our allies in Europe as well.   Right now, Vladimir Putin has mobilized 100,000 troops on the border  of Ukraine. He can afford to do this because he is flush with cash.  Rising energy prices and reduced American production mean Vladimir  Putin has hit the energy economic jackpot. The world is now more  dependent on Russian oil and energy. If gas starts to flow through this  pipeline, Vladimir Putin will get even richer, more powerful, and the  world will become even more dependent on him, the dictator.  [[Page S210]]    Vladimir Putin uses energy as a geopolitical weapon. He uses energy  to coerce our allies and our partners in Europe.   Stopping this pipeline should be an area of bipartisan agreement. In  fact, it was an area of bipartisan agreement in this very body until  Joe Biden became President. Many Democrats in the body voted for  sanctions the first time around. Even Joe Biden opposed the pipeline  before he became President.   Congress has overwhelmingly passed several pieces of bipartisan  legislation imposing sanctions on this Russian pipeline. Yet the Biden  administration refuses to implement these laws.   The Biden administration has now been actively lobbying this body and  actively lobbying Congress against this bill. Democrats must think it  would give Putin what he wants. I don't get it. They think that if you  give Putin what he wants, then he is going to play nice. That is not  going to happen. Every American President must negotiate from a  standpoint and a position of American strength. Vladimir Putin is  cunning, opportunistic, and aggressive. He respects strength, not  statements. When he sees an opportunity, he takes it. He can smell the  weakness.   The pipeline will mean an enormous transfer of wealth--wealth from  our allies to our enemy. It will make our allies weaker, and it will  make Putin stronger. If Putin gets stronger, we know he will get even  more aggressive.   It is time now for this body to stand up--stand up against Russia. It  is time to sanction this pipeline.   I yield the floor.
