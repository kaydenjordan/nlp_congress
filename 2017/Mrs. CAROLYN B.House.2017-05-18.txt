 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this is a picture  of the committee our Republican colleagues in the Senate have put  together and tasked with crafting a healthcare bill that will affect  the healthcare of tens of millions of American women.   And just a quick glance at his poster tells you that there is not one  person on this committee who will ever bear a child or need maternity  care. There is no one on this committee that will ever need a  mammogram. No one on this committee will ever have to worry about  having their access to affordable contraceptives or prenatal care taken  away from them.   Yet, the House bill that was delivered to the Senate callously would  make healthcare services and insurance coverage either unaffordable or  unavailable to millions of struggling hardworking women.   So, once again, we find that our Republican colleagues are making  life-altering decisions without a single woman at the table, ignoring  the very real, very cruel effects of the House-passed bill on American  women and families.   So, once again, Mr. Speaker, we ask: Where are the women?                            ____________________
