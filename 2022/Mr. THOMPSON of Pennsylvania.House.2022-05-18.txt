 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the  storied career of Mr. Jeff Shipp as he celebrates his retirement from  the Farm Credit Council.   Jeff has worked in and around the Farm Credit System for virtually  his entire adult life. Raised as a true D.C. native, Jeff earned his  bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland before obtaining his  master's at Tulane University.   Jeff's notable career working on Farm Credit issues started as an  internship on Capitol Hill before he moved to USDA and what was then  known as the Farmers Home Administration.   He then went to work representing farmers at the National Wheat  Growers Association, which led him to the Farm Credit team in 1987.   Perhaps one of the most distinguished moments of his career was when  he worked to help pass the Farm Credit Act of 1987, which stabilized  Farm Credit and set it on the sustainable path the organization  continues to enjoy today.   Jeff's representation in Washington is second to none. Jeff has been  the face of Farm Credit for many on Capitol Hill, and he will certainly  be missed as he enters retirement.   Farm Credit, American agriculture, and our country are better off  because of Jeff's exceptional work.   Congratulations, Jeff, on your very successful career, and best  wishes to you and Susan for a long and happy next chapter.                            ____________________
