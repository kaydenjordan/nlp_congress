 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  a dear friend of mine and so many others, William Harold Prestage, a  true gentleman whom we all loved and knew as Bill.   Bill is survived by his wife, Marsha; his three sons, Scott, John,  and Ron; and multiple grandchildren, who were his greatest joy and with  whom he had his most cherished days.   I first met Bill Prestage when I was a staffer for U.S. Senator Jesse  Helms. After that first encounter, I would see and talk with him many  times over the years at more community, agriculture, and political  events than one could ever imagine. He was always a delight. He would  cut to the chase in a very charming and direct way, and there was never  any question of what he liked or what he didn't like. You always knew  right where he stood on a matter. He was a lion of a man with a heart  of gold.   He was well known as a devout family man and an exceptional member of  his community, one who would give you the shirt off his back if you  needed it. Starting from very humble beginnings in the 1960s and with  no agriculture experience, Bill pioneered what is now one of the  country's largest family-owned and family-operated animal protein  production companies.   The foundation of this family enterprise was laid when Bill joined  his good friend Otis Carroll, whom he met upon moving to North  Carolina. These two great entrepreneurs joined together and helped  transform pork and turkey production, bringing significant economic  development to southeastern North Carolina.   In 1983, Bill, along with his wife, Marsha, and his sons, established  what is known today as Prestage Farms. Today, with each generation of  the family involved in the business, the Prestage Farms and Prestage  Foods companies have five divisions across seven States, with three  processing plants collectively employing more than 2,300 people and  contracting with more than 450 farm families.   The company's multigenerational success is a true testament to Bill's  entrepreneurial spirit and work ethic, as well as his devotion to his  family and his employees. He was truly beloved by his family and  friends, the agriculture community, and the hardworking employees and  growers who make up the Prestage family of companies.   His people were his passion, and they loved their leader  tremendously. Those outside of the family business loved Bill, too.  Though he was far too humble to think it, Bill was, in fact, a very  well-known and very well-liked celebrity wherever he went, not just in  Sampson County but throughout the State and country, particularly in  agriculture, wildlife, and conservation circles.   Beyond Bill's impact on the agriculture community, he is well known  for his love of nature and the outdoors. As a result, he was an avid  conservationist. Upland bird hunting, boating, and fishing were among  his greatest joys, especially when his family would join him.   There is no doubt that Bill not only made a name for himself as a  pioneer in agriculture, but he also made our State and country a better  place to live. He leaves behind a great legacy that will have an  everlasting impact, as well as many great memories. Everyone who knew  Bill loved Bill, and that, in and of itself, is arguably one of the  greatest legacies one can have.   I know I speak for countless others when I say Bill is deeply missed.  His was a life of a great American and patriot, well lived, and an  example of the best of humanity.          Congratulating Nicola ``Niki'' Dennis Upon Her Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  career of Niki Dennis, who recently retired as Bladen County Clerk of  Superior Court following 43 years of distinguished public service.   Niki is a proud lifelong resident of Bladen County, and in 1979, she  started her career at the Bladen County Courthouse, working as a deputy  clerk.   Thanks to Niki's hard work, determination, professionalism, and  kindness, she advanced quickly through the ranks and became an integral  team member in the clerk's office. In 2006, Niki was elected high clerk  and served in this capacity until her retirement recently.   Over the years, Niki has been a mentor and friend to so many. She  managed multiple clerks while navigating the everyday challenges of the  clerk's office with respect, grace, and professionalism, setting an  example for public service that all should strive to emulate.   On behalf of the citizens of Bladen County and the entire Seventh  Congressional District, I thank Niki for her many years of service to  Bladen County. I wish her great health and joy as she embarks on this  next chapter of life. May God continue to bless her path.                            ____________________
