 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Maloney for yielding  me time.   My first amendment, No. 9, will strengthen the ability of Congress to  do our job of oversight of the executive branch. It closes a loophole  in the Freedom of Information Act that effectively lets Federal  agencies ignore congressional requests for information.   Amendment No. 10 will require all congressionally mandated reports to  be transmitted to Congress in a machine-readable format. It is a  commonsense way to search and find information within thousands of  pages of reports.   These two amendments are about the government, and they are about  transparency. Our government should not have anything to hide. Both of  these are supported by the Project On Government Oversight.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on en bloc No. 1 and to support  amendments No. 9 and No. 10.
