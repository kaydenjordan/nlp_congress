 Mr. Speaker, since 2022, the Juniata  College Eagles women's volleyball team has played 70 matches. During  that time, they have lost only twice.   Today, I rise to congratulate the Juniata Eagles on winning their  second consecutive NCAA Division III national championship.   Playing with technical skill, agility, and power, these young women  have built a program that has stood the test of time, becoming a  dominant force and drawing more attention to the sport of volleyball in  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Last week, the Eagles showed that their hard work over the past 2  years was well worth it--defeating Hope International three sets to  zero in the championship match.   Standing behind these incredible athletes is their dedicated coaching  staff and mentors who have dedicated their expertise, guidance, and  support to nurture these exceptional student athletes.   Coach Heather Pavlik and Assistant Coach Casey Dale have committed  themselves to shaping not just skilled players but also well-rounded  student athletes.   On behalf of all the people in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District, I congratulate the Juniata College Eagles under the  leadership of President Jim Troha and wish them every continued success  in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank Dr. Foxx for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act.  As a doctor, I know the benefits of whole milk, and I know that whole  milk can have benefits for Americans of all ages.   Whole milk is 96\1/2\ percent fat-free. According to a study that was  conducted that lasted for more than 15 years and was published in The  Lancet journal of medicine, individuals who consume more than two dairy  products each day have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. There is  lower morbidity associated with those who have whole milk and whole  milk products in their diet.   The 13 essential nutrients that are found in milk are vital to the  development of bones, muscles, and even brain tissue in our Nation's  children.   By banning healthy milk products from our schools, misguided policies  that were crafted and implemented by the Obama administration, that has  led students to turn away from milk and dairy products and turn to  highly caffeinated and sugary drinks. Those drinks have very little  nutritional value.   Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District is home to the most number  of dairy cows in our Commonwealth. Recently, I had the chance to visit  Galliker's Dairy Company in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.   For the past four generations, Galliker's has processed milk from 46  regional family dairy farms for retailers, grocery stores and schools  across the Northeast.   The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act will ensure that the whole and 2  percent milk processed at facilities like Galliker's will make its way  into school lunchrooms across the country.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for nutrition by  supporting this legislation.
