 Mr. Speaker, this week, we saw new data  that revealed who is truly being harmed by President Biden's economic  crisis. The short answer is that those who can least afford it are  being left behind.   Last month, the U.S. economy added only 200,000 new jobs. This isn't  enough. It is not enough to sustain any sort of recovery from the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Because of this poor response and because of this poor showing, many  industries lost workers, including manufacturers and retail stores. In  November, labor force participation actually declined among those with  less than a high school diploma or some college education.   Simply stated, the Biden administration's failures are leaving  Americans behind at a time when the price of essential goods are  skyrocketing. Instead of addressing the crises that liberal policies  have created, Democrats are doubling down on the failed legislative  ideas that threaten to raise the cost of gasoline and raise the cost of  groceries. The costs of beef, vegetables, chicken, and pork are on the  rise, and real wages have actually decreased during 7 out of the 9  months that Joe Biden has been in office.   This isn't effective governing, and this is not the way to get  America back on track.                            ____________________
