 Madam Speaker, passage of the Affordable Care Act nearly  a decade ago, while not a perfect bill, helped thousands of Utah  families gain insurance coverage, many for the first time, and I am  working in Congress to ensure we meet the law's goals to improve access  to care and protect all Americans' coverage, particularly those with  preexisting conditions.   Utah's hardworking families struggle with the rising costs of care,  fueled to a large degree by skyrocketing prescription drug prices.   Everywhere I go, people talk about how the cost of an illness or an  accident sparks the fear of being one health crisis away from financial  ruin.   That is why I have voted for a dozen bills to seek to lower the cost  of prescription drugs and strengthen consumer protections, and I urge  my Senate colleagues to act, too.   I continue to meet with Utahns about their healthcare concerns, and I  recently had a conversation with moms of kids with type 1 diabetes, who  explained to me how the high cost of insulin is affecting their child's  treatment.   We have a bipartisan consensus that our healthcare system needs work,  so it is past time that we act on bipartisan solutions that lower  Americans' costs and ensure their access to quality, affordable  healthcare.                            ____________________
