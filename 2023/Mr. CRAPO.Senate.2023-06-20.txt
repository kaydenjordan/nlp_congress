 Mr. President, with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch  and Representative  Mike Simpson, we honor an outstanding Idahoan and  great American, Robert S. Jackson, Jr., for his service to our country,  fellow veterans, and community.   Robert ``Bob'' Jackson is an Idaho native who spent many years in the  U.S. Navy, serving throughout the world on various aircraft carriers  that traveled to Vietnam, Libya, Lebanon, and locations for Desert  Shield/Storm. His numerous awards throughout his career include Sailor  of the Year three times, Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Achievement  Medal, Silver Wreath with six stars, and Meritorious Unit Commendation.   Following his retirement in 1992, he found ways to assist local  veterans, particularly with his administrative and organizational  skills. He is well-respected in the State veterans community and has  helped a number of projects advance smoothly with his input and  expertise. His list of efforts is long and includes leadership  positions with the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, State Convention  posts, and MC responsibilities. He is also a proud father of four  daughters and one  [[Page S2144]]  son and husband to Jennifer, who also volunteers with the VFW Ladies  Auxiliary. In 2009, Bob's military service, commitment, and sacrifice  were honored with the 2009 Spirit of Freedom Award.   Bob, like so many of his fellow veterans, did not stop serving others  long after his military service ended. He has demonstrated again and  again his devotion to our country and others through his admirable  actions. Despite overwhelming health challenges, he continues to show  us all how to face difficulty with courage and honor. It seems deeply  fitting that folks are gathering just after the Fourth of July to honor  this remarkable American, as he served nobly for so many years to  protect the freedoms we celebrate on Independence Day. Bob, our hearts  are with you as we thank you for your admirable service to our country  and our great State.                            ____________________
