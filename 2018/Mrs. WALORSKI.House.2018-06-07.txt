 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate local RV  manufacturer, Jayco, and to join them in celebrating 50 years of  success.   In 1968, Lloyd and Bertha Bontrager developed their first RV  prototype on their family farm in northern Indiana and launched a  family business that would last for generations. Half a century later,  Jayco has grown to include  [[Page H4860]]  over 500 acres of manufacturing plants, more than 300 dealers around  the world, and countless good jobs for hardworking Hoosiers in our  community.   Northern Indiana leads the RV industry in the United States and, as a  community, we are grateful to have this company to inspire future  generations of manufacturers and to carry on that legacy.   It is an honor to represent Jayco, the Bontrager family, and the  hardworking employees who have played such a vital role in northern  Indiana's growing economy for decades.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Second District Hoosiers, I want to thank  everyone at Jayco for an incredible 50 years, and I look forward to  more amazing things to come.                            ____________________
