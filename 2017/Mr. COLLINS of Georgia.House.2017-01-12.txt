 It is good to have the General here.   It is going to be an interesting time. I know you are the last  speaker here, but not the last of all of the freshmen. We are going to  be doing this more in the coming weeks. But I just know as I watch  tonight, it is the passion of your class coming in.   I have watched you all as you have come and gone through orientation  and done all of the things together and that there is a bond. I notice  you come and sit together and you all talk together, and there is an  understanding that you all come here for a purpose bigger than  yourselves--and that is exciting to see. So I am excited to have you  here. It is going to be a good year.   Mr. Speaker, as we have introduced and talked about these new Members  and they have allowed themselves to introduce themselves, one of the  things that I wanted to do is just make sure, as we look ahead, we see  folks who have made a place--they made a place in their communities;  they made a place in their homes. As they look forward to serving here  in this Congress, we are looking forward to having them here.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a few moments to discuss something  else, and that is, as we move forward and as we continue here, the  majority, with these new freshmen and all coming in, are going to be  fighting for what matters. It is sort of amazing to me now that, as we  enter tomorrow and we take the first step toward repealing, really,  what is a disastrous law, it is amazing now the cries of: Oh, what is  going to be done? What are you doing now? But it didn't seem to matter  just a few years ago when they said: Here is what you are going to  have. You are going to take it no matter what it does. You want your  doctor? Keep him.   That is a lie.   You want to keep your health provider? Keep him. Your insurance is  fine.   That is a lie. It is amazing now how some on the other side are just  wanting to start yelling and saying: Oh, you have got to have a plan.   Have a plan?   Let's remind the American people why we are here. The majority is  here because of 6 years of poor decisionmaking. It started at the base  and has gone up. And we are going to continue as this majority to put  people first, those who get up every morning, who want a job, who want  to be able to go to their job and to start businesses and start and use  that intellectual capital so that they can continue to do those things  without government interference.   I heard just the other day as I was here working on a rule, Mr.  Speaker, I heard one of the speakers actually say that we should not  put these burdens on government employees because it would make their  jobs so much harder.   Please, tell me where the voice is for the American worker out in the  field every day just trying to make ends meet. It is in this majority.  And we will continue to put forth policy that takes away the government  overreach and puts it back where it belongs, and that is in the  entrepreneurs, the moms, the dads, the kids, those who have a dream  right now in a freshman English class or a science class, that have a  dream that one day they will own their own business or go further.   Mr. Speaker, let's put this in perspective. This majority is putting  people first, and over the past 6 years, the American people have  responded. It is now our time to act. People say, if you don't have a  plan, then you are not understanding. This is friends and neighbors  that elected us, and we will not fail in this moment.   We have said what we are going to do. We are going to put people  first in their businesses, in their jobs, and in their health care.  When we do that, that is what makes America great.   So tonight is the first night for letting our freshmen come, share  their heart. We have heard their passion. We are going to continue to  hear their passion as new and more freshmen come.   Mr. Speaker, you are part of that. There are many others that will be  a part. I am looking forward to leading in our majority, putting people  first, putting Americans first, and this country is going to be the  better for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.                            ____________________
