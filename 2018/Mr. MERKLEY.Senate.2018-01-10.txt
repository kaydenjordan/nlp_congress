 Mr. President, here we are at the start of a new year.  Last year, the Republican majority decided to dedicate the year to  government by and for the powerful and the privileged, but how about  this year, 2018? We pay attention to our Constitution, which starts  with that vision of government, not for the powerful, not for the rich,  not for the privileged, not for the well connected, not for the wealthy  but for the people of the United States. It is a vision where power is  distributed, and power comes up from each individual citizen to create  policies for their general welfare.   Last year, we saw this complete dedication to trying to wipe out  healthcare for 20 million to 30 million Americans in order to provide  tax benefits for the richest. How big were those tax benefits? Well, if  you add up the provisions that are dedicated to the powerful  corporations and those benefits for the wealthiest 10 percent, and most  of that goes to the wealthiest 1 percent, those provisions stack up to  over $2 trillion--$2 trillion.   It is very hard to get your hands around $2 trillion. Those are not  numbers we use in ordinary conversation. Let's take that down to the  amount of money per man, woman, and child--per citizen in America.  Well, that is about $6,000--$6,000 taken from the community funds for  every man, woman, and child in America to deliver to the wealthiest  Americans. That was government by the Republican majority in 2017. It  was not ``We the People'' but we the powerful and we the privileged.   How about we have a new year's resolution that pays attention to the  vision of our Constitution, to that vision of government of, by, and  for the people?   Ben Franklin once wrote in his ``Poor Richard's Almanac'':         Be at war with your vices,        At peace with your neighbors,        And let every New Year find you a better man.    Every new year is a chance to recreate and reenvision where we are  headed. Certainly, it is a big vice to use this Chamber, in  contravention of our Constitution, to pursue policies for the powerful  and privileged rather than for the people. So let's set that vice aside  and have a bipartisan year, dedicated to making a foundation for  families to thrive and jobs and education and healthcare and a  healthier planet.   Right now, we should have an immediate new year's checklist of things  to get done, and that checklist starts with the budget. We have just 9  days until funding runs out for the Federal Government, and we all know  from experience what that means--parks shut down, medical research  stops, passports don't get processed, and businesses can't check in on  their I-9 applications for employees. That is the type of conduct that  happens in banana republics--basically, in countries that don't have a  competent system of government. It should not happen in the United  States of America.   We are deep into the financial year, which started on October 1.  October passed. November passed. December passed. We are well into  January and still the majority leadership of this body is unable to put  together a process that addresses just key, fundamental issues. Why is  that? Because they were so distracted by delivering trillions of  dollars to the richest of Americans and trying to destroy healthcare  for millions of Americans that they didn't tend to the fundamentals  that need to be tended to. Let's take care of those things now.   The Children's Health Insurance Program. Here we are. It expired on  September 30 of last year. Nine million children across America depend  on this insurance. This insurance was crafted in a bipartisan manner.  It was forged in an agreement between Senator Hatch, a Republican, and  Senator Kennedy, a Democrat, who had very different visions of America  but who could agree that families who didn't qualify for Medicaid and  weren't affluent enough to buy insurance for their children could still  have insurance for their children. These are the working poor of  America, the struggling workers of America.   It was forged in a bipartisan manner, but this year my Republican  colleagues decided to make these children a bargaining chip for their  effort to get more for the privileged and the powerful. That has to  end.   When children do not have insurance, they don't get that dental  benefit to take care of those cavities. They don't get that medical  exam. They don't get those inoculations, those vaccinations. They don't  get treatment when they are injured because their parents can't afford  to take them to the doctor. They don't get treatment when they are sick  for the same reason. Let's take care of children's healthcare.   This is not a partisan issue. It was forged in a bipartisan manner,  and it should be so today.   What also expired on September 30 of last year was the legislation  authorizing support for our community health clinics. Community health  clinics are the front door to healthcare for millions of Americans. It  is that friendly place in your rural community, in your urban  neighborhood, where you can go through the front door and get  assistance.   Talking about millions of Americans who go through those front doors,  there are more than 1,400 clinics across the country. These are popular  in rural areas. They are popular in urban areas. They are popular in  red States. They are popular in blue States. There is nothing partisan  about it, but the leadership of this body has no interest, has seen no  urgency in reauthorizing the ability for those health centers to stay  open.   In Oregon we saw, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, 30 more  health clinics established. We saw a lot more resources go into both  mental illness and into drug abuse during a period in which the opioid  crisis joined the meth crisis and afflicted both rural and urban areas.  Lots of folks come to this floor and say: We have to take on opioids.  It is not just on the left-hand side of the aisle, but it is also on  the right-hand side of the aisle. People base virtually their entire  campaigns on taking on opioids. Yet the Republican leadership says this  isn't important. Let me tell you, this is important, and we need to get  it done.   Then let's turn to the Dream Act. Dreamers are those children raised  in our communities, now 16 through their midtwenties. They are  productive members of our communities. They have gone through our high  schools or are in high school now. They are in college. They are  working. They are contributing. They know no other country than ours.   Across both sides of the aisle we hear folks say: We want to take  care of them and establish a structure for this, a legal structure for  the Dreamers.   The President yesterday hosted a bipartisan conversation at the White  House to say: Let's get this done. He expressed his support. In fact,  everyone in the room expressed support for getting this done.   Each one of these--the budget, the children's healthcare, the health  centers, the Dream Act--are bipartisan efforts. These are things that  should have been addressed long ago if my Republican colleagues instead  weren't so  [[Page S116]]  obsessed with decimating healthcare for millions of Americans and  ripping off the National Treasury to deliver benefits to the wealthiest  Americans.   Let's get this done for our Dreamers. More than 100 a day are losing  their status, which means they can no longer legally work in our  country. It matters. It is urgent. It is productive for our  communities. It is bipartisan. Let's get it done.   How about disaster relief? We certainly saw a powerful punch against  our States from the raging forest fires in the West to the hurricanes  in the South and Southeast. Hurricanes have hit Texas and Florida and  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands--massive destruction. Fires have  scourged States from Montana to Idaho, to Washington, to Oregon, to  California. Those fires burned well into the winter months of November  and December.   These afflictions hit Democrats and Republicans, red States and blue  States. Why don't we get this done? These are basic, bipartisan, let's- get-it-done agendas. Let's get it done now.   Let's make sure, when we are addressing the impact of those storms in  the South and those hurricanes--Harvey, Irma, and Maria--we  simultaneously recognize the destructive impact forest fires have had  that have been scourging the West. They have destroyed a lot of the  infrastructure in the forest that needs to be replaced. They have  affected a lot of communities that need economic help recovering.   Certainly, it made us recognize that we have millions of acres of  forests that can become much more fire resilient if they are thinned,  if we get rid of the fuel buildup on the floor of the forests. When  they become more resilient, they stop the forest fires.   Thinning is a win-win. It produces a steady supply of sawlogs for the  mill and stops forest fires when they are raging. There was a forest  fire headed right for Sisters, OR, and it hit an area that had been  thinned. Guess what. It stopped. The trees were farther apart. The  fuels were removed from the floor of the forest.   Now we have created a real fire hazard with our clear-cut strategy of  years past--the forestry grows very close together, often replanted.  Trees are all the same height. It is very easy for the fire to get into  the canopy, and once in the canopy, every tree is touching the next  tree. It rages on, and there is no break.   But a natural forest is very different. We can more effectively  replicate the fire-resistant nature of a natural forest by thinning  these overgrown, second-growth forests. We can then create that supply  of saw logs, keep our mills open, keep our people working, and  strengthen our economies in rural America. We can do it by funding this  reduction, these thinning programs in acreage that has already gone  through the environmental process. In Oregon, we have 1.6 million acres  already approved for thinning, if we can pass the funds to get it done.   So let's take this on in 2018. Let's dedicate 2018 to that vision in  our Constitution of ``we the people.'' Let's stop passing legislation  targeted specifically to help out the richest at the expense of  everyone else in America. Let's turn over a new leaf from campaigns and  policies and legislation by and for the privileged and the powerful to  honor the vision of our Constitution, the vision of our Nation, a  Nation of laws which distributes power that produces policies by and  for the people of the United States of America, for making families  stronger, for building those foundations of jobs and healthcare and  education and a healthy planet.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
