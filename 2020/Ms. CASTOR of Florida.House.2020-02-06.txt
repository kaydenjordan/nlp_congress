 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for  yielding the time.   Affordable healthcare is fundamental to the well-being of American  families, but the Trump administration doesn't believe that. Now, they  are proposing again to shrink, block, or eliminate health services  under Medicaid.   For over 50 years, Medicaid has provided a coverage guarantee. It is  guaranteed that if you fall on hard times or if you have a disability  or you are a senior in skilled nursing, care will be there if you need  it. But this proposal out of the administration will severely chip away  at that coverage guarantee.   It is particularly harmful to my home State of Florida, and it will  complicate our ability to expand Medicaid health services to families  who need it.   Don't just take it from me. Patient advocates, doctors, and hospitals  overwhelmingly oppose block grant waivers because they will weaken  access to care. Groups like AARP, the American Cancer Society Action  Network, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Federation of American  Hospitals, the Children's Hospital Association, and many others have  spoken out against block grants and waivers.   Unfortunately, this is part of the administration's broader  antihealthcare agenda. They have tried to weaken affordable care  through budgets; we have rejected it. Through legislation, we have  defeated it. Now, they are in the courts to take away that coverage for  preexisting conditions.   The Trump antihealthcare agenda is cruel. It is wrong. And I urge my  colleagues to reject it today by passing this resolution.
