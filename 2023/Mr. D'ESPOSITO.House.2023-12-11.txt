Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3224.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 3224,  the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Extension Act of 2023.   Authorized in 2018, the mission of the Department of Homeland  Security's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office is to enable  its operational partners at the Federal, State, and local levels to  prevent the use of WMDs against the United States of America and to  promote readiness for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear  threats.   At the Federal level, CWMD works with the United States Customs and  Border Protection to acquire radiation portal monitors that scan cargo  at U.S. ports of entry, as well as works with the U.S. Coast Guard to  procure personal radiation detectors.   At the local level, the CWMD Office achieves its mission of  supporting State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners through  funding, equipment, and expertise.   In my home State of New York and in many other States across this  great country, the CWMD Office operates the Securing the Cities  program, which helps build regional capabilities to detect, analyze,  and report nuclear and other radioactive materials.   My bill, the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Extension Act of  2023, will extend the sunset clause to ensure that the vital work of  the CWMD Office continues.   Additionally, my legislation takes meaningful steps to address some  longstanding challenges the office has faced, such as dwindling  employee morale, and requires the Assistant Secretary for the CWMD  Office to submit a report to Congress on how the office will  continuously improve morale and employee engagement within the office.   Further, my bill requires the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a review of the CWMD Office's coordination with stakeholders  and efforts to provide the programs and activities that carry out the  office's mission, among other items.   From aviation and border security to emergency response and  cybersecurity, the Department of Homeland Security has one common  mission, Mr. Speaker, and that is to keep America safe.   The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office facilitates its  mission by ensuring that operational partners have the tools and  support needed to safeguard the United States of America against  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.   Although we hope that we never ever see the day when one of our  adversaries deploys a weapon of mass destruction against this great  Nation, we cannot neglect the ever-present threat of terrorism that  continues to exist today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  commonsense bill, H.R. 3224, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I think that it is very clear that this bill, H.R. 3224,  is not a partisan issue. It is one that the American people will  benefit from in order to keep this great homeland safe.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3224, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
