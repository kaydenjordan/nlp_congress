 Madam Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman from Michigan for  having this Special Order on such an important issue.   When you look at inequality in America, you have to start with  housing, because inequality often is started by how much a person pays  to house their family, to house their kids, to house their family  members.   In order to solve for inequality, we have to solve the housing  crisis. And in order to solve the housing crisis, we have to  acknowledge and rectify America's shameful history of discriminatory  housing practices.   Policies and practices like redlining, segregation, blockbusting, and  steering that denied low-income people and communities of color access  to homeownership and created the housing disparities that are still  prevalent today.                                time  1545    In America, homeownership is how we build wealth, and it determines  your family's likelihood of success.   In America, whether you rent or you own, where you live determines  where your kids go to school.   In America, it often determines how far you commute to work.   In America, it often determines how far you are from a grocery store  and healthy options for food for your family. It also determines what  public services are available to you.   But, unfortunately, many low-income individuals and people of color  have been denied this opportunity.   We still have an opportunity to make amends and rectify the  inequalities that have persisted in low-income neighborhoods and  communities of color.   The Tax Code is one of the most powerful tools we have. That is why I  reintroduced the Rent Relief Act.   This bill aims to reduce the rent burden by creating a new refundable  tax credit for families that are paying more than 30 percent of their  income in rent and utilities because no family should be forced to  choose between paying rent and meeting their basic needs. This would  put more money in the pockets of families at a time when wages have  remained stagnant and housing costs have increased.   This bill has the potential to transform lives, provide millions of  the lowest income people with a breadth of opportunities, and provide  opportunities to climb the economic ladder by redistributing the  benefits of homeownership to the lowest income earners.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece  of legislation.
