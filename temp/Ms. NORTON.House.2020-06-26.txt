 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1017, I call up  the bill (H.R. 51) to provide for the admission of the State of  Washington, D.C. into the Union, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 51.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is the only democratic country that  denies both voting rights in its national legislature and local  autonomy to the residents of its nation's capital.   As we approach July Fourth, it is long past time to apply the  Nation's oldest slogan, ``no taxation without representation,'' and the  principle of consent of the governed to District of Columbia residents.  H.R. 51 would do so, and Congress has both the moral obligation and the  constitutional authority to pass the bill.   H.R. 51 would admit the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth  into the Union and reduce the size of the Federal District. The State  would consist of 66 of the 68 square miles of the present-day Federal  District.   The reduced Federal District, over which Congress would retain  plenary authority, would consist of 2 square miles. The reduced Federal  District would consist of the Washington that Members of Congress and  visitors associate with the Nation's Capital, including the White  House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court, and the principal Federal  monuments.   H.R. 51 has both the facts and the Constitution on its side. The  Constitution does not establish any prerequisites for new States, but  Congress generally has considered three factors in admission decisions:  resources and population, support for statehood, and commitment to  democracy.   The District pays more Federal taxes per capita than any State and  pays more Federal taxes than 22 States of the Union. The District's  population of 705,000 is larger than those of Wyoming and Vermont, and  the new State would be one of the seven States with a population under  1 million.   D.C.'s $15.5 billion budget is larger than those of 12 States, and  the District's AAA bond rating is higher than those of 35 States. D.C.  has a higher per capita personal income and gross domestic product than  any State.   Eighty-six percent of D.C. residents voted in favor of statehood in  2016. In fact, D.C. residents have been fighting for voting rights in  Congress and local autonomy for 219 years.   The Constitution's Admissions Clause gives Congress the authority to  admit new States, and all 37 new States have been admitted by an act of  Congress. The Constitution's District Clause, which gives Congress  plenary authority over the Federal District, sets a maximum size of the  Federal District of 100 square miles. It does not set a minimum size.  Congress previously has changed the size of the Federal District,  including by reducing it 30 percent in 1846.   Over the last few months, the Nation, and even the world, has  witnessed discriminatory and outrageous treatment of D.C. residents by  the Federal Government.   In March, Congress passed the CARES Act, which deprived the District  of $755 million in coronavirus fiscal relief by treating the District  as a territory rather than a State. The HEROES Act, passed by the House  in May, would restore those funds.   This month, Federal police and out-of-State National Guard troops  occupied D.C., without the consent of the D.C. Mayor, to respond to  largely peaceful protests. Prior to this occupation of the city, there  had been much more looting and property destruction in other cities,  but the Federal Government did not occupy those cities. The Federal  occupation occurred solely because the President thought that he could  get away with it. He was wrong.   For me, H.R. 51 is deeply personal. My great-grandfather, Richard  Holmes,  [[Page H2532]]  who escaped as a slave from Virginia on a plantation, made it as far as  D.C., a walk to freedom but not to equal citizenship. For three  generations, my family has been denied the rights other Americans take  for granted.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   Congress has two choices: It can continue to exercise undemocratic or  autocratic authority over the 705,000 American citizens who reside in  our Nation's capital, treating them, in the words of Frederick  Douglass, as ``aliens; not citizens, but subjects''; or Congress can  live up to this Nation's promise and ideals and pass H.R. 51.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority  Leader Steny Hoyer, Majority Whip   James Clyburn, Chairwoman Carolyn  Maloney, and the late Elijah Cummings, our millions of allies across  the country, and, most importantly, generations of D.C. residents and  officials who have refused to simply accept their treatment as second- class citizens for bringing us to this historic day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 51,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                       Committee on the Judciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 18, 2020.      Hon. Carolyn B. Maloney,      Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Reform, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Maloney: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 5803, the ``Washington, D.C.       Admission Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I       appreciate your consulting with us on those provisions. The       Judiciary Committee has no objection to your including them       in the bill for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.R. 5803, with the understanding that we do not thereby       waive any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions       or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       5803, the Washington D.C. Admission Act. As you know, the       bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform, with an additional referral to the       Committee on the Judiciary.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on the Judiciary to       be discharged from further consideration of the bill to       expedite floor consideration. This discharge in no way       affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on the Judiciary represented on the conference committee.        I would be pleased to include this letter and your       correspondence in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration to memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                Carolyn B. Maloney,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, June 19, 2020.      Hon. Carolyn B. Maloney,      Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Reform, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman Maloney: I write concerning H.R. 5803, the       ``Washington, D.C. Admission Act,'' which was additionally       referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce (Committee).       There are certain provisions in the legislation which concern       the Medicaid federal medical assistance percentage for a       newly admitted state and fall within the Rule X jurisdiction       of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 5803, the Committee agrees to waive formal consideration       of the bill as to such provisions. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I request that you       urge the Speaker to name Members of the Committee to any       conference committee which is named to consider such       provision. Such participation will be critical to allow the       Committee to continue to work on the policy involving the       Medicaid federal medical assistance percentage for a newly       admitted state.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter       into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       H.R. 5803.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       5803, the Washington D.C. Admission Act. As you know, the       bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform, with an additional referral to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce, due to provisions in the       legislation which concern the Medicaid federal medical       assistance percentage for a newly admitted state.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on Energy and       Commerce to be discharged from further consideration of the       bill to expedite floor consideration. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Energy and Commerce represented on the conference       committee.        I would be pleased to include this letter and your       correspondence in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration to memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                Carolyn B. Maloney,                                                        Chairwoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), chairwoman of the House Committee  on Oversight and Reform, and I thank her for the way she conducted  hearings on H.R. 51.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to note that the  gentleman's amendment to cede the District of Columbia back to Maryland  did not have the consent of Maryland.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), my good friend and neighbor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, the last thing we have to be concerned about  is whether or not the 23rd Amendment will be repealed, and the bill,  H.R. 51, contains an expedited procedure for that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my good neighbor and good friend, the majority leader of the  House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland State (Mr. Sarbanes), my good friend, that  ceded land in perpetuity out of which the District of Columbia was  formed.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman, paying Federal  taxes, that says everything about the desire of citizens of Washington,  D.C. to be equal, that we are quite willing to continue to pay Federal  income tax.   And I appreciate his amendment. We have rejected his amendment  because we want to be full citizens. That means paying our share.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands (Ms. Plaskett), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, important to note that Maryland permanently  ceded the land that now is part of the District of Columbia. You can't  get back what you permanently ceded.   And it is important to note that we have had several Members from  Maryland speak.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Mfume).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), my friend and the chair of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This bill allows our country to live up to its claim to be a  democracy. We stand out as the only democracy which denies democracy to  the residents of its own Capital City.   Our claim to world leadership is marred until, with this bill, the  residents of our Capital are equal in citizenship to the citizens of  every Member of the House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
