 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Build Back  Better Act.   This legislation builds on our efforts to make healthcare more  affordable and accessible for all Americans, including millions  unfairly caught in the Medicaid coverage gap.   It also makes prescription drugs more affordable by finally giving  Medicare the ability to negotiate lower drug prices with the  pharmaceutical companies. Seniors will also pay no more than $2,000 a  year in out-of-pocket costs for their drugs, and the legislation  penalizes Big Pharma companies that unfairly raise prices.   The Build Back Better Act also aggressively tackles the worsening  climate crisis. The new greenhouse gas reduction fund will accelerate  innovation in low- and zero-emission technologies. Rebates for  homeowners to electrify and make their houses more efficient will save  them money and reduce emissions. The new methane emissions reduction  program will drive down pollution from the oil and gas industry.   Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot wait any longer to combat the climate  crisis. Bold action is needed now.   The Build Back Better Act invests in the American people and our  future and deserves strong support today.
