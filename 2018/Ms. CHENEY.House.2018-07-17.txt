 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 995) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the Nation now faces a more complex and grave set  of threats than at any time since the end of World War II, and that the  lack of full, on-time funding related to defense activities puts  servicemen and servicewomen at risk, harms national security, and aids  the adversaries of the United States.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 995         Whereas the United States now faces a more complex set of       threats than at any time since the end of World War II;        Whereas the National Defense Strategy released on January       19, 2018, highlights these threats and acknowledges a return       to great power competition;        Whereas countries like Russia and China are heavily       investing in military modernization and developing       capabilities that the United States may not be able to defend       against while also expanding their influence across the       globe;        Whereas North Korea's nuclear program continues to be a       serious threat;        Whereas the National Defense Strategy states that ``Iran       continues to sow violence and remains the most significant       challenge to Middle East stability'';        Whereas the National Defense Strategy states that       ``terrorist groups with long reach continue to murder the       innocent and threaten peace more broadly'';        Whereas the United States continues to fight a war against       terrorism and has troops deployed in hostile regions       throughout the globe;        Whereas, on January 19, 2018, Secretary of Defense James       Mattis stated, ``As hard as the last 16 years have been on       our military, no enemy in the field has done more to harm the       readiness of the U.S. military than the combined impact of       the Budget Control Act's defense spending cuts, worsened by       us operating, 9 of the last 10 years, under continuing       resolutions, wasting copious amounts of precious taxpayer       dollars'';        Whereas fiscal year 2009 was the last fiscal year the       Department of Defense received on-time funding;        Whereas the House of Representatives has passed an annual       appropriation bill for the Department of Defense before the       start of the next fiscal year in each of those fiscal years;        Whereas article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives       Congress the responsibility to ``provide for the common       Defence and general Welfare of the United States'' and calls       on Congress to ``raise and support Armies'' and ``provide and       maintain a Navy''; and        Whereas Secretaries of Defense appointed by Presidents of       both parties have warned about the damage funding uncertainty       has on the readiness of our Armed Forces: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) failing to provide our military with full, stable, and       on-time funding allows our adversaries to close critical       military capability gaps, putting our servicemembers at       increased risk, and severely harms our military's ability to       prepare for, deter, and, if needed, defend against these       capabilities, putting United States national security at       greater risk;        (2) providing full, stable, and on-time funding for the       Department of Defense is critically necessary to preventing       these increased risks; and        (3) the House of Representatives is committed to ending the       funding uncertainty for the Department of Defense and       providing the resources United States servicemembers need to       defend the Nation, and that the Senate should join the House       of Representatives in these efforts.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my resolution, H. Res. 995, which  expresses this House's commitment to providing the full, on-time  funding our men and women in uniform need to defend our Nation.   This week and next, Mr. Speaker, we will be spending time on this  floor discussing the devastating impacts nine  [[Page H6286]]  consecutive continuing resolutions have had on our military's readiness  and on our ability to deter and defend against our adversaries. Despite  the fact that this House has consistently, and normally in a bipartisan  fashion, completed our work on time, we have repeatedly seen partisan  politics, particularly in the Senate, prevent the Congress from  delivering a funding bill to the President's desk on time. In fact,  since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, the House has  never failed to pass a Defense Appropriations bill on time.   Just a few weeks ago, we passed H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019, with an overwhelmingly  bipartisan 359-49 vote.   Today's resolution, Mr. Speaker, expresses the sense of this House  that failing to provide full, on-time, stable funding increases the  risk to our servicemembers and aids our adversaries. The resolution  expresses our commitment to ending the funding uncertainty our military  faces and urges the Senate to similarly complete its work so we can  provide the on-time funding our armed services require.   Mr. Speaker, we must stop forcing our men and women in uniform and  their families to pay the price for our dysfunction.   Today, Mr. Speaker, we will consider three resolutions.   H. Res. 995, which I have introduced, acknowledges the unprecedented  global threat environment we face and the negative impact these  continuing resolutions have had on our military's ability to confront  this environment and deter and, if necessary, defeat our enemies.   We will also consider H. Res. 994, offered by my colleague and fellow  member of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Gallagher from Wisconsin.  Mr. Gallagher is a marine with two deployments to Al Anbar province in  Iraq. His resolution details the negative impact of CRs and funding  instability on the readiness of the U.S Marine Corps.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we will consider H. Res. 998, offered by Mr.  Wittman of Virginia, chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces  Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. Wittman's  resolution lays out the damage that the CRs and unpredictable funding  have done to the United States Navy.   Next week, Mr. Speaker, we will consider resolutions addressing the  impact of unstable funding on the United States Air Force and the  United States Army.   We know, Mr. Speaker, that not every Member of this body is on one of  the defense-related committees, but we also know that every Member of  this body is committed to the security of our Nation. I take the  opportunity today, along with my colleagues, to lay out in detail the  threats we face and the impacts our actions in this House can have on  our military's ability to keep us safe.   Reflecting on the challenges facing our Armed Forces, Secretary  Mattis put it this way: ``As hard as the last 16 years have been on our  military, no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of  the U.S. military than the combined impact of the Budget Control Act's  defense spending cuts, worsened by us operating 9 out of the last 10  years under continuing resolutions.''   Secretary Mattis went on to explain the consequences of Congress'  failure to provide reliable, on-time, sufficient funding: ``Ships will  not receive the required maintenance to put to sea; the ships already  at sea will be extended outside of port; aircraft will remain on the  ground, their pilots not at the sharpest edge; and eventually  ammunition, training, and manpower will not be sufficient to deter  war.'' Not sufficient to defer war, Mr. Speaker.   No experience, Mr. Speaker, has had a greater impact on me during my  time as a Member of this body than having the Secretary of Defense  testify in front of us as members of the Armed Services Committee and  say that congressional abrogation of our constitutional duty to fund  our military is putting our servicemembers at greater risk.   While our military has suffered under this burden of continuing  resolutions and dangerous policies of our previous administration, our  adversaries have been making steady gains. Never before in recent  history have we seen the gap between our capabilities and those of our  adversaries widen at such a breathtaking pace--and not in our favor,  Mr. Speaker.   China is pursuing an aggressive strategy to overtake our military and  economic advantage globally. They are developing technologies that are  specifically targeted to diminish our ability to project our force.  They are developing weapons systems against which we may not be able to  defend.                                time  1415    They have utilized deficiencies in our current CFIUS process to  attempt to acquire critical U.S. technology. Chinese companies like  Huawei and ZTE have made significant efforts to embed themselves in the  United States, putting our telecommunications networks and,  potentially, our defense supply chain at risk.   Militarily, economically, in cyberspace, in space, on land, in air,  and at sea, the Chinese have made clear their objective is to achieve  global preeminence, which means they must attempt to displace us.   The Russians continue to modernize their nuclear arsenal, as they  violate their commitments to us under the INF Treaty. They, too, are  developing advanced and threatening weapons systems and attempting to  exercise their hegemonic ambitions across Europe. They have violated  the borders and sovereignty of their neighbors. In the words of the  National Defense Strategy, they are making efforts ``to shatter the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization and use emerging technologies to  discredit and subvert democratic processes in Georgia, Crimea, and  eastern Ukraine.'' They have attempted to subvert our own democratic  processes, as we saw in last week's indictment of 12 members of the  GRU, Russian military intelligence.   We have seen in Russia and China a return to great power competition,  and 8 years of Obama-era policies facilitated these developments. At  the same time, we continue to face significant threats from rogue  regimes like Iran and North Korea.   The Iranians benefited tremendously from the payments they received  from the Obama administration, over $1.5 billion, when they entered  into the Obama nuclear deal. This deal paved the way for a nuclear- armed Iran with no real verification provisions, no complete disclosure  of their past activity, no cessation of their enrichment activity, and  it lifted restrictions on their ballistic missile program.   President Trump was right to withdraw from this disastrous deal, but  we are still living with the consequences of an emboldened Iran,  enriched with U.S. taxpayer dollars and a pathway to a nuclear weapon.  Their support for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah has grown,  while they continue to pose an existential threat to the State of  Israel.   The North Koreans, similarly, continue to pose a serious threat, Mr.  Speaker, with an arsenal of nuclear weapons, an ongoing ballistic  missile program, and continued pursuit of biological and chemical  weapons.   Despite recent success on the battlefield against ISIS, radical  Islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat to our Nation. We have got  troops deployed today, Mr. Speaker, around the globe in the fight  against terrorism.   As we face all of these threats, we are also living through an era of  increasingly rapid technological development. The very nature of  warfare is changing. The ability and the agility required to  successfully respond to these threats requires funding sufficiency and  certainty.   Mr. Speaker, that certainty simply cannot be provided through  continuous continuing resolutions. In the face of all these threats,  Mr. Speaker, we in this body must resolve not to add to the risk our  troops are facing. We must resolve to fulfill our constitutional duty  and provide sufficient, on-time, reliable funding.   It took many years for the readiness, manpower, and training crises  we face to develop. We in this House and in the Senate must be part of  the solution today and for many days and years into the future.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read something that the  Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral John Richardson, said before the  House Armed  [[Page H6287]]  Services Committee last year in a hearing about the damage of  continuing resolutions:   ``I have a hard time believing,'' he said, ``that I am sitting before  you now to discuss the potential that we might take steps to make our  sailors' missions more difficult, to give our adversaries more  advantage. . . . `'   Think about that, Mr. Speaker. That is what this debate is about.  That is what this resolution is about. Insufficient, unreliable funding  gives our adversaries an advantage. We must not be part of that any  longer. We must resolve to get our work done on time, in the House and  in the Senate, and to fulfill our constitutional obligation.   We must, in this Congress, Mr. Speaker, be worthy of the sacrifices  our men and women in uniform make for us every day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and just want to say I enjoy very much the opportunity to serve with my  colleague, Mr. Smith, on the Armed Services Committee, and I appreciate  his support for this important resolution.                                time  1430    We disagree on several points. I know that Mr. Smith knows that the  defense budget is not what is driving the debt in this country. I don't  disagree that we need a fiscal policy and that we have got to address  our fiscal concerns, but it is also the case that we have the votes,  that we have the ability, as we have done in this House and as they  could do in the Senate.   We saw, in the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Defense  Appropriations bill passed out 30-1. So it is a bipartisan bill that we  ought to pass. We passed it across this floor. We ought to pass it  across the Senate floor. We ought to get it to the President's desk so  that he can sign it, instead of being in a situation where we are  holding it hostage to a whole range of other issues and concerns.   Mr. Smith and I do have big disagreements. You know, to talk about  somehow that the tax cuts are impacting the Defense budget ignores the  history of the fact that the Defense budget was being strangled when  Barack Obama was in office. And as far as I know, nobody is accusing  President Obama of cutting taxes too much.   So the challenge that our military is facing and the challenge of  reliable sufficient funding isn't directly tied to tax policy. I think  what we have got to do is decouple these things.   If we don't get the funding for the military right, as Mr. Smith  said--you know, Secretary Mattis has said we can afford survival.  Another way to say that is if we don't get this right, nothing else we  do will matter. And the situation is so serious and so significant that  if we let ourselves one more time go down the path of holding this  funding hostage to other concerns and other issues, basically holding  our men and women in uniform hostage, I would submit that we are not  doing our job, and we are not fulfilling our constitutional obligation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Byrne), my colleague from the Rules Committee and from the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate very much my colleague's support for  this important resolution. I look forward to having his support as we  go forward on these resolutions that lay out very clearly how important  it is to fund our men and women in uniform.   He and I have very serious and significant disagreements over tax  policy. I believe--I know that the private sector is the engine of  growth in this economy; that tax cuts, in fact, generate economic  growth, and economic growth generates revenue; that if you really want  to deal with the debt in this Nation, then you have got to generate  additional revenue.   The way to do that is not by taxing people more. It is by letting  people keep more of what they earn so they in fact can reinvest so we  can see the kind of economic growth we need.   But I would say my colleague's focus on that issue today points out  the problem that we have been facing. We face a number of critically  important challenges in this body and in the United States Senate, but  we have got to ensure that we don't hold our men and women in uniform  hostage while we deal with those other issues.   We are, today, not at a time when we have got an international  environment that is one in which we can feel safe in our predominance,  in which we can feel safe in our ability to continue to project our  power. We are in one where the threat to us is growing, and it is  significant.   When you have got servicemen and -women, when you have got service  chiefs, when you have got the Secretary of Defense telling us things  like: our adversaries have weapons systems we might not be able to  defend against, that policies and budget processes and votes that are  undertaken in this body are increasing the risk to our men and women in  uniform, those are things we have got to pay attention to. And I would  say we have an obligation to pay attention to those things that is  higher than any other obligation that we have.   We have to commit, Mr. Speaker, to fulfilling that constitutional  obligation to providing full and on time funding for our troops.   And, Mr. Speaker, I would like to close today with something that  General Dunford said in his testimony before the House Armed Services  Committee earlier this year. He said: ``The Joint Force must continue  to receive sufficient, sustained, and predictable funding for the  foreseeable future to restore our competitive advantage and ensure we  never send our sons and daughters into a fair fight.''   Every single time we have to deploy our forces, Mr. Speaker, we must  ensure that they have everything they need to prevail.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution. I urge a  continued focus on completing the Defense funding process on time and  getting the bill to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 998) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the United States Navy's total readiness remains  in a perilous state due to high operational demands, increased  deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and deferred  maintenance all while the Navy is asked to do more with less as  financial support for critical areas waned in the era of sequestration  and without consistent Congressional funding.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 998         Whereas Navy readiness could further deteriorate in areas       such as training, ship construction, ship repair, and       deployability if Congress does not provide stable funding for       the Department of Defense;        Whereas the USS Fitzgerald, a United States Navy destroyer,       collided with a container ship while transiting through       Sagami Bay near Japan on June 17, 2017, resulting in the       deaths of seven sailors and hundreds of millions of dollars       in damage;        Whereas the United States Navy's investigation of the USS       Fitzgerald collision concluded that the event was       ``avoidable'' and that numerous failures included failure to       plan for safety, failure to adhere to sound navigation       practice, failure to execute basic watch standing practices,       failure to properly use available navigation tools, and       failure to respond deliberately and effectively when in       extremis;  [[Page H6290]]         Whereas the USS John S. McCain, a United States Navy       destroyer, collided with an oil tanker while transiting       through the Straits of Singapore on August 21, 2017,       resulting in the deaths of 10 sailors and hundreds of       millions of dollars in damage;        Whereas the United States Navy's investigation of the USS       John S. McCain collision concluded that the crew suffered       from a ``lack of preparation, ineffective command and       control, and deficiencies in training and preparations for       navigation'';        Whereas the Navy the Nation Needs, the United States Navy's       plan for building and sustaining a lethal, resilient force       through balanced investments across readiness, capability,       and capacity, explicitly states a need for 355 Battle Force       ships, yet the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan peaks at only       342 Battle Force ships in 2039 before a predicted decline;        Whereas an efficient and supported industrial base will be       vital to building and maintaining a 355 ship Navy;        Whereas over the previous 5 decades, 14 defense-related       new-construction shipyards have closed, 3 have left the       defense industry, and only 1 new shipyard has opened;        Whereas stable and predictable funding allows for Navy       leaders to properly forecast their missions and adhere to the       Optimized Fleet Response Plan while also enabling industry       partners to prepare for ship repair work at the most       competitive prices to the United States Government;        Whereas China's shipbuilding industry, according to a Naval       War College professor, is poised to make the People's       Liberation Army Navy the world's second largest navy by 2020,       and, if current trends continue, a combat fleet that in       overall order of battle is quantitatively on par with that of       the United States Navy by 2030;        Whereas China continues to develop forward operating bases       on manmade islands in the South China Sea and, by doing so,       consolidate its control over the strategic corridor between       the Indian and Pacific Oceans through which \1/3\ of global       maritime trade passes; and        Whereas Russia's shipbuilding industry's focus on undersea       warfare has positioned the Russian Navy to add six modernized       nuclear attack submarines to its naval inventory by 2023 and       aggressively modernize its aging Oscar-class nuclear attack       submarine fleet: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes the United States Navy's need for       congressional support to address readiness, training, and       modernization challenges that threaten to weaken naval       superiority; and        (2) finds that failing to provide the United States Navy       with stable, predictable funding negatively affects its       ability to project power around the world, reassure critical       allies, and defeat adversaries when necessary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), who is on the Armed Services  Committee, to discuss his resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague, Mr. Smith, is worried about a lot of  things that really just aren't the case over here on this side of the  aisle.   I agree with Mr. Smith that weakness is provocative. We certainly  need look no further than the Obama administration to see what happens  when the United States is weak, to see what happens when the United  States abandons its longstanding allies in the Middle East, including  Israel, in order to provide funding and a pathway to nuclear weapons  for the Iranians. We see what happened again and again and again.   We saw what happened when the Obama administration, President Obama,  decided to pull troops out of  [[Page H6292]]  Iraq based on a timeline that he established in Washington, D.C., with  no regard to the facts on the ground. We saw what happened. What  happened was the rise of ISIS.   So the problem that we have is, in order to deter, we have to make  sure people understand that we are strong. We have lived through 8  years in the previous administration of apologies and weakness, and  President Trump is turning that around. President Trump is making clear  that people understand that no longer will that be the case, and that  we, in fact, are going to be a Nation that stands up for what we  believe in.    I think it is also very educational, Mr. Speaker, to think about this  debate we are having here today, this discussion, and to think about  what it sounds like to men and women who are serving overseas and to  their family members. What we are supposed to be discussing here and  debating here is a resolution that expresses a sense of this body that  the United States Navy has been hurt extensively by the lack of  predictable funding. Instead, what we are getting is a lot of  discussion and conversation about a whole bunch of other things that I  am more than happy to debate.   Mr. Smith and I clearly have very different opinions about the  economy and about what you have to do to generate economic growth in  this economy. But that is not this resolution.   I think we have the opportunity here, on a bipartisan basis, once and  for all, to show that we are in a position where we are going to  provide the kind of support that our men and women in uniform need.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   These resolutions do lay out the steps necessary. These resolutions  make clear that the House has done its business, has done its work; we  need the Senate to do its work, and we need to get these bills to the  President's desk.   As I recall, Mr. Speaker, the only person that had hope as a policy  was Barack Obama, and my colleague is right, that he is no longer-- President Obama is no longer in the Oval Office. However, the damage  that his policies did are so devastating and so long-lasting that we  are having to dig out from under it. That is why we are here today.   We are here today because not only have continuing resolutions hurt  the Department of Defense, the policies of the last 8 years have  created a situation, geopolitically and militarily, where the work that  we have got to do to undo those very ill-guided policies is significant  and requires the kind of funding that we are talking about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 994) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the United States Marine Corps faces significant  readiness challenges and that budgetary uncertainty impedes the Corps'  ability to meet ongoing and unexpected national security threats,  putting United States national security at risk.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 994         Whereas since fiscal year 2010, United States Marine Corps       active duty end strength has shrunk by 8 percent from 202,100       to 186,000;        Whereas, on March 1, 2016, Marine Corps Commandant Robert       Neller stated, ``The fiscal reductions and instability of the       past few years have impacted our readiness. As resources have       diminished, the Marine Corps has protected the near-term       operational readiness of its deployed and next-to-deploy       units in order to meet operational commitments. This has come       at a risk'';        Whereas, on February 26, 2015, now Chairman of the Joint       Chiefs of Staff Joseph F. Dunford stated, ``[a]pproximately       half of our non-deployed units--and those are the ones that       provide the bench to respond to unforeseen contingencies--are       suffering personnel, equipment and training shortfalls'';        Whereas, on February 8, 2017, Assistant Commandant Glenn       Walters stated, ``A focus on [ongoing] operations, the       decrease in funding levels from Fiscal Year (FY) 2012, fiscal       instability and the lack of an inter-war period have left       your Marine Corps insufficiently manned, trained and equipped       across the depth of the force to operate in an evolving       operational environment'';        Whereas the Marine Corps' Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV-      7A1) and Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) average over 40 and 26       years old, respectively;        Whereas the Marine Corps has a stated requirement for 38       amphibious ships to support the operations of 2 Marine       Expeditionary Brigades, but the amphibious fleet numbers only       32 ships today;        Whereas former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan       Greenert testified on March 12, 2014, that, ``[t]oday, in the       world that we live in, the world that the Navy and Marine       Corps lives in, and the future, we probably need 50       [amphibious ships]'';        Whereas, on April 5, 2017, Marine Corps leaders testified       that, ``The most dire readiness situation lies within our       Aviation element. An unhealthy percentage of our aviation       units lack the minimum number of ready basic aircraft (RBA)       for training, and we are significantly short ready aircraft       for wartime requirements. We simply do not have the available       aircraft to meet our squadrons' requirements'';        Whereas during parts of 2016, only 43 percent of the Marine       Corps' total aviation fleet was available for operational       employment, including less than \1/3\ of its F/A-18 Hornets;        Whereas from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017,       Marine Corps aviation accidents increased by 80 percent from       56 to 101 per year;        Whereas between 2011 and 2017, aviation accidents killed       more than 60 Marines, including 19 over a 2-month period in       2017; and        Whereas, on March 10, 2017, Deputy Commandant Gary L.       Thomas stated, ``Unstable fiscal environments prevent the       deliberately planned, sustained effort needed to recover       current readiness of our legacy equipment in the near term,       and to modernize in the longer term . . . We must work to       avoid a budget-driven strategy and return to a strategy-      driven budget, informed by the strategic requirements of the       current and future operating environments. Unless we do so,       the range of options we have to address current and future       threats will further erode'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes that the United States Marine Corps faces       significant readiness challenges, as well as shortfalls in       end strength and delayed modernization;        (2) finds that failing to provide the Marine Corps with       stable, robust, and on-time funding impedes its ability to       meet ongoing and unexpected security threats, putting United       States national security at risk; and        (3) commits to enhancing the Marine Corps' ability to meet       our Nation's threats ``In the air, on land, and sea''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), my colleague on the Armed  Services Committee, to discuss his resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking both my colleagues, Mr.  Wittman from Virginia, Mr. Gallagher from Wisconsin, and all of the  folks on the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Thornberry, Ranking  Member Smith, as well as the folks on the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee, led by Chairwoman Kay Granger, for their tremendous work  on these crucially important issues.   I think that, again, Mr. Smith has highlighted, really, the crux of  this issue, and the crux of this issue is whether or not we as a body  are going to recognize that we have the ability here and what we do  here will determine whether or not we provide the support and the  resources our troops need or whether we increase the risk they face.   When we are facing a situation where we have had more servicemembers  die in training accidents than in combat in the last year, that is an  unacceptable and indefensible situation.   Mr. Speaker, on this particular resolution, I want to thank my  colleague from Wisconsin for introducing this resolution. As a marine,  he understands better than most how what we do in this body impacts our  men and women in uniform.   H. Res. 994 highlights the vast readiness impacts we have seen in the  Marine Corps over the past 9 years of continuing resolutions,  sequestration, and overall budget dysfunction. We do not want to be in  a position, Mr. Speaker, where the Marines are forced to continue to  use aging or outdated equipment, or they don't have the funds necessary  to receive the training they require to undo this readiness crisis, or  they don't have the flexibility they need to respond to the fact that  we have got an absolutely changing world of warfare. They need agility  to do that, and that requires funds from this body.   As my colleagues have said, we have made great progress. Over the  past year, we have increased the defense spending caps for fiscal year  2018 and 2019, and we have agreed to fund the Department of Defense at  $700 billion for fiscal year 2018.   Mr. Speaker, we have got to get that done now for fiscal year 2019.  The readiness crisis was not created in a single year, and it will take  many years of effort to be able to address it.   The bill that we considered in the House just a few weeks ago passed  with over 300 bipartisan votes. I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that we can  now, today, commit all of ourselves as a body and urge our colleagues  on the other side of this building to ensure that the work that we do  is worthy of the men and women in uniform who protect all of us, to  ensure that we stay on track to get this bill passed by the Senate and  to the President's desk before the end of the fiscal year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher) to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
