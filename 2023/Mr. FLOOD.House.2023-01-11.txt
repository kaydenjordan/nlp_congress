 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Nebraska's 41st  Governor, the newly-inaugurated, Jim Pillen.   After traveling to all 93 counties in Nebraska, putting 100,000 miles  on his truck, Jim has become a very well-known man, but I also wanted  to share a little bit about his story with you.   Jim is the son of a tenant farmer and a seamstress. What most people  don't know is that Jim came from almost nothing. He is a self-made man.  His entrepreneurial spirit built Pillen Family Farms into a company  with international success.   If you have eaten bacon in the last decade, you have probably enjoyed  the work of the Pillen family, which reaches all the way from hog  genetics to meat processing and everything in between.   The pig farmer is wasting no time as Governor. He has already rolled  up his sleeves, getting to work raising awareness about human  trafficking, fighting for school choice, and making government more  efficient.   Jim has pledged to bring people together to make Nebraska better day  by day. Our Nebraska delegation is excited to work with him to move the  State forward.                            ____________________
