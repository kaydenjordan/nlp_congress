 Mr. Speaker, it is a dark day; $3 trillion in revenue  cuts, in tax breaks; three quarters of that goes to corporations under  the premise that they will use that money to employ people. The last  time they got this kind of a break, 93 percent of the money went to  stock dividends, buybacks, and executive bonuses, and it will be no  different this time--squandering America's wealth for the wealthiest  among us.   Eighty-three percent of the remainder goes to people who earn over  $400,000 a year. They are going to trickle down on us, yet again.   At the same time, there is no infrastructure package. The Trump  administration, the DOT says, we just don't know where we can find the  money.   Well, imagine if they used a fraction of these tax giveaways for  infrastructure--15,000 jobs per billion invested. We could have had  $1.5 million with 3 percent of the money they just wasted on these tax  cuts.   Shame on them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for explaining in  some detail what the impacts of this legislation are and who is going  to benefit. The gentleman is a member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, on which I am the ranking member.   I just want to say, we have been waiting for the trillion-dollar  Trump infrastructure plan for a year now, and what we are hearing is,  well, they just can't afford it. We can't afford to rebuild America's  infrastructure.   So let's compare the impact of a few of these tax cuts to what we  could have done or could do with that money. Every tax cut means the  government forgoes revenue.   So let's just take the estate tax. Doubling the exemption from an $11  million to $22 million estate, that costs $100 billion. If we invested  that $100 billion in infrastructure, we would create 1.5 million  working family wage jobs for Americans--1.5 million jobs. Now, I  suppose those people with the cuts in the estate tax, they are going to  trickle something on working people, probably not jobs, though.   And let's look at one of my favorites, the passthrough. We are going  to help small business. Well, no, we are not really going to help small  business. If you work in your small business, you are not going to get  a tax break. If you are a passive investor in a so-called small  business or passthrough entity, you get a big tax break.   Now, the President says he won't benefit. He owns 500 passthrough  businesses according to his financial disclosure. Each one of those  will give him a massive tax break.   Well, that little beauty costs $600 billion. For $600 billion, if we  invested it in infrastructure, we could create 9 million jobs. These  passive investors in oil and gas and real estate, how many jobs are  they going to create? Again, they might hire another manservant or  someone to cut the lawn or someone to wax the yacht, but it's not going  to be 9 million jobs, and it isn't going to be at family wages--Davis- Bacon wages, I might say, really good wages.   Let's just look at one item, the top rate. That only goes to people  who earn over $500,000 a year. They are going to get a substantial  break. About $130 billion it is going to cost us to give a tax break to  people who earn over $500,000 a year, more of the trickle class, and  that would have created 2 million family wage jobs rebuilding America's  infrastructure, and not just benefiting the people who do the work.   And it isn't just construction. It is design. It is engineering. It  is small business. And just think of all the benefits in terms of the  movement of goods and people and how it makes America more competitive.   What a sad day it is when, as you pointed out very well, we are  giving this money--three-quarters of it goes to corporate tax breaks,  three-quarters. The last time we gave corporations a big tax cut under  Bush when they repatriated almost $1 trillion, 93 percent of the money  was spent on stock buybacks, dividends, and executive bonuses. I don't  know what they did with the other 7 percent because those same  corporations actually reduced employment.   So what a false promise this is. A very, very sad day. I thank the  gentleman for bringing this to the attention of the American people.
