 Mr. Speaker, just a few floors from here, I am in  the Homeland Security Committee, and we are addressing issues dealing  with the security of this Nation. And in my remarks on the legislation  that we are dealing with, I expressed the pain of having this Congress  come together in a bipartisan manner. I know a couple of sessions ago,  we worked on a bipartisan border security bill. Sometimes America says  enough is enough. They want us to work together.  [[Page H7759]]    This morning I rise to mourn and stand with those families--58 of  them--who are feeling now an unspeakable pain. They are questioning how  their loved one could be at a joyous country music festival and be  massacred.   My hometown newspaper says it right: that the massacre in Vegas was  an act of pure evil.   Those of us who believe in this flag, whether we kneel, whether we  stand as we pledge, we know that America is the greatest country in the  world; but when she is hurting, it is important for this Congress to  act.   The comment that this is no time to discuss how we solve this  unfettered violence, this massacre, this evil perpetrator, then that  sentiment is a sentiment I hope will only be a small percentage of this  body.   We have tried over and over again in any manner that we could to  discuss fairly the idea of gun safety legislation, not the diminishing  of the Second Amendment, as some made the argument, that the kneeling,  take a knee, or ``I kneel'' was a diminishment of the First Amendment.  It absolutely was not, because the First Amendment allows one to  petition one's grievances.   In terms of the Second Amendment, the procedure of overturning a  constitutional amendment would be a long journey, which would include  the two Houses of Congress and the people of the United States.   Stop fueling fear that any manner of regulating the right to hold  guns is in any way diminishing the Second Amendment, the right to bear  arms.   It is ``enough is enough.'' There were hundreds of mothers and  fathers outside of the Capitol this morning when Democrats stood up and  called on this Congress and the Speaker to appoint a select committee,  of which I join them in. Make it as large as it can be. Have people who  will disagree. Take members of the jurisdictional committees and others  who have experienced this violence. Let us solve this dirty problem.   It is dirty, for you cannot give any support to the idea of civilians  having military-style weapons and taking them and preying on the  innocent.   Beautiful young women, young men, mothers and fathers, grandparents  now dead, and nothing but their faith will give to their family the  hope that they may see them again, for we are God-fearing people in  whatever faith we may have.   Our hope is vested in seeing our loved ones again, in particular in  the Christian faith, and others have their ways of seeing their loved  ones again.   There must be a ban on assault weapons. There must be a recognition  that there exists domestic terrorism.   What was the Pulse nightclub?   Domestic terrorism comes in different ways. It doesn't have to be  ISIS. It can be Charleston, South Carolina. That was an act of  intimidation.   There were those interviewed who said: I may rethink my life. Why  should I be going to large venues? Maybe I can't do that.   That is not America. That is not what we want for our children. Why  can't this Congress look at the polling numbers of the members of the  National Rifle Association. They understand the importance of training,  of putting locks on guns, of not having military weapons in the hands  of individuals who would kill us dead.   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that enough is enough. We cannot  do nothing. This flag demands that we do something.   I close by saying that a veteran was killed. He was not killed in  Iraq or Afghanistan, where he fought; but he was killed in the streets  of America, where he had overcome post-traumatic stress disorder. We  know that Texans were wounded.   So, Mr. Speaker, I leave this podium in respect simply to say: As  America, we cannot do this any longer, and we must stand up as a  Congress and do our jobs and find a way to end this gun violence now.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend, my fellow  alum, for his leadership. I recognize and thank the chairwoman of the  committee.   To my good friend that was on the floor, I think he wants limited  government when disaster is not in his district.   So I think it is important as a member of this Budget Committee of  which I am so very proud of its service, as the Democrats have worked  so hard, and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, a  committee called upon  [[Page H7786]]  for domestic tranquility and domestic security, might I just add that  we are now marking up a bill just a few floors away from this House  that is asking for $15 billion to pay for a border wall in the midst of  the horror of tragedy and in the midst of a lowering number of  individuals even coming to the United States across the border, the  very border wall that was told to us would be paid for by the people of  Mexico.   But I think the important point is that my good friends who are  supporting this dastardly budget that tears at the fabric of America  are, as well, supporting a tax cut for the wealthy that will provide  $2.9 trillion of debt to the American people and increase the debt as  well as the deficit. It will mean that working and middle class  families will have taxes raised on them by $470 billion. We will see  the heavy brunt of this budget on low-income families, students  struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   Just a few hours ago, I said the American people do not need to have  the government step on them; and I can assure you, with this budget,  which cuts more than $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and Medicare, we will  step on the American people.   We will end the Medicare guarantee, and it will narrowly shortchange  soft power by cutting and decimating the State Department, the very  partner that we need to continue the security of the American people,  raising defense, of whom I support all of our military. Texas is a  military State. But it is $72 billion above cap, and that is not giving  our military personnel their due. It is going above the needs of the  military.   We need to be prepared, but this skinny budget will undermine  education and the workforce at $326 billion, energy and commerce at  $1.56 billion, homeland security by $25 billion, justice and the needs  of civil justice by $67 billion, and veterans by $49 billion.   It will cut the Community Development Block Grant, and it will hurt  Virgin Islands U.S. citizens, Puerto Rico U.S. citizens, and Texas,  that is still struggling.   Before I came to this floor, I was engaging with my State about more  disaster food stamp sites because I have people who are unhoused in the  18th Congressional District, who are needing the resources.    Mr. Chairman, I have individuals who our wonderful  first responders had to drag out of the raging waters in Hurricane  Harvey. I have homes that were underwater that need disaster relief. I  have individuals who are walking along highways like oceans, and then I  have children who are with families who do not have jobs because of  Hurricane Harvey, who need the Children's Health Insurance Program or  need the disaster food stamps.   This is a budget that steps on the American people. It steps on our  disaster relief, and it does not recognize what the United States  Government is. It is a refuge and a relief for the American people.   Vote ``no'' on the Republican budget.   Mr. Chair, as a member of the Budget Committee, a senior member of  the Homeland Security Committee, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations, and the proud representative of the 700,000 residents  of 18th Congressional District of Texas who are still coping with the  devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, I rise in strong and unyielding  opposition to H. Con. Res. 71, the Congressional Budget Resolution for  Fiscal Year 2018.   Why do I urge every Member of this House to vote against this  Republican budget resolution, laughingly called the ``Building a Better  America Budget,'' but which more accurately should be named the  ``Nightmare on Capitol Hill Budget''?   Let us count the ways; here are eight to start.   1. Republican budget mandates $5.4 trillion in spending cuts to top  priorities like disaster relief, education, infrastructure, research,  veteran benefits, and programs that expand opportunities for American  families.   2. Republican budget provides $2.9 trillion in tax cuts to  millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations, while raising  taxes on working and middle class families by $470 billion.   3. The budget includes fast-track reconciliation procedures to push  through cuts to programs that tens of millions of Americans count on  totaling $203 billion across 11 House committees.   4. The steep reductions in program investments proposed in this  Republican budget fall most heavily on low-income families, students  struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   5. Republican budget immediately guts investment critical to  expanding economic opportunity by lowering the already inadequate  austerity-level spending caps by an additional $5 billion in 2018 and  by even more in subsequent years.   6. Republican budget adopts Trumpcare but does even more damage  because in addition to depriving more than 20 million Americans of  healthcare, denying protection to persons with preexisting conditions,  and raising costs for older and low-income adults, cuts more than $1.5  trillion from Medicaid and Medicare.   7. Republican budget ends the Medicare guarantee and calls for  replacing Medicare's guaranteed benefits with fixed payments for the  purchase of health insurance, shifting costs and financial risks onto  seniors and disabled workers; this represents a $500 billion cut to  Medicare over ten years.   8. The Republican budget focuses too narrowly on the military,  shortchanging American soft-power and other essential elements of  national security by increasing defense spending by $72 billion above  the cap and hollowing out the State Department and foreign aid agencies  with cuts of $11 billion and environmental and natural resource  protection by more than $6 billion.   Mr. Chair, the federal budget is more than a financial document; it  is an expression of our values and priorities as a nation.   Sadly, this Republican budget, just like the President's ``skinny  budget'' fails this moral test of government.   America will not be made great by stealing another $1.5 trillion from  Medicare and Medicaid, abandoning seniors and families in need,  depriving students of realizing a dream to attend college without  drowning in debt, or disinvesting in the working families just to give  unwanted tax breaks to wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy.   Even a cursory review leaves the inescapable conclusion that this  budget represents a betrayal--of our values as a nation, and of the  promises made by the President during the election campaign.   This Republican budget is not a budget for the real world that real  Americans live in but is as much a fantasy budget as the Trump ``Skinny  Budget'' in that it pretends to achieve balance by assuming that  painless spending cuts can and will be made by the following standing  committees of Congress in the following amounts:   1. Agriculture Committee: cut $207 billion   2. Armed Services Committee: cut $33 billion   3. Education and Workforce Committee: $326 billion   4. Energy and Commerce Committee: $1.656 trillion   5. Financial Services Committee: cut $124 billion   6. Homeland Security Committee: cut $25 billion   7. Judiciary Committee: cut $67 billion   8. Natural Resources Committee: cut $59 billion   9. Oversight and Government Reform Committee: cut $282 billion   10. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee: cut $3 billion   11. Veterans Affairs Committee: cut $49 billion   12. Ways and Means Committee: cut $800 billion   13. Unassigned (i.e., Intelligence; Foreign Affairs; Small Business;  Science, Space, and Technology Committees: cut $747 billion   14. Total Cuts: $4.38 trillion   To put these reckless, irresponsible, and draconian budget cuts in  perspective, it is useful to examine what they mean when applied to the  programs depended upon by Americans to rise up the economic ladder,  plan for the future, provide for their families, and strive to achieve  the American Dream.   The elimination of funding for Community Development Block Grants  (CDBG) drains resources from communities, even in times of disaster  because CDBG provides flexible grants to local communities for a wide  range of unique needs, including Meals on Wheels, housing programs, and  community infrastructure improvements.   The Republican budget targets disaster grants made by the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, which help families and businesses when  their disaster-related property losses are not covered by insurance.  [[Page H7787]]    The Republican budget makes higher education more expensive by  cutting $211 billion from student financial aid programs, like Pell  Grants, over ten years.   The Republican budget also eliminates subsidized loans, making it  difficult for students, particularly low-income students, to afford  college and compounds the damage by making it more difficult to repay  student loans by eliminating the Public Sector Loan Forgiveness and  Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs.   The Republican budget's solution to the affordable housing crisis  currently facing cities large and small all across the country is to  convert all discretionary spending on affordable housing into a block  grant, which means there will be even less assistance to help the 71  percent of extremely low income renter households who spend more than  half their income on housing.   The Republican budget cuts $154 billion from the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next ten years by  essentially converting it to a block grant, cutting off funding for  eligible individuals and requiring cash-strapped states to either fill  in the gap or take away food assistance from millions of working  families, children, and seniors.   Mr. Chair, as economists and policy experts have documented time and  again, immigration reform would expand the size of the U.S. workforce,  and in turn would increase the size of the economy and reduce deficits.   The Republican budget, however, again rejects comprehensive  immigration reform that would bring clear and just rules for those  seeking citizenship and help secure the nation's borders.   In doing so, the Republican budget squanders an opportunity to reduce  deficits by an estimated $900 billion over the next two decades, boost  the economy by 5.4 percent, and extend the solvency of Social Security.   Mr. Chair, none of us can forget the President's favorite boast and  central campaign promise that he would build a wall on our southern  border and guarantee that Mexico would be made to pay for it.   The Republican budget deprives the President of the opportunity to  make good on his foolish boast by forcing American taxpayers to foot  the bill for President Trump's $1.6 billion border wall that will do  nothing to stop unauthorized entry into the country and will not fix  our broken immigration system.   The Republican budget continues to target federal employees by  cutting their compensation and benefits by at least another $163  billion over ten years, which comes on top of the $182 billion in cuts  federal employees have already absorbed in the form of higher  retirement contributions, pay freezes, and furloughs.   The Republican budget puts U.S. transportation network on the road to  ruin by slashing transportation spending, by $254 billion over ten  years, or 25 percent below current estimates.   The Republican budget cuts hurts veterans by cutting veterans  benefits by nearly $50 billion over the next ten years, with newly  eligible veterans experiencing cuts in programs that pay for education  benefits as well as loan guarantees.   Finally, Mr. Chair, it must be pointed out that the Republican  budget's pretension to balance is based on reliance on trillions of  dollars in budget games and gimmicks to rig the numbers.   The Republican budget counts a dubious $1.8 trillion ``economic  dividend'' from cutting taxes and taking away consumer protections that  is not backed up by any credible analysis and assumes $1.5 trillion of  this ``dividend'' will go toward deficit reduction.   The Republican budget assumes, despite all precedent and evidence to  the contrary, that tax reform will be revenue neutral, even though  Republican tax plans are projected to lose between $3 trillion and $7  trillion.   Given these budgetary shenanigans, never could it more truly be said  that ``figures don't lie, but liars figure.''   As the late and great former senator and Vice-President Hubert  Humphrey said:         The moral test of government is how that government treats       those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who       are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are       in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.    It is for this reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget  resolution, it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal  responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the budget must also  pass a ``moral test.''   The Republican budget resolution fails both of these standards.   Because the American people deserve to know exactly what ills  Republicans have in store for them, I strongly oppose H. Con. Res. 71  and urge all Members to join me in voting against this reckless, cruel,  and heartless measure that will do nothing to improve the lives or  well-being of middle and working class families.    Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman for his  leadership. It has been more than a pleasure to serve as the vice chair  of the Congressional Progressive Caucus for the number of years that we  have had to put forward the people's budget.   I simply want to say what a budget is, Mr. Chairman. A budget is a  roadmap for the American people. It is a question of whether America  cares about the most vulnerable and whether or not, in our caring, we  are prepared to do deeds to insist upon their success.   The Republican budget takes $2 trillion and provides a big, wealthy  tax cut for the rich, and it creates, in essence, a deep hole in  affordable care for healthcare. It does not provide justice and fair  elections. It takes away educational opportunity from students, and, of  course, it does not bring the most vulnerable out of poverty and  enhance the lives of the middle class.   The people's budget provides for supporting the Affordable Care Act.  It provides for giving fair working tax cuts for others, and it  provides fairness and justice.   I rise to support the people's budget. It invests in the American  people. I ask my colleagues to vote for the Congressional Progressive  Caucus' budget.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the top ten reasons to support the  Congressional Progressive Caucus' budget.               Top Ten Reasons To Support The People's Budget     (Supported by over 60 organizations including: AFT, NEA, Planned    Parenthood, Communications Workers of America, Sierra Club, AFSCME,               AFGE, Vote Vets, Social Security Works, NARAL)         (1) The People's Budget invests $2 trillion in America's       crumbling infrastructure while promoting job growth and       strengthening our commitment to sustainability. This is an       investment in America which will transform our fossil-fuel       energy system, overburdened mass transit, deteriorating       schools, lead-contaminated water systems, and crumbling roads       and bridges through local hiring and livable wages.        (2) The People's Budget enacts comprehensive immigration       reform which permanently protects Dreamers and their families       and opposes immigration bans on Muslims and refugees. Our       country needs an immigration system that honors our values of       inclusion, diversity, and equality. Our Budget prohibits       funding to Customs and Border Protection to implement       President Trump's discriminatory Muslim and refugee bans.        (3) Our budget takes bold action to fight climate change       and rebuild our local communities recently devastated by       hurricanes. The People's Budget requires polluters to pay for       their reckless behavior while eliminating tax breaks that       incentivize fossil fuel energy over cleaner energy. It       invests $200 billion to ensure families in Texas, Louisiana,       Puerto Rico, Florida and U.S. territories have the immediate       assistance they need to begin the stable road to recovery. It       also provides funding for climate change research, mitigation       and adaptation to protect those most at risk from future       environmental disasters.        (4) The CPC budget delivers on the promise of child care       for all and Pre-K for all. It ensures that families will not       have to pay more than 10 percent of their income for child       care, whether that care is at home or at a child care center.       Our budget also expands pre-k for children across the       country.        (5) We make debt free college a reality for all students by       overhauling the student loan system which currently leaves       college students saddled with unmanageable levels of debt.       The People's Budget creates a federal matching program that       supports state efforts to expand investments in higher       education, bring down costs for students, and increase aid to       students to help them cover the total cost of college       attendance without taking on debt.        (6) The People's Budget strengthens the Affordable Care       Act, while pushing towards a single payer system. It       prioritizes reforms to increase access, equity, and       affordability. Maintaining the positive reforms from the ACA       are critical as Republicans attempt to gut the health care       system and leave millions of Americans stranded without       access to critical insurance coverage. The People's Budget       protects Medicare's integrity and improves its long-term       solvency. It protects children and low-income Americans and       gives states the freedom to transition to a single payer       system. It also makes two significant policy changes to       reduce the costs of prescription drugs: allows Medicare Part       D to negotiate drug prices and ends ``Pay for Delay''       practice which keeps generics out of the market.        (7) The CPC Budget creates a fair tax system for working       Americans. In order to make these bold, necessary investments       in working families, we must rewrite the rules of a rigged       economy that favors billionaires and big corporations. The       People's Budget closes tax loopholes that corporations use to       ship jobs overseas, and stops CEOs from receiving millions in       tax-free bonuses. Our budget tackles inequality through fair       tax rates for all Americans, leveling the playing field for       working people.        (8) Our budget protects the right to vote and supports       criminal justice reforms which strengthen public safety and       avoid over-criminalization. Our budget calls for rebuilding       trust in the justice system by funding community oriented       policing reforms. It also strengthens Department of Justice       voter protection programs, protects voting rights by       increasing funding to voter protection agencies, and funds       public financing of campaigns to curb the influence of       special interests in politics. Additionally, the budget makes       key investments in America's electoral integrity by upgrading       our voting systems.        (9) The People's Budget creates pathways out of poverty by       expanding proven anti-poverty programs and initiatives and       restoring vital programs to our nation to provide prosperity       for all. These include a national strategy to reduce poverty       in half in ten years and $12.8 billion investment to end       family homelessness. The People's Budget restores cuts made       to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and       permanently adopts the enhanced levels established in the       American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It also provides an       additional $10 billion for child nutrition programs and       allows those who have lost a job through no fault of their       own to claim up to 99 weeks of unemployment benefits for up       to two years.        (10) We make veterans a priority by increasing funding for       veterans supportive housing to eliminate veterans       homelessness and expanding access to mental health care for       all veteran and service members. Our budget also invests in       job training opportunities for transitioning service members       and veterans.     Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Budget Committee, I  find the CBC budget to be a principled and thoughtful budget.   It ends the threat of sequestration, it will accelerate our economic  recovery, it will help eradicate poverty in America, and it will reduce  the deficit by approximately $2.72 trillion over 10 years.   On the other hand, the tax cut that our Republican friends are  proposing will cause a deficit by giving a whopping $2.4-plus trillion  in tax cuts, most to the top 1 percent of the American people.   It will not help the young child as he grows to seek opportunities  and jobs. This will be a bill that is at a price that is not right. If  you work hard, you get less.   Our budget, on the other hand, gives $665 billion in immediate  investments to rebuild our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. It is  crumbling even more so after the devastating hurricanes. It gives $120  billion to fund a national direct job creation program and full  employment trust fund program.    It provides $80 billion to fund the modernization of  schools, $45 billion to fund an energy infrastructure modernization  program, $20 billion to expand access to broadband services, $25  billion for recapitalization, $15 billion for improving and rebuilding  VA hospitals, $25 billion for HUD's Choice Neighborhoods program, and  $5 billion for summer jobs for young people.   I can attest to the fact that, in discussions with the Federal  Communications Commission, the connectivity in vulnerable neighborhoods  and communities is at an all-time low. Expanding broadband services is  a vital need.   It is a vital need to expand the educational services for this young  man in order for him to be capable of taking a job in the 21st century.  There are hundreds of thousands of jobs that go unapplied for because  the skill set of our young people have been deprived because of  inadequate education.   This budget of the Congressional Black Caucus is a people investor.  It invests in people. For that reason, I believe it is the right way to  go. It balances our needs for the military and it provides for the  American people.  [[Page H7832]]     It, in fact, provides that roadmap to ensure that  the American people are taken care.   I want to make mention that it provides for $300 billion for programs  that are proven instrumental in lifting millions of Americans out of  poverty.   Shouldn't this be what we are doing?   Right now, in my district, thousands are online for the disaster Food  Stamp program. That program needs to be extended.   This is what we do. We do not make people dependent. We give them a  hand up, not a handout. That is what the budget is supposed to be: a  roadmap for opportunity.   I support the Congressional Black Caucus budget, for that is what it  is: a roadmap for opportunity.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Amendment in the Nature of  a Substitute (ANS) offered by the Congressional Black Caucus to H. Con.  Res. 71, the House Republicans' ``Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year  2018.''   I support the CBC Budget for four principal reasons:   1. It ends the threat of sequestration;   2. It will accelerate our economic recovery;   3. It will help eradicate poverty in America; and   4. It will reduce the deficit by approximately $2.72 trillion over 10  years.   Mr. Chair, if we reject the House Republicans' ``Price Is Not Right''  and ``Work Harder to Get Less'' Budget with its discredited economic  gimmicks and unrealistic projections and adopt the CBC Budget, we will  get instead a comprehensive jobs program that would rebuild our  nation's infrastructure and reinvest in our communities totaling $1  trillion over the next decade.   The jobs created will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure  that it reaches every community in America, while also making the  necessary investments to ensure America's long-term economic  competitiveness.   Specifically, the CBC Budget will create jobs by providing:   1. $665 billion in immediate investment to rebuild our nation's  crumbling infrastructure;   2. $120 billion to fund a National Direct Job Creation Program and  Full Employment Trust Fund Program;   3. $8o billion to fund the modernization of schools;   4. $45 billion to fund an energy infrastructure modernization  program;   5. $20 billion to expand access to broadband services;   6. $25 billion for public housing recapitalization;   7. $15 billion for improving and rebuilding V.A. hospitals and  extended care facilities;   8. $25 billion for HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Program and for  communities that desperately need revitalization; and   9. $5 billion for summer jobs so young persons can save money to  attend college and plan for their futures.   Mr. Chair, when it comes to addressing the poverty that is still too  prevalent in our country, the CBC Budget is clearly superior to the  Republican's ``Work Harder, Get Less'' Budget.   The CBC Budget provides for $300 billion for programs that have  proven instrumental in lifting millions of Americans out of poverty.   The funding provided will be used to restore cuts to the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, extend emergency unemployment insurance,  expand access to affordable housing, increase access to quality and  affordable education, and increase funding for job training and trade  adjustment assistance programs.   Additionally, Mr. Chair, to ensure that federal resources are  targeted more efficiently towards eradicating poverty and are actually  reaching communities most in need, the CBC budget proposes the  codification of the ``10-20-30'' policy for federal spending.   Under the ``10-20-30'' policy at least 10 percent of the federal  funds in certain accounts are to be directed to areas that have had a  poverty rate of 20 percent for the last 30 years.   Finally, I support the CBC Budget because it puts an end to the  draconian sequester burdening the economy and our people for the last  several years.   In addition, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget  Office, it will reduce the deficit by approximately $2.72 trillion over  10 years.   Mr. Chair, it is said often, but is no less true, that the federal  budget is more than a financial document; it is an expression of the  nation's most cherished values.   As the late and great former senator and Vice-President Hubert  Humphrey said:         ``The moral test of government is how that government       treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those       who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who       are in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the       handicapped.''    The Republican budget resolution fails this moral test; the CBC  Budget does not.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the  House Republicans' budget and voting for a better alternative, the CBC  Budget.
