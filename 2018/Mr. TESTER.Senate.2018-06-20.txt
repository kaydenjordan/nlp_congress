 Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from  Indiana for this amendment. It is a good amendment and is an amendment  we need to pass in this body. As Senator Young pointed out, issues  around mental health are very prevalent. It is the signature injury  coming out of the Middle East. When these folks come back home, our men  and women who have served need to have access, especially when they are  in crisis. I thank Senator Young.                              Amendment No. 2971    Mr. President, I have a different amendment. This amendment does one  simple thing. It stresses the importance of the independence of the  Office of the Inspector General at the VA. To be honest, I am not sure  we should ever have had to have this amendment, but we do because it is  clear the VA is denying access to the Office of Inspector General to  get the information it needs to carry out its mission of oversight.  Over the past week, there have been a flurry of letters back and forth  from the VA to the IG about access to information about the nature of  the relationship between the two.   This is what I have to say. The rhetoric coming out of the VA is a  bit troubling. Sunlight, bringing information to light, is the best  antiseptic for good government. When the IG is doing its job correctly,  that is exactly what happens. So with the rhetoric that is coming out  of the VA, it opens the door to the VA to be able to control or  interfere for political reasons what should be the OIG's independent  oversight efforts. I am here to state that the VA is not above the law  or exempt from independent oversight. Despite the Acting Secretary  directing the inspector general to act like he is his subordinate, he  is not. This amendment No. 2971 simply prohibits funds appropriated in  this bill to be used in a way that limits the access of the Office of  Inspector General to the information or documents it deems necessary to  investigate and do the oversight of the VA's work.   As we have seen, the Department cannot be trusted to police itself.  It must be held accountable to the veterans and taxpayers, and the  Office of Inspector General is an important watchdog that should not be  undermined.   I would like to add to the Record the cosponsors of this bill:  Senators Isakson, Murray, Blumenthal, Hirono, Manchin, Duckworth,  Baldwin, King, Gillibrand, Warren, Brown, McCaskill, Jones, Durbin, and  Wyden.   This is a good amendment. It is a good governance amendment. It is an  amendment to allow us, the folks in the Senate, to offer the kind of  oversight we need to offer to the VA to make sure it is serving the  veterans of this country.   With that, I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2926
