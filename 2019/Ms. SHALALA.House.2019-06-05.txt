 Madam Speaker, today as we mark Gun Violence Awareness  Month, we wear orange to remember the victims of gun violence.   We remember Parkland. We remember Pulse and Charleston and  Pittsburgh. We remember Virginia Beach. We remember the children of  Liberty City and Sandy Hook.   We wear orange to remember. We wear orange to remind ourselves that  we must not give up until children can go to school, worshippers can go  to church, and employees can go to work free from the fear of gun  violence.   We will not give up until universal background checks are in law and  until the weapons of war are banned from our streets.   Madam Speaker, we will not give up until this epidemic is over.                            ____________________
