 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7, the Democrats'  conveniently titled, but painfully misguided, Paycheck Fairness Act,  which should be called the paychecks for trial lawyers act.   We all agree on the fundamental principle of this bill: women should  not be paid less than men for the same work.   That is not up for debate; and, for me, it has never been up for  debate; and, for our country, it hasn't been since 1963, when the Equal  Pay Act amended the Fair Labor Standards Act, making equal pay the law  of the land.   Moreover, in 1964, title VII of the Civil Rights Act codified  nondiscrimination rules for employment, making it illegal to  discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion,  and sex.   The question before us today is whether the Democrats' Paycheck  Fairness Act provides any additional protections to women in the  workplace. The answer is a resounding no.   The United States has some of the most varied and complex workplaces  in the world. Before the onslaught of COVID-19, women were earning  merited paychecks in record numbers. According to a Harvard University  analysis and numerous other studies, the difference in earning between  men and women comes down to choices made regarding careers and  parenting. Many working women take advantage of flexible work schedules  to meet their diverse needs. A survey by Pew found 70 percent of  working mothers say that a flexible schedule is extremely important.   Democrats aren't giving the full story when they talk about pay  differences. Women are making career choices that are best for  themselves and their families. Limiting their freedom to do so is  wrong. Congress has no place in telling women their career choices are  wrong, yet Democrats are hellbent on telling all Americans how to live  their lives, how to spend their money, and now how to make career  decisions.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is not a win for women in the slightest. It  is a false promise that creates opportunities and advantages only for  trial lawyers looking for easy payouts while causing irreparable harm  to employers. By making it much easier to bring lawsuits of  questionable validity against employers, trial lawyers will be able to  force employers into settlements or try for unlimited paydays from jury  awards, lining their own pockets and dragging women through tedious,  never-ending legal proceedings.   In the United States, we believe in innocence until proven guilty,  but this bill assumes otherwise. Under current law, business owners can  defend themselves from a claim of pay discrimination by proving that a  pay differential is based on legitimate, business-related factors other  than sex.   H.R. 7 would radically alter this law, requiring a business owner to  convince a judge or jury that the pay differential was required by  ``business necessity.'' This is a nearly impossible burden of proof to  meet that will lead to unfair judgments against business owners because  the plain meaning of the term ``business necessity'' is that the pay  differential must be absolutely essential to the business.   H.R. 7 would also result in a flood of litigation in front of judges  and juries, who will delve into employer compensation decisions even  when the employer can demonstrate that those decisions are based on  legitimate, business-related reasons having nothing to do with the sex  of the employee.   Fearing Big Government and liability risks that could leave them  bankrupt, many business owners will likely implement rigid pay bands--a  model used by government and unionized businesses. This means workers  will not be compensated on the basis of merit.   This is the opposite of the American Dream. As one columnist wrote:  ``equality of opportunity--not outcomes--is the American ideal.''   On top of the legal jeopardy this bill creates for employers, H.R. 7  also mandates that business owners submit mountains of worker pay data  to the Federal Government. This will pose significant threats to the  confidentiality and privacy of workers' pay data, create a data stash  that would be impossible to protect or interpret, and cost business  owners more than $600 million annually.   This bill purports to champion equality for women, yet it disregards  the 40 percent of small businesses owned by women that will be forced  to implement pay policies found in government-run workplaces and be  stuck paying through the nose in compliance costs if this bill passes.   Even worse, H.R. 7 will severely limit workplace flexibility for  women. Many working women take advantage of flexible work schedules to  meet their diverse needs, yet this harmful legislation completely  ignores this reality and threatens to take away the choices and freedom  necessary for them to retain employment.   We know employees prefer workable and flexible schedules, and now is  not the time to limit these options for women who have been hit  particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.   Should my Democrat colleagues wish to discuss additional policies  which will foster the advancement of women in the workplace, we can  consider legislation that safely reopens our schools and businesses,  provides the flexibility and support to expand work-based learning  programs and create viable pathways that enable more individuals to  reskill and build fulfilling careers on their own terms, and promotes  career and technical education, to name a few.   Unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues would rather impose radical  [[Page H1803]]  and unworkable policy under the guise of progress than find bipartisan  solutions which foster environments where individuals are empowered to  succeed and make the decisions that are best for them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 7, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, proponents of H.R. 7 claim that despite current  prohibitions against pay discrimination, female workers are still paid,  on average, considerably less than male workers and, as a result, a  pernicious wage gap exists. However, many studies demonstrate that the  gap is not necessarily the product of workplace discrimination.   In fact, this gap nearly disappears when factors such as hours worked  per week, rate of leaving the workforce, and industry and occupation  are considered.   A 2020 study by compensation software company PayScale found that  when controlling for job title, years of experience, industry,  location, and other compensable factors, women earned 98 percent as  much as men.   A 2009 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor found a  gender wage gap of between 4.8 and 7.1 percent when controlling for  economic variables between men and women.   A 2018 Harvard study found that the gap in pay between female and  male bus and train operators working for the Massachusetts Bay  Transportation Authority, MBTA, can be explained by the workplace  choices that women and men make rather than other factors, such as  discrimination. The study found that the earnings gap for MBTA bus and  train operators is explained by the fact that the male operators took  48 percent fewer unpaid hours off and worked 83 percent more overtime  hours per year than the female operators.   I want to point out that I am giving you facts here, Mr. Speaker,  facts.   These differences are not due to any different work options faced by  female and male operators. Rather, the study found that the female  operators had a greater demand for workplace flexibility and a lower  demand for overtime work hours than the male operators.   Pay discrimination is wrong and already illegal. We probably cannot  say that enough. Any new legislation to combat pay discrimination  should be based on facts, not supposition, not projection. The facts  seem to be sorely missing from this debate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7 requires that the employer defense must be  consistent with ``business necessity,'' a broad and ill-defined term.   We don't know how the courts will interpret this sweeping  requirement, but we do know the dictionary says it means ``absolutely  essential'' or ``indispensable.''   How can an employer prove that any one factor determining employee  pay could rise to the level to be necessary for the survival of the  business?   Proponents of H.R. 7 will argue this phrase has been adopted from  title VII, as amended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act, but the phrase has  spawned endless litigation because of its lack of clarity. Anyone who  thinks this concept is simple and can just be carried over from title  VII is either naive or has been misled.   Further, the dubious concept of business necessity was developed  under controversial so-called disparate impact analysis and cannot  simply be slapped onto the Equal Pay Act, especially where, as mandated  by H.R. 7, damages are unlimited. In contrast, under title VII, in  disparate impact cases, damages are limited to backpay and benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Another provision in H.R. 7 requires that, in addition to proving  business necessity, an employer must prove the business necessity  accounts for 100 percent of the differential in compensation at issue.  This is impossible to do. How can an employer explain slight  differences in compensation based on educational level, experience, or  quality of work on the job?   This bill is going to make it impossible for employers to pay  differentially on merit for anything. It is a bad bill, and we should  not be passing it.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7 would create impossible conditions in which to  operate for businessowners large and small. It would result in endless  litigation in front of judges and juries, who will delve into employer  compensation decisions even when there has been a showing that those  decisions are not based on sex.   Alternatively, businessowners will simply decide not to risk  liability of unlimited damages, which could bankrupt them, and the end  result will be the use of pay bands by employers, which imposes a  government civil service model on the private sector that will result  in everyone in the workplace being compensated equally without regard  to merit.   This is a very broad goal of liberals in general: Pay everybody the  same and stifle innovation, stifle initiative, stifle anybody being  different.   This is the wrong thing for our country. That is not the way the  United States of America operates. We value innovation, we value  entrepreneurism, we value independent thinking. We don't want to crush  everybody into thinking the same way. That is the way civil service  works. That is the way the unions work. That is not the way it should  be in private industry, which has made this country great.   This bill stalls upward mobility. It hurts all employees striving to  succeed on the job, who want to be rewarded for their efforts.   For these reasons and others, H.R. 7's provisions are unworkable and  will benefit only trial lawyers, not innovative, hardworking workers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the majority leader for his compliments of me. When Howard  Coble first introduced me to the Republican Conference here he said, I  was ``a feisty mountain woman from the Blue Ridge, who goes bear  hunting with a switch.'' And so I have cherished that description of me  over the years. I am a feisty woman because I grew up extraordinarily  poor.   And the majority leader is correct, I would not tolerate  discrimination against me. I won't tolerate discrimination against  anyone. I abhor discrimination. I am also an Italian American. I abhor  that kind of discrimination and have fought against that. I fought  against racial discrimination. I doubt there are many people in this  body that fought more against discrimination against women than I have  or mentored more women than I have.   However, the majority leader also said something that made me think  of the phrase, ``all things being equal.'' Well, rarely are all things  equal. Obviously, when all things are equal, we want no discrimination,  everybody to be treated the same. That is what I want.   I have one child, a daughter. I have two grandchildren, a grandson  and a granddaughter. I certainly don't want either one of them  discriminated against on the basis of anything.   But, I say to Mr. Hoyer, yes, 82 cents has been disputed. We hear the  same old tired ``statistics.'' They are not accurate. So let's stop  doing that. Let's deal with the facts.   H.R. 7 is not the answer to discrimination. It is going to make it  more difficult for employers to create jobs and to pay women and  everybody equally. We need alternatives and we have one.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have never said everything is perfectly  okay. I said this bill is not the answer to what issues may still exist  out there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Miller-Meeks), and applaud her for how she has handled herself in the  past few months through all the turmoil and all of the challenges she  has had.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Women,  in terms of employment and pay, have made great strides in this  country. When I was graduating from high school, basically there were  three open professions for women: nursing, teaching, and being a  secretary. We have come a long way. We have also come a long way in  terms of wages.   Do we have ways to go in this country in terms of the way everybody  thinks about people who are different from them? We certainly do.  Republicans and Democrats both agree that pay discrimination is  repugnant and illegal. I will say it again and again. It is repugnant  and illegal.   Despite misguided claims from the other side, this underlying  principle is not up for debate. Women should not be paid less than men  for equal work.   However, Republicans are not in the business of passing radical and  prescriptive bills just to get flashy headlines and score cheap  political points.   We are equally committed to promoting both fairness and strong  policymaking, and when judged by these standards, today's bill falls  woefully short. Pay discrimination is illegal.   You know, we have really heard nothing about the inadequacies of the  current law or the current processes. What we have heard is that we  need new legislation. Republicans disagree with that. Again, we want  pay discrimination to be illegal and we want any such cases to be  treated seriously and to be looked at. This bill offers no new  protection against pay discrimination in the workplace, however. And  that is sorely lacking in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7 is nothing more than a trial lawyer payout at the  expense of hardworking women. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in opposition to the en bloc amendments.   Madam Speaker, in America, discriminating in pay based on sex is  illegal, as codified in the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act.   Democrats claim H.R. 7 will improve upon these bipartisan laws to  create new opportunities for women to fight pay discrimination. What  H.R. 7 actually does is create new opportunities for trial lawyers to  earn higher paychecks while offering no new protections for pay  discrimination in the workplace.   Unfortunately, I cannot support any of the Democrat amendments to  H.R. 7 because none of them addresses the numerous unworkable and  onerous provisions in the bill.   I appreciate that Representative Beyer's amendment recognizes the  very serious problems with H.R. 7 by attempting to place a fig leaf on  the expansive government data collection mandate in the bill. However,  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, is still required to  implement the draconian data collection scheme in the underlying bill,  which is still extremely misguided, expensive, and unnecessary.   H.R. 7 requires business owners to submit reams of pay data to the  EEOC disaggregated by job category, race, sex, and ethnicity. Moreover,  the collection mandate also includes other employment-related data,  including hiring, termination, and promotion data, which even the  discredited 2016 Obama administration pay data collection scheme did  not include.   The data collection mandate in H.R. 7 raises several concerns.   First, it puts at risk volumes of highly confidential pay data  involving millions of individual workers. We all know of the widespread  data breaches the Federal Government has suffered.   Second, EEOC will not be able to manage or properly use this data. It  has never been explained what exactly the EEOC will do with this data.  Madam Speaker, data is not the same as information.   Third, this mandate is overly burdensome. Under the Obama  administration scheme, the data cells required from business owners  when they file an Employer Information Report, EEO-1, with EEOC  expanded 180 cells to 3,660. Let me say that again: from 180 cells to  3,660. H.R. 7's scheme will add on hundreds, if not thousands, of more  data cells.   EEOC has estimated that with the new reams of pay data added, the  collection will cost business owners more than $600 million annually. I  doubt that is going to help one single woman in this country.   Although this amendment purports to give EEOC more discretion to  implement the pay data collection, this data collection mandate should  simply be removed from the bill.   In any event, discretion cuts both ways, and the Democrat-controlled  EEOC may choose to implement a data collection scheme even more  expansive.   Let me be clear that the Beyer amendment does not improve the  draconian pay data collection mandate in  [[Page H1821]]  the underlying bill or the other serious flaws in other sections of  H.R. 7 we have talked about today.   Representative Newman's amendment takes a longstanding reasonable  requirement and makes it disruptive and unworkable.   First, the amendment requires a workplace notice posting of a  partisan special-interest bill which fails to address pay  discrimination in the workplace.   Second, under current law, covered employers must post a notice of  the equal employment opportunity rights in a conspicuous place at the  workplace. Employees who telecommute or otherwise do not have access to  the physical notice must be provided an electronic version. Under  Representative Newman's amendment, the employer must post electronic  copies of a new notice on an internal website to which employees have  access. This is unrealistic. H.R. 7 applies to millions of small  businesses that do not have websites, much less internal websites for  their employees.   In keep with the other impractical provisions in H.R. 7, the  amendment adds another onerous requirement on small businesses that  will be stuck with the bill.   Representative Ocasio-Cortez' amendment would create a new program  for the Department of Labor to--I hate to say this word--``train''  employers regarding bias in negotiation and other wage-setting  practices. The amendment includes a non-exhaustive list of 13 wage- setting practices on which employers allegedly need education.  Employers may understandably review this list as 13 new ways for trial  lawyers to allege violations of the Equal Pay Act.   I will compliment one aspect of Representative Ocasio-Cortez'  amendment. It mentions compensation self-audits. Republicans agree that  self-audits can be a useful tool in combating pay discrimination, and  we urge support for the Republican substitute amendment which  encourages employers to conduct self-evaluations to identify  potentially unlawful pay differences and to take steps to rectify any  unlawful pay practices. Unfortunately, H.R. 7 does not encourage these  self-evaluations.    Representative Williams' amendment reestablishes the Obama-era  National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. This amendment would  establish another politically biased government bureaucracy that  includes agencies such as the EEOC and the Department of Labor already  tasked with enforcing laws against pay discrimination and ensuring  compliance with those laws.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I support equal pay for equal work. I don't  know how many times Republicans have to say that, but we will keep  saying it if necessary because equal pay for equal work is the right  thing to do, but it is also required under two Federal statutes, and in  most cases it is being adhered to.   Congress should focus on policies that will continue to increase  economic opportunity and expand options for all workers. That is what  we should be doing in the Education and Labor Committee: looking for  ways to increase economic opportunity and expand options for all  workers.   We shouldn't be doing away with pipeline jobs, we shouldn't be  raising taxes, and we shouldn't be decreasing options for people to  work in this country; but that is what this administration is doing,  and that is what the other side is doing.   The Democrat amendments and the underlying bill fail miserably in  terms of increasing options and expanding economic opportunity. It is  pushing people into the bands, making everybody the same and treating  everybody as though they have no individuality, they shouldn't be  innovative, they shouldn't be creative, and they shouldn't strive for  more. That is not the way to go.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Democrat en bloc  amendment and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment, which was also  introduced earlier this week by Representative Stefanik as a standalone  bill, H.R. 2491, the Wage Equity Act of 2021.   Unlike the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act, which will unfairly  punish businessowners and reward trial lawyers at the expense of  workers, this amendment will effectively address pay discrimination in  the workplace and help working women by ensuring pay differences among  workers of the opposite sex are due to legitimate business-related  reasons.   Among other commonsense provisions, this amendment will direct funds  and research towards women's advancement in the workplace and will also  authorize a grant program to educate women in college careers and  technical programs on negotiating pay.   This amendment will also allow job applicants to disclose prior  salary history voluntarily, ensuring they control this information as  they see fit.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
