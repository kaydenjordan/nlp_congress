 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  thank him for the leadership role he played in making America healthier  in the original passage of the Affordable Care Act and protecting it  from the constant sabotage that the Republicans in the Congress and in  the White  [[Page H2961]]  House have exacted on the Affordable Care Act.   I want to pay special tribute to the outside groups, the patient  advocacy groups, the Little Lobbyists, the children, so many people who  spoke and told their stories at 10,000 events across the country to  oppose the Republicans' constant assault on the Affordable Care Act for  the first 2 years of the Trump administration, a time when the  President had the White House, the House, and the Senate and could very  well have passed legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, as  they said they would do.                                time  1430    They didn't replace it because they don't believe in a government  role. Much about the Affordable Care Act has to do with Medicare and  how we prolonged the life of Medicare and adjusted funding so that we  could reduce the cost of prescription drugs for our seniors.   The Republican approach to Medicare is that it should wither on the  vine, that there is no place in a free society, in a free economy, for  Medicare.   Let's understand this. This is not just about the issue or the  legislation of the Affordable Care Act. This is about a value system in  our country, about understanding that healthcare is a right for all  Americans, not just a privilege.   Yes, they could get preexisting conditions coverage--with rates that  go right through the ceiling and are a gift to the insurance industry,  but not to make care affordable and accessible to all.   So, here we are, in an unusual situation where the Affordable Care  Act is the law of the land, and it is the responsibility of the Justice  Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in  court, and what are they doing? Just the opposite. Why? Because they  don't believe in governance.   That is why they are happy to shut down government for any reason.  They don't believe in governance. They don't believe in a public role  in the well-being of the American people. They don't believe in the  Affordable Care Act.   What they are trying to do is strike down every last provision of the  ACA: protection for preexisting conditions, which I will come back to;  bans of lifetime and annual limits; the Medicaid expansion; Medicare  solvency going out for many more years; savings for seniors on  prescription drug costs; and the vital premium assistance that makes  healthcare coverage affordable for millions of families. It all would  be ended if the President and the Republicans in Congress get their  way. I hope it is not all Republicans in Congress, because I hope that  some of them will care enough about their constituents and meeting  their needs.   On the subject of preexisting conditions, how many times during  campaigns did they say, ``Oh, we are for preexisting conditions,''  having voted it down over and over and over again?   The misrepresentations were almost embarrassing. Let's look the other  way, so we don't embarrass them any further. It is almost a joke, but  it is not funny if you have a preexisting condition.   What was interesting about the Affordable Care Act is it wasn't just  about expanding coverage to 20 million more people. That, in itself,  would be a justification. It was about the more than 150 million  families who had better coverage, on a trajectory of lower cost, better  benefits, no preexisting condition barrier, no lifetime limits, no  annual limits, and the rest. And if your child is up to 26 years old,  your child could be on your policy.   Actually, the issue of subsidizing those so that everyone could  participate and it would be affordable, can we do more there? We  certainly can, and we certainly will.   I want to tell this story. As I said, the outside groups were so  instrumental in saving us from the Republican sabotage of the  Affordable Care Act and of the good health of the American people. The  outside groups held, as I said, 10,000 events around the country,  telling stories. Nothing conveys more information and more  understanding than people telling their own stories.   The statistics are interesting. They are staggering. But the stories  are powerful, and they make a difference.   I am going to tell the story that I have told before. It is about  America's families paying the price and America's children paying the  price for this Republican sabotage of the Affordable Care Act.   The story I would like to tell is about Zoe Madison Lihn. Zoe was  born with a congenital heart defect in May 2010. She faced the first of  her three heart surgeries at just 15 hours old.   By 6 months old, Zoe was halfway through the lifetime limit that her  insurer had placed on her case. She faced a grim future, not just using  up her lifetime limit by preschool--her lifetime limit was used up, but  her preexisting condition had not gone away--but carrying the  preexisting condition that would require attention and care for the  rest of her life.   Under the ACA, Zoe is protected. She will celebrate her 9th birthday  next month.   But the Republicans want to take all that away, not only from Zoe but  from their own constituents.   Our Democratic House majority will not let that stand. Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr., said: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in  healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane because it often results  in physical death.''   Our colleagues are used to our colleague, Whip Clyburn, telling that  story, which I think he heard Dr. King say.   On day one of this Congress, freshman Member from Texas Congressman  Colin Allred led the way. House Democrats voted to throw the full legal  weight of the House against the Texas lawsuit to destroy the ACA.   We salute Congressman Allred for his outstanding leadership to  protect America's families' health and to reach out to the Republicans  to join him in doing so. But more than 190 Republicans voted to be  fully complicit in that attempt to overthrow the ACA and tear away  those health protections.   Now, with this resolution led again by Congressman Allred, we call on  our Republican colleagues to go on the record once more. Either they  will vote for protecting their constituents' healthcare, or they will  vote for taking it away. With this vote, we will see their values and  their intentions.   House Democrats will always fight to protect families' affordable and  quality healthcare. We don't see it as an issue or legislation. We see  it as a value--a value. It is not just about healthcare. It is about  the good health of America, a source of our strength.    After we pass this resolution, we will continue to advance our  transformative legislation to reverse the GOP healthcare sabotage. We  will lower healthcare costs and strengthen protections for people with  preexisting medical conditions.   By the way, under the Affordable Care Act, being a woman is no longer  a preexisting medical condition. As a mother of five, I can attest to  that being a preexisting condition.   Democrats are for the people: lowering healthcare costs by reducing  the costs of prescription drugs, preserving the preexisting condition  benefit, increasing wages by building the infrastructure in a green  way, and cleaning up government. Lower healthcare costs, bigger  paychecks, cleaner government.   Once we can reduce the role of dark, special-interest money in  Washington, D.C., people will have confidence that it is possible that  their voices will be heard more strongly than the voices of those who  stand in the way of progress.   Three months ago from tomorrow, the Members of this institution,  Democrats and Republicans, took a solemn oath to protect and defend the  Constitution of the United States. The Constitution of the United  States, after the beautiful preamble of our Nation's purpose, is  Article I, the legislative branch. The legislative branch's  responsibilities are spelled out in the text of the Constitution.   This body, the first branch of government, voted to protect the  health and well-being of the American people. It is the law of the  land. It is the responsibility of the executive branch to protect the  law of the land.   They have departed from that and, therefore, departed from our oath  to the Constitution to protect and defend.   If they have a better idea, we haven't seen it. On top of that, the  President has said we won't see it until 2021, after the 2020  elections.  [[Page H2962]]    That is just not good enough, Mr. President. The needs of the  American people will not stop right now because you have stopped  believing in them. The needs of the American people go on, and we will  continue this fight. We will fight in the Congress; we will fight in  the courts; and we will fight in the court of public opinion.   I hope that we can have some Republican support from the other side  of the aisle to vote to protect America's families and their healthcare  and, therefore, strengthen America.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
