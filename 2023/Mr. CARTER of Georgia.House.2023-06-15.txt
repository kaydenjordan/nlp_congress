 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  important relationship between two of the largest democracies in the  world, the United States and India.   India and the United States built our relationship on our shared  values for democracy and freedom, but today it is based on so much  more. We support India and its emergence as a leading economic power  and as a vital partner in promoting peace and prosperity for all.   India has grown exponentially in the 21st century, quickly becoming  home to one of the fastest growing economies in the world and leading  innovation in the fields of information technology, communications, and  agriculture. Consequently, India was named the 2023 president of G20  where they have and will continue to work to address major issues in  the global economy.   Recently, through the U.N., India has declared 2023 the International  Year of Millets, taking a strong approach on the promotion of important  issues such as food security and global health.   The Indian community in Georgia's First Congressional District will  always have my support in generating good will between our two vibrant  democracies.   I extend my best wishes to Prime Minister Modi, and I look forward to  seeing what the future holds for the United States and India.                            ____________________
