 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during  national Teacher Appreciation Week to celebrate America's hardworking,  dedicated, and passionate teachers.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure every Member of this House can think of a  teacher who had a positive influence on not only their education, but  their life. Teachers push students to achieve their best, and they show  students how to realize their full potential. Sometimes it is the  interest of just one teacher that can transform the life of a young  person.   Teachers are often the most underrated, yet powerful professionals in  the entire world. They truly do shape young minds and our future.   Teachers lend a caring hand and extend a loving heart. They make  differences in the lives of our students academically, emotionally, and  physically.   So, Mr. Speaker, during national Teacher Appreciation Week, I rise to  say ``thank you'' to those who educate our children. Thank you for the  job you do, for the hours you work, for the patience you show, and for  the impact  [[Page H3844]]  you have on so many lives. Day in and day out, our teachers are there.  We are grateful to them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that my name be removed as a cosponsor of H. Res. 774.
