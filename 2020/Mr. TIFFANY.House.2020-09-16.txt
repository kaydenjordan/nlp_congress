 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  yielding some time to me here this afternoon.   First, we are setting up a picture here on the easel to the right of  me. And what you see there are not the wildfires in California. What  you see is a picture from my district in western Wisconsin of  Minneapolis at the end of May as the city was burning.   Organized anarchist groups like Antifa have been engaging in  systematic criminal activity including assaults, widespread property  damage and destruction, repeated looting, and attacks on law  enforcement and others.   They have turned parts of Kenosha, Madison, and Milwaukee in my  State, as well as neighborhoods just over the border in Minnesota, into  post-apocalyptic hellscapes.   And if I can take just a minute. Growing up in western Wisconsin, I  will never forget, it was always a treat to go into the Twin Cities of  Saint Paul and Minneapolis. And in the Midwest, Minneapolis and Saint  Paul were always known as the best of the big cities to live in. They  can no longer say that after what has happened here in 2020.   These are not mostly peaceful protests, and Antifa is not a myth.  These are orchestrated assaults on civil society and the American way  of life designed to spread terror and chaos, to destroy businesses, and  to shake the very foundations of our country.   First, it was Minneapolis and Atlanta, then Portland and Seattle,  then Milwaukee, Madison and even Kenosha. Tomorrow it could be your  community.   So let's talk about those cities here in Wisconsin.   Madison: In June, a violent mob vandalized the State capitol and  other State buildings, shattering windows, hurling Molotov cocktails  and destroying historic monuments. In fact, it was  [[Page H4480]]  very fortunate that the Molotov cocktail that went into the county  building just off from the State capitol did not lead to a loss of  life.   They attacked a statue of Hans Christian Heg, a statue that I was  just walking past a few months ago as a State legislator in Wisconsin.  He was a Civil War veteran, immigrant, abolitionist who fell at  Chickamauga fighting to end slavery and preserve the Union. Yes, they  tore it down. His nearly 100-year-old sculpture was decapitated and  thrown into a lake by rioters.   The mob also tore down the statue of Lady Forward, a monument that is  emblematic of Wisconsin being the first State to ratify the women's  suffrage movement. The original Lady Forward statue was first placed in  front of the Wisconsin State Capitol in 1895.   And for my friends on the other side of the aisle, whether you are a  Republican or Democrat, if you don't think they are going to come for  you at some point, go ask my former colleague Democrat State Senator  Tim Carpenter, who was beaten by rioters during that unrest and needed  surgery to recover. He told the media, ``I don't know what happened . .  . all I did was stop and take a picture . . . and the next thing I'm  getting five-six punches, getting kicked in the head.'' That is a  Democratic State senator.   Roving bands of thugs looking to intimidate residents torched and  looted State Street. The State Street riots proceeded when they tore  down the statues around the beautiful State capitol in Madison,  Wisconsin.   But let's talk about Bernell Trammell. In July, Mr. Trammell, an  activist known for carrying handmade signs supporting President Trump,  was gunned down in broad daylight in Milwaukee. To date, no arrests  have been made.   Mr. Trammell is an African American. And, in fact, I am quite sure he  supported an African American former state senator that I used to work  with.   There is growing public concern that the violence and lawlessness  that has plagued Milwaukee for months has rendered local officials  either unwilling or unable to thoroughly investigate his murder and  bring those responsible for his death to justice. And that includes the  top law enforcement official in Wisconsin. We are hearing nothing from  him in regard to Bernell Trammell.   The failure of local officials to apprehend any suspects a month  after this brutal crime was committed sets a dangerous precedent, one  that could encourage more politically motivated killings and undermine  the civil rights protections afforded to all Americans.   I have asked Attorney General Barr and the U.S. Attorney to initiate  a civil rights investigation into his killing as they did into the  shooting of Jacob Blake.   Kenosha: During the Kenosha riots, at least 56 businesses were  severely damaged or destroyed racking up a $50 million price tag. Thank  you, President Trump, for coming to Kenosha and offering your  assistance.   The destruction has left business owners devastated and wondering  whether they will have the money to rebuild and stay in the  neighborhood.   The Uptown neighborhood, home to a majority of minority-owned  businesses, was among those hardest hit. One news report described the  plight of one local business owner:         Inside La Estrella Supermarket, owner Abel Alejo surveyed       the water and smoke damage his shop suffered. Carpeting in a       hallway was spongy with water as he surveyed packages of       spoiling food that needed clearing out last week. A few       pinatas still hung overhead from an intact part of the       otherwise broken ceiling in the closed store.    Wauwatosa: According to police, a mob targeted the home of a  Wauwatosa policeman, vandalizing his home, physically assaulting him,  then firing a shotgun through his back door.   A Democrat state representative participated in the unrest and  actually accused the officer, who lives in the home with his girlfriend  and two children, of aggressively provoking the confrontation by  ``choosing to come out of his home.''   So I think about my district. I was talking to the mayor a short week  after I was sworn in on May 19, when the riots were happening in  Minneapolis, and he was wondering, along with lots of other citizens in  St. Croix and Polk Counties on the western edge of Wisconsin, are the  riots of Minneapolis going to come to our community? We can only hope  that that does not happen here as we close out 2020.
