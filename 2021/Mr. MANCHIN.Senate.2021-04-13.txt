 Mr. President, I rise today to honor longtime Kanawha  County Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman upon his retirement after more than 32  remarkable years of service to the 13th Judicial Circuit.   I have often said there is no greater accomplishment than to find  yourself in a position to give back to the community you love. As a  Charleston native, Judge Kaufman has served the people of Kanawha  County with professionalism, fairmindedness, and great respect from the  day he took office in 1988.   Following his undergraduate education, he worked as a paralegal in  the Washington, DC, law firm of Covington & Burling and received a law  degree from West Virginia University College of Law in 1980. He served  a clerkship on the U.S. Tax Court during law school before joining his  late father's Charleston law firm of Kaufman & Ratliff in 1980. Prior  to his appointment as judge, he served as my colleague in the State  legislature and was appointed to the State senate in 1982 by then- Governor Jay Rockefeller and was elected in 1984. Judge Kaufman's  lectured internationally at prestigious law schools and conferences and  is a former member of the Mass Litigation Panel of the West Virginia  Supreme Court and past president and executive officer of the West  Virginia Judicial Association.   Shortly after graduating law school, Judge Kaufman tragically lost  his parents, former Senator and World War II veteran Paul Kaufman and  Rose, and brother, Steven, in a car accident. I know their unfailing  love and influence had a tremendous impact on the person he was to  become. Both of his parents were extremely active in their community  and passionate about many social issues. I will always be personally  grateful to them that they passed their work ethic and compassion on to  Judge Kaufman, because he has done so much good in our home State due  to their influence. In 2011, the 35th Street Bridge over the Kanawha  River between the East End and Kanawha City was renamed in their honor,  and I am certain they would be so very proud of Judge Kaufman's legacy  and personal values.   Throughout the years, Judge Kaufman has witnessed the drastic changes  in the judicial landscape. Technology in the courts has played a  crucial role, especially with current events as they are, but Judge  Kaufman has always promoted the value of interpersonal communication  and protecting the humanism in our court processes. He has been  fiercely protective of the interests of the people in front of him in  the courtroom, acknowledging the heavy responsibility of representing  the justice system. He and I served in the State senate together, and  in the many years I have called him a friend, Judge Kaufman has never  taken his position lightly and has always seen himself primarily as a  servant of the people of Kanawha County and of West Virginia. His view  of the law is something I will always admire, and I know it has also  inspired countless young judges and lawyers.   I will always be grateful to Judge Kaufman for his years of  friendship and our shared passion for serving the people of West  Virginia. While he is retiring and everyone is sure to miss his strong  leadership, Judge Kaufman's unwavering dedication will leave a lasting  legacy with the countless lives he has touched. Again, I congratulate  him for his remarkable years of service, and I am honored to wish good  health and much happiness to Judge Kaufman, his wife Barrie, and their  daughters, Paula, Caroline, and Sophia, in the days and years ahead.                            ____________________
