 Mr. President, I wish to initially speak about the  bipartisan Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act, but first I suggest  the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act. I will start my remarks by  saying that Chairman Isakson was here earlier, and he had a meeting he  had to get to. Johnny has been through a tough surgery, and it is good  to have Johnny back. But the fact of the matter is he supports this  bill. He is an original cosponsor of this bill. The same could be said  of Senator Blumenthal, who also had a meeting and wanted to be here,  once again. We heard from Senator Schatz earlier. This bill truly has  bipartisan support, not only in the VA Committee but also in this body.   The reason people support this piece of legislation is because it  brings much needed reforms to the Choice Program while ensuring that  veterans can access care in their communities. It is a good bill.   A few years back, the Choice Program was established with the very  best of intentions. In my home State of Montana, it is a fact that  veterans were waiting far too long for an appointment at the VA and  oftentimes had to drive over 100 miles for the appointment. The Choice  Program was supposed to allow these veterans to access care closer to  home. Unfortunately, it has not been working out the way it should, and  veterans have been inundated with redtape and a government contractor  that struggles to schedule appointments and pay providers on time. That  is why we all worked together--Democrats and Republicans and even  Independents--on this bill to put forth these much needed reforms.   The Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act cuts redtape so veterans  can access care more quickly. In fact, I made it clear from the get-go  that I would not vote to extend the Choice Program until Congress and  the VA have addressed some of the biggest concerns I have been hearing  from Montana veterans and community providers.   Once we get the bill passed, this program reimburses community  providers more quickly for the care they provide to our veterans. It  reduces out-of-pocket costs for veterans receiving care through the  Choice Program. It improves the sharing of medical records between the  VA and the community providers to better ensure seamless care for  veterans, whether they are seeing a VA doctor or a doctor in their  community. It allows the VA to access all the funding initially  appropriated for this program to ensure that veterans' access to care  is not disrupted.    This bill is not going to fix everything, but it is certainly a step  in the right direction. With this legislation, combined with assurances  that I have received from VA Montana, VA folks within the State will be  allowed to schedule appointments for Montana's veterans directly  instead of going through an inept government contract.   It is my hope that we can make the Choice Program work the way it was  [[Page S2142]]  intended when we first set it up, with the goal of serving those who  have served our country.   I again express my appreciation for taking this bill up on the floor,  this Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act, and I think it is a prime  example of how this body needs to work together to solve problems--in  this case, for our veterans community. We should push this bill out as  soon as possible.   I yield the floor to Senator Moran.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.    Mr. President, I would like to thank the good Senator  from Kansas for his comments and his leadership not only on the VA  Committee on which we both serve but also as chairman of the  Appropriations MILCON-VA Subcommittee, the subcommittee that really  sees how the money is going to be utilized within the VA. I think  Senator Moran has covered just about all of it. I just want to go back  and say one thing.   We are going to have a unanimous consent. I am told there will be an  objection to it. That is truly unfortunate because this has been a  bipartisan effort. It has cleared everyone in the Senate except one  person, to my knowledge, and I think that is unfortunate.   One of the complaints I hear is that the primary payer provision of  this bill is the problem. The primary payer provision of this bill  requires the VA to be exactly that--the primary payer of the bills. My  question would be, Why is this a bad thing? Right now veterans are  being hamstrung and delayed, and the folks who provide the benefits,  the providers, are not getting the dollars in a timely manner. I would  just ask, if the VA is not going to be the primary payer, who is?   These folks have put it on the line for this country, and they come  back in different shape than when they left, after they bore the  battles of war. Some of the injuries are seen; some of the injuries are  unseen. And we are not going to say ``You know what. Don't worry about  it. We are going to make sure you get the care, and we are going to  make sure it is paid for''? It is part of the cost of war. So when we  send our young men and women off to war, we ought to be thinking about  this stuff. And we have a solution. We have a solution to part of the  problems with the Choice Program.   If we get this bill passed, it will give us the opportunity to work  together to get a long-term bill passed before the first of the year to  really address the needs of our veterans so that there are wraparound  services at the VA that veterans can count on.   I would just say that this is supposed to be a very deliberative  body, and for the most part, it is pretty deliberative. But when you  have a situation of a program that we put into effect--that Congress  passed and the Senate had a big part of writing--and it is not working,  we ought to fix it, and this bill fixes it in good part. We have some  more to do, as I said, but this bill is a step in the right direction  in cutting redtape and making it easier for veterans to find care and  get care, whether it is in the VA or outside the VA. It  [[Page S2143]]  is also something that the Veterans Administration sorely needs to move  it forward.   I just want to say that we come in here and we have good arguments  and good discussions, and sometimes politics comes into the discussion.  In this particular case, folks have come to the table--whether it is  Senator Isakson or Senator McCain or Senator Moran or me or any of the  others on the Veterans' Affairs Committee--and we have come up with a  solution that 99 percent of the people in this body agree with, but we  can't get it across the finish line. And we wonder why our popularity  is in the single digits in this country.   I am just going to close by saying I want to thank everybody from  both sides of the aisle who worked together to get this bill crafted  and get this bill to this point. I hope that at some point in time,  people will take a look at this bill for what it does and realize that  there aren't bogeymen in this bill, that our veterans deserve us to  work together to find solutions to move the ball forward so they can  get the healthcare they were promised when they signed on the dotted  line to protect this country.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I was going to ask for unanimous consent  that S. 544, the bill we have been talking about, be discharged for  immediate consideration, and then someone would have to object to that  unanimous consent request--otherwise it would move forward.   I am going to do this on Monday. I hope the Senator who is truly  going to object to this will have the opportunity to talk to Secretary  Shulkin and Chairman Isakson, and he will find out that both those  people are in support of this bill.   Hopefully we can come in and do a unanimous consent and get this bill  passed on Monday. This is a bill that is good for America's veterans. I  think it is good for our community providers, and I think it is very  good for the VA. We will hold off today and take care of this after the  weekend.   I would like to once again thank all the folks who worked on this  bill. A special thank-you to Senator Moran for his statements today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
