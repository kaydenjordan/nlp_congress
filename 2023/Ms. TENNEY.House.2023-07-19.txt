 Mr. Chair, Americans do not expect to take their life  into their own hands when they board a regional flight. They expect to  be safe no matter where they travel in the air.  [[Page H3816]]    Since the 1,500-hour flight requirement was passed in response to the  tragic 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash in Clarence, New York, the  success of the policy speaks for itself.   American airspace is among the safest in the world, with a 99.8  percent reduction in passenger airline accident fatalities since 2010.  This is why most pilot groups oppose any dilution of the flight-hour  requirement.   It is vital that our pilots have full competence in the high-stakes  environment of a cockpit in flight. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on Langworthy amendment No. 5 and stand with the flying public  and the Colgan Air Flight families.
