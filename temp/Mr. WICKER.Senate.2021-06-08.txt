 Mr. President, I certainly rise in support of this  legislation and urge a ``yes'' vote. This is an opportunity for the  United States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair  competition that we are seeing from Communist China, and it is an  opportunity to have a game changer in terms of geographic diversity in  our research effort.   This morning, the Armed Services Committee heard extensive testimony  about the need to compete with China at the military level. This is an  opportunity to compete with China at the research level. This bill will  strengthen our country's innovation in key technology fields of the  future--in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum  computing, and communications.   And this bill also is a game changer in terms of giving universities  all over the United States an opportunity to participate in game- changing research, which will help us compete. Universities, largely in  smaller States such as mine, have been left behind in the past. They  will finally, under this legislation, have an opportunity to  participate in research at a meaningful level--so two good reasons to  vote yes.   The distinguished chair of the committee has been gracious in  thanking all of our staffs on the majority and the minority side. I  appreciate her doing that, as well as Senator Cantwell's admirable job  of managing this bill through the committee.   I congratulate the two authors of this bill, Senator Schumer and  Senator  [[Page S3979]]  Young, who sponsored this legislation. This bill is headed toward  passage with a fine bipartisan vote, and I am pleased to support  passage.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, today, the Senate passed the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act--USICA--legislation which would  establish a new Technology and Innovation Directorate at the National  Science Foundation. Section 2005 of USICA would define 10 initial key  technology focus areas to direct research at the new Directorate and  the Department of Energy. One of these areas is advanced energy  technology. I want to put in the record that Congress has previously  enacted legislation defining advanced energy technology in 42 USC  18632, and that definition should apply here.                            ____________________
