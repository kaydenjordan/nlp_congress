 Mr. President, listening to my friend, the Democratic  leader, leads me to conclude that he and his party have given up on the  American dream. They want to settle for the status quo, which is  stagnant growth of our economy and jobs where people haven't seen an  increase in their wages for years. They even seem to be rooting for  failure. That seems to be the attitude of our missing-in-action  congressional Democrats on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   We, on the other hand, think American families need more take-home  pay, higher wages, more jobs, and a competitive economy, and we believe  they shouldn't have to settle for less. I will come back to that in a  moment.   I do want to talk about tax reform and make the perhaps obvious  statement that tax reform is hard. That is the reason it hasn't been  done since 1986. It is even harder when we have a political party that  is determined to fight against every single proposal we have made in  our tax cut and tax reform bill, including ones they themselves have  championed in the past.   I have heard the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee,  Senator Wyden, talk about corporate giveaways, and the Democratic  leader just alluded to the same thing. Yet we are embracing the same  sort of approach they took in previous proposals and that President  Obama advocated for in his State of the Union Address in 2011, when he  asked Republicans and Democrats alike to work together to lower the  highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world because he knew  it was chasing jobs overseas, and he knew it was important to bring  that investment and those jobs back to the United States. That is  exactly what our bill does.   My friend Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means  Committee, called tax reform a Rubik's Cube. He is right, but now,  thankfully, we have figured out how to solve that Rubik's Cube.   We confess that this legislation is not perfect, but it is good, and  it is much better than the status quo, which our Democratic colleagues  seem to have settled for. Last week, the conference committee met  between the House and the Senate, and members, including myself, had  many difficult conversations about how to reconcile the differences  between the two bills. Those discussions were necessary, they were  prudent, and they were productive. We now have a consensus about how to  get this bill across the finish line and to the President's desk before  Christmas.   We will vote on this final bill after the House does tomorrow-- hopefully by tomorrow night. Perhaps it will carry over into Wednesday  morning, but we will get it on the President's desk for him to sign  into law before Christmas, as we pledged.   I want to talk for just a few moments about why I am so excited at  the prospect--and so are so many other people across the country-- because oftentimes their words get lost in the chatter, some of which  is designed to mislead and presents an inaccurate picture of just how  consequential this tax reform will be. Their voices--those who believe  this good bill will help them--deserve to be heard.   Let me first talk about manufacturing. There was a survey released  last week that showed historically high optimism among 14,000 small and  large employers in the manufacturing sector. How long have we heard  that we need to bring manufacturing back to the United States rather  than outsourcing it to Mexico or China or other places around the  world? Well, we tried to address that, and I think we met with some  success because more than 94 percent of manufacturers are now positive  about their company's outlook. Nearly 64 percent said that tax reform  would encourage their company to increase capital spending. Capital  spending is what goes into infrastructure, equipment, and things that  allow them to become more productive and to create more jobs. A  majority of these manufacturers said that they would indeed expand  their businesses and they would hire more workers after this bill is  signed into law by the President. In fact, manufacturers predict that  the number of jobs could surge to 2 million by the year 2025. Now there  are roughly 350,000 American manufacturing jobs, so a leap to 2 million  is almost fantastic--hard to contemplate--but very exciting if true.    The second group I want to mention that is very excited about the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act is small businesses. We know small businesses are the  economic engine of the country. Indeed, 70 percent of new jobs are  created not by Fortune 500 company businesses but by small businesses.  As one piece in the Houston Chronicle recently pointed out, the 2.6  million small businesses that call Texas home are enthusiastic because  tax reform will provide them much needed relief.   Small businesses, of course, all have to pay taxes, which is  burdensome enough, but they also have to spend hours and money to  comply with our unnecessarily complex tax laws. According to a 2017  survey by the National Small Business Association, 58 percent of small  businesses reported that the administrative burden of Federal taxes  posed a greater challenge than the cost of the taxes themselves. The  burden of compliance was worse than the check they had to write to the  [[Page S8055]]  Federal Government. The Houston op-ed put the matter succinctly. It  said:         For large corporations that can afford a small army of       lawyers and accountants, the tax laws are a nuisance. For       small businesses, they are a nightmare.    Now that situation will change. Our bill will simplify the Tax Code  by eliminating many special deductions and credits while broadening the  base and bringing down rates.   To those cynics here inside the beltway who roll their eyes, who  think that changes to the business provisions of the code don't matter,  I would point out two more important pieces of news. First, the Federal  Reserve, an independent government institution, recently said that this  tax package is one of the factors that led them to increase their  projections for growth next year. That is welcome, to say the least.  Tax reform, said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, last appointed by  President Obama, will boost spending and could do the same for  productivity. So the Federal Reserve has raised its growth projections  for next year, particularly in response to what we are doing.   For those who worry about deficits--that we are cutting taxes too  much--and who don't believe the economy will grow to compensate for  those cuts in taxes, all they need to do is look at the projection of  the Federal Reserve. They currently project the economy to grow at 2.1  percent, but she said that next year it could go to 2.5 percent. So  even if you believe that very conservative estimate, that is enough  growth to compensate for the cut in taxes and the loss of revenue next  year, but we expect that will continue and will grow over the next 10  years.   It is another thing to note how the rest of the world is reacting to  what we are doing here. To name but one example, China is worried,  which should tell us something. According to a Wall Street Journal  story printed last week, China sees these tax plans as making the  United States a much more attractive place to invest, which means less  investment will occur in China. One official in Beijing has called our  tax plan a huge and imminent danger that can't be ignored. China is  worried that job creators will relocate here in America, which is a  well-founded concern and one of the goals of this tax bill. That is  exactly what they will do when we lower the corporate rate and go to a  territorial system. Rather than taxing these businesses twice and  encouraging them to keep the money they earn and the jobs they create  overseas, we encourage them to bring them back to America by making our  businesses more internationally competitive.   So to summarize what we are seeing already, and we haven't even  passed the bill yet--the conference report, at least--we have passed  the Senate bill, the House bill, and now the conference report, which  is the reconciled version between the House and the Senate versions,  was released Friday.   To summarize what we have seen already, nationally, manufacturers are  raving about the tax plan. In places like Texas, small businesses  desperately need the relief this bill offers. The Federal Reserve, an  independent financial body of the Federal Government, has increased  their growth estimates, in part, based upon the tax relief provided in  this bill. And our chief competitor in the global economy is startled  by what we are doing and afraid of what it might mean in terms of  America's competitiveness globally.   Put all this together and what do you have? A brief snapshot of the  huge economic impact of the tax overhaul that will be signed by the  President in the next few days. Signs of that impact are all around us,  almost everywhere I look.   I know of at least one major airline--Southwest Airlines--that has  already announced big plans as to what they plan to do with their tax  savings. With the benefits afforded by this tax reform, they said that  they will purchase new aircraft. Well, this means more jobs for the  people who build those aircraft. It means more jobs for the pilots and  the flight attendants who travel on them. It means better customer  experiences, and it may even mean lower fares for consumers.   Let's talk about what this bill does for Americans who get up and go  to work every day and just try to eke out a living, providing for their  families. Well, I will tell you, for those worried about how tax reform  will affect real people's actual lives, let me give you a couple of  concrete examples. Let's take a single teacher making $50,000 a year.  She will see a significant reduction in her tax burden--between 17 and  20 percent--less taxes that she will have to pay. This comes from a  lower marginal rate and a higher standard deduction. How about a  married couple with three children and with median earnings of $75,000  a year? Well, their tax bill will decrease, as well, by as much as  $2,000 from a lower rate and a higher child tax credit.    As I have said before, maybe some of our Democratic friends don't  believe this is a big deal; maybe they don't care about those American  families living paycheck to paycheck, who would welcome an additional  $2,000 each year. Their actions make me think they are OK with the  status quo because they have refused to even participate in the  process, and they have been rooting for failure every step along the  way.   Well, we saw the latest example of this over the weekend when a  leftwing website, masquerading as a legitimate news outlet, led by a  former staffer of the junior Senator from Vermont, published what it  advertised as a breaking news story about the final bill. This story  breathlessly claimed, without a shred of evidence, that a provision had  been airdropped into the final draft in secret in order to secure the  vote of a Member who would supposedly personally benefit from it. This  is a salacious tale from beginning to end. It was also completely false  and invented.   As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have joined with  my colleagues over the last year to investigate the efforts of Russian  intelligence operatives to undermine public confidence in our last  elections. Well, the way this phony news story broke and was picked up  on social media and in the mainstream media would make a Russian  intelligence officer proud. The whole purpose of this exercise--this  false and invented story--was to undermine public confidence in this  tax reform package that we will pass, perhaps as early as tomorrow, to  be signed by the President, perhaps before Christmas.   Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle and their allies  in the so-called mainstream media ran with it in a dishonest attempt to  derail us from passing the bill and undermine the reputation or  integrity of one of our fellow Senators--all from a made-up story.  Again, the Russian intelligence officials--it is well-documented by  now--through a combination of cyber theft, propaganda, creative use of  social media, and a gullible mainstream media, undermined American  confidence in our most basic obligation, an institution of our  government, which is our election system. But what we saw happen this  weekend, as I said, would have made a Russian intelligence officer  proud.   As a letter from Chairman Hatch, who is chairman of the Senate  Finance Committee, makes clear today, this website, which, by the way,  also posted a false report about an amendment I had introduced several  weeks ago and later had to correct it, spread a false story  irresponsibly and dishonestly. In his letter, Chairman Hatch writes:         It takes a great deal of imagination--and likely no small       amount of partisanship--to argue that a provision that has       been public for over a month, debated on the floor of the       House of Representatives, included in a House-passed bill,       and identified by [the Joint Committee on Taxation] as an       issue requiring compromise between conferees is somehow a       covert and last-minute addition to the conference report.    It reminds me of another quote sometimes attributed to Mark Twain,  perhaps apocryphally, who supposedly said: A lie can travel halfway  around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes. Well, a  lie can travel even faster than that today because of social media.   Shame on those who would perpetuate lies in an effort to deny the  American people a much needed tax cut and tax relief. Thank goodness  that attitude isn't shared by most Americans and by the Texans I  represent who want and deserve much better than the same old same old.  They don't believe we have to settle for the status quo. We are going  to give them something better. We are going to keep our promise, and I  can't wait until this bill gets on the President's desk.   Let me just close by saying that I am a proud son of a World War II  veteran.  [[Page S8056]]  My dad was in the Army Air Corps, flew B-17s out of Molesworth Air  Force Base in England over Nazi Germany during the end of World War II.  He was a member of the 8th Air Force, 303rd Bomb Group. On his 26th  mission, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war. Thank  goodness he survived, came home, met my mom, married, raised a family,  and became a productive member of civilian society after his military  service. But I remember, as if it were yesterday, what my parents said  they wanted for me, my brother, and my sister. It is what parents of  that entire generation wanted for their children and grandchildren.  They wanted to know that their sacrifice, their willingness to fight  and win America's wars against terrible tyrants, such as Adolph  Hitler--that the consequence of their sacrifice and their service would  be a better standard of living, a safer world, and a better quality of  life. In short, what they wanted for us and what I want for my children  and what I believe every American parent wants for their child or their  children is exactly what my parents wanted for me and my sister and my  brother. We sometimes call that the American dream.    Some of us believe that the American dream is still alive, that we  don't have to settle for second place. We don't have to settle for the  status quo. We don't have to settle for flat wages and fewer jobs. We  can do better. We believe we have done better in this piece of  legislation, which will help reawaken the slumbering giant of the  American economy. It will put Americans back to work. It will mean more  take-home pay. It will mean a better standard of living, but,  surprisingly--and disappointingly--our colleagues across the aisle want  no part of it. I hope they haven't given up on that American dream. I  haven't given up, and I don't believe Americans have given up on that  dream.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous that the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I ask unanimous that the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I ask unanimous that the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter  from Chairman Hatch be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                            Committee on Finance,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2017.      Hon. Bob Corker,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Corker: Thank you for your letter dated       yesterday.        I am disgusted by press reports that have distorted one       particular aspect of the conference agreement on H.R. 1, the       Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The reports have focused on the final       version of the 20 percent pass-through deduction, the       proposed new Section 199A. As the author of this provision       and the vice chairman of the conference committee, I can       speak with authority about the process by which the       conference committee reached its final position.        There are two false assertions contained in these reports,       and I would like to correct the record on both.        First, some have asserted that a new provision was crafted       for real estate developers and was ``airdropped'' into the       conference agreement. Second, reports have implied that you       had some role in advocating for or negotiating the inclusion       of this provision.        Both assertions are categorically false. With respect to       the second, I am unaware of any attempt by you or your staff       to contact anyone on the conference committee regarding this       provision or any related policy matter. To the contrary,       virtually all the concerns you had raised in the past about       the treatment of pass-through businesses in tax reform were       to voice skepticism about the generosity of various proposals       under consideration.        The first claim--that a new pass-through proposal was       created out of whole cloth and inserted into the conference       report--is an irresponsible and partisan assertion that is       belied by the facts. For more than a year, tax-writers in the       House and Senate have worked to craft legislation that not       only provided relief for ``C'' corporations, but also       delivered equitable treatment for pass-through businesses.       Though the two chambers came at this issue from different       angles, our goal was the same: To provide tax relief to pass-      through businesses at a level similar to that provided to       regular ``C'' corporations. This policy goal was confirmed in       the Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code, which       provided in part:        ``TAX RATE STRUCTURE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES The framework       limits the maximum tax rate applied to the business income of       small and family owned businesses conducted as sole       proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations to 25%. The       framework contemplates that the committees will adopt       measures to prevent the re-characterization of personal       income into business income to prevent wealthy individuals       from avoiding the top personal tax rate.''        The House Ways Means Committee and the Senate Finance       Committee achieved this mutual goal by different means.       Section 1004 of the House bill provided a special tax rate       for pass-through income and included a ``prove-out'' option       for capital-intensive businesses. Chairman Brady unveiled       this approach on November 2nd, more than six weeks ago.        The Senate took a different approach, achieving the       intended rate relief through a deduction patterned after       current law Section 199. We also included measures to ensure       that compensation could not be easily gamed into business       income in order to qualify for the deduction. Similar to       Section 199, the deduction in the Senate bill excluded       compensation and guarantee payments to owners and was limited       to 50 percent of compensation paid to employees, with an       exception for small pass-through businesses, including       service providers. The Senate bill did not include a prove-      out option for capital-intensive businesses like the one       contained in the House bill.        The Joint Committee on Taxation (``JCT''), the non-partisan       congressional scorekeeper for tax legislation, released a       side-by-side summary of the two bills for conferees. That       summary, dated December 7, 2017 and available on JCT's       website (JCX 64-17), described the House position in part:        ``In the case of a capital-intensive business, a taxpayer       may ``prove out'' a capital percentage by electing the       application of an increased percentage for the taxable year       it is made and each of the next four taxable years. The       applicable percentage is determined by dividing (1) the       specified return on capital for the activity for the taxable       year, by (2) the taxpayer's net business income derived from       that activity for that taxable year.''        It takes a great deal of imagination--and likely no small       amount of partisanship--to argue that a provision that has       been public for over a month, debated on the floor of the       House of Representatives, included in a House-passed bill,       and identified by JCT as an issue requiring a compromise       between conferees is somehow a covert and last-minute       addition to the conference report.        I have sat on a number conference committees, too numerous       to remember. In each case, conferees have come into the       conference expecting to achieve their chamber's position or       negotiate a reasonable compromise. This conference committee       was no exception. The House entered the conference with an       interest in preserving, in some form, the prove-out       alternative as an option for capital-intensive taxpayers.       Through several rounds of negotiations, the House secured a       version of their proposal that was consistent with the       overall structure of the compromise.        The prove-out alternative included in the conference report       was derived from the House provision and is the product of a       negotiation between the House and Senate tax-writing       committees. It is that simple.        If you have any further questions, please feel free to       contact me.            Very Truly Yours,                                                    Orrin G. Hatch,                                Chairman, Senate Finance Committee.     Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) and the Senator from Arizona  (Mr. McCain).   Further, if present and voting the Senator from West Virginia (Mrs.  Capito) would have voted ``yea.''    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).
