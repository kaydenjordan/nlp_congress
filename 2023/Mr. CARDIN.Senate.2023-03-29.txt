 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.J. Res. 27, which is at the desk; and that at 2:30  p.m. today, it be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on  the passage of the joint resolution without intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I have the honor of being the chair of  the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee here in the U.S.  Senate, and there has been a lot of activity during the Biden  administration that deals with our economy.   The Biden administration has a proud record of legislative  accomplishments, from the American Rescue Plan to the bipartisan  infrastructure bill, to the Safer Communities Act, to the Inflation  Reduction Act, to the CHIPS and Science bill, to the PACT bill, and the  list goes on and on. But I want to talk a little bit about the  accomplishments under the Biden administration for small businesses,  and I am very proud of what we have been able to do to help small  businesses in our country.   We have 33.2 million small business owners in America. They are the  drivers of our economy. We say they are the backbone of our economy; I  think they are also the backbone of our communities. They create jobs,  and they do most of the innovation that we see. It makes America more  competitive and creates more job opportunities and economic  opportunities.   Over 99 percent of our businesses in the United States are small  businesses, and nearly 50 percent of all U.S. employees work for small  companies. So it is critically important that we pay attention to our  small businesses, and, of course, it was challenging during the COVID- 19 pandemic.   I will just give you one example of why it is so important, giving  one example in Maryland. I am sure you could give an example in every  one of our States. This past Friday, I was at Sabatino's restaurant in  Little Italy, Baltimore. We see many times that the economic growth of  ethnic communities has been spurred by innovation by small companies.  Sabatino's is one of those restaurants, which is iconic to Baltimore  today. It was started in 1955 by two individuals, two immigrants who  started Sabatino's restaurant. It is now an iconic restaurant in  Baltimore where we like to go for good political discussion. It is in a  pretty famous neighborhood. It is where Nancy Pelosi grew up. It has  incredible food. It is for good company and good food, and it is an  anchor in that community for its economic growth.   There are a lot of small business owners who are in that neighborhood  who are continuing to provide job opportunities and economic growth and  a future for Little Italy in Baltimore.   We could give many, many examples of that type of activity by a small  company, a small business, that has really saved a neighborhood and  preserved it for its future.   The Biden administration has a proud record in support of small  businesses. Let me just give you some of the numbers. Twenty twenty-one  was a record year for the growth of small businesses in this country.  We had the largest number of new business growth, small business  growth, in the history of America, and it was led by women-owned small  businesses. Women of color led among the women business entrepreneurs.   This is attributable to the fact that the Biden administration has  been concentrating on helping our small businesses but has paid  particular attention to those small businesses located in traditionally  underserved communities. That has led to programs that have helped. I  will give you one example: women's business centers. The President  announced just this week increasing the number of women's business  centers in our community.   When President Biden took the oath of office, we had one women's  business center in Maryland, and it was doing really great service,  helping women get through the maze of bureaucracies and obstacles that  were in their way to start a small business or grow a small business.  It was located in Rockville, MD, and provided great help. Today, we  have four women's business centers in Maryland, one located in  Salisbury, which is a rural part of our State, to help women business  entrepreneurs in rural Maryland. We have one at Morgan State  University, a historic Black college in Maryland, and it is an HBCU  that has provided tremendous opportunities for minority business  owners. We just recently opened another women's business center at  Bowie State University, an HBCU in the Washington area, in Prince  George's County.   These are concrete steps the Biden administration has taken to not  only grow our small business opportunities in America but to make sure  we pay attention to those who have been left behind in the past.   Let me just give you another example of how we have delivered through  the Biden administration to help our small business community.   We delivered for the people, for individuals like Carl Williams of  Los Angeles, who founded Royal Men Solutions. After he was released  from prison, Carl heard about the Minority Business Development  Agency's Entrepreneurship Education for Formerly Incarcerated Persons  Center in Los Angeles. His dream of becoming a third-generation  carpenter and making his father proud took flight through this program.   Carl explains, and I quote:         The information the MBDA Center afforded me was invaluable,       teaching me the elevator pitch, understanding my competition,       standing out as a custom furniture builder, and knowing my       value. All of their advice was an intricate part of my growth       and development in the business world.    Well, one of the great accomplishments of the Biden administration  was to help our returning citizens, those impacted under the criminal  justice system, to give them an opportunity,  [[Page S1018]]  and they are taking advantage of that thanks to the Biden  administration.   Also in the Biden administration was the passage of the bipartisan  infrastructure package. Through the bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, we were able to pass legislation that  establishes in statute the Minority Business Development Agency that  Carl depended upon--the MBDA.   We authorized $110 million per year for the Agency through fiscal  year 2025 and elevated the office by creating an Under Secretary  position to lead the Agency. The funds will expand the geographic reach  of the MBDA by authorizing the creation of regional MBDA offices and  rural business centers and creating the Parren J. Mitchell  Entrepreneurship Education Grants Program to support minority  entrepreneurs at HBCUs and MSIs.   I particularly like the program being named after the former  Congressman Parren J. Mitchell, a Congressman from Baltimore, who was  chair in the House of Representatives of the Small Business Committee  and was responsible for our first efforts to set aside to help small  businesses and minority small businesses.   We delivered for founders like Miles Barr, Richard Lunt, and Vladimir  Bulovic, who at MIT imagined a world where they could seamlessly help  limit our carbon footprint through transparent solar technologies. The  company has already started producing small-size windows that reduce  energy and may help reduce our total national energy consumption by up  to 12 percent. Thanks to funding from the Small Business Innovation  Research or SBIR Program, as we all know it, they were able to spin out  of MIT and embark on this private endeavor.   In the 117th Congress, with President Biden's leadership, we were  able to extend the life of and improve the SBIR and STTR Programs.  Through the SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022, the Small Business  Innovation Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer Programs  were reauthorized, including their related pilot programs, through  September 30, 2025. The legislation also includes language that ensures  the largest SBIR and STTR award winners are adequately transitioning  and commercializing their technologies.   These actions we take have real consequences. These are companies  that need to have that ability to participate in government research.  That is what the SBIR Program and the STTR Program do. The Federal  Agencies that have the largest amounts of research must engage smaller  companies.   Now, guess which Agency is the strongest proponent of the SBIR  Program that we reauthorized under President Biden's leadership? It is  the Department of Defense because they know these small, innovative  tech companies are going to give them the technology they need to keep  America safe, and they are.   I look at my own State of Maryland, where we are blessed to have so  many high-tech companies that are working in defense, working in  healthcare, working in communications, and working in the environment  and energy. Thanks to our actions, these companies can now grow and do  their work and help our country solve our problems through the passage  of the SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022.   The Biden administration delivered for veterans, women entrepreneurs,  rural communities, and the mom-and-pop shops that keep our communities  vibrant.   Because of COVID-19, we knew this was not a time to sit back and  watch the small businesses we loved close their doors. Instead, we  rolled up our sleeves and took care of Main Street. While we saw too  many small businesses close, we saw many of them come back stronger  than ever before, and entrepreneurs did the same. In a remarkable  comeback under the Biden administration, we have seen 10.5 million new  business applications, making 2021 and 2022 record years.   Through the Inflation Reduction Act, we helped small businesses  reduce their energy costs while improving their environmental  sustainability.   Through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, small  businesses across the country will receive the help they need to  modernize the way they do business in order to grow and succeed.   Look, I want American entrepreneurs and small business owners to know  that they should dream big. Our Nation is on path to make those big  dreams a reality. I am very proud of the progress we have been able to  make during these past 2 years. I am looking forward to working on  behalf of small businesses in this Congress with my partner Senator  Ernst on the Small Business Committee.   I just want the small business owners of America to know that we are  on their side, and we are going to continue to provide the help so they  can help America grow. They are the backbone of our economy and the  backbone of our communities, and we stand with them.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I want to thank Senator Lujan for his  leadership on behalf of small businesses.   Senator Lujan is absolutely right. There are a lot of areas that are  not necessarily within the jurisdiction of the Small Business Committee  that directly affect small businesses, and one of those is access to  broadband. Senator Lujan understands that for small businesses to  succeed, they have to have access to affordable, high-speed internet.   And Senator Lujan has also been critically important in so many of  the other areas--challenges that we have confronted, particularly  during COVID. So I just want to thank him for his leadership on behalf  of small businesses and the people of New Mexico.   We are joined on the floor by Senator Rosen, and I just want everyone  to know of her valuable contributions to the Small Business Committee.  She has been one of the leaders during these 2 years with the record I  just went over of accomplishments under the Biden administration. But  she is a real leader in recognizing that, if we are going to succeed  with women entrepreneurs, we need to deal with childcare, and, today,  small business tools are not fully available to small business  operators of childcare. Senator Rosen is our leader in trying to make  sure that we correct that and do something about it.   I also appreciate her knowledge and understanding and leadership on  the regulatory challenges that small businesses confront and taking on  that challenge to see whether we can't provide some relief.   So I just really wanted to acknowledge her extraordinary work on  behalf of small businesses in this country.    Madam President, again, I want to thank Senator Rosen for  her leadership, and we certainly are looking forward to taking up the  legislation that she has introduced.                                 H.J. Res. 27    Madam President, I know we are on debate on the waters of the United  States.   The rule provides for exceptions for ranchers and farmers. I would  hope that we reject the resolution.   I would like to start my statement of support for a strong definition  of ``waters of the United States'' with a reflection on the history of  the Clean Water Act.   Congress overhauled the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,  originally enacted in 1948, with amendments in 1972 that gave the act  its current dimensions. The 1972 legislation spelled out ambitious  programs for water quality improvement that industries and  municipalities are still implementing today.  [[Page S1020]]    The 92nd Congress held a series of votes on the Federal Water  Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, which would later come to be  known as the Clean Water Act. The Senate passed the bill, which came  out of a conference committee with the House after 39 meetings, by a  vote of 74 to 0. The House passed the bill by a 366-to-11 vote.   Nineteen-seventy two was a Presidential election year. Despite a  first term notable for its landmark environmental achievements,  President Nixon vetoed the bill in an attempt to set himself apart from  his opponent, George McGovern.   Bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate overrode President  Nixon's veto, and the bill became law on October 18, 1972. The Senate  vote was overwhelming. Meanwhile, State and local leaders, as well as  advocates of all stripes, were central in the push for this legislation  to be enshrined in law.   Contrast this show of congressional unity with our situation today,  where we are relying on President Biden for his veto if the Senate  passes this joint resolution of disapproval of the rule the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency--EPA-- jointly submitted relating to ``Revised Definition of `waters of the  United States.' ''   The rule under attack finally delivers a clear, workable definition.  On December 30, 2022, the Agencies announced the final ``Revised  Definition of `waters of the United States' '' rule. On January 18,  2023, the rule was published in the Federal Register.   The Agencies' final rule establishes a clear and reasonable  definition of ``waters of the United States'' and reduces the  uncertainty from constantly changing regulatory definitions that has  harmed communities and our Nation's waters.   This commonsense, science-based approach recognizes that pollution  upstream can have downstream impacts, so we must protect the system to  safeguard downstream communities and our environment. The rule also  maintains longstanding Clean Water Act permitting exemptions for  routine farming and ranching activities.   The rule ought to be durable in part because it was informed by  extensive public comment to establish a definition that supports public  health, environmental protection, agricultural activity, and economic  growth. In developing the proposed rule, EPA and the army reviewed and  considered the extensive feedback and recommendations the Agencies  received from States, Tribal governments, local governments, and  stakeholders through consultations, meetings, and webinars.   In 2017, Chairman Carper and I led 19 Senators in a letter to then- EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt opposing the Trump administration EPA's  plan to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule, which would have weakened  safeguards for the Nation's waterways.   Last year, on February 28, 2022, 13 Senators joined me in a letter to  the EPA applauding the rule to revise the definition of ``waters of the  United Sates.'' Our letter explained how the rule takes significant and  positive steps toward restoring strong clean water protections that are  critical to meeting the Biden administration's commitment to  environmental justice.   Clean water is essential for improving public health outcomes through  the provision of safe, affordable drinking water for all Americans, no  matter their location.   In the interim, I led a bicameral letter with my Chesapeake Bay  watershed colleagues to Michael Regan, who is currently the EPA  Administrator, and to Lieutenant General Scott Spellman, the Chief of  Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   We urged them to rescind the harmful Navigable Waters Protection Rule  the Trump administration implemented, and replace it with a rule that  restores strong Clean Water Act protections to the Chesapeake Bay and  other waterways and wetlands across the country.   The Bay receives half of its water from a network of 110,000 streams  and 1.7 million acres of wetlands, most of which are non-navigable  tributaries and non-tidal wetlands that drain to those tributaries.  Scientific research attests to the critical importance of small  headwater streams in removing pollution from higher-order streams and  rivers, and in preserving aquatic and riparian life throughout the  entire system.   Small streams and wetlands do not just provide habitat for wildlife  and trout and other fisheries that enhance outdoor recreation  opportunities; they also clean water for farmers that drive our economy  through the production of food.   Water pollution has never respected political boundaries. Using the  Congressional Review Act to attack this thoughtfully crafted rule would  be a mistake for healthy watersheds and clean water supplies across the  country.   I urge all my colleagues to reject this damaging resolution.    Madam President, the Senate today has finally voted to  repeal two outdated and obsolete authorizations for the use of military  force--those that launched two wars against the Iraqi Government of  Saddam Hussein, enacted into law in 1991 and 2002.   Yet this is not the only action we must take to protect our national  security. A third AUMF, which Congress enacted in 2001 in the aftermath  of the 9/11 attacks on our country by the terrorist organization al- Qaida, is also outdated and ought to be repealed. This authorization  was fully justified and necessary at the time, and I voted in favor of  it.   It was sadly necessary to go to war in Afghanistan to remove the very  real threat that al-Qaida posed from its sanctuary there.   But, as I have repeatedly argued in successive Congresses since 2014,  this AUMF, too, is now obsolete. We ought to repeal it and replace it  with a new AUMF that more accurately reflects the threats our country  faces today.   Four Presidents from both parties have used the 2001 AUMF to target  groups that did not even exist on 9/11/2001 in countries such as Yemen  and  [[Page S1056]]  Somalia, far from the battlefield of Afghanistan. Presidents have used  this AUMF in ways that those of us in Congress who voted for it could  never have imagined 22 years ago.   Publicly available War Powers Resolution notifications that refer to  the 2001 AUMF address more than 20 countries, including Afghanistan,  Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Niger, Philippines, Georgia,  Djibouti, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Cameroon,  Chad, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia.   The number of countries where the U.S. military has actually resorted  to military action is smaller but not insignificant. Again based on War  Powers Resolution notifications, the 2001 AUMF has been publicly cited  as authorization for military activity in seven countries: Afghanistan,  Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Niger. No administration should  continue to use the 2001 AUMF--that clearly and specifically is aimed  at those who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks--as a blank check for war  anywhere and anytime, and it is past time for Congress to take action.   In 2014 and 2015, President Obama relayed his intent to work with the  Congress to repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF, at the time the United  States was assembling the Coalition to Defeat ISIS, but we were not  able to get it done.   Now, President Biden has reiterated the same intent. In the official  Statement of Administration Policy on the bill we have passed today,  the White House declared its support for passage of S. 316 and goes on  to say:         Furthermore, President Biden remains committed to working       with Congress to ensure that outdated authorizations for the       use of military force are replaced with a narrow and specific       framework more appropriate to protecting Americans form       modern terrorist threats. Toward that end, the Administration       will ensure that Congress has a clear and thorough       understanding of the effect of any such action and of the       threats facing U.S. forces, personnel, and interests around       the world.    So, in response to the invitation President Biden has extended to  Congress to replace and repeal the 2001 AUMF, I am today introducing  legislation that would prospectively repeal the outdated  authorization--while providing enough time for both the executive and  the legislative branches to agree on the most appropriate replacement.  This legislation would sunset the existing AUMF in July 2025, 6 months  into the next administration. So we will have adequate time to consult  with the administration's national security professionals about the  best way to do so.   This would also provide a framework for the necessary national debate  about how to modernize our national security posture during the  upcoming 2024 elections.   This is a pivotal moment. Congress must act to reassert its rightful  role in war-making authorities, as set out in article I of the  Constitution. We must take action on all fronts. Having voted  decisively to repeal the authorizations of 1991 and 2002 in legislation  led by my able colleagues, Senator Kaine of Virginia and Senator Young  of Indiana, we now need to move with dispatch to repeal and replace the  2001 authorization. It is a responsibility that we must assume to  protect our national security in today's context.   I look forward to moving on this initiative as soon as possible in  this session of the 118th Congress.                            ____________________     Madam President, the Senate today has finally voted to  repeal two outdated and obsolete authorizations for the use of military  force--those that launched two wars against the Iraqi Government of  Saddam Hussein, enacted into law in 1991 and 2002.
