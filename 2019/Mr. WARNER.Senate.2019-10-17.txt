 Mr. President, I am coming to the floor to speak on a  different subject, but I do want to acknowledge that this is an issue I  follow as well. I actually cosponsored Senator Lee's bill. I do hope  what my friend from Illinois proposed, in terms of a process--that that  process will take place and that we can get this legislation, or a  variation thereof, passed through the Senate; that we deal with this  issue is something I hear a lot from my constituents in Virginia-- specifically, Northern Virginia.   Again, although no piece of legislation is perfect, I think the  direction Senator Lee has put forward is one I carefully considered  before I cosponsored the legislation. Again, the only way we are going  to get this resolved is if we go through this process. Nobody on the  Senate works harder on immigration issues and with more passion and  willingness to get to yes on an issue than the Senator from Illinois,  so I thank him for his work as well.                          Tribute to Victoria Brahm    Mr. President, I came down here today to address the question I came  for, to actually continue the tradition of my friend Senator Ted  Kaufman. I had the distinction of serving here as a staff member for a  long time and filled in for a few years when Senator Biden became the  Vice President of the United States.   What Senator Ted Kaufman did was he came, during his tenure in the  Senate, on a regular basis, came to this floor and highlighted the  contributions of exceptional Federal employees. He highlighted the work  they do every day to make our Nation and communities safer, healthier,  and stronger.   I came to the floor earlier this year to congratulate three  Virginians who were recognized by the Partnership for Public Service as  finalists for the Service to America Medals. Within the world of  Federal employees, this award may not be as well known as the Oscars,  but the award, the Service to America Medals, are known as the  ``Sammies.''   During my time on the floor earlier, when I spoke about the  Virginians who were nominated, I spoke about Ambassador Michael Kozak  from Arlington, Kara De Castro from Haymarket, and John Wagner from  Ashburn. Each of these public servants have made significant  contributions to our national  [[Page S5878]]  security, as well as to global peace and human rights. We are indebted  to them for their contributions, and I congratulate them again for  their much deserved recognition as finalists.   Unfortunately, none of this year's winners hail from Virginia. Still,  I want to congratulate the 2019 Federal Employee of the Year, Victoria  Brahm from Wisconsin. Ms. Brahm is a career public servant who has  spent more than 37 years working in the VA system.   Since 2015, she has served as the director of the Tomah VA Medical  Center. When she arrived, the center was struggling with unsafe medical  practices, high staff turnover, and other issues impacting the quality  of care that veterans were receiving. In the years since her arrival,  there has been a rise in patient satisfaction and a dramatic drop in  the use of opioids and other prescription pain relievers.   Under Director Brahm's leadership, preventable inhospital  complications have also dropped significantly, and the center has risen  from one of the worst ranked hospitals in the VA system to the top 10  percent. This remarkable turnaround that is making life better for our  veterans is due in many ways to the work of Ms. Brahm. Congratulations,  Ms. Brahm, and thank you for your service.   Congratulations, as well, to all of this year's award winners who  hail from around the country, not just Washington, DC. While the  Federal workers we recognize today are exceptional, the truth is they  are not the exception. Federal employees across the country dedicate  their lives to serving the country, to protecting its people, and to  making sure our tax dollars are properly spent.   Unfortunately, this commitment has not been honored by the Trump  administration. In addition to the longest government shutdown in  history, Federal workers have endured pay freezes, hiring freezes, bad- faith collective bargaining, and other efforts to dismantle our  nonpolitical civil service. This is wrong. It is also unsustainable,  and ultimately it will be everyday Americans who suffer the  consequences of this administration's actions. If you drive out and  drive down the morale of our workforce, the American people end up with  a less good product.   I commit that I will continue fighting in the Senate to ensure this  country is keeping its commitment to Federal workers because they  deserve so much better than the treatment they have received recently.                                  FUTURE Act    Mr. President, let me now, for a couple of moments, turn to another  important issue where I fear we are not keeping our commitments, and  that is our commitment to our Nation's historically Black colleges and  universities, also known as HBCUs.   I will talk briefly in support of legislation introduced by my  colleague from Alabama, Senator Jones, and my colleague from South  Carolina, Senator Scott. The legislation they introduced is called the  FUTURE Act.   The FUTURE Act would provide a 1-year reauthorization of the  mandatory funding for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions  that already expired on September 30. This is a commonsense bipartisan  fix that is fully paid for, and it would allow us to keep our  commitment to institutions across the country that are educating  historically underrepresented and underserved students.   Virginia is home to five outstanding HBCUs whose funding would be  preserved by this legislation: Virginia State University, Norfolk State  University, Hampton University, Virginia Union University, which I was  proud, prior to my tenure in government, to serve on the board of, and  Virginia University of Lynchburg. All told, these institutions received  nearly $4 million in funding last year that is now at risk unless we  pass the FUTURE Act.    I have letters of support here from the Presidents of Hampton,  Norfolk State, and Virginia Union. These letters highlight the FUTURE  Act and the importance of this funding to the representative  universities.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                              Hampton University,                                         Hampton, VA, July 16, 2019.      Hon. Mark Warner,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warner: I am writing to request that you       cosponsor S. 1279, the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by       Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act sponsored by       Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) and Senator Tim Scott (R-SC). This       bipartisan, bicameral bill was written to extend important       mandatory funding for education in the sciences, technology,       engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in Title III, Part F of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 until September 30, 2021.        Title III, Part F, benefits Historically Black Colleges and       Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions       (MSIs) by providing mandatory funds that allow these       institutions to better serve their students in the STEM       fields. As I am sure you are aware, a STEM education is       crucial to the growth and continued development of our       economy. Hampton University and other institutions have       benefited greatly from the availability and usage of these       funds.        A report released by the White House National Science and       Technology Council stated that the ``national benefits of a       strong STEM foundation cannot be fully realized until all       members of society have equitable access to STEM education       and [until] there is much broader participation by those       historically underserved and underrepresented in STEM fields       . . .'' The report goes on to highlight the importance of       diversity in the workplace leading to more engaged,       innovative, and higher-performing organizations. Hampton       serves all students, some of whom are low-income, first       generation post-secondary students of color; an underserved       population. One benefit of funding through Title III, Part F       is that it dlrectly helps achieve the goal of diversifying       our workforce and ensuring more underrepresented students are       entering STEM fields.        The mandatory funds included in Title III, Part F, were       originally established by the College Cost Reduction and       Access Act for the years of 2008-2009, retained in the Higher       Education Opportunity Act of 2008, and then extended until       2019 in the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of       2010. All three pieces of legislation were passed in the       House and Senate on a bipartisan basis showing support for       this crucial stream of funding.        However, this stream of funding is scheduled to expire       September 30, 2019. Therefore, it is imperative that this       bill passes both Chambers and becomes law before the       expiration date. Again, I ask that you cosponsor S. 1279 and       help institutions of higher education, HBCUs in particular,       continue to provide the much needed services to the students       on our campuses.            With all good wishes,                                                 William R. Harvey,      President.                                   ____                                         Norfolk State University,                                                  September 5, 2019.      Hon. Mark Warner,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of Norfolk State University,       I ask your support in cosponsoring S. 1279, the Fostering       Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education       (FUTURE) Act sponsored by Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) and       Senator Tim Scott (R-SC). This bipartisan, bicameral bill       would extend important mandatory funding for education in the       sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in       Title III, Part F of the Higher Education Act of 1965 until       September 30, 2021.        The mandatory funding included in Title III, Part F, was       established in 2008 by the College Cost Reduction and Access       Act. The funding was later extended through authorizations in       the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, and the Health       Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010. All three       pieces of legislation passed in the House and Senate on a       bipartisan basis with strong congressional support. Current       funding will expire on September 30, 2019.        Title III, Part F, benefits Historically Black Colleges and       Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions       (MSIs) by providing mandatory funds that allow these       institutions to support their students in the STEM fields.       Whether it be innovations in cybersecurity, or emerging       research in deep space exploration, Norfolk State University       has a longstanding history of preparing students to excel in       the STEM fields. Title III, Part F is a critical resource       that has played an important role in NSU's success.        Continued funding for Title III, Part F is crucial to the       growth and continued development of our economy and this       University. Your cosponsorship and vote of support for S.       1279 is very much needed, and will represent a sound       investment in America's future.            Sincerely,                                       Javaune Adams-Gaston, Ph.D.,      President.                                   ____                                        Virginia Union University,                                                     August 6, 2019.      Hon. Mark Warner,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warner: I write to you today to ask you to       cosponsor S. 1279, the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by       Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act sponsored by       Senator Doug Jones  [[Page S5879]]       (D-AL) and Senator Tim Scott (R-SC). This bipartisan,       bicameral bill was written to extend important mandatory       funding for education in the sciences, technology,       engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in Title III, Part F of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 until September 30, 2021.        Title III, Part F, benefits Historically Black Colleges and       Universities (HBCU's) and other Minority-Serving Institutions       (MSIs) by providing mandatory funds that allow these       institutions to better serve their students in the STEM       fields. STEM education is crucial to the growth and continued       development of our economy, and my institution has benefited       greatly from the availability and usage of these funds.

The report goes on to highlight the importance of       diversity in the workplace leading to more engaged,       innovative, and higher-performing organizations. Like my       institution, HBCUs and MSIs serve all students, but primarily       serve students who are low-income, first generation, and       students of color, which would directly help achieve the goal       of diversifying our workforce and ensuring more       underrepresented students are entering the STEM fields.        The mandatory funds included in Title III, Part F were       originally established by the College Cost Reduction and       Access Act for the years of 2008-2009, retained in the Higher       Education Opportunity Act of 2008, and then extended until       2019 in the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of       2010.

Again, I ask that       you co-sponsor S. 1279 and help me continue to provide the       much-needed services to the students on my campus.            Sincerely,                                             Hakim J. Lucas, Ph.D.,                                                   President & CEO.     Mr. President, recently our colleagues in the House  passed this important legislation on a bipartisan basis. Now it is time  for the Senate to do the same. Let's pass the FUTURE Act without  further delay and then work together on a comprehensive reauthorization  of the Higher Education Act.   As Dr. Harry Williams, president of the Thurgood Marshall College  Fund, said, America's HBCUs ``simply do not have the time to wait for  Congress to work out a deal.'' So let's put our broader policy  differences aside for now and honor the commitments we made to HBCUs  and other minority-serving institutions before Congress's inaction  harms students in Virginia and around the country.   With that, I yield the floor.
