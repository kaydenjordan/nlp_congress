 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 8163, the  Improving Trauma Systems and Emergency Care Act of 2022, which is  sponsored by my Energy and Commerce Committee colleague, Representative    Tom O'Halleran.   This legislation renews a program in the Public Health Service Act  that authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award  grants to improve local trauma care readiness and emergency medical  services.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC,  trauma is a leading cause of death for children and adults under the  age of 44. Ensuring access to trauma care requires many crucial  components, and the window of opportunity for a chance at survival is  narrow for a severely injured patient; a prompt response is truly a  matter of life and death.   However, in many rural parts of the United States, accident victims  and others suffering life-threatening injuries may not be able to  receive needed trauma care within an hour, or even many hours,  following an incident.   H.R. 8163 will help ensure seriously injured patients have the best  possible chance for survival by supporting States to coordinate and  improve regional emergency medical services and  [[Page H8152]]  trauma care, and by supporting trauma centers to improve their  emergency system situational awareness and access.   The bill also authorizes grants for carrying out research and  demonstration projects to support the improvement of emergency medical  services and trauma care in rural areas.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Pallone and Chair Eshoo for working with  us to make sure the State match is maintained.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of 8163, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 958, the Maximizing  Outcomes through Better Investments in Lifesaving Equipment, or the  MOBILE Health Care Act.   Federally Qualified Health Centers, or FQHCs, are an integral part of  the healthcare system. They provide much-needed healthcare services to  some of our most vulnerable populations, the uninsured, pregnant women,  children, those suffering from homelessness, and veterans, as well as  Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.   It can be difficult for patients to access care at FQHCs in rural and  underserved areas due to transportation constraints. One way to help  improve healthcare delivery is for FQHCs to meet patients where they  are by deploying mobile units.   The MOBILE Health Care Act will allow existing FQHCs to use their New  Access Point grants to establish mobile health units without also  creating new brick-and-mortar sites and without authorizing any new  grant programs or funding.   Further, it allows new applicants to use these grants to purchase  mobile health units if they also use a portion of the grant to  establish a permanent, full-time site.   This bill will help increase access to affordable primary care  services across the country, especially in rural areas, like my  district.   I thank the bill's sponsors, Representatives Hudson, Herrera Beutler,  Lee, and Ruiz for introducing this important legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), my Energy and Commerce Committee colleague.    Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4081, the Informing  Consumers About Smart Devices Act, introduced by Representative Curtis.   In the past few years, we have seen a tremendous advancement in the  development of technologies in consumer products. While many of these  technologies make everyday life more convenient, they also have the  ability to collect data from their users without their knowledge.   While it may be apparent to users that a laptop has the ability to  record conversations, it certainly may not be clear that other devices  like televisions, refrigerators, even toasters, have the same  capabilities.   This bipartisan legislation would simply require manufacturers of the  internet-connected devices that contain a microphone or a camera, and  that do not market themselves as such consumer electronics, to disclose  to consumers that such a component is part of the device, either pre-  or post-sale.   We owe it to our constituents to ensure these types of devices are  not recording them without their consent and collecting data when their  users are not aware.   I thank Representatives Curtis and Moulton for their bipartisan work  on H.R. 4018.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We wish Jerry Godspeed and thank him for the good work. I know  sometimes when our staff leaves, it is bittersweet. We hate to see them  go but know they are going to different opportunities. The hard work  that both your side and our side of the aisle do together, sometimes  when we are working on things together, sometimes negotiating together,  it is always good work. We are well served. The American people, more  than anything, are well served by the people who work here on Capitol  Hill. I thank and congratulate Jerry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6965, the Visit America Act.   The bill along with H.R. 7820, the Travel and Tourism Act, from  Representative Dunn, and H.R. 4594, the Restoring Brand USA Act, from  Representative Bilirakis, have represented bipartisan efforts to assist  our tourism sector with economic recovery post-COVID-19.   Representative Bilirakis is not here speaking about this bill. He is  home in Tampa, Florida, and represents the Tampa Bay area, as all of us  know. Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers are with his community in  Florida and the other States that have to deal with the remnants of the  rain. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.   Back to the bill, while I am pleased that Representative Bilirakis'  Brand USA legislation was signed into law this year, more work and  bipartisan efforts are needed to build upon Representative Bilirakis'  efforts to increase tourism.   Without question, the COVID-19 pandemic was difficult for all  industries, but the travel and tourism industry was hit especially  hard.   According to testimony by the U.S. Travel Association before the  Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, at the end of 2021,  international travel spending was 78 percent below prepandemic levels.   This bipartisan legislation can support the U.S. travel and tourism  industry and address the declining percentage of international visitors  to the United States. The Visit America Act will help by directing the  Department of Commerce to develop a 10-year travel and tourism strategy  with annual goals for the number of international visitors to the  United States.   Again, I thank the sponsors and cosponsors of all of these bills that  we have considered at the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I would  like to give special recognition to our colleague, Representative  Bilirakis, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Consumer  Protection and co-chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus,  who, as I noted, is back home, duly focusing on the hurricane response  and serving his constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, we have the greatest country in the world. I love when  people want to come see the beauty of our great land and meet our great  people. We have a wonderful opportunity for people to come see our  country. The tourism industry is a great industry, as are the people  who serve in it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
