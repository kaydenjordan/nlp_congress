 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a friend and  former colleague, former State Senator Patty Birkholz. I join my  colleagues and friends in Lansing today by wearing purple in her honor,  as she was affectionately known as Purple Patty. Literally down to the  ink pens that she used, everything was purple.   Senator Birkholz was first elected to the State legislature in 1996,  as the first woman from Allegan County in the western side of Michigan.  Then she became the first female Republican speaker pro tempore. After  that she was elected to the State senate, where she served two terms.   Upon leaving the legislature, Senator Birkholz was appointed director  of the Office of the Great Lakes by Governor Rick Snyder and as the  Michigan representative to the Great Lakes Commission. President Barack  Obama appointed Senator Birkholz to the National Sea Grant Advisory  Board, a position she continued until she passed away.   Senator Birkholz was a passionate advocate for Michigan's natural  resources and passed significant legislation, creating the Great Lakes  Interbasin Compact, water withdrawal assessment laws, and ballast water  standards that have affected all of the Great Lakes region. In 2010, a  291-acre portion of the 1,000-acre Saugatuck Dunes State Park was  renamed the ``Patricia Birkholz Natural Area'' by the Michigan  Department of Natural Resources and Environment.   She was a friend and a colleague who fought hard for her beliefs. She  was tough, she was compassionate, and she was a great legislator. She  will be deeply missed. Blessings to her family as we mourn her loss.                            ____________________
