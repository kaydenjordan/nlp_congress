 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, it is hard to know where to begin, because  this process is so lousy, but I want to rise today in opposition to  this rule and the so-called underlying bill, H.R. 3219, the GOP fiscal  year 2018 so-called security minibus appropriations bill.   This rule makes in order 72 amendments for debate on the House floor,  blocking 100 amendments. It continues the terrible closed process that  this Republican majority has used since they took control of the House  in 2011.   When Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he promised a fair and open process  with regular order where both the majority and the minority would have  the opportunity to have their voices heard, and I am happy to provide  the full text of that speech to my Republican friends.   I guess we were misinformed, because our collective voices are  repeatedly silenced in this Chamber, not just Democrats, but  Republicans as well.   Speaker Ryan's broken promise was clearly on display last week when  he waited until the dead of night to strip out of the Defense  Appropriations bill a provision requiring Congress to debate the issue  of the 2001 AUMF. That provision was adopted by the full House  Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan basis as an amendment offered  by our respected colleague, Representative Barbara Lee. The bipartisan  Lee amendment would sunset the outdated 2001 AUMF and give Congress 8  months to enact a new one, ensuring that Congress finally debate and  vote on the many wars in which the United States is engaged.    If the Republican leadership doesn't like the lead provision, then  the Rules Committee could have made in order an amendment to strike it  from the bill. That would have given Members the chance to vote up or  down either to keep or remove the provision. That would have been  regular order, that would have been fair, that would have been open,  but, instead, House Republican leadership took it upon themselves to  replace Ms. Lee's provision with alternative language calling upon the  administration to produce a report.  [[Page H6315]]    Republicans on the Rules Committee defended this action, saying that  the Lee amendment legislated on an appropriations bill. The trouble  with that logic, Mr. Speaker, is that the language that replaced Ms.  Lee's amendment also legislates on an appropriations bill. That is  right. House Republicans put in an amendment that violates the same  rule.   If this leadership is going to silence Members on flimsy procedural  grounds, they probably shouldn't break those same rules on the same  day.   Even more shameful, the Republican leadership's continued actions to  block every effort and refuse to allow Congress to debate and vote on  these wars, I believe, is an insult to the men and women in uniform,  who put their lives on the line every day to protect our country, and  to their families.   Americans deserve better, and the bipartisan voices calling for  action will not be silenced, but this is just one example of regular  order being abandoned in order to advance an extreme agenda.   Tomorrow, House Republicans will use another legislative trick, the  self-executing rule, to stick taxpayers with a $1.6 billion bill for  President Trump's reckless and ineffective border wall with Mexico.   Now, instead of bringing that measure to the floor for an up-or-down  vote in an open process where all voices could be heard, the Republican  leadership is sticking this provision into the rule so that as soon as  the rule is approved, the measure will automatically become part of the  bill.   President Trump, as you may recall, promised the American people that  he would make Mexico pay for this wall. He repeated it over and over  and over again during the campaign. But now, House Republicans want to  take $1.6 billion of hard-earned tax dollars from millions of Americans  to fund it.                                time  1245    Let me point out, Mr. Speaker, this $1.6 billion is only targeted at  74 miles of the border: two small tracts in Texas and one small tract  in California.   And how did this provision on the border wall make its way into this  minibus of appropriations bills? It was literally lifted out of the  Homeland Security appropriations bill and its few sentences air-dropped  into this package.   Where is the rest of the Homeland Security bill, Mr. Speaker? Sitting  in limbo, that is where it is.   I guess there weren't any other national security priorities in the  Homeland Security Appropriations bill that merited the very special  treatment that the 74 miles of this lousy wall seem to be getting. I  see that the only priority that matters for my Republican friends when  it comes to the security of our Nation is 74 miles of wall costing $1.6  billion.   Mr. Speaker, this is a disgrace. This is just a disgrace.   And then, because it will be part of a self-executing rule,  Republicans won't even have to vote on this Republican priority. They  will just vote on the rule and, bingo, it is all taken care of. There  will be no separate vote on this. You get the funding for the wall, but  nothing on record that says you voted to waste $1.6 billion on 74 miles  of border wall. Republicans can go home and say they delivered on the  wall. I guess they better hope that their constituents don't ask them  to show them the vote.   But as I said, Mr. Speaker, this is a disgrace on funding. It is a  disgrace on funding priorities, and it is a real disgrace on process. I  mean, we should be ashamed of the process in which this bill is being  brought to the floor.   I wish I could say that I am surprised by all of this, but the fact  is that House Republicans have been doing this kind of thing for quite  some time now. This week, you may have read about this: Kellyanne  Conway claimed that even if President Trump says something that isn't  true, it is not a lie if he believes it.   Well, you can't make this stuff up. Well, I take that back. I guess  you can make everything up.   It seems clear that this warped logic has infected this Chamber, with  the House Republican leadership employing this same kind of thinking  and underhanded methods on a regular basis. They defend a process that  is indefensible, plain and simple.   This is a rigged process. Let's be honest. This is a rigged process.   Is this really how we want Congress and this House to conduct the  business of the American people? Is this how we will conduct the  appropriations process not only now, but in the future: no debate for  individual appropriations bills and severely limiting amendments  overall? no regular order and a subversion the committee process?   Soon, maybe there will be no amendments on appropriations bills at  all. This is a slippery slope, and I urge my Republican colleagues to  carefully consider the dangerous road that we are going down.   Americans deserve better from their leaders in Congress, especially  when it comes to deciding how the American people's hard-earned tax  dollars will be spent. Republicans talk about fiscal responsibility,  but what I see here today is another reckless and bloated budget  proposal that empties the Treasury vaults for wasteful military  spending when we have so many critical priorities here at home that are  in desperate need of funding.   Now, apparently, House Republicans have no problem with spending $1.6  billion on President Trump's border wall with Mexico, but when it comes  to investing in our own communities here at home, they can't be  bothered.   How about investing in our kids' schools? Why aren't we doing more to  ensure that our young people have the resources and the support they  need to get additional education? Make college more affordable, for  example. Wouldn't that be a radical idea?   Republicans love to talk about personal responsibility and the need  for Americans to work. Why aren't we investing $1.6 billion more in job  training programs and finding ways to increase wages?   We should be making sure that more families have access to good jobs  and that no one in America who works full-time has to raise their  family in poverty.   President Trump had what feels like countless infrastructure weeks,  but we have yet to see Republicans propose any legislation to make good  on their promise to finally invest in America's infrastructure and  finally fix our Nation's crumbling roads and bridges.   Instead of making any of these policies the top priorities that they  should be in this Congress, Republicans are just offering more of the  same: empty rhetoric and broken promises.   Now, to be clear, the legislation that we will consider today, H.R.  3219, does fund some important priorities. Our national security must  be our number one priority with policies that are both strong and  smart. I strongly support our men and women in uniform and believe that  Congress should provide our troops everything that they need. Yet  Republicans have deliberately created a security bill that raises  serious concerns.   Let's recap for a second, Mr. Speaker. The final version of this bill  will include $1.6 billion for the President's useless and immoral  border wall. It strips out the bipartisan Lee amendment that would have  ensured Congress finally grapples with the wars that we are sending our  troops to fight instead of continuing to write the White House a series  of blank checks. And to top it all off, Mr. Speaker, the four bills  contained in H.R. 3219 blow through the Budget Control Act cap on  defense spending by $72 billion, threatening a 13 percent sequester cut  to all defense accounts.   While obliterating the defense spending cap, House Republicans have  proposed reducing nondefense spending to $5 billion below its cap. It  is legislative malpractice that Republicans have ignored this reality  and have done nothing to work with Democrats to write a new bipartisan  budget agreement to raise the Budget Control Act caps for both defense  and nondefense spending. Republicans are setting us up for a train  wreck, a government shutdown, or worse.    This is not good, Mr. Speaker. This should concern every single  Member of this Chamber, both Democrat and Republican. And so I urge my  colleagues to reject this rule and finally take a stand against this  process, which is rigged and closed and restrictive, and to oppose the  underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just remind my colleagues here that we are debating the rule,  and this is about process.   The gentleman from Oklahoma earlier talked about waivers and that the  Lee AUMF language would be subject to a point of order. Well, the  language that my Republican friends replaced the Lee amendment with is  protected by a waiver of all points of order because it was also  legislating on an appropriations bill. As I pointed out last night in  the Rules Committee, you made in order amendment No. 19 by Mr.  Griffith, which violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act,  and you provided a waiver for that.   My Republican friends routinely grant waivers in bills that come  before the Rules Committee. The problem is that the waivers are only  granted for your amendments and never for our amendments, and that is  just not fair and that is not right.   So if your policy is going to be we are going to grant no waivers,  then it ought to apply not just to Democrats; it ought to apply to  Republicans, too. But there is this double standard here, and voices  that you disagree with always seem to end up being cut off.   So, Mr. Speaker, I just point that out because this process and the  reason why so many of us are angry about this process is it is so  blatantly unfair.   The gentleman from Alabama talked about how we all want to commit to  upholding the national security of this Nation. I agree with him, but I  would say we are not doing our jobs if this floor is not a place where  we can have a free-flowing debate, where Members can offer different  ideas and be able to have a vote on them. I would just say, with all  due respect to my Republican colleagues, you do not have a monopoly on  all good ideas.                                time  1300    You know, we have a couple of good ideas, too, and maybe some of your  Members agree with that as well.   The other thing we are going to object to is, again, the way my  Republican friends self-execute controversial measures like this border  wall at $1.6 billion, basically denying an up-or-down vote. Maybe it is  to protect your Members in swing districts; I have no idea. Maybe you  don't think you have the votes to do it. But if you don't have the  votes to do it, it ought not to be in this bill. That is just, to me, a  sound way to approach legislating. All the normal rules seem to be  thrown out the window here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  [[Page H6317]]  McCollum), the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) so he may respond.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he promised to have  ``a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, and  more participatory.''   My friends like to highlight a number of amendments made in order  today as if this is a good process. I would remind you, Mr. Speaker,  that, rather than taking up one issue at a time, this is a rule for  three appropriations bills. I say to my friends, you guys are worse  than you used to be.   There are 10 amendments allowed for the Legislative Branch. Last year  you made in order 13. We have fewer amendments this year.   For the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill, there are 16  amendments. Just a short time ago, in fiscal year 2016, we had a  modified open rule. This rule is clearly much worse.   We have the same situation with the Energy and Water bill. We have a  structured rule this year, while we had a modified open rule just 2  years ago. The process in the House is getting worse.   For the first time in history, we have a Speaker of the House who has  never allowed a truly open rule. Now, we were not perfect, Mr. Speaker,  but Speaker Pelosi allowed the Rules Committee to report open rules.  Speaker Boehner allowed open rules. Every Speaker in modern history  allowed some open rules, but we don't even get modified open rules  anymore.   Mr. Speaker, we are seeing an alarming rise in the number of self- executing rules, what Republicans used to call ``deem and pass rules.''  Now, let me explain what that is.   In his book, ``Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative  Leaders,'' our dear Speaker, Mr. Ryan, described the self-execution  process. This is on page 98, if you are following along. But he called  this process, ``legislative trickery to enact legislation that does not  have majority backing.''   Now, sometime today we are going to go back up to the Rules Committee  to do a little legislative trickery to fund the President's border  wall.   News flash: Mexico is not paying for the wall. The language that the  Speaker intends to deem passed without a vote uses good old-fashioned  American greenbacks to pay for Trump's wall. The American taxpayers are  going to be stuck with this bill for this ridiculous wall.   Mr. Speaker, this process is not good; it is not a better way; it is  rotten; and the rule the majority will put on this floor tomorrow will  be even worse. We are jamming through these important appropriation  bills together, limiting debate, and moving further away from regular  order.                                time  1315    We don't need this rule, and we don't need a self-executing rule  tomorrow. Now, if we defeat the previous question on this rule, I will  offer an amendment to open up this process and consider the Department  of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Energy and  Water Appropriation bills each under an open rule.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just conclude with this, Mr. Speaker: Members have a chance to  vote for an open amendment process on these appropriations bills. That  is what this PQ vote is about. Republicans will not control this House  forever, and I hope that no Member who votes against this open rule  amendment today will have the audacity to criticize any future  Democratic majorities.   If they do, Mr. Speaker, I assure you, we will remind them of this  vote.   To discuss our proposal, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by  a number of civil rights groups, education groups, environmental  groups, and women's groups in opposition to this minibus.                                                      July 25, 2017.      Re Oppose H.R. 3219 Security Minibus--Vote No on Border wall.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our coalition of almost       90 environmental, faith, immigration, and civil rights       organizations, we are writing to strongly urge you to oppose       funding for the continued construction of a border wall along       the U.S.-Mexico border. The construction of a border wall       serves as a symbol of hostility towards immigrants, and       undermines the civil rights of communities living along our       southern border. It also imposes environmental costs and       natural disaster threats on border communities, especially       indigenous communities, harms native wildlife and wastes tens       of billions in taxpayer dollars.        As the House moves to consider the Fiscal Year 2018       Security Minibus, H.R. 3219, we are profoundly concerned       about the inclusion of $1.6 billion slated for border wall.       In addition to spending billions of taxpayer dollars, adding       funding for the border wall in this legislative package       undermines a fair and transparent legislative process.       Instead of allowing legislators and the public to fully       consider the impacts of funding wall construction, the       Majority is using rushed and underhanded legislative       maneuvers to circumvent the vast and legitimate opposition       that exists for this measure, even within their own party.        Including border wall funding in a Security Minibus is       based on the false premise that our borders are somehow       violent and insecure. This false premise has been used to       justify and advance anti-immigrant, anti-border, pro-      criminalization, and anti-environment legislation that has       negative economic and civil rights impacts on border       communities. The fact is that communities along the border       are some of the safest in the country. According to the FBI's       Uniformed Crime Reports, cities on the border are safer than       cities away from the border. Places like El Paso, Texas have       long topped the lists of safest cities for their low crime       and violence. Additionally, according to the American       Immigration Council, communities with more immigrants are       likely to be safer than places with fewer immigrants.        Border walls are an ineffective tool in curbing       undocumented migration between the United States and nations       south of the border. Rather than deter migration, the current       650-mile barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border has forced       vulnerable migrant populations to pursue more dangerous       routes of travel. The continued construction of a border wall       portrays an attitude of hatred and animosity towards our       neighboring nations. Additionally, construction of this wall       would undermine indigenous border communities, potentially       destroying elements of their history, archeology, and       culture. Border security measures must consider the historic       Tribal lands and families occupying the southern border.        Finally, the current proposal in Fiscal Year 2018 Security       Minibus calls for the construction of 60 miles of levee       border wall in the South Texas Rio Grande Valley; 28 miles       would be levee-border wall, with 2.9 miles slated to be built       in the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge. This Refuge is home to       diverse wildlife species, ecotourism opportunities, and rich       natural beauty. When levee border walls are constructed, they       negatively impact wildlife migration, pose severe flooding       risks, destroy natural habitats, and lead to potential       increased extinction rates. In order to construct existing       border-walls, dozens of laws protecting our environment,       public health, and sacred natural lands were waived. Our       nation's natural habitats, vibrant wildlife, and healthy       ecosystems are an unacceptable sacrifice to make for       ineffective security measures.        For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to vote       NO on the Fiscal Year 2018 Security Minibus, and oppose       funding for border walls, levees, or additional       infrastructure along the southern border of the United       States.        Thank you for your consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by  18 environmental groups opposed to H.R. 3219.                                                      July 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,       the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose H.R. 3219,       the so-called Make American Secure Appropriations Act, 2018,       which includes the Defense, Military Construction and       Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water       funding bills. This package includes provisions that are       harmful to water and ocean resources, cuts funding for clean       energy innovation, undermines safe nuclear waste storage, and       attacks border communities. Furthermore, this bill continues       the House Leadership's pattern of adding harmful policy       riders into spending bills in an attempt to avoid regular       order. Lastly, the inclusion of $1.6 billion for the       continued construction of a failed, divisive, and anti-      environmental wall along the southern border of the United       States would be the latest example of inserting harmful,       controversial and even radical policy proposals onto spending       bills, which undermines the legislative process and the       already complex budget process. This bill reflects a set of       values that is not shared by the American people--one of       clean air and clean water, one of equity and prosperity, one       of safety and security.                            Border Wall Provisions         The border wall is a powerful symbol of hatred toward       immigrants and undermines the civil rights of communities       along our southern border, and it would increase the       environmental and natural disaster risks to border       communities, harm wildlife, and waste billions of taxpayer       dollars on an ineffective border security tool. The current       proposal would lead to the construction of 60 miles of new       border wall to be built in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas,       including levee-border walls and 2.9 miles built within the       Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. This refuge is home to       diverse wildlife species, ecotourism opportunities, and rich       natural beauty. When levee-border walls are constructed, they       negatively impact wildlife migration, pose severe flooding       risks, destroy natural habitats, and can increase the risk of       wildlife extinctions occurring. In order to construct       existing border walls, dozens of laws protecting our       environment, public health, and sacred natural lands were       waived. Our nation's natural habitats, vibrant wildlife, and       healthy ecosystems are an unacceptable sacrifice to make for       ineffective security measures.                               Water Provisions         The Energy and Water Appropriations division includes       damaging policy riders and report language in contravention       of regular order. Specifically, Sec. 108(a) aims to allow the       Trump administration to disregard countless laws as it       carries out a scheme to undermine clean water safeguards. The       provision would authorize EPA and the Army Corps to repeal       the Clean Water Rule without following basic and longstanding       processes aimed at giving people a voice in their       government's actions. For instance, a repeal could ignore       Clean Water Act and Administrative Procedure Act requirements       to meaningfully consider public comment. It could also       interfere with the courts' ability to review if the       withdrawal is ``arbitrary or capricious.'' This fact reveals       the real motivation for the rider--its proponents want to       shield the Trump administration's repeal of carefully-      developed clean water protections from public scrutiny and       from independent judicial review. Without the Clean Water       Rule, the streams that help supply public drinking water       systems serving one in three Americans will remain at risk.        Additionally, Sec. 107 would exempt certain discharges of       dredged or fill material from Army Corps' permitting under       the Clean Water Act. The Act already exempts these kinds of       activities from such permits, but requires permitting when       the impacts to waterways would be more harmful. This rider       would have the effect of nullifying Congress's direction to       subject those nonexempt discharges to pollution control       officials' review. Another rider would undermine the       restoration of the San Joaquin River, the second longest       river in California. Sec. 203 would prohibit spending any       funds to implement the legal settlement between the United       States, fishing and conservation groups, and Friant water       users regarding the restoration of the river. The settlement       ended 20 years of litigation and continues to be supported by       water users, conservation and fishing groups, and state and       federal governments.        Finally, the bill also includes a provision to halt       implementation of the National Ocean Policy (Sec. 505), an       important planning tool to coordinate the work of dozens of       federal and state agencies with overlapping and sometimes       conflicting responsibilities for addressing ocean       development. These riders, and any further damaging policy       provisions that will be offered, undercut the public process       for determining how to implement the laws that Congress has       passed. They are bad policies that will put American's health       and safety at risk and they have no place on a funding bill.                              Energy Provisions         The bill also dramatically cuts federal clean energy       spending, which has consistently proven its worth by       directing RD&D funds that drive job creation, economic growth       and reduce health and environmental costs. The committee bill       cuts funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and       Renewable Energy by $1 billion (48% reduction) hurting       important programs that support the development and       deployment of wind energy, solar energy, advanced       manufacturing, sustainable transportation technologies, and       building technologies. Recklessly, the bill eliminates       funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy       (ARPA-E) and the Title 17 loan guarantee program. Defunding       ARPA-E cripples our ability to commercialize new technologies       that will serve to meet our future clean energy needs.       Furthermore, the Title 17 loan guarantee program has a strong       track record of lowering the risks on deploying projects that       can make cleaner and cheaper energy a reality.        The bill also includes $120 million in a continued attempt       to push the unworkable, long ago rejected proposal to dispose       of nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. It also includes       a rider in Sec. 507 that prevents funds being used to close       the facility. Decades from now others will face the precise       predicament we find ourselves in today if Congress tries to       ram through unworkable nuclear waste solutions contentiously       opposed by States, lacking a sound legal structure of       science-based foundation, and devoid of public understanding       and consent. The current efforts to quickly open Yucca       Mountain and an interim storage facility simply will not       work.        This bill also rejects the sensible plan to cancel the       risky and enormously costly mixed oxide (MOX) program,       intended to dispose of excess plutonium from the U.S. nuclear       weapons program by turning it into nuclear reactor fuel.       Instead this bill mandates that the Department of Energy       waste an additional $340 million on construction of the MOX       fuel fabrication plant. Congress should reject the MOX       program and support an improved approach for disposing of       excess plutonium.        We strongly oppose this minibus package, which would put       our energy future at risk and would harm border communities,       and it includes poison pill riders that will harm our       nation's public health, air, water, lands, and wildlife. We       also urge opposition to any amendments that would harm health       and the environment.            Sincerely,        Alaska Wilderness League, Clean Water Action, Defenders of       Wildlife, Earthjustice, Environment America, Environmental       Protection Information Center, Klamath Forest Alliance,       League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense       Council, NextGen, Public Citizen, Restore America's       Estuaries, San Juan Citizens Alliance, Save EPA, Sierra Club,       Western Environmental Law Center, Western Watersheds Project,       Wildlands Network.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Coalition on Human Needs against this minibus.                                       Coalition on Human Needs,                                      Washington, DC, July 25, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Coalition on Human       Needs, I strongly urge you to vote against the package of       military-related appropriations bills expected to come to the       House floor this week. These appropriations bills--including       those for Defense, Military Construction and Veterans'       Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water--should not       be taken up until there is a bipartisan agreement to lift the       sequestration caps called for in the Budget Control Act in a       way that provides for increased funding for domestic and       international (non-defense discretionary, or NDD)       appropriations, not just for the military.        As you know, defense appropriations exceed the Budget       Control Act cap for FY 2018 by $72 billion. Without       legislation to raise the caps, sequestration will eliminate       that increase through across-the-board cuts to military       programs. Legislation to lift the caps requires bipartisan       support, and we expect that support will not be forthcoming       without an agreement to raise the caps for non-defense       discretionary spending as well.        The Coalition on Human Needs, which is made up of       organizations representing millions of human service       providers, faith organizations, policy experts, civil rights,       labor, and other advocates concerned with meeting the needs       of low-income and vulnerable people, strongly believes that       our national security depends on a balanced approach that       invests in our domestic needs. Our people gain economic       security from access to education and training, affordable       housing, a reliable and modern infrastructure, and child care  [[Page H6321]]       and other work supports. We need public health protections       from epidemics and environmental protections to ensure clean       air and water and to protect against climate disasters.       Stopping the erosion in domestic human needs programs is       necessary for our security and our future. NDD programs apart       from Veterans Affairs will be cut by $22 billion in FY 2018,       5 percent below the previous year and 17 percent below the       level in FY 2010, taking inflation into account. This harsh       cut abandons previous congressional commitments to provide       defense and non-defense programs with equal relief from       sequestration. We urge you to vote against this package of       defense-related bills because they should not be considered       without a comprehensive agreement to lift the caps for all       the programs that contribute to our security.        We also ask you to vote against this package of       appropriations bills because it includes wasteful funding for       the border wall that will not increase our security, and to       oppose extraneous and irresponsible policy riders such as       those restricting opportunities for young people in the       Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to enter the       military or weakening the Congressional Budget Office.        Please vote no on this package of appropriations bills, and       instead make it a top priority to achieve a bipartisan       agreement to lift sequestration caps for non-defense       programs, not solely for the military.            Sincerely yours,                                                 Deborah Weinstein,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to my  colleagues from AFSCME opposed to this bill.                                                         AFSCME,                                      Washington, DC, July 24, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the ``Minibus''       appropriations bill which packages together the Defense,       Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs, Legislative       Branch, and Energy and Water funding bills.        Congress should not craft funding bills that unilaterally       violate the Budget Control Act (BCA) and the parity       principle. In this case, defense is increased far above the       cap while non-defense discretionary (NDD) spending is       severely underfunded. In fact, passing this bill will not       promote American security; rather it charts a direct course       for deep cuts to the military. The defense funding levels       would trigger sequestration in January of 2018, requiring       cuts of $72 billion. Further, dramatically increasing only       defense funding endangers investments in essential public       services. This is evidenced by House Appropriations bills'       deep cuts of $5 billion below the current non-defense caps       and deep cuts that harm labor, health, human services,       education, housing, transportation and other important       programs. Instead of reaching a bipartisan agreement as       called for by many members of Congress, this bill makes it       harder to address urgent needs in other non-defense programs.        A budget deal remains the most likely path toward enactment       of appropriation bills that responsibly meet the nation's       national security commitments and domestic needs. AFSCME       urges Congress to focus attention on a budget solution that       provides commensurate increases for both defense and non-      defense funding. This is the best way to avoid a fall budget       showdown that would leave defense and all government       programs, including state and local governments, in the lurch       with considerable budget uncertainty and the threat of deep       and damaging cuts.        We also oppose this minibus package, because it includes       poison pill riders. This bill creates a new level of       egregious riders by air-dropping in controversial funding for       a border wall that is unrelated to any of the four bills.        It's time to address the most basic of congressional       responsibilities, which means passing clean funding bills in       a timely manner under regular order.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, finally, I include in the Record a letter  sent to my colleagues in opposition to this bill from American  Federation of Teachers.                                American Federation of Teachers,                                      Washington, DC, July 26, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, I write to express       our strong opposition to the Make America Secure       Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3219), the fiscal year 2018       appropriations ``minibus'' bill that bundles together the       appropriations bills for defense, energy and water       development, military construction, Veterans Affairs and the       legislative branch. We oppose this bill because it moves in       the wrong direction by failing to lift the sequester caps in       a manner that maintains parity between defense and nondefense       discretionary funding, and by including ideological poison       pill riders.        Our national security is critical, but it requires       investments that help working families seize the       opportunities they need and deserve, and appropriations bills       must invest in critical public services that enable these       opportunities. Sequester caps have unduly restricted these       kinds of foundational investments; without removing arbitrary       caps, crucial investments will suffer. Yet instead of working       toward a bipartisan deal to lift these punitive funding caps       in a way that treats nondefense discretionary funding       equitably, the speaker is moving forward with a minibus       package that promotes a strategy to drastically cut       nondefense programs as a means to increase defense funding.       This must not be an either-or choice: National security       requires strength at home and opportunities for our next       generation, not the elimination of the funding they need to       create those opportunities.        In addition, the well-being of the nation is further       undermined in this bill by the inclusion of ideological       poison pill policy riders. We particularly object to the       inclusion of funding for an ill-conceived and mean-spirited       border wall that is unrelated to any of the four       appropriations bills included in the minibus.        As the defense portion of this bill violates the Budget       Control Act, the increases in funding proposed by this bill       are imaginary. The cuts this bill proposes are not.        I urge you to reject this bill and work to raise the       sequester caps, to allow balanced funding bills--ones that       adequately invest in the health, safety and education of our       nation, and do not include ideological poison pill policy       riders--to move forward. Until this has been accomplished, we       urge you to oppose this bill.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my good friend from  Oklahoma: The Republicans presided over the most closed Congress in  history in the last session. In history. And this year you are on your  way to beating that record.   The gentleman talks about exceptional speed in which we are moving  these appropriations bills to the floor. I am not so much impressed  with exceptional speed when it comes to the spending of billions of  taxpayer dollars. I want to make sure we get it right. That is why we  are asking for an open process.   The gentleman talked about poison pills. Let me go back to the  Barbara Lee AUMF amendment. I hardly consider that a poison pill when  it was unanimously approved in the Appropriations Committee, and the  gentleman even voted for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record a letter from Amnesty International rejecting  the border wall funding.                                          Amnesty International,                                      Washington, DC, July 26, 2017.   Amnesty International USA Urges House to Reject Southern Border Wall                                  Funding         Dear Representative: On behalf of Amnesty International USA       and our more than one million members and supporters       nationwide, we strongly urge you to reject any and all       requests included in H.R. 3219 (Department of Defense       Appropriations Act, 2018 AKA Make America Secure       Appropriations Act, 2018) for the funding of a southern       border wall. The construction of such a wall would pose       serious human rights consequences and would violate       international law and standards in two major ways.        First, Congress should not approve funding for a wall that       will cut through tribal land unless the U.S. government first       obtains the free, prior, and informed consent of affected       Nations, as prescribed by Article 19 of the United Nations       (``UN'') Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The       U.S. must consult in good faith with Native American Nations       who would be impacted by the construction of the proposed       wall. The National Congress of American Indians and the       Legislative Council of the Tohono O'odham, the second-largest       tribe in the United States by land holdings, have both passed       resolutions opposing the construction of the wall without       tribal consent. Without the free, prior, and informed consent       of affected Native American Nations, the House cannot approve       border wall funding without violating the UN Declaration on       the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.        Second, the construction of a border wall risks escalation       of the already serious violations experienced by asylum       seekers seeking to enter the U.S. In order to provide a fair       asylum process, the U.S. must ensure the existence of       sufficiently located, secure, regulated border crossing       points for asylum seekers. This is essential to ensure that       the U.S. government does not violate the principle of non-      refoulement, which is enshrined in the 1951 UN Convention       Relating to the Status of Refugees and binding on States       Party to the 1967 Protocol.        Amnesty International strongly urges you to reject funding       for a southern border wall, in order to uphold U.S.       obligations with respect to Native Americans and arriving       asylum seekers.            Sincerely,                                                     Joanne Lin,                                  Senior Managing Director, Advocacy                                          and Government Relations.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter opposing  the funding for the wall from the League of United Latin American  Citizens.                                              League of United Latin                                               American Citizens,                                      Washington, DC, July 19, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the League of United       Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the nation's oldest and       largest Latino civil rights organization, I write to oppose       any legislative attempts to keep funding the construction of       a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the expansion of a Trump       deportation force, and the increase of detention beds in       immigrant incarceration centers.        As the House moves to consider the Fiscal Year 18       Department of Homeland Security Appropriation bill, and other       security related bills, LULAC is deeply concerned about       language that would provide billions for the construction of       a costly and divisive wall along the Southern border, as well       as hundreds of millions to hire a deportation force and       expand immigrant incarceration.        The continued criminalization of immigrants, militarization       of the border, and rush to build a costly, ineffective, and       destructive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border are aims of       radical politicians seeking to advance a xenophobic, anti-      Latino agenda in this Congress. Unfortunately, this       administration has failed to focus on legitimate staffing       concerns at ports of entry, rebuilding port infrastructure,       and protecting the land, water, and environment of the       border. Instead, it is looking to seize the private property       of border residents, destroy the natural habitat and wildlife       in border communities, endanger border water supplies, and       turn immigrant neighbors, families, and children into       criminals who merit incarceration and deportation.        The House of Representatives should not enable these aims       and should oppose any language seeking to advance the radical       right-wing agenda of demonizing border communities and       scapegoating immigrants. LULAC opposes any DHS appropriation       bill, or any other appropriation vehicle, that funds border       walls/levees, the hiring of Trump's deportation force and the       continued expansion immigrant incarceration.            Sincerely,                                               Roger C. Rocha, Jr.,                                          LULAC National President.     I include in the Record a fact sheet by the Washington  Office on Latin America entitled: ``Key points about the $1.6 billion  border wall.''                                                      July 24, 2017.        Please find below a rigorously sourced analysis of the $1.6       billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.       The border wall funding is expected to be attached to the       appropriations ``minibus'' in the Rules Committee later this       week.        As a leading research and advocacy organization with years       of field research and experience working on migration and       border security issues, WOLA (the Washington Office on Latin       America) outlines a number of reasons why this proposal will       be costly, ineffective, and divisive.        WOLA believes that these are overwhelming reasons to oppose       President Trump's request for a border wall and to vote       against its inclusion in a bill claiming to fund national       security. Regardless of party, it is clear that $1.6 billion       spent to start building the wall is money wasted.        Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any       questions or would like more information.            Best regards,                                                      Adam Isacson.        [From the Washington Office on Latin America, July 24, 2017]               Key Points about the $1.6 Billion Border Wall     A Costly, Ineffective, and Divisive Border Wall Doesn't Belong in a                    ``National Security'' Appropriation         The House of Representatives is rushing to the floor four       Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 appropriations bills related to       national security, which will be combined into a so-called       ``minibus.'' In addition, the House Republican leadership is       expected to carve out the most controversial part of the       Homeland Security appropriations bill--President Trump's full       request to fund the border wall--and use a procedural       maneuver in the Rules Committee to attach it to this week's       funding bill. Along with money for our military, veterans,       and other defense-related items, the House is expected to       consider $1.6 billion to start building President Trump's       proposed border wall.                       The border wall would be costly         The bill would fund the Trump administration's full request       for $1.6 billion to build 60 miles of new border wall and       fortify 14 miles of existing wall. That comes out to $21.2       million per mile. This is more than four times the $4.84       million per mile cost of fencing built since 2011.        At the rate proposed by President Trump, building       additional fencing along the 1,317 border miles that lack it       would cost $28 billion. And that figure doesn't count the       cost of building in more difficult terrain, access roads,       maintenance, or acquiring land in Texas, where almost all       border landholdings are privately held.        Building the wall carries a huge opportunity cost. $1.6       billion could support many more important border security       priorities. These include upgrading and hiring more personnel       for ports of entry, the main vector for illegal drugs. The       ports have $5 billion in unmet infrastructure needs. They       could include more technology so that border-security       agencies have a better idea of what is happening along the       border. This would make continued National Guard deployments       unnecessary. They could include greatly increased investment       in moving costs and bonuses for Border Patrol agents who       agree to relocate from quieter border sectors to busier ones       in need of manpower.                     The border wall would be ineffective         The proposed border wall will not stop drug trafficking. To       understand drug trafficking across the U.S.-Mexico border,       it's first necessary to understand the difference  [[Page H6323]]       between ``ports of entry''--the 44 official land border       crossings--and the vast spaces between them, where fencing       exists or where Trump's wall would be built. The ports of       entry are where U.S. border authorities seize the majority of       heroin and opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine. ``The big       issue, really, right now on drugs coming into the United       States is the ports of entry,'' Homeland Security Secretary       John Kelly told a Senate committee in April. Building a wall       would have no effect on smuggling at ports of entry.        Meanwhile, in the rural border areas where the White House       proposes to build, a wall really isn't much of a barrier. It       slows individuals down for the 10 or 15 minutes it takes to       climb over. In a populated area, where authorities can       respond quickly, that 10 or 15 minutes makes a big       difference. But almost all of these areas already have high       fences, because of the hundreds of miles of building that       followed the Secure Fence Act of 2006. In emptier areas,       reducing a border crosser's head start by 10 to 15 minutes is       hardly a deterrent--and in Texas, the Rio Grande already       serves that purpose.                      The border wall would be dangerous         More wall-building could have tragic consequences.       Violence, poverty, and family ties ensure that migrants will       continue attempting the risky journey through the border       region's inhospitable wilderness zones. Every year, U.S.       authorities find the remains of hundreds of migrants, dead of       dehydration and exposure in deserts and scrublands. With more       fencing, migrants may attempt the crossing in even more       remote areas, where the probability of death will be even       higher.                      The border wall would be divisive         Building a wall sends a toxic message to one of our two       closest neighbors, a country on whose cooperation the United       States' national security and economic prosperity depends.       Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner.       Our common border is 1,970 miles long. Mexico collaborates on       efforts to guard against extra-regional terrorists       hypothetically using its territory to enter the United       States. After 12 years of steadily declining migration, more       Mexican citizens leave the United States than enter it each       year. In January, it extradited its most notorious drug lord       to the United States.        It makes no sense to undermine this relationship by       building a permanent barrier along our border with Mexico. It       makes no sense to jeopardize badly needed cooperation by       portraying Mexico as a sinister source of threats that should       foot the bill for the wall (which, the 2018 appropriation       makes clear, it will not have to do). Mexico certainly has       problems, particularly corruption and human rights abuse. But       these are aspects of the relationship the United States must       work on, rather than push Mexico away with an aggressive       construction project.                      The border wall should be rejected         WOLA believes that these are overwhelming reasons to oppose       President Trump's request for a border wall and to vote       against its inclusion in a bill claiming to fund national       security. Regardless of party, it is clear that $1.6 billion       spent to start building the wall is money wasted. Let's stop       this now before it becomes even larger, more costly, more       counterproductive, and more divisive.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an NBC News  article on how the border wall is being planned to decimate the  National Butterfly Center in the wildlife corridor of the lower Rio  Grande Valley.                       [From NBC News, July 26, 2017]   Border Wall Push Creates Flap in House--And at the National Butterfly                                   Center                            (By Suzanne Gamboa)         Washington.--A national butterfly preserve is the latest       flashpoint in the border wall debate as Democrats accuse the       GOP of rigging the process to slip wall funding into a pack       of House spending bills possibly up for a vote this week.        While there are not specific details on exactly where $1.6       billion proposed for President Trump's border wall will be       spent, an amendment sponsored by Rep. John Carter, R-Texas,       calls for $498 million to go to 28 miles of ``new bollard       levee wall'' in Hidalgo County in Texas' Rio Grande Valley--      home to the National Butterfly Center.        The amendment also calls for $251 million to repair       secondary border fencing in the San Diego area and $38.2       million for planning future border wall construction. Another       $784 million is for 32 miles of ``border bollard fencing'' in       Starr County, Texas, also in the Rio Grande Valley.        The butterfly center's executive director Marianna Trevino       Wright said she found a work crew on the butterfly center's       property last week, and she worried that their efforts might       be related to construction of the proposed border wall. The       workers had chain saws and work trucks and had cut and shred       brush, trees and plants, she said. Trevino Wright said she       found surveyor stakes and ``X'' marks on the property. She       posted photos on the center's web site and Facebook page.        The 100-acre center is part of the wildlife corridor of the       lower Rio Grande Valley, which is a migratory flyway for       birds, butterflies and a host of other wildlife. The center's       property already is bisected by earthen levees. Two thirds of       the property is below the levee, Trevino Wright said.        ``The property we have acquired here used to be a       commercial onion farm and we have spent the last 15 years       fundraising for our efforts and growing plants and purchasing       materials to revegetate this area, to plant native, host and       nectar plants and provide breeding and feeding areas to       support wildlife, especially butterflies,'' she said.        ``We do have folks who come from around the state, nation,       world for the birds and butterflies and other things we have       here on the property. Sometimes people show up looking for       indigo snakes,'' Trevino Wright said.        In a previously issued statement, the Army Corps of       Engineers denied that its contractors cleared or removed       trees at the center, but acknowledged the crew placed X       markings on the ground for mapping and wooden stakes flagging       proposed locations to bore holes for possible construction.       The agency said its contractor collected two soil samples       from the levee but did so away from the butterfly center.        Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Army Corps       of Engineers, nor other agencies have outlined plans for the       proposed border wall on the center property.        Still, Trevino Wright and her supporters worry about what       the center called on Facebook the ``government secret       activity on our property.''        There also is angst over the possibility of border wall       construction in another refuge along the Rio Grande--the San       Ana Wildlife Refuge. It is considered the ``crown jewel'' of       wildlife refuges and one of the nation's top birding spots.       The Texas Observer first reported that crews were taking core       samples, setting off a reaction among birders who flock to       the spot that boasts 400 species of birds.        The American Birding Association put out a plea to its       members to write and call their members of Congress asking       that they stop construction of the wall.        Carlos Diaz, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection,       told NBC News he did not have information on what plans or       hopes there are for putting fencing or a wall on the       butterfly center's property or the Santa Ana Refuge.        In a previously issued news release following a meeting       with Rio Grande Valley mayors last week, Customs and Border       Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers said in a news       release they are conducting research activities in areas       slated for construction of new or replacement border wall,       with $20 million in reprogrammed funds approved by Congress.        Also money provided for fiscal 2017 is being used to       replace pedestrian barriers in San Diego and El Centro,       California; replace vehicle barriers and pedestrian barriers       in El Paso, Texas and install 35 new gates at gaps in border       fencing built already in the Rio Grande Valley, according to       Army Corps of Engineers information provided by Diaz.        In a hearing Monday held by the U.S. House Rules Committee,       Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., pointed out that American       taxpayers are footing the tab for the border wall work, not       Mexico as Trump had promised. That's a point that should be       debated and could be if the border wall funding was given       it's own vote, he said.        ``This is a rigged process,'' McGovern said.        With Congress closing in on a summer recess, the House is       trying to push through a batch of four spending bills the GOP       has said are critical for security. But the GOP plan to       include $1.6 million for 74 miles of President Donald Trump's       border ``wall'' means those who oppose the border wall       funding have to vote against the military spending.        Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who chairs the Rules       Committee, said Monday he made the amendment providing the       border wall money ``self-executing,'' setting up the dilemma       for opponents of the wall funding.        ``You are dadgum right I put it in there,'' Sessions said.        ``We are going to comply with allowing the president to       have things he wants also,'' he said.        Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., called the move ``sneaky'' and       said House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP House members were doing       Trump's ``dirty work.''        ``They want to make sure Trump can build his wall, but they       also want desperately to avoid a clean up or down vote on the       issue,'' Gallego told reporters in a call Monday.        Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said in an email       that House and Senate Republicans' agenda includes a       commitment to increased border security ``and we are       following through on that promise.''     Mr. Speaker, process matters. And I have come to the  conclusion, after having served here for some time now, that a lousy  process leads to a lousy product and lousy legislation.   I know many of my colleagues were moved, like I was yesterday, when  Senator John McCain appeared on the Senate floor and not only engaged  in Senate business, but actually gave a very eloquent, passionate  speech.   I want to quote Senator McCain from yesterday. He said: ``Let's  return to regular order. We've been spinning our wheels on too many  important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without  help from across the aisle.  [[Page H6324]]  That's an approach that's been employed by both sides, mandating  legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side,  with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires.   ``We're getting nothing done.''   I agree with Senator McCain, and I believe that a majority in this  House, Democrats and Republicans, agree with Senator McCain. But at  some point we have to stop saying: ``Well, we will get better. We will  get better. It will be better next time. It will be better next time.''   Because what is happening is, it is getting worse each time we bring  legislations or appropriations to the floor. We are getting more and  more restrictive. We are shutting out more and more voices, not just  Democratic voices, but Republican voices as well.   This is a deliberative body. We ought to be able to deliberate a  little bit. And both Democrats and Republicans have good ideas. Let us  use this opportunity to change things, to go back to the regular order  that Senator McCain talked so eloquently about yesterday.   There is an opportunity to do that. It doesn't stop us considering  the appropriations bills, but what it says is that we will do so under  an open rule. We will go back to the way we all say we want it to be,  an open process.   If you like some of these amendments, you vote for them. You make  this legislation better. If you don't like the amendments, then you  vote against them. I mean, that is the way this body is supposed to  operate; none of this underhanded, self-executing of controversial  provisions that may not have the support of the majority in this House.   Let's go back to regular order. This is the moment. This is a  defining moment.                                time  1330    Democrats and Republicans, if you really mean it when you say you  want regular order, then you have to vote for regular order once in a  while. You can't keep on making excuses. I think this is the moment  that we have on these appropriations bills to send a message to the  leadership that we want things done differently here. We want to open  things up. I think that is what the majority on both sides really want.  But the question is whether or not we all have the guts to vote for an  open process. So we have an opportunity to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can bring this legislation up today under an open rule. Let  everybody offer their amendments. Let's bring it up. Let's do this  today. No more excuses.   If you mean what you say when you say you want regular order, this is  the opportunity to vote for it. So please vote ``no'' on the previous  question. And I oppose the underlying bill. Maybe I won't if we can fix  it through regular order. Maybe we can add a number of amendments, and  even I would support some of these amendments.   Let's give it a chance. Let's work in a bipartisan way. Let's go back  to the days when we did have open rules on appropriations. This is the  opportunity to do it. Vote ``no'' on the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
