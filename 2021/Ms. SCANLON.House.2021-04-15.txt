 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Cardinal  O'Hara Lady Lions basketball team, which recently won the PIAA class 5A  [[Page H1836]]  girls championship, securing their first-ever State basketball title.   On March 27, the team defeated the defending champion, Chartiers  Valley, 51-27, led by junior Sydni Scott's game-high 16 points.   The victory made history on several fronts. Not only was this the  school's first State basketball championship, but it also marked just  the third time a mother-daughter duo has won a PIAA state title, with  Coach Chrissie Doogan at the helm and her daughter Maggie playing  forward. O'Hara's win also gave the Philadelphia Catholic League the  distinction of becoming the first league to win three straight girls'  titles in the same year.   The young women of Cardinal O'Hara are an inspiration to our Delaware  Valley community. Congratulations to the entire Lady Lions basketball  team. Keep making HERstory.                            ____________________
