 Mr. Speaker, I rise this December in reflective  remembrance and commemoration of the valiant lives of the famed four  American churchwomen, who were brutally raped and murdered by the El  Salvadoran military 40 years ago on December 2, 1980.   Their names were Sisters Dorothy Kazel, Ita Ford, Maura Clarke, and  Jean Donovan. Their mission, and ultimately their lives, were  sacrificed to the service of the forgotten and the impoverished in El  Salvador. These courageous women of faith were hallmarks of their  community and their mission of accompaniment in the nation amidst  turmoil.   Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, in the midst of a civil war, the U.S.  Government funded and supported the El Salvadoran military that on  December 2, 1980, murdered these evangelical saints. In their  protection and companionship of refugee families, they were targeted as  enemies of national interest in the country. These four women were  nothing less than lionhearts of political and social righteousness that  respected all people.   Mr. Speaker, in recognizing their legacy, I ask for a moment of  silence as we recall, each time we mourn their names, the loss of these  four saints.                            ____________________
