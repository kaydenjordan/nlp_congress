 Mr. President, I wish to recognize an  extraordinary educator, Dr. Juliette Bell, for her 6 years of  outstanding service as president of the University of Maryland Eastern  Shore. Dr. Bell has left a lasting legacy of accomplishment.   During Dr. Bell's tenure, UMES reached new levels of achievement,  including being ranked as one of the Nation's best Historically Black  Colleges and Universities, being a top producer of African-American  pharmacists, becoming a doctoral research university, establishing the  engineering and aviation science complex, experiencing an increase in  student graduation rates, and improving relationships and collaboration  between the university and the community. Thanks to her focus on  inclusion and her commitment to the success of all students, Dr. Bell  truly made a difference in the lives of UMES' students.   Dr. Bell's leadership has been recognized beyond the UMES campus. A  renowned biochemist and scholar, she has received numerous prestigious  national honors and awards, including the Millennium Award for  Excellence in Teaching from the White House Initiative on Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, the NAFEO Research Excellence Award,  the Minority Access, Inc., National Role Model Mentoring Award, and the  University of North Carolina Board of Governors' Award for Excellence  in Teaching. She has also been named a Giant in Science by Quality  Education for Minorities and was featured as one of 10 African-American  life scientists in an exhibition at the Chicago Museum of Science and  Industry entitled ``Defying Tradition: African American Women in  Science and Technology.'' She has also been named one of Maryland's Top  100 Women.   Throughout her distinguished career, Dr. Bell has been a role model  for many, including women and women of color, especially those seeking  to pursue careers in STEM fields. I ask my colleagues to join me in  expressing our gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Juliette Bell for all  that she has done for students, the State of Maryland, and our entire  Nation.                            ____________________
