 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share another good news  story from Ohio's Ninth Congressional District.   With the new Ninth District stretching from the Indiana border to  Sandusky County and beyond, my team and I are wasting no time in  getting out and introducing ourselves and making new friends.   Over the Thanksgiving break, I had the pleasure of stopping by Tackle  Box 2 in Fremont, Ohio, an iconic fish house pub along the banks of the  Sandusky River. That fish house is home to a remarkable array of  fishing memorabilia, tasty food, especially the perch, and a very  friendly and welcoming staff, as you will see here.   Pictured are Angela, Rose, Carla, and Linda, new friends I made who  take pride in their hard work and their community. In the hard jobs  that they work, they serve guests with a welcoming smile--wonderful,  smiley faces--and such a warm presence.   Angela, Rose, Carla, and Linda, as we move into the excitement and  tugs of heart of the holiday season, may the joy each of you and your  colleagues make possible be returned to you sevenfold.   The ethic of hard work and kindness beats fully in the hearts of  these fine women.                            ____________________
