 Mr. Speaker, once again the Republican majority is  offering a bill that would harm working families. It has nothing to do  with saving local businesses, small businesses, and has everything to  do with limiting workers' rights and taking away workers' wages.   Between 2005 and 2015, 94 percent of net job growth was in  alternative work like temporary, contract, and on-call jobs. This isn't  our parents' workplace anymore, where one employer sets the rules and  pays the wages. Today, a corporation can set workplace rules while a  temp agency or subcontractor pays the wages. Today's workers need to be  able to bargain with both and to hold each accountable for labor law  violations.   Instead, this bill moves us backward. It would prevent working men  and women from bargaining for better wages and benefits and safer  working conditions with the corporations that have decisionmaking power  over their workplace.   It would allow corporations to rob working women and men of their  earned wages without giving those workers the right to recover. The  annual cost of wage theft is estimated at $50 billion this year.   It would immunize bad corporate actors and put small and big  businesses who respect their workers at a competitive disadvantage.   This bill is a bad deal, and workers know it.   I include in the Record a letter from the AFL-CIO and its 12 million  members.   If you support better wages and better jobs, vote ``no'' on this bad  bill.                                                         AFL-CIO                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.                             Legislative Alert         Dear Representative: On behalf of the 12 million working       women and men represented by the unions of the AFL-CIO, I am       writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 3441, the ``Save Local       Business Act.''        Proponents of the legislation claim that it is designed to       repeal the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB's) 2015       decision in Browning Ferris Industries, in which the NLRB       clarified its legal test for determining whether two       employers are joint employers of certain employees. In fact,       H.R. 3441 rolls back worker protections so they are weaker       than when Congress adopted the National Labor Relations Act       in 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938. It is       harmful legislation that will undermine workers' pay and       protections on the job.        Browning Ferris concerned a group of workers on a recycling       line at a facility owned and operated by Browning Ferris. The       workers were supplied by a staffing agency--Leadpoint.       Browning Ferris controlled the facility, set the hours of       operation, dictated the speed of the recycling line,       indirectly supervised the line workers, and had authority       over numerous other conditions of employment. In order to       ensure that the employees' right to form a union and bargain       over workplace issues was protected, the NLRB held that       Browning Ferris was a joint employer of the line workers       along with Leadpoint. This fact-intensive decision reflected       the realities of the arrangement at Browning Ferris and was       rightly decided in order for the line workers to have a       meaningful right to bargain over their terms and conditions       of employment.        Before the ink was dry on the Browning-Ferris decision,       business groups and Republicans in Congress began attacking       the decision, claiming it dramatically changed the law and       undermined the franchise business model. (Browning Ferris is       not a franchise case, a fact specifically noted by the NLRB       in its decision).        In our view, these attacks on the Browning Ferris decision       are overblown and misguided. In today's fragmented       workplaces, with perma-temps, contracted workers, agency       employees, and subcontracting becoming ever more prevalent,       it is more important than ever to make sure our laws protect       workers and ensure they receive the wages they are due and       that their right to join with their co-workers to bargain for       improvements on the job is protected.        H.R. 3441 takes the law in the opposite direction,       radically changing both the National Labor Relations Act and       the Fair Labor Standards Act by instituting a new test for       finding employers to be joint employers that is more       restrictive than any agency or court has ever adopted. As a       practical matter, the legislation eliminates joint employment       from the NLRA and the Fair Labor Standards Act, meaning that       many workers in subcontracting or staffing agency       arrangements will be left without recourse for wage theft and       will have no meaningful bargaining rights. The bill weakens       worker protections and allows corporations to evade their       responsibilities under the law.        We urge you to reject this harmful and misguided proposal.            Sincerely,                                                 William Samuel,                                                           Director,                                     Government Affairs Department.
