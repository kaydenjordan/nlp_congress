 Mr. President, I would like to wish my colleagues  happy new year. It is a time for new beginnings. Tomorrow, we will kick  off the 116th Congress.   Of course, there is urgent business that the new House and the new  Senate will need to tackle immediately. Democrats will finally have to  get serious about border security so a government funding agreement can  be reached that can pass the House, earn 60 votes in the Senate, and  get a Presidential signature. All three of those things are needed to  make a law. One partisan vote in the House tomorrow is not going to  solve anything.   I made it clear to the Speaker that we are not interested in having  show votes in the Senate. We are interested in bringing up something  the House has passed, 60 Senators will support, and the President will  sign; in other words, make a law.   The legislation House Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce  and have voted on tomorrow will not be a serious contribution to the  negotiations that are going on between the administration and the  incoming Democratic majority in the House. It isn't comprehensive. It  ignores the needs of border security. It is exactly the kind of  proposal you would expect if the incoming House Democrats were choosing  to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of  helping to govern the country; in other words, it is a total  nonstarter.   Will these new Democrats come to Washington ready to roll up their  sleeves, work together, and make laws or are they going to waste time  on partisan show votes that will do nothing to move the country in a  forward direction? That is the question, political performance art or  responsible governance?   We will get an early signal in the next few days, but let me make it  perfectly clear one more time, as I have  [[Page S8052]]  said consistently for the last 2 weeks: The Senate will not waste its  time considering a Democratic bill which cannot pass this Chamber and  which the President will not sign.                                 Nominations    Mr. President, on another matter, I am pleased to announce this  evening that the Democratic leader and I have reached an agreement to  confirm a number of the administration's nominees. In a few moments, I  will be asking unanimous consent to confirm a series of several well- qualified individuals to serve in important executive branch posts.  Each of them will be confirmed. I am glad the President will have more  of his rightful team in place, and I am glad this group of newly  confirmed nominees will be able to get to work on important business  for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following treaty on  today's Executive Calendar No. 7.
