 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I rise to  recognize Deborah Bowers Kippley for her years of dedicated public  service in the State of Nebraska. As an arts educator, Debbie's  leadership, skills, and initiatives have benefited the minds of our  youth for decades.   Debbie had a strong interest in the arts from an early age. In 1974,  she graduated from Omaha Burke High School where she participated in  band, orchestra, and art. She continued her education, obtaining a  bachelor's degree in art education and elementary education from  Hastings College.   After college, she toured with a Christian repertory theater company  before being hired as an elementary arts teacher for Omaha Public  Schools. During her time with OPS, Debbie participated in several  Nebraska art-based programs. After 13 years with OPS, she wanted to  start the elementary art program at Papillion La Vista Community  Schools.   After obtaining her master of science from the University of Nebraska  Omaha, she earned her doctorate in administration, curriculum and  instruction from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, concentrating on  the variation of people's ability to create mental images and the  effect this has on learning.   As someone who struggled with math, reading, and spelling during her  elementary years, Debbie believes her inability to create mental images  at that age was the cause of her struggles. Her conclusion was to  enhance the five senses by using art in learning in her elementary  teachings to better help students learn.   For the last nearly 40 years, Debbie has consistently given back to  the community. Just a few of her accolades include Elementary Educator  of the Year, president-elect and president of the Nebraska Art Teachers  Association, and the Nebraska Art Teachers Association Roscoe Shields  Award for her continued service to art education. She also assisted  with the writing and creation of hundreds of thousands of dollars in  grant money for the arts.   As a now-retired educator, Debbie continues to promote the arts by  her work with the Congressional Art Competition for the Nebraska  congressional districts, founded in 1998, and still manages the  Papillion La Vista Arts Network, providing a theater experience for  elementary and middle school students. Supervising art student teachers  for the University of Nebraska Omaha is another task that she loves,  and she is the president of the Papillion Downtown Business  Association.   Debbie has always believed in the power of the arts to heal,  encourage, and empower. This has been her mantra for all her years of  educating young minds.   I salute and thank Debbie for her impression upon the community, a  tremendous impact, which will be felt for many years to come.                            ____________________
