 Mr. Speaker, I share the frustration of the American  public who overwhelmingly support protecting young DREAMers,  authorizing the Children's Health Program and the community health  centers that serve them, and funding government long term, not week to  week.   Part of the solution is obvious: Donald Trump should not be in the  negotiations, in part, because he doesn't understand the complexities.  Indeed, it appears he doesn't even understand the basics. He frequently  changes his mind, agreeing with what he last saw on FOX News or heard  from the last person he talked to.   The weekend news was filled with accounts of his confusion and how  destructive his participation has been, acknowledged by Republicans and  Democrats alike, even frustrating his own staff.   Maybe it is time to just ignore Donald Trump and his tweets, send him  lots of cheeseburgers, and keep this news off FOX. Without Trump's  participation, we will reach a better solution, and we will do it  faster.                            ____________________
