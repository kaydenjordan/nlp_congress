 Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago today, this House passed a  constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. 274 Members  voted for it, but 136 voted against it. One Representative said:  ``Important issues cannot be decided by women's fears and tears and  emotions. They have to be decided by the real, manly men of America.''   One hundred years later, unfortunately, we hear similar comments. To  get our rights and to protect our rights, the battle continues. But  2018, Mr. Speaker, is the year of the women. We will never give up our  rights, we will never give up our votes, and we will never, ever give  up our voice.   Mr. Speaker, we have history slapping us in the face. We, as a body,  need to recognize and respect women's rights in this House and in  America.                            ____________________
