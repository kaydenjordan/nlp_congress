 Madam Speaker, the House impeachment inquiry is about  abuse of power. It is about betrayal. It is about corruption. It is  about national security. It is about the undermining of our elections.  It is about defending our democracy for the people.   The House is a separate and coequal branch of government. We don't  work for this President or any President. We work for the American  people. We have a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and  balance on an out-of-control executive branch. Our job is to ask  difficult questions on behalf of the American people.   What we are doing right here is consistent with the words of James  Madison who, in Federalist 51, said the House should be a rival to the  executive branch. Why did Madison use the word ``rival''? The Founders  didn't want a king. They didn't want a dictator. They didn't want a  monarch. They wanted a democracy, and that is exactly what we are  defending right now. No one is above the law.                                time  1000
