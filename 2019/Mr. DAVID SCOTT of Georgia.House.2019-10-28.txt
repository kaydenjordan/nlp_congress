SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative  [[Page H8494]]  days in which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation  and to insert extraneous materials therein.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   First of all, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our ranking member  of the Financial Services Committee, Representative McHenry, for his  efforts in crafting this very important piece of legislation to help  startups finance their operations while still protecting the investors  who entrust their hard-earned funds to those companies.   Equity crowdfunding is a high-risk, high-reward investment that  allows hundreds, or even thousands, of retail investors to invest in  startup companies. But because of the unique and heightened risks posed  by crowdfunding, Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission  have put in place guardrails to prevent these less-sophisticated  investors from suffering financial ruin while still being able to  access this area of the market.   Now, in 2012, Congress cautiously approached equity crowdfunding by  creating a number of investor protections in the Jumpstart Our Business  Startups Act, or the JOBS Act.   The SEC followed our directions and finalized a crowdfunding rule  that protects investors by setting reasonable investment limits based  on income and provides helpful disclosures for investors to weigh the  risks.   This bill aims to enhance the investor and company experience in  crowdfunding by authorizing crowdfunding vehicles to pool investors  together, allowing them to make joint investments totaling $1 million  in a single business.   These vehicles would be advised by a registered investment adviser  with a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the fund.  Importantly, the investors would have the same rights to sue companies  as if they had directly invested in the company itself--a very, very  important point, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1645    This bill also clarifies that as long as a crowdfunding company  continues to make ongoing disclosures to investors required under SEC's  rule, it would not have to make the more detailed public reports until  it had either a $75 million value or $50 million in revenue. This  change is consistent with the levels set under Regulation A, another  exempt offering sold to retail investors.   I am very pleased that the bill also incorporates targeted  improvements to crowdfunding for all investors and start-ups and lacks  problematic provisions that were opposed by consumer advocates like the  Consumer Federation of America in previous Congresses, including  additional changes that Chairwoman Waters and our ranking member agreed  on this Congress.   Although crowdfunding should be viewed as highly risky in terms of  investment, especially for retail investors, this bill will ensure a  larger choice of high-quality crowdfunding companies and a higher  degree of finance savvy for investors. And, in addition, it may help to  ensure compliance with regulation crowdfunding.    I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote  for this bill, and I want to commend the ranking member for his  excellent work.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2514) to make reforms to the Federal Bank  Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(a) In General.--The dollar amount specified under section       7(a)(3)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C.       289(a)(3)(A)) is reduced by $27,000,000.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on September 30, 2029.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks on this legislation, and to insert extraneous  material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   In recent weeks, we have had the opportunity to discuss the valuable  anti-money laundering aspects of the COUNTER Act of 2019, H.R. 2514,  introduced by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver).   This important piece of legislation is the first major reform in the  United States anti-money laundering regime since 2001 and makes  critical changes to close loopholes and ensure better enforcement of  this country's AML and Bank Secrecy Act laws.   Today, I would like to highlight how this bill also addresses the  costs and burdens of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering  compliance for smaller financial institutions, including credit unions  and community banks.   This bill includes multiple avenues to improve information-sharing  and feedback loops, including new programs of domestic liaisons for the  Financial Crime Enforcement Network of FinCEN, sending FinCEN officials  to the field to connect directly with financial institutions.   It also makes permanent the FinCEN Exchange program, allowing for  more robust exchange of threat information and analysis among  participants. It revives the popular ``SAR Activity Review,'' which was  a FinCEN publication that provided timely threat detection information,  which will help banks to better direct their resources, and result in  more efficient and effective collection of information from both banks  and law enforcement.   The COUNTER Act also codifies the Federal financial regulators'  guidance to encourage resource-sharing among similar institutions.   Mr. Speaker, we heard from many smaller institutions that they were  more apt to invest in resource-sharing if they knew that the permission  to do so wouldn't change with new directors or administrations.   The bill also raises the Currency Transaction Reports threshold,  increasing it every 5 years, pegged to inflation. This is a key issue  for smaller institutions and addresses their concerns, while balancing  the investigative needs of law enforcement.   Further focused on the compliance burden, this bill requires FinCEN,  working with industry and law enforcement, to consider the design of a  shortened, modified Suspicious Activity Report, or SAR, form for  certain customers and activities.   These reforms are among the reasons that the National Association of  Federally Insured Credit Unions, the Independent Community Bankers of  America, the Credit Union National Association, all of the State  banking associations, and many, many others have expressed support for  this important bill.   Overall, I believe that the COUNTER Act of 2019 is a significant step  forward for small businesses, law enforcement, and other stakeholders.   I want to thank Mr. Cleaver for introducing this bill, and I want to  thank our Republican colleagues for working collaboratively with a team  effort to refine this legislation, for this is truly a bipartisan bill,  ensuring that this bill passed out of the Financial Services Committee  with a unanimous 55-0 vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   This is a very critical piece of legislation for our financial  services industry that will help close loopholes in existing law, and  prevent criminals, prevent terrorists, and other bad state actors from  escaping the United States Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Threat  Finance laws; it is badly needed, and that is why this is so important.   I am proud to stand up to support small businesses here today, while  we are making important and necessary updates to these regimes.   I would especially like to congratulate my colleague from Missouri,  Mr. Cleaver, the chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services,  National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy  Subcommittee for introducing this bill.   A champion of small business himself, Mr. Cleaver has diligently  engaged stakeholders, including government, industry, nongovernmental  organizations, and Members from across the political spectrum on the  text that we vote on here today. The result is this comprehensive bill  with broad bipartisan support.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4067) to amend the Consumer Financial  Protection Act of 2010 to direct the Office of Community Affairs to  identify causes leading to, and solutions for, under-banked, un-banked,  and underserved consumers, and for other purposes, as amended.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous  material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, my bill, H.R. 4067, is a response to a national crisis  that we have in terms of taking better financial care of the American  people.   This bill is called the Financial Inclusion in Banking Act, and  almost the entirety of what we are doing is included in those two  words, ``financial inclusion.'' It truly reflects the key focus of this  legislation, which is ensuring that, in this Nation, consumers of all  backgrounds, of all races, of all income levels have access to our  great financial system and our financial products that are affordable,  that are safe, and that meet their needs.   The benefits of traditional banking and financial inclusion may not  be immediately apparent, Madam Speaker, until one considers the cost  and the long-term struggles of financial exclusion. Imagine, we have  people, millions of households, without even a checking account. Simple  tasks suddenly become more challenging without a checking account, more  time-consuming, more expensive. Without a bank account, the simple act  of accessing their own paychecks causes millions of consumers in this  country to rely on costly check-cashing services or high-fee money  orders.   Take paying a utility bill, just paying your light bill or your gas  bill means a trip across town and a lengthy wait in line to pay your  bill in cash if you find a place where you can even cash your paycheck  without a bank account.   When the 31st or the 30th of each month arrives, and the financial  ends don't meet, families are out there, millions of our families in  America who are forced to payday lenders, to pawn shops for loans, to  predatory bad actors, to loan sharks, just to make do. In the event of  a tragedy, a hospital trip, a family emergency, these challenges are  multiplied many times over.   The reality is that, in our increasingly highly technical electronic  online banking system and broadband, and in an increasingly credit- based economy, unbanked and underbanked consumers are being left  behind. They are being abandoned to the predators that are out there.   The FDIC gave some very valuable statistics from a report just a few  months ago. It reported that 8.4 million American households--that is  not the individuals; it is just the households. Nobody in these  households is considered in a way that they have a checking or a  savings account. 8.4 million American households, nobody in the house,  not mama, not daddy, not grandmama, not uncle, not cousin, nobody in  that household has even a bank account.   Then, according to the FDIC, an additional 24.2 million American  households are underbanked, which means that that household has limited  access to traditional banking but has to rely on the use of risky  alternative financial services to manage just basic maneuvers in their  financial lives.   I want to take a moment, Madam Speaker, to fully explain and describe  the nature of this problem. I hope the American people who are  listening will understand now why I say we have a national crisis and  this is why we need my bill. The Financial Inclusion in Banking Act, a  bill I was proud to introduce earlier this year, gets to the heart of  this issue. This is what it does.   It directs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to: one, research  factors standing in the way of financial inclusion of the American  people so we can understand the hurdles that these individuals and our  consumers face; two, the bill will also direct the CFPB to recommend  best practices to increase participation in the formal  [[Page H8504]]  banking sectors to bring our consumers out of the shadows of risky,  predatory, alternative financial services; and, three, my bill will  direct the CFPB to work with minority depository banks, African  American-owned banks and institutions, consumer advocates, and civil  rights groups to make sure that their recommendations--they are out  there grappling day to day with the unbanked and underbanked.   They need to be brought to the table so we can learn from these  groups what we must do in order to reflect the needs of the most  marginalized and unbanked consumers among us and the most underserved  communities across our Nation while also simultaneously strengthening  and growing many of the minority-owned banking institutions, African  American institutions particularly.   Madam Speaker, do you know that there has not been a new African  American-owned bank in the last 25 years and that we are losing  minority banking ownership? What better opportunity? Who knows best  this group that is marginalized?   We will be able to solve two problems, enrich and grow our minority  depository institutions while at the same time providing a way to get  nearly 58 million Americans out of the grasp of these predators and  into our great banking system.   Finally, H.R. 4067 will direct the CFPB to promote strategies to  improve financial education. You cannot have consumer financial  protection for the American people if you don't have consumer financial  education for the American people. That is an integral part that will  empower them with the tools necessary to manage their financial lives.   Personal financial education is the key, especially for our young  people. But you know how terribly critical this issue is? Only 17 of 50  States in our Nation's public school systems even require a course in  financial education, only 17.    We can do much better. This bill will start the wheel moving. And we  are going to be bringing another bill so that we can be able to give  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau grant-making authority.   Madam Speaker, we are the richest Nation in the world. We need to  apply our resources, and we need to pass legislation that will mandate  the teaching of financial education in all 50 States, not just 17.   I have to thank a lot of people who have been working with me for my  bill. First, I thank our chairwoman, Ms. Maxine Waters, who has been  working with us and her staff and my staff as we tackle this issue. I  also thank my friends from the other side, the Republicans who are  working with us, as well, for this is not a Democratic issue or a  Republican issue. This is an American issue. And we will bring the  energy to make sure that we are able to pass this bill.   I am proud to put the bill forth, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, first, I would like to  inquire if the gentlewoman has any more speakers.    Madam Speaker, I am so glad that the  gentlewoman mentioned Sean Duffy. I thank Mrs. Wagner for doing that.   Madam Speaker, Sean Duffy literally--to tell you the truth, I told  him in committee, when he didn't show up, when we found out so we  couldn't give our great speeches for him, I told him he broke my heart  when I heard he wasn't coming back. I said here we are working on this  monumental bill, he was the lead Republican sponsor on it and has  brought it a mighty long way. But a great American has decided to  retire from the Congress, Madam Speaker, and that is Sean Duffy of  Wisconsin.   He and I served on that committee for years, and he has played a  monumental role with us in this bill. We wouldn't be here with it on  the floor with the strong bipartisan support we have if it weren't for  the leadership of Sean Duffy.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Madam Speaker, I am urging that we get a  unanimous vote on this, that every single Member of Congress will send  a powerful message that we are no longer going to stand by and have 58  million Americans out there waiting for the pawns of these predatory  lenders, these loan sharks, and others. No. We want to bring them out  of the shadows and bring them into our great American financial system.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to vote for the bill, and I hope we  have a unanimous vote.  [[Page H8505]]    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1865) to require the Secretary of the  Treasury to mint a coin in commemoration of the opening of the National  Law Enforcement Museum in the District of Columbia, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous  material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in 2000, Congress passed and President Clinton signed  into law the National Law Enforcement Museum Act. That bill authorized  the construction of the National Law Enforcement Museum to commemorate  the service and sacrifices of our U.S. law enforcement officers, a  very, very important piece of legislation.   The National Law Enforcement Museum opened its doors in October of  2018 with a mission to honor the lives of service and sacrifice of  America's law enforcement officers, serve as an important bridge  between law enforcement's past and present, and strengthen the  relationship between law enforcement and the communities that they  serve.  [[Page H8506]]    This bipartisan legislation authorizes the Department of the Treasury  to mint $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar coins in 2021  to commemorate the National Law Enforcement Museum and the service and  sacrifice of law enforcement officers throughout history. Proceeds from  the sales of these coins will go toward funding the museum's  educational and outreach programs and exhibits.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Pascrell of New Jersey--as I  affectionately refer to him, the mayor of Paterson, New Jersey, a great  town--for introducing this bill this Congress, and I urge Members to  vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a distinguished gentleman and  the sponsor of this important piece of legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2423) to require the Secretary of the Treasury  to mint coins in commemoration of ratification of the 19th Amendment to  the Constitution of the United States, giving women in the United  States the right to vote, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2423         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Suffrage Centennial       Commemorative Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the       first Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. 68       women and 32 men signed the Declaration of Sentiments at the       Convention in July 1848.        (2) The Declaration of Sentiments was modeled after the       Declaration of Independence and declared that ``all men and       women are created equal'', linking women's rights directly to       the founding ideals of the United States.        (3) Suffrage activists, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton,       Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Ida B.       Wells, Jovita Idar, Inez Millholland, Mary Church Terrell,       Anne Dallas Dudley, Carrie Chapman Cat, Alice Paul, Lucy       Burns, Esther Hobart Morris, and many others, conducted over       900 local, State, and Federal campaigns over a 72-year time       span to win women the right to vote.        (4) On November 6, 1917, New York granted women the right       to vote, which was an act that created momentum for the       national movement that culminated in the ratification of the       19th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 3       years later.        (5) The 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the United       States (``The Susan B. Anthony Amendment'') guarantees all       United States women the right to vote and was passed by the       66th Congress of the United States on June 4, 1919.        (6) On August 9, 1920, right before the ratification period       was set to expire, Governor Albert H. Roberts called a       special session of the Tennessee General Assembly to consider       the amendment. Pro-suffrage and anti-suffrage activists from       around the country descended on Nashville, Tennessee, intent       on influencing the legislature.        (7) After the amendment was defeated in a 48-48 tie vote,       Tennessee State Representative Harry T. Burn from McMinn       County cast the deciding favorable vote after receiving a       note from his mother, Phoebe Ensminger Burn, imploring him to       vote yes for ratification.        (8) On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final       State needed to pass the 19th Amendment, ensuring its       ratification pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the       United States.        (9) The 19th Amendment was ratified on August 26, 1920,       when Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby issued a       proclamation announcing it has become part of the       Constitution of the United States.        (10) The ratification of the 19th Amendment marked the       single largest extension of voting rights in United States       history, enfranchising 27,000,000 American women in the       United States.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is--        (1) to honor and commemorate the work of women suffrage       activists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries;        (2) to increase public awareness and appreciation for the       history of the women's suffrage movement; and        (3) to encourage all women in the United States to exercise       their hard-won franchise and to become involved in civic life       if they so choose.       SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.         (a) $1 Silver Coins.--The Secretary of the Treasury       (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'')       shall mint and issue not more than 400,000 $1 coins, which       shall--        (1) weigh 26.73 grams;        (2) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and        (3) contain at least 90 percent silver.        (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be       legal tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United       States Code.        (c) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and       5136 of title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under       this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.       SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COIN.         (a) Design Requirements.--        (1) In general.--The design of the coins minted under this       Act shall be emblematic of the women who played a vital role       in rallying support for the 19th Amendment to the       Constitution of the United States.        (2) Designations and inscriptions.--On each coin minted       under this Act, there shall be--        (A) a designation of the value of the coin;        (B) an inscription of the year ``2020''; and        (C) inscriptions of the words ``Liberty'', ``In God We       Trust'', ``United States of America'', and ``E Pluribus       Unum.''        (b) Selection.--The design for the coins minted under this       Act shall--        (1) contain motifs that honor Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth       Cady Stanton, Carrie Chapman Catt, Harriet Tubman, Mary       Church Terrell, Alice Paul, Lide Meriwether, Ida B. Wells,       and other suffrage activists of the late 19th century and       early 20th centuries;        (2) be selected by the Secretary, after consultation with       the Smithsonian Institution's American Women's History       Initiative, and the Commission of Fine Arts; and        (3) be reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee.       SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS.         (a) Quality of Coins.--Coins minted under this Act shall be       issued in uncirculated and proof qualities.        (b) Mint Facilities.--Only 1 facility of the United States       Mint may be used to strike any particular quality of the       coins minted under this Act.        (c) Period for Issuance.--The Secretary may issue coins       under this Act only during the period beginning on January 1,       2020, and ending on December 31, 2020.       SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.         (a) Sale Price.--The coins issued under this Act shall be       sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the sum of--        (1) the face value of the coins;        (2) the surcharge provided in section 7(a) with respect to       such coins; and        (3) the cost of designing and issuing the coins (including       labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, overhead expenses,       marketing, and shipping).        (b) Bulk Sales.--The Secretary shall make bulk sales of the       coins issued under this Act at a reasonable discount.        (c) Prepaid Orders.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary shall accept prepaid orders       for the coins minted under this Act before the issuance of       such coins.        (2) Discount.--Sale prices with respect to prepaid orders       under paragraph (1) shall be at a reasonable discount.       SEC. 7. SURCHARGES.

(c) Audits.--The Smithsonian Institution's American Women's       History Initiative shall  [[Page H8508]]       be subject to the audit requirements of section 5134(f)(2) of       title 31, United States Code, with regard to the amounts       received under subsection (b).       SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES.         The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary       to ensure that--        (1) minting and issuing coins under this Act will not       result in any net cost to the United States Government; and        (2) no funds, including applicable surcharges, shall be       disbursed to any recipient designated in section 7(b) until       the total cost of designing and issuing all of the coins       authorized by this Act (including labor, materials, dies, use       of machinery, overhead expenses, marketing, and shipping) is       recovered by the United States Treasury, consistent with       sections 5112(m) and 5134(f) of title 31, United States Code.       SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 2020 marks the centennial anniversary of the  ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote.  This historic centennial offers an unparalleled opportunity to  commemorate a milestone of democracy, and to honor the legacy of  pioneers and patriots who blazed a trail to lead women to the voting  booth.   This bipartisan, bicameral legislation authorizes the Department of  the Treasury to mint $1 silver coins in 2020 to commemorate the work of  women suffrage activists in the late 19th and early 20th century and  increase public awareness and appreciation for the history of the  women's suffrage movement. Proceeds from sales of these coins will go  towards supporting the Smithsonian Institution's American Women's  History Initiative for the purpose of collecting, studying, and  establishing programs recognizing diverse perspectives on women's  history and women's contributions that have influenced the direction of  our great Nation.   I thank Ms. Stefanik for introducing this bill, and I urge all  Members to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to  yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), who  is a national leader in the fight for women's voting rights and is the  lead Democratic sponsor of this historic and important piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, as I stand here at this moment and listen to  the comments, I am reminded of a woman whose name was Isabella. But in  New York City, one day, the Lord changed her name because she had a  vision from God, and God changed her name from Isabella to Sojourner  Truth. She was a pioneer in women's rights and was at the forefront of  the battle coming out in the 19th century for women's rights, a  fearless leader.   Today, we have a statue honoring Sojourner Truth right here in the  Capitol.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to support this bill, and, hopefully,  again, we will have a unanimous vote on this very important piece of  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.
