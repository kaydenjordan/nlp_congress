 Mr. Speaker, as we end this session of Congress in the  next few weeks, I remind all Members we are acutely aware that without  congressional action, the entire healthcare clinician community faces a  cumulative Medicare payment cut in reduction of approximately 8.5  percent on January 1, 2023.   Without congressional action, these cuts will continue to drive  hospital consolidation, limit patient access, and harm physicians'  ability to run their own small businesses.   These outdated cuts in a time when considerable stress is placed upon  physicians has meant that they are affected. They are affected because  of the costs that they have on their business.   So at a time when we look for this access and the care for our most  vulnerable populations, it is up to Congress to make sure that we pass  H.R. 8800, the Supporting Medicare Providers Act of 2022.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is important what we are doing here  because our friends, the Democrats, were arguing that there is no  additional rights of action, that this isn't going to change anything.  In fact, this same discussion that we are having, if that is true, and  we are going to say that we take them at their word, that would mean no  rights of action would take place as a result of this law.   Any judge would be able to look at the reason why we are passing this  and the intent that would be on the floor of the House of  Representatives, and that is what is being stated here tonight: No  right of action; that is not what this is about.   I would hope that we would understand, just as when I was the  chairman of the Rules Committee, that what we did and the way we talked  on this floor is what the intent would be for a judge, for a lawsuit.  If something were to happen, they would open up the Record, just as we  are doing here tonight, Mr. Speaker, and a judge, magistrate, Federal  judge, State district judge, anyone ruling on this constitutional right  would be able to see that this is not about a right of action.   So, let's be clear. That was stated point blank in this discussion on  the floor of the House of Representatives. It was reiterated up at the  Rules Committee at the time that the rule came to the floor. That is  what is stated. I will accept that as their word.   I thank the gentleman from Lewisville, Texas, for his time and  service to the Rules Committee. I spent 20 years on the darn committee,  6 years as chairman, and I understood when we handled matters that we  spoke clearly and that we spoke directly about the intent of the law. I  have heard enough to understand that, and I appreciate Mr. Burgess for  yielding to me.
