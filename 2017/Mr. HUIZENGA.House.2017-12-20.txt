 Mr. Speaker, as has been pointed out each year, public  companies convene these shareholder meetings at which the companies'  shareholders vote for the companies' directors and on other significant  corporate actions that require shareholder approval.   As part of this annual process, the Securities and Exchange  Commission requires public companies to provide their shareholders with  a proxy statement before those meetings.   A proxy statement includes all important facts about the matters to  be voted on at the meeting, including, for example, information on  board of directors candidates, director compensation, executive  compensation, related party transactions, securities ownership by  management, and eligible shareholder proposals.   The information contained in the statement must be filed with the SEC  before soliciting a shareholder vote on the election of directors and  the approval of these other corporate actions. Solicitations, whether  by management or shareholders, must disclose all important facts about  the issues on which the shareholders are being asked to vote.   Institutional investors, including investment advisers to mutual  funds and pension funds, typically hold shares in a large number of  public companies. Each year, the investment advisers to these funds  vote billions of shares on behalf of their clients on thousands of  proxy ballot items.   What you have heard about, really, was the theoretical way this is  supposed to run. Unfortunately, that is not reality, and that is not  what you are hearing from the other side, because in 2003, the SEC  adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, requiring an  investment adviser that exercises voting authority over its clients'  proxies to adopt policies and procedures designed to ensure that the  investment adviser votes those proxies in the best interests of their  clients. Perfect. That is exactly what they should be doing.   The SEC's release adopting the rule clarified that ``an adviser could  demonstrate that the vote was not a product of a conflict of interest  if it voted client securities, in accordance with a predetermined  policy, based upon the recommendations of an independent third party.''   Okay so far, but here is where we see the problem. As a result,  institutional investors increase their reliance on these proxy adviser  firms to help them decide how to vote their shares.   In 2004, the SEC staff, without a Commission vote, just the staff,  issued two ``no action'' letters ``effectively blessing the practice of  investment advisers simply voting the recommendations provided by a  proxy adviser,'' according to SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher.   Largely, as a result of the SEC's regulation, proxy adviser firms now  wield tremendous outside influence on the U.S. proxy system. Studies  have shown that the two largest proxy adviser firms are comprised of  approximately 97 percent of all the proxy advisory industry and can  control a significant percentage of share votes in corporate elections,  which is sometimes as high as 40 percent. There have been numerous  instances where these two firms have issued vote recommendations on  publicly traded companies that include errors, misstatements of fact,  and incomplete analysis.   Additionally, some proxy advisory firms' recommendations have been  made without any sort of communication or contact with the public  company that they are actually reviewing. In fact, these same proxy  advisory firms even encourage companies to join their service on the  other side of the ledger in order to have the privilege to  ``influence'' an advisory firm's recommendations.   Members heard from the ranking member about a teacher having to check  with a student about what their grades are going to be as a student.   Well, what this is, Mr. Speaker, this is the teacher shaking down the  student for their lunch money and milk  [[Page H10318]]  money to make sure that they are behaving.   So let's talk about reality here.   Regulators, market participants, and academic observers have  highlighted potential conflicts of interest inherent to this business  model and activities of these proxy firms. For example, proxy advisory  firms may feel pressured by their largest clients, who may be activist  investors, to issue voting recommendations that reflect those clients'  specific agendas, not the boards' or the corporations'.    Mr. Speaker, additionally, proxy advisory firms often  provide voting recommendations to investment advisers on matters for  which they also provide consulting services to public companies. Talk  about, again, a conflict of interest.   Some proxy advisory firms also rate or score these public companies  on their governance structures, policies, practices, and they are  trying to actually influence the corporate governance practices of  these companies.   Essentially, these proxy advisory firms have hijacked the proxy  system by aligning themselves with activist shareholders, who also  might be their clients, to push social and political initiatives rather  than using shareholder votes to maximize shareholder value and  increasing shareholder returns.                                time  1330    Well, H.R. 4015 is to the rescue on this. It would foster greater  accountability, competition, responsiveness, and, most importantly of  all, transparency.   This legislation would ensure that voting recommendations at proxy  advisory firms are, in fact, in the interest of long-term shareholders.   So let's not misunderstand. The role of these proxy advisory firms  serves a very important place in our economy. However, these firms  aren't immune to conflicts of interest.   The good work of my friend, Mr. Duffy, on H.R. 4015 will improve that  transparency.
