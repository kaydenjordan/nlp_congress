 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this legislation and  especially this part of the bill, which includes a provision that  declares Dr. Afridi an international hero.   For those who don't remember Dr. Afridi, who now languishes in a  Pakistani prison, this was the brave soul who helped us identify Osama  bin Laden, the mastermind of the slaughter of 3,000 Americans on 9/11.   Pakistan arrested him on trumped up charges, and he now lingers in a  dungeon, ignored by us, ignored by the world.   This is an international hero. This is a man with courage.   It is a disgrace that our country still has relations, when Pakistan  rubs this in our face. I would hope that this Congress--and, Mr. Chair,  I thank the gentleman for putting this in the bill that we are  declaring to the world Dr. Afridi must be freed, and he is a hero, an  international hero to all of humankind.
