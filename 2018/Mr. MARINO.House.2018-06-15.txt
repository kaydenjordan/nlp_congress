 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2851.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, all Members of the Chamber are acutely aware of the  devastation caused by the opioid epidemic. The epidemic is destroying  lives and families across the United States. It affects every area of  our country, and grandparents, parents, and children alike.   Especially during the course of this week, we have been reminded that  over 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016. More than 20  percent of these deaths resulted from an overdose of synthetic opioids  like fentanyl, which can be as much as 100 times more powerful than  painkillers like morphine.   Additionally, synthetic analogues with street names like K2, spice,  bath salts, or molly, are designed to mimic other drugs like marijuana,  LSD, and ecstasy, and can be more potent and deadly than the real  thing.   Criminal drug manufacturers, largely from China and Mexico, work  continuously to stay ahead of our laws by altering the molecular  structure of their drugs as soon as the government bans them.   The Controlled Substance Act, which was signed into law more than 40  years ago, was designed to protect the public from the dangers  associated with drugs and drug use. However, this law was not designed  to handle the magnitude and speed with which these new psychoactive  substances have emerged in our communities.   It currently takes 3 years to schedule a new drug, but criminals can  skirt the law by quickly changing a drug molecule and get it to the  U.S. streets, often through the mail.                                time  0915    The bill we are considering today, the Stop the Importation and  Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues Act, or SITSA, updates Federal law  to provide swifter action to stop the unlawful importation and  distribution of synthetic drugs and gives law enforcement effective  tools to help keep our communities safe.   While Congress has taken action to combat the opioid epidemic through  the historic Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, it is clear that  we need more tools to combat the ever-growing problem of synthetic drug  abuse.   Instead of taking 3 years to bring a drug under control, SITSA gives  the Attorney General the power to act quickly and to classify a new  dangerous drug in a matter of months when it is virtually identical to  a current scheduled and powerful drug. The bill also requires the  Attorney General to work with the Department of Health and Human  Services so that these synthetic drugs can still be studied by  qualified researchers.   Supporters of H.R. 2851 include the National Association of Police  Organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District  Attorneys Association, and the American College of Emergency  Physicians.   I fully support this legislation. I encourage my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on my side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared  to close.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am puzzled by those who oppose this legislation.   Among the obligations we owe our constituents, one is to keep deadly  substances like synthetic opioids out of our country and out of the  hands of drug traffickers. Drug traffickers have no regard for the  devastation they inflict on our citizens, as their sole motive is greed  and profit. Sadly, their greed resulted in over 64,000 drug overdose  deaths in 2016, destroying countless families.   If a terrorist organization killed 175 Americans each and every day,  we would all be certain that our response would be swift, laser- focused, and decisive.   There is no question and no greater responsibility Congress has than  to protect the health and safety of all Americans. Voting against this  crucial legislation is a clear signal to all drug traffickers that  Congress is giving them a green light to continue spreading their  carnage.   While we may differ as to the priorities to solve the opioid  epidemic, make no mistake: a responsible and truly effective solution  must include treatment, prevention, and enforcement. Over the course of  this week, this Chamber has approved legislation in all three of those  areas.   This bill before us now gives law enforcement and the protecters of  our borders the tools to keep these deadly poisons out of our  communities. It also assures that these potent chemicals can remain in  the hands of qualified researchers. Altogether, this bill strikes the  perfect balance to respond to this ongoing epidemic.   Mr. Chair, I want to state that I take a backseat to no one when it  comes to  [[Page H5212]]  treatment. There is no question that drug addiction is addiction. It is  not only a biological addiction; it is a mental addiction as well.   As a prosecutor for 18 years, an assistant district attorney,  district attorney, and a U.S. attorney, I have seen my share of the  devastation of drugs, put a lot of dealers away, helped a lot of people  get into treatment; and, unfortunately, I have seen my share of people,  particularly young people, on slabs in morgues.   Anyone dealing today with opioids--regardless if they read the  newspaper, regardless if they watch TV, regardless if they are aware of  this legislation--knows, because of publicity, because of the deaths  that are caused by opioids and fentanyl, of the probability of fentanyl  or something like it being in the drug that they are selling. So I do  not accept the argument that they don't know that it is there. Everyone  knows that it is there.   Mandatory sentencing, I used when I was a prosecutor in my community,  and it worked. It put the worst of the worst away. We also, as  prosecutors, had discretion.   My constituents demand that we aggressively--aggressively--act now on  this problem. Not only am I hearing that from the great Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania but across the country.   I want to explain one thing on the chemical makeup. I had enough  chemistry in college to make me dangerous. Picture, if you will, a  chain of molecules and picture a single molecule. The scientists in  China have devised a way to take an atom from that molecule or add to  it to slightly change the composition, which technically removes it  from being an illegal drug or an illegal opioid. This is why this  legislation is needed.   The Chinese are there every day trying to figure out a way--and they  are figuring out ways--to alter, how to get around the law. We have to  be a step ahead of them. This legislation is what is needed. It is  good, bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Mr. Katko and Miss Rice, both of New York,  for this very important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2851.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time does the gentleman  from Virginia have left?    Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes three impactful  changes to SITSA. First, it changes and sets strict definitions of what  constitutes a controlled substance analogue suitable for inclusion in  schedule A. A substance proposed for inclusion in schedule A must have  a close chemical and scientific relationship to a substance already  controlled in one of the other five schedules.   Second, it checks the power of the Attorney General in the permanent  scheduling process. Under this bill, the Attorney General will be able  to act swiftly to bring certain synthetic drugs under temporary import  and distribution controls. However, this part of the amendment ensures  that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or HHS, possesses a  veto power in the permanent scheduling process.   If, after more extensive analysis, HHS concludes the drug lacks  psychological properties, then the Attorney General must remove the  drug from the schedule A list and decontrol it.   Third, it ensures that researchers with current Federal licenses in  any of the five existing schedules of controlled substances can  continue their research. Government and private sector chemists and  scientists are researching and developing new drugs and substances  every day. These researchers already possess a Federal license, called  a registration, to conduct their research.   This part of the amendment safeguards the ability of qualified  researchers to continue their research while unsafe and untested  synthetic drugs are controlled in schedule A. This amendment makes a  great piece of legislation even better. I applaud Mr. Griffith's and  Mr. Raskin's efforts in doing do. I support this amendment and  encourage all Members to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, section 9 of the bill would provide guidance  in sentencing during the current problematic time for courts,  prosecutors, and defendants. Courts are having difficulties similar to  those of law enforcement because of the constantly evolving nature of  synthetic drugs and their chemical makeup.   Recently, the U.S. Sentencing Commission unanimously approved a slate  of new amendments to the sentencing guidelines. Among them are  guidelines for the three most potent classes of synthetic analogues  being imported from China and distributed in the United States. I view  this as a tremendous step forward in providing guidance to courts,  which are performing very labor-intensive examinations during  sentencing proceedings   This amendment would strike section 9 of the bill. Chairman Goodlatte  has spoken to and received correspondence from Judge William Pryor,  acting chairman of the Sentencing Commission. Both he and his staff  have assured Chairman Goodlatte that synthetic drug guidelines will  remain a priority for the commission.   I am agreeable to striking section 9 of this bill, and I encourage  the Sentencing Commission to continue its important work and to provide  guidance to the courts in these often complex cases.   I support the Jackson Lee amendment and encourage all Members to do  likewise.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the Drug  Enforcement Administration to compile a report on both the lawful and  illicit sale of synthetic drug analogues over the internet.  Unfortunately, the internet and the dark web have become sizable  marketplaces for many illegal drugs, especially synthetic analogues.   As Chairman Goodlatte stated earlier, Garrett Holman lost his life  from synthetic drugs he ordered over the internet and received in the  mail from China. The report requested by this amendment will help  Congress and law enforcement have a better picture of the magnitude of  the synthetic drug problem.   Mr. Chairman, I support the Maloney amendment, I urge my colleagues  to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment would improve the Federal Analogue Act,  a provision in the Controlled Substance Act, which, during a  prosecution, allows a chemical that is determined to be substantially  similar to a controlled substance listed in schedule I or II to be  treated as if it were also listed in those schedules, but only if the  substance is intended for human consumption.   Drug traffickers, particularly those who traffic synthetic drugs,  repeatedly attempt to evade Federal law by labeling their synthetic  drugs with a phrase, ``not made for human consumption.'' They do this  routinely in a preemptive attempt to rebut an assertion during their  prosecution that they never meant the drug be intended for human  consumption.                                time  1045    The Thornberry amendment sets forth six factors which a court may  consider when determining whether a controlled substance analogue was  intended for human consumption. It also states a label on the product  is not sufficient proof, standing alone, that the defendant did not  intend it for human consumption. This amendment is quite similar to S.  207, the SALTS Act, which the Senate Judiciary Committee reported  favorably 3 weeks ago.   Mr. Chair, I think this is a useful amendment to the legislation  before us, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.
