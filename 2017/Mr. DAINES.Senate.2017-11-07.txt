The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, with Veterans Day approaching this  weekend, I would like to recognize and express my gratitude for the  patriotism, selfless service, and community spirit of a small community  in southern Montana. The town of Roberts, in Carbon County, is honoring  military veterans by lining Highway 212 with crosses and dogtags to  represent servicemembers who have lived in Roberts. The crosses signify  veterans who have passed away, while the dogtags symbolize living  veterans.   The breadth of service in this scenic town north of Yellowstone Park  is evident in the 133 dogtags on display this year. The depth of  service to our great county is rooted in the 308 crosses, some of which  date back to service in the Civil War. A total of 441 individuals, with  service spanning over a century and a half, is an impressive display of  patriotism for any small community. The record of service among the  people of Roberts is even more awe-inspiring when you consider that,  during the last census, the town had just 361 residents.   As we gather to celebrate Veterans Day, let us be encouraged by the  example of the folks in Roberts and take time to remember the  accumulated sacrifices and ongoing commitment that allow so many to  live in freedom. To the people of Roberts, thank you for punching above  your weight class for our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 220, S. 1088.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.   The bill clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 1088) to require the collection of voluntary       feedback on services provided by agencies, and for other       purposes.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill,  which had been reported from the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs, with amendments, as follows:   (The parts of the bill intended to be stricken are shown in boldface  brackets and the parts of the bill intended to be inserted are shown in  italics.)                                  S. 1088         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the Federal Government serves the people of the United       States and should seek to continually improve public services       provided by the Federal Government based on customer       feedback;        (2) the people of the United States deserve a Federal       Government that provides efficient, effective, and high-      quality services across multiple channels;        (3) many agencies, offices, programs, and Federal employees       provide excellent service to individuals, however many parts       of the Federal Government still fall short on delivering the       customer service experience that individuals have come to       expect from the private sector;  [[Page S7067]]         (4) according to the 2016 American Customer Satisfaction       Index, the Federal Government ranks among the bottom of all       industries in the United States in customer satisfaction;        (5) providing quality services to individuals improves the       confidence of the people of the United States in their       government and helps agencies achieve greater impact and       fulfill their missions; and        (6) improving service to individuals requires agencies to       work across organizational boundaries, leverage technology,       collect and share standardized data, and develop customer-      centered mindsets and service strategies.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       all agencies should strive to provide high-quality,       courteous, effective, and efficient services to the people of       the United States and seek to measure, collect, report, and       utilize metrics relating to the experience of individuals       interacting with agencies to continually improve services to       the people of the United States.
