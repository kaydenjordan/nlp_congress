 Mr. Speaker, on February 9, the Winter Olympics began in  South Korea.   As we celebrate the world coming together to achieve the very best in  sports, I am extremely proud and excited to announce that Florida's  Third District has three young speed skaters, Brittany Bowe, Erin  Jackson, and Joey Mantia, who are competing in the Olympics.   Brittany, Erin, and Joey are from the town of Ocala, a city in my  district with no ice rink. Yet, under the tutelage of Renee Hildebrand,  these athletes have perfected their skills through regular training on  roller blades. In fact, Erin had only spent 4 months total training on  ice before earning her spot, making her position as the first African- American woman to qualify for the U.S. long track team even more  remarkable.   Brittany, Erin, and Joey, all of Florida's Third District is rooting  for you, and I know you will make our community and the Nation proud.   Good luck, and go Team USA.                            ____________________
