 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3326, the World Bank  Accountability Act of 2017.   Last year, Democrats on the Financial Services Committee joined our  Republican colleagues in favorably reporting H.R. 3326 out of committee  to support the bill's authorization of a U.S. contribution of $3.29  billion to multilateral development efforts and to enforce the  importance of U.S. leadership at the international financial  institutions, but the favorable report in committee came with clear  conditions for the future of the bill.   Democrats made it clear during consideration of this bill in  committee that our ongoing support for the measure would depend upon  changes to provisions in the bill moving forward that put critical U.S.  funding at risk. But here we are today and Republicans have not made  any effort at all to address our very specific concerns.   Namely, the bill would cut up to 30 percent of the U.S. contribution  to the International Development Association--IDA--in any year in which  the Treasury Secretary does not certify to Congress that the World Bank  has adopted or is taking steps to implement two sets of reforms  mandated in the bill.   IDA is the arm of the World Bank that provides grants and other  assistance to the world's 77 poorest countries, which are home to more  than 450 million people living in extreme poverty. Cuts to U.S. funds  to IDA would punish millions of children and other vulnerable people in  Africa, Latin America, and Asia, who are living in extreme poverty, who  are suffering from famine, or who are emerging from conflict.   Democrats do not believe that cutting U.S. funds for, and diminishing  U.S. influence at, the international financial institutions is an  effective approach to reform.                                time  1500    To remedy this problem with the bill, Representative Moore, who is  the ranking member on our committee's Subcommittee on Monetary Policy  and Trade, had sought to offer an amendment on the floor to strike the  provisions in the bill that would give the administration cover to cut  U.S. funding from multilateral efforts aimed at alleviating global  poverty. The amendment would have maintained both sets of reforms  currently in the bill and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to  actively promote these policy goals through advocacy and direct  engagement with World Bank management as well as the World Bank's other  major shareholders.   Unfortunately, the Rules Committee refused to make this amendment in  [[Page H442]]  order, thus depriving the House of the opportunity to decide for itself  which approach it prefers to take: reforming the World Bank by fiat  with a threat to cut funding or reforming the World Bank through the  exercise of U.S. influence and power at the World Bank based on the  merits of the reforms themselves.   Mr. Chairman, the process by which this bill has come to the floor  stands in stark contrast to our committee's long history of working  together on issues relating to global economic governance.   For many years, the Financial Services Committee has worked in a  bipartisan fashion to achieve a number of important reforms at the  World Bank, including increased transparency, the creation of the  inspection panel, more disclosure of information, and closer  consultation with local communities most affected by World Bank  projects.   We were able to successfully advance these policy goals through  serious and direct negotiations and sustained engagement with both the  Department of the Treasury and the World Bank itself, not by  threatening to walk away from our commitments, but the Trump  administration has consistently demonstrated troubling attitudes toward  the role of the U.S. in the world.   In November of last year, in testimony before the Financial Services  Committee, David Malpass, Treasury's Under Secretary for International  Affairs, expressed the administration's view that globalism and  multilateralism have gone substantially too far.   In December, the Trump administration refused to pledge any funds for  the next replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural  Development, a small multilateral development bank that helps the poor  in remote, rural areas where few donors operate. Of course, just last  week, this President made ignorant, racist, and deplorable comments  about Africa, where, as it happens, IDA focuses a great deal of its  resources and energy.   Mr. Chairman, the more committed we are to our goals and to our  ideals, the more morally obligated we are to do everything we can to  advance those goals.   The legislation before us today, in its current form, fails to meet  that test, so I will be opposing this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. We can, and we should, do better.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Texas really has presented rather hollow arguments that have no place  in this debate. This is about our humanitarianism and about our  strategic position in the world.  [[Page H443]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman  from New York an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), the senior member of the  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), the vice ranking member of  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional  1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Kihuen), a member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   In closing, let me say that Democrats did view this legislation as an  important marker of international engagement from our committee, which  has not in recent times demonstrated a great deal of interest in global  economic leadership. We viewed this measure as an opportunity to  reinforce the importance of global economic cooperation. Given that, it  seemed to us a mistake to then reject the possibility of cooperation  with our own Republican colleagues. So we supported the bill for that  reason as well, and I regret we couldn't come to an accommodation.                                time  1545    On another matter, let me also say that I won't question the  sincerity of my Republican colleagues' commitment to reforming the  World Bank, but  [[Page H447]]  I do wonder why, if these reforms are as pressing and as urgent and as  critical as they say, why did they take so long?   Chairman Hensarling has been at the helm of our committee for over 5  years, and, during that time, the Obama administration requested  legislation to authorize U.S. participation in three other  replenishments, including the previous IDA-17. But the committee  refused to act on any of these requests, not only shirking its  oversight responsibility, but also missing a number of opportunities to  press for reforms which presumably were as urgent then as they are now.   In fact, in November of 2014, near the end of the 113th Congress, I  wrote to Chairman Hensarling urging him to turn his attention to the  three pending authorization requests before Congress adjourned. I made  a number of arguments in support of the multilateral development banks,  the MDBs, which apparently did not persuade the chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I include that letter in the Record.                                     U.S. House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                  Washington, DC, November 19, 2014.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: I write to urge you to turn your       attention before Congress adjourns to the Administration's       requests for authorizations for U.S. participation in the       replenishments of three concessional windows at the       multilateral development banks (MDBs)--namely, the World       Bank's International Development Association (IDA-17), the       Asian Development Fund (AsDF-11), and the African Development       Fund (AfDF-13).        As you know, these concessional facilities provide grants       and low-cost development financing to the world's poorest       countries. They support projects that combat hunger and       poverty while promoting private-sector growth and global       stability. Well-designed multilateral aid programs help       create more equitable societies and more stable democracies.       It is also crucial to U.S. interests that developing nations       continue to grow. Exports have been the most rapidly growing       share of our economy, and exports to developing countries       have been an important part of that.        America is also fighting a war on terrorism, and while the       forces that give rise to terrorism are complex, poverty and       despair provide a fertile feeding ground. Moreover, U.S.       contributions to the development banks also provide       tremendous value for the money. Every dollar we commit is       leveraged many times over by contributions from other donor       nations, as well as from the internal resources of the       institutions themselves.        Today, we have another very important, and potentially far-      reaching, reason why the U.S. should promptly meet its       commitments to the MDBs. The last few years have       unfortunately seen a weakening of the commitment to       multilateralism by the United States, which has led to       widespread doubt about U.S. leadership on global economic       governance.        In response, a number of developing countries, led by       China, have begun to act independently, with initiatives       viewed as the first serious, coordinated effort to reshape       the global financial architecture and challenge western       dominance in the world economy.        Last month, China announced an agreement with 21 other       developing countries to create a multilateral development       bank called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB),       which will focus on financing infrastructure development       projects in the Asia-Pacific region. A clear rival to the       Asian Development Bank, the AIIB will be led by China, its       largest shareholder, and headquartered in Beijing.        Separately, in July, the so-called BRICS nations (Brazil,       Russia, India, China and South Africa) announced plans to       launch an international development bank of their own, which       they hope will rival the strength and influence of the World       Bank. The ``New Development Bank,'' as it is called, will be       headquartered in Shanghai and focus on infrastructure       investment throughout the developing world.        Development experts agree that global infrastructure needs       in developing countries is tremendous, and there are many who       welcome the contribution that the new development banks can       make in helping to build sustainable economic infrastructure       both in Asia and elsewhere. But these new institutions also       reflect frustration by the world's major emerging economies       with the slow pace of governance reforms at the Bretton Woods       institutions, especially the IMF. In fact, the now-stalled       agreement to realign the quota shares at the IMF, negotiated       by the Bush Administration, was a critical effort to preserve       its legitimacy and keep emerging economies firmly anchored in       the multilateral system that the U.S. helped design.        U.S. inaction in meeting its commitments to the MDBs, as       well as its refusal to ratify IMF governance reforms, is what       led, in large part, to the creation of these new institutions       that will increasingly pose a challenge to the global       financial order created by western powers after World War II.       We should be mindful that a world in which countries such as       China and Russia are acting outside of the established       international financial institutions, or other global bodies,       is one that could drift beyond our control. Moreover, it       remains to be seen what values these new rising powers will       articulate and promote in their vision of a new global       economy.        I believe this makes U.S. leadership at the multilateral       development institutions today more important than ever. They       are directed at some of the most central challenges faced by       the U.S.--strategic, economic, political and moral--and, in       many ways, they are often our most effective means for       responding to those challenges.        I strongly urge you to take prompt action to affirm U.S.       support for, and U.S. leadership at, these institutions,       which have served both U.S. interests and the global public       good for so many years.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                    Ranking Member.     Nevertheless, here we are, at a  historic moment when U.S. credibility on the global stage is in serious  question.   We have the option of choosing to lead and show the community of  nations that the hateful words of the President will not be followed by  misguided and enabling actions by Congress.   Today, I speak on behalf of the world's poorest countries and their  people. Today, I stand with Africa, and I urge my colleagues to oppose  this legislation and its misguided, cynical approach to  multilateralism.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation as a  signal to the world that Trump doctrine is not the American doctrine or  a broader sign of American unreliability and indifference.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a moment to tell you what is being  said about us from some of these countries and around the world.   From Haiti, Trump comments saying that they were ``based on  stereotypes.''   ``In the spirit of the people of Haiti, we feel in the statements, if  they were made, the President was either misinformed or miseducated  about Haiti and its people.''   From Laurent Lamothe, the former Haitian Prime Minister: ``It shows a  lack of respect,'' he says, ``and ignorance never seen before in the  recent history of the U.S. by any President.''   Let's see what Jessie Duarte, Deputy Secretary General of the African  National Congress, has to say. He said, ``Ours is not a s----hole  country, neither is Haiti or any other country in distress.''   From the Government of El Salvador: ``We have addressed a note of  protest to the Government of the United States highlighting in this  document also the high value of Salvadorans.''   From Salvador Sanchez, President of El Salvador:         The statement by the President of the United States hits       the dignity of the Salvadoran people. El Salvador demands       within the framework of the principles governing relations       among states respect for the dignity of their noble and       courageous people.    Hugo Martinez, El Salvador's Foreign Minister, said:   ``It's always been a foreign policy priority of our government to  fight for the respect and dignity of our countrymen independent of the  immigration status.   ``Our countrymen are hardworking people who are always contributing  to the countries where they are living and, of course, also to our  country.''   And according to the State Department, Senegal also summoned the U.S.  Ambassador for an explanation. And so Macky Sall, President of Senegal,  said: ``I am shocked by the words of President Trump on Haiti and  Africa. I reject them and condemn them vigorously. Africa and the Black  race deserves the respect and consideration of all.''   And then there is John Mahama, former President of Ghana. He said:  ``Africans and Haitians come from s----hole countries? Isn't Trump  demonstrating that he is nothing but a racist and pursuing a policy of  `Make America White Again'? I congratulate Botswana for showing the  way. Our AU Presidents must respond strongly to this insult.''   I could go on and on about comments that are coming from our friends  and  [[Page H448]]  our allies. Some of them may be poor countries but who have had respect  for us in the past and who have stood with us in times of adversity.   I absolutely know that this country has demonstrated, time and time  again, that we are humanitarians, that we understand the importance of  giving support to the poorest countries in this world, and they  appreciate us so much. They honor us, they have respected us, and they  have done everything to show that they will stand with us when they  need us to do that.   And here we are at a time when we are willing to put them at risk  with a piece of legislation where we have some Members on the opposite  side of the aisle who think they know better than the World Bank, who  think they know better than all of the Members, Democrats and  Republicans, who have worked together for years in our support of the  World Bank; in our support of giving support to the 77 poorest  countries in the world; and giving our support to the 450 million  people, many of them who are living in abject poverty, many of them who  don't know where the next meal is going to come from, and many of them  whose lives are at risk every day.   How can we, the richest country in the world, turn our nose up at  them, talk about somehow they are not credible, talk about somehow they  are all corrupt? I reject it, and I ask the Members of this Congress to  vote ``no'' on this misplaced, misguided piece of legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition  to the amendment.    Yes, I am opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition  to the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).   While the amendment speaks to reducing government barriers to  entrepreneurship, the real-world impact of adopting this amendment  would be to enlist the World Bank in the business  [[Page H450]]  of really what they are going for, diminishing labor standards.   The World Bank's prior ``doing business'' report is a prime example  of why we must reject this amendment. The World Bank should be  encouraging sustainable and inclusive growth, not policies that  diminish workers' rights. So I would urge all Members to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition  to the amendment, though I do not intend to oppose it.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment,  offered by the gentleman from Kentucky, Representative Barr, would make  changes to section 4 of the underlying bill dealing with opposing World  Bank assistance for governments that fail to enforce U.N. Security  Council sanctions against North Korea.   These changes are welcome and would bring this section of the bill in  line with a provision that was adopted on a bipartisan basis in the  Financial Services Committee as part of our commitment in the Otto  Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act.   Just as the bipartisan measure that was passed through our committee  included a clearly defined waiver authority, the amendment offered by  Representative Barr would add, in this same waiver, provisions to the  underlying bill. In doing so, the amendment not only makes section 4 of  the bill consistent with the approach used in  [[Page H452]]  other contexts, but, more importantly, it ensures that we allow the  President to waive the withholding of assistance for countries that  fall short in applying sanctions on North Korea when such failure is  due exclusively to a lack of capacity of the foreign government and the  foreign government is taking effective steps to prevent the failure  from recurring.   While I do not believe the underlying bill should become law in its  current form, I do believe we should take a consistent and thoughtful  approach to cutting off World Bank assistance to the poorest countries  that are unable to fulfill their U.N. Security Council obligations.  This amendment would address this concern.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for giving credit to Ms. Moore  for her work and her assistance with the work that was being done to  deny North Korea any kind of assistance from any of our allies, as I  understand it. This is not something that is done by the Republicans or  the Democrats. This is truly bipartisan. We all feel the same way about  North Korea, and we all feel that the sanctions should be honored. We  all feel that no country, in particular those countries that we are  supporting, in any way should do anything to give support to North  Korea.   In saying that, let me also point out that we don't come to this  floor with any kind of empty rhetoric, talking about all of those  countries are corrupt and somehow all of these countries in Africa and  other places that are very poor are somehow disregarding the fact that  the United States is being of assistance to them. Most of them know  that their lives oftentimes depend on our generosity. They love us and  support us. They want to emulate us.   They get a little bit confused when we have people who charge them  with being corrupt and irresponsible and noncaring and not having an  appreciation for what the citizens of the United States are doing for  them. That is not the kind of rhetoric that we need in order to enhance  our posture or our image with our constituents and have them believe  that we are saving them from these poor countries who are getting  taxpayer money and don't care about them. That is not true.   I cringe when I hear that kind of rhetoric on the floor of Congress.  I cringe when I hear us using our position, our influence, to send a  message that somehow we don't trust, we don't believe, we don't honor,  and we don't respect many of those very, very poor countries. We are  talking about 77 of the poorest countries in the world.   You will see ads on television, from time to time, of nonprofit  organizations that are trying to save the lives of little children who  are dying from malnutrition. You see them every night, and they tell  you: Send $21; send some money to this organization so we can save  these children who are dying because they don't have clean drinking  water, who are dying because they are victims of malaria, who are dying  because they don't have any healthcare whatsoever, living practically  outdoors. When we see these ads, many people are responding, joining in  with their government to show our humanitarianism and helping the least  of these.   I want us to take credit, but I want us be respectful. I want us not  to join in calling names. I want us to say to the President of the  United States: ``Don't keep doing this.'' I want to say to the Members  on the opposite side of the aisle: ``You are better than this, and you  don't need this for your reelection. You don't need this to send a  message to your citizens that you are saving them from poor, corrupt  countries.''   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
