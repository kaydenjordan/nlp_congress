 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding.   I appreciate the opportunity to address this important issue and the  question the gentleman from Maryland just asked. I hear the question.   Yes, their District boundary lines have changed in the past, but what  the majority wants to do today is fundamentally alter what Washington,  D.C., is. That is what is at stake here.   I would love to hear the gentleman from Maryland expound on his  support and belief in our electoral college since, suddenly, my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a newfound respect for  the power of States and the importance of States. I would love to hear  them expound on that.   I would love to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  talk about what is critical about community and about respecting the  ability of people to live differently in order for us to agree to  disagree, to allow Texas to be Texas, California to be California. I  would like love to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  expound on these principles.   This is about power. That is what this is about. Let's make no  mistake about it. D.C., I do not believe, should become a State--and I  use that word importantly, should not become a State.   We can talk about the constitutional infirmities with what the  majority is trying to do. My colleagues are doing that, and they have  laid that out.   The Constitution speaks to creating the Federal city in Washington,  D.C. The Founders wanted to do that for a reason. We wanted this seat  to be completely unintertwined and separated from other States. We  wanted it to be special and unique and not subject to the powers and  the struggles that go on about the people in a certain State. That is  what is at stake here.   I would note that my friends, Mr. Raskin, Mr. Connolly, Mr. Hoyer,  and Mr. Beyer, are the first to rattle--the very first to rattle--if we  dare go down the road of potential shutdown, if we dare go down the  road of limiting the size and scope of the Federal Government. Why?  Because the jurisdictions they represent are wholly and heavily  dependent on this Federal Government.   I am a proud Texan dating back to the 1850s, but I grew up in Loudoun  County, Virginia, and went to the University of Virginia. When I grew  up in Loudoun County, it was 80 percent dirt roads. There was one  stoplight in my entire school district. It was a rural county fully  separated from Washington, D.C., and now it is the richest per capita  county in the United States of America because leviathan grows.                                time  1015    It is because leviathan continues to separate from the real Americans  out there--the people throughout the entire country who are not being  represented by this body.   If we want to talk about representation, then let's talk about this  body doing its job to represent the people, the forgotten man. The  American people are tired of watching their country burning to the  ground, statutes being toppled, people getting killed in the streets.  And we are spending time here today on an unconstitutional effort to  create a State out of a Federal city that the Constitution contemplated  being separated so that it could be unique and be the power seat of  this great country.   Mr. Speaker, that is what this is about.
