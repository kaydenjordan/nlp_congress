 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following Senators be permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each prior  to the recess: Van Hollen, Cardin, Stabenow, Schatz, Markey, and  Heinrich.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I am on the floor today with a very simple question: What is the  Republican agenda for tackling many of the major challenges we face  today in the United States of America?   We know what our Republican colleagues are against. In fact, just  yesterday, the Trump administration asked a Federal court of appeals to  strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate  affordable healthcare for tens of millions of Americans and strip away  protections for people with preexisting conditions.   So that is what Republicans are against, the Affordable Care Act.  What are they for? Since January of this year, the new Democratic  majority in the House of Representatives has already passed major  legislation on some important issues for our country. They passed a  major bill to protect and strengthen the integrity of our election  system and the health of our democracy. It includes lots of provisions,  including one to get rid of secret money in politics, because, like the  American public, we believe that Americans have a right to know who is  spending tens of millions of dollars to try to influence their votes.   Why not get rid of secret money and dark money in politics? That is  what the House bill does. That bill is right here in the Senate now,  but are we going to get a chance to vote on that? We are asking the  majority leader for a vote on that bill that is sitting right here in  the Senate.   The House also passed sweeping legislation to address gun safety  issues. Specifically, the legislation calls for a universal criminal  background check to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous  people. This is overwhelmingly supported by the American public. Why  would we want to keep a big loophole in the law that allows dangerous  people to get guns and commit violent acts with those guns? That bill  is also here in the Senate, but there is no sign that we are going to  vote on that bill.    Instead, the Republican leader is bringing up the nonbinding  resolution--the Green New Deal resolution--which calls for ambitious  goals to tackle climate change, which has created a lot of important  momentum in our country to address this issue. Yet our Republican  colleagues are not bringing up this bill because they want to do  something about climate change; they are bringing it up with the  express purpose of defeating it and playing political games.   It is a very simple question. We know what you are against. You are  against the Green New Deal resolution. But what are you for when it  comes to addressing climate change? The science is overwhelming. It  mounts every day. Americans can see what is happening with their own  eyes in the form of extreme weather events.   Former Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska just wrote over the weekend:         The disastrous flooding this month in Nebraska and much of       the upper Midwest is a reminder of several important truths.       First, weather and climate are not the same thing. Climate       affects weather, not the other way around.    If our Republican colleagues don't agree with our own American  scientists at NASA and NOAA, scientists throughout the country and  around the world, my goodness, I would hope they would believe our  military leaders who just last year put out a report. I am reading from  a release that says: ``New Pentagon Survey: Climate Change-Related  Risks to 50% of Military Infrastructure.''   The folks at the Pentagon seem to recognize the costs and harm of  climate change. Yet our Republican colleagues do nothing but play games  with this issue.   Ironically, this week we are going to be taking up a disaster relief  bill. I think the pricetag for that bill is $13 billion to $14 billion.  This is just one of many disaster relief bills we will handle.   We all know that we will always have natural disasters, but we also  know from the science that they are more intense, more extreme, and  more costly because of climate change, and they happen more often  because of climate change.   Our Republican colleagues are happy to ask taxpayers to shell out  more and more money to pay for the harm and damage of climate change  through extreme weather events, but they are not willing to consider  any legislation on this floor to actually do something about it and  stop the rising costs, harm, and damage.   If you don't like the nonbinding resolution of the Green New Deal,  why not support another nonbinding resolution put forth by Senator  Carper and every Democrat? It is very simple. No. 1, climate change is  real; No. 2, human activity is the dominant cause; and No. 3, Congress  should take immediate action to do something about it. That must be a  really radical proposal for our Republican colleagues, but only one  Republican Senator has signed on, which just shows the incredible  hypocrisy of this entire exercise.   The Republican leader is bringing up a measure that calls for  ambitious goals. I think those are good goals. I support it, but he  wants to defeat it. Yet he has not a single idea of his own to address  this issue.  [[Page S1961]]    This week, I intend, along with Congressman  Don Beyer in the House,  to reintroduce a bill called the cap and dividend bill. It is very  simple: The polluter pays, just as we have handled environmental issues  in the past. We will put a price on carbon pollution, and by doing so,  we will create more incentives for investment in clean energy  technology, renewable energy technology, energy efficiency. We propose  to take the proceeds from that ``polluter pays'' fee and rebate the  entire thing to the American people. As a result, according to the  studies of the University of Massachusetts, 80 percent of the American  people, at the end of the day, will actually see more money in their  pocket than before, and we will begin to address the ravages of climate  change.   I urge my colleagues to actually do something when it comes to  climate change.   I yield the floor to Senator Stabenow from Michigan, who has been a  leader on this issue.
