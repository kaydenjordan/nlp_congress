 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, you heard the gentleman from Kentucky purport to  describe what is in the bills that we are considering today. I think  his description of these bills is somewhat inaccurate. The so-called No  Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act--and I say so-called because this bill  does not actually do what the title suggests. It is really just about  Republicans going after President Biden because they are mad he secured  the release of American hostages.   It is as simple as that. Some Members of Congress would rather let  these American hostages stay imprisoned in Iran than give credit to  President Biden for bringing them home.   This is a bad bill. It undermines America's credibility in future  negotiations. The money the United States unfroze--Iranian money, not  American money--can only be used for humanitarian needs. That is the  truth.   The money doesn't even go to the Iranian Government; it goes to a  restricted account in Qatar where it can only be used for approved  purchases. Those are the facts, and I won't waste any more time on this  foolish political messaging bill.   The other bill contained in this rule is H.R. 5893, another extreme  MAGA Republican spending bill. It is no shock that this radical  Commerce, Justice, and Science appropriation bill couldn't even get a  markup and a vote out of the full Appropriations Committee because it  is nuts.                                time  0930    It defunds the police, which is ironic, but let's not even go there.  It guts programs that help small businesses, slashes services that help  missing and exploited children. I mean, really? It also makes it easier  for criminals to get their hands on guns.   Madam Speaker, the truth is that the Republican Party is completely  and totally broken. They are unable to govern themselves, let alone a  country. The two extreme MAGA messaging bills that we are considering  today are just the latest examples, just the tip of the iceberg.   Now, our job on the Rules Committee is to help run this place like  professionals, to advance legislation in a thoughtful, orderly,  deliberate manner, and to do it in a way that reflects well on the  Congress and the country. Since Republicans took over, we have seen  nothing but dysfunction and disaster in this Chamber. There has been  chaos, confusion, and crisis at the hands of MAGA extremists who have  turned this place into a circus. Republican incompetence over the last  11 months takes my breath away.   As this chart shows, Madam Speaker, we have a timeline up here that  speaks for itself. There was a week wasted on 14 failed votes for  Speaker while Kevin McCarthy agreed to shady backroom deals with MAGA  extremists so he could win the gavel.   There was a month wasted on MAGA extremists threatening to default on  America's debt unless Democrats agreed to draconian spending cuts.   We had an entire summer wasted after Democrats came to the table and  negotiated a budget deal, but then Republicans didn't bring a single  spending bill to the floor.   Finally, days before a government shutdown, Republicans brought to  the floor appropriations bills they couldn't even pass. They had to  call on Democrats to get a continuing resolution over the finish line,  and then they kicked out their own Speaker for the terrible crime of  keeping the government open. All because the MAGA extremists had a  temper tantrum.   There were 20 days wasted while Republicans argued amongst themselves  until they finally settled on someone who evidently everybody in their  Conference disliked the least.   Here they are today, Mr. Speaker, right back where they started, with  nothing to show the American people except dysfunction and disarray. We  heard promise after promise from Republican leaders that this Congress  would be different: more open and more accommodating, we kept on  hearing.   Those promises have been broken. There have been over 40 closed rules  on the floor, blocking 68 percent of bipartisan amendments. By the way,  they even blocked over half of all Republican amendments. Twenty  percent of Mr. Massie's own amendments have been blocked, never even  considered on the floor.   I have a radical idea that in the world's greatest deliberative body  we should, I don't know, deliberate? Yet time after time, despite their  promises, Republicans are blocking amendment after amendment. Again,  two-thirds of bipartisan amendments and over half of their own  amendments have been blocked. Don't worry, though, they found a way to  make in order every  [[Page H5863]]  single MAGA culture war amendment to ban abortion and go after women's  reproductive rights. They tucked those into nearly every appropriations  bill. You would think that after all of that, at least they would have  something to show for it, right? You would be wrong.   At this point in the 116th Congress, when Democrats were in charge,  during divided government, we had already enacted 68 laws; not just  passed the House, but enacted into law, signed by the President. So far  this Congress, Republicans have enacted 19 laws. That is it. Let that  sink in. Democrats enacted over three times the number of laws at this  point in our majority. Here is an idea: Maybe they would have had more  bills signed into law if they didn't waste all their time fighting with  one another.   Instead, they wasted an entire month, 26 days so far, fighting with  themselves, holding midnight seances trying to revive the dead bills  that divided their Conference and fighting a MAGA civil war about who  should be in charge. Fourteen percent of all legislative days this  Congress have been focused not on the American people, but on which one  of them gets to be in charge. That is a national embarrassment.   Do you know how many days it took Democrats to pick a Speaker when we  were in charge, Mr. Speaker? One. One. Americans expected us to govern,  not fight with each other. That reminds me, it's not like we don't have  a recent example of what it looks like when Congress gets stuff done in  a productive and bipartisan way.   Now, let's compare their record this Congress with our record last  Congress. Republicans have made fewer bipartisan amendments in order.  They have even made fewer majority amendments in order, and only 19  bills signed into law. Again, we have a recent example of what this  place looks like when it works.   Democrats enacted 58 laws last Congress, signed by the President at  this point. I said a moment ago that it was 68 under divided  government. It was 58 in the last Congress. We get things done, no  matter who is in the White House. We take our job seriously. The facts  speak for themselves, and the contrasts could not be more clear.   This right here, this is what Democratic leadership looks like in  Congress. It looks like results for American families.   Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan, ending the COVID crisis  and reopening our economy.   Democrats passed the CHIPS and Science Act, bringing jobs back from  China and supply chains back from overseas.   Democrats passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a  historic investment that will rebuild our infrastructure for  generations and generations to come.   What did almost every single Republican do on every single one of  those bills? They voted ``no.''   Guess what, though? They are in charge now, and instead of rising to  the occasion, they have totally, totally, totally failed at governing.  They are running this place like babies. Actually, I think that is an  insult to babies, Mr. Speaker. Their incompetence is staggering. Their  infighting is so immature that it is stunning.    All the American people want, Mr. Speaker, is for Republicans to work  with Democrats to get things done. It is that simple. It is that  simple. Republicans barely control one-half of one branch of  government. Democrats control the Senate and the White House. To get  anything done, anything at all, we all have to work together. We have  to compromise. We have to do things in a bipartisan way. That is, quite  frankly, what the American people want. They want us to put people over  politics to get stuff done, and that is what Democrats are focused on.   I can tell you, people are fed up with this Republican dysfunction  and disarray. They are fed up with Republicans fighting with each other  instead of for the people. They are fed up with Republican leadership  caving to the MAGA extremists time after time after time. I am telling  you right now, this majority will not be in the majority for long if  things keep going like they have been.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think the viewing public who is watching this may take  note that the gentleman didn't respond to anything that I said in my  opening remarks.   I will point out for the record so people understand that over half  of the amendments that were offered to this bill were rejected.  Actually, they were blocked. They were blocked by the Republican  majority on the Rules Committee. Mr. Speaker, 170 amendments, many of  them Republican amendments, I should point out, were blocked. It was  not because they added to spending. They were just blocked.   The point I was trying to make, and I will make it again, is that my  friends on the other side of the aisle, my complaint with them is they  have accomplished absolutely nothing. They have wasted their time in  the majority.   The gentleman talks about all these deep cuts. Some of these  appropriations bills, I will be honest with you, I object to them  because they are going to hurt people, people I represent.   He talks about all these cuts. None of these are ever going to become  law. We spent all of last week debating two appropriations bills, the  Transportation bill and the Financial Services bill. We worked  overtime, late into the night, debating all these amendments, and guess  what? They pulled them.   They are in the majority. They can't even pass the crummy bills that  are being sent from the Appropriations Committee to the Rules  Committee.   It is mind-boggling. The bill we are talking about today, I am not  even sure this is going to pass. I wouldn't be surprised if they pull  this and the Labor-HHS bill, as well.   This is not how you run Congress. We are supposed to bring things to  completion. The bill before us today was so bad that the full  Appropriations Committee didn't even mark it up. Why? Because they  probably couldn't get votes to get it out.   My friends have accomplished absolutely nothing in their majority.  That is a tragedy. They barely struggle to do the basics, like keeping  the lights on, but they need Democratic help to do that.   They have blocked the majority of their own Members' amendments. You  can't make this stuff up. The gentleman, who is on the Rules Committee,  had a big chunk of his amendments blocked, as well.   In any event, Mr. Speaker, we are going to urge our side to defeat  the previous question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule  to provide for consideration of a measure that unequivocally states  that the people's House will keep its promise to American workers and  seniors and that we will protect and preserve Social Security and  Medicare and fight against any Republican cuts to these essential  programs that so many of our constituents rely on.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. McGarvey) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me again point out that my friends on the other side  of the aisle blocked most of the amendments that were brought before  the Rules Committee. In fact, they have a habit of even blocking a  majority of their own Members' amendments.   Even with this rigged process that we have been operating under that  the Republicans have put in place, even under this rigged process--and  they have yet to rebut this--they have accomplished nothing. They have  accomplished nothing. They have normalized dysfunction.   A win for this majority is having Democrats keep the lights on for  them so that we don't shut the government down.   I brought this chart out before, but this is a contrast of what we  accomplished when we were in charge. I can go right down the list: the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Honoring our PACT Act and  helping our veterans to get additional healthcare, the Violence Against  Women Act reauthorization, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act, the Chips and Science Act, the Families First  Coronavirus Response Act, the Paycheck Protection Program and  Healthcare Enhancement Act.   These are things that passed the House and the Senate and were signed  by the President. These are real things.   Here we are today doing what we did last week, bringing up all these  rightwing MAGA amendments with appropriations bills that are so bad  that even Republican members on the Appropriations Committee do not  want to vote for them in full committee, so we bypass that.   They come to the floor, and we are going to debate the amendments  they made in order all day and all night, only to have them pull the  stuff at the end of the day.   That is what they did last week. Two bills, after all the time on the  floor debating, were just pulled.   I get it. We signed up for this, but I will be honest with you that I  think it is a disservice to the staff who work up here and who take  this job seriously to go through all of these kinds of gyrations for no  reason at all. It is just ridiculous.   This majority, as we come to the close of this week--hopefully, we  will break for Thanksgiving--has accomplished nothing. This has been a  waste of time.   Do you want to talk about a waste of taxpayer money? It is the  Republican majority in this House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I don't even know where to begin. What we are witnessing here is  called smoke and mirrors. The gentleman says we are not going to sneak  things into a bill at the last minute. A whole bunch of stuff was snuck  into this bill at the last minute. In fact, I repeat, this bill did not  go before the full Appropriations Committee. It was not reported out by  the full Appropriations Committee. Why? Because it is so extreme and so  awful that they didn't have the votes.   The same thing last week, two appropriations bills, we wasted all of  this time on the floor talking about those bills and then they pulled  them because they didn't have the votes. Here we are again voting on  another extreme bill that will probably, in all likelihood, be pulled.   When the gentleman is making the case that somehow amendments are  blocked because they are not rule compliant, okay, all right, that is  an argument to be made, but that is not the case with the overwhelming  majority of the amendments that were blocked. I say to my Republican  friends who are watching, a majority of your amendments were blocked,  and you guys are in charge.    I get it. They blocked 72 percent of the amendments I offered, which  by the way are rule compliant, but they blocked the majority of  Republican amendments. The gentleman says: We were just blocking  amendments that were not rule compliant. Last night in the Rules  Committee, we offered amendments to strike out language that is in the  bill. It is totally rule compliant.   We offered an amendment to strike the anti-abortion riders. We had a  vote, and the gentleman voted with the majority of Republicans to block  us even being able to offer an amendment to strike the anti-abortion  riders. I guess they are afraid they would lose or afraid of the debate  or afraid to put vulnerable Members in a tough position, whatever.   We had an amendment striking anti-LGBTQ riders. Again, all the  Republicans, the gentleman included, voted to block it. It was totally  rule compliant.   We had an amendment striking the anti-gun safety riders that were  added into this bill. They were totally rule compliant. Every  Republican, including the gentleman, voted to not make our amendment in  order.   This is what you call smoke and mirrors. We had an amendment striking  their anti-climate riders. Again, it is in the bill. We are not putting  something new in the bill. This is their bill, totally rule compliant.  Every Republican, including the gentleman, voted to block that.   Let's not have this kind of fantasy debate where we are saying, oh,  all we did was we kept out amendments that were not rule compliant.   The bottom line is: You are afraid of the debates. My friends are  afraid that they may lose on some of these issues. They also know that  the majority of the American people do not like their position on  women's reproductive rights where they want a national abortion ban.  They also know that a majority of people in this country are sick and  tired of bigotry against the LGBTQ+ community. They know that a  majority of Americans are sick and tired of the rising level of gun  violence in this country. They also know that a majority of Americans  believe climate change is for real, and they want us to do stuff to try  to reverse the current trends.   They blocked all of these amendments. I have the report from the  Rules Committee last night with all the votes and the amendments. They  are all rule compliant.   Let's get real here. We are here today to, again, talk about an  appropriations bill that is not only extreme, that probably at the end  of the day, they are not going to be able to pass it with Republican  votes. It will certainly never become law. It is a joke of a bill. They  wouldn't even bring it before the full Republican-controlled  Appropriations Committee and then--or they are going to pull it. That  is it.   You want to talk about wasting money, all of the money we wasted last  week debating bills that are going nowhere. What about the money that  we wasted while for 26 days we had no Speaker of the House but had to  keep everybody here while they tried to fight amongst themselves on  which member of the Republican Conference they disliked the least so  they could move that person forward as Speaker. Give me a break.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I think I am beginning to understand the logic of the gentleman from  Kentucky. He thinks that we have an open process as long as amendments  that he agrees with are made in order, but any amendments that he  doesn't agree with it is okay to block them.   I don't have any problem with some of the crummy amendments that the  gentleman and the Republicans have made in order that, in my opinion,  are really bad for this country. We will have those debates, and we  will vote on them. I have no problem with that.   I don't know why my friends are afraid to have a debate on women's  reproductive rights, whether or not we should protect a woman's right  to choose, whether we should protect a woman's right to abortion in  this country. They blocked it. They added language in that curtails  women's rights, but they won't allow an amendment so we can have those  10 minutes of debate.   I don't know why the gentleman is afraid to have a debate on whether  or not we should end bigotry against the LGBTQ+ community. If they  believe that it is okay to continue prejudice and discrimination  against that community, they can vote ``no'' on our amendment. Let's  have the debate.   On climate change or even on--we have a different position on assault  weapons. The gentleman can offer his amendment. We have a different  amendment. Why is it that the amendment that we offered is blocked?   It is just a strange view of the world when you come up here and say  we have a very fair and open process here. We block all your  amendments, but we are making all the amendments that we agree with  basically in order. I don't really think that is a fair process.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are a minority party that is  masquerading as a majority party. I say that because I think my friends  on the other side don't want to actually be in charge anymore. It is  easier to be in the minority when you are a Republican. They think all  you have to do is vote ``no'' on everything.   It is harder to be in the majority. It is especially hard because the  Republican Party no longer represents a coherent political ideology  that seeks to solve problems or govern. They just want to scream and  yell about how this place is broken--when they are the ones that broke  it.   They want to use crisis and scandal to mask their own selfishness and  sedition, and to cover up their own incompetence and ineffectiveness.  The American people see through it. They know this Republican majority  is a disaster--a national embarrassment. They have normalized  dysfunction.   We have Republican Members of Congress literally assaulting each  other in the hallways. They are threatening to punch people in  committee hearings. They are getting into fights on the House floor and  having their supporters threaten each other's families with violence.  That is the truth.   They have wasted away their majority fighting among themselves and  acting like babies. They focus on retaliation and revenge. They are  pursuing ridiculous impeachment inquiry sideshows. They are  conditioning aid to our allies on tax cuts for billionaires here at  home. They scream about the deficit when they keep passing bills that  blow up the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, I say to the people watching this at home, you might not  agree with Democrats on everything, but we are team normal. The  Republicans are team totally off-the-deep-end nuts. I cleaned that up  for the floor, Mr. Speaker, for civility.   Democrats ran this place like professionals. Republicans are running  it into the ground. Democrats fight for the people. Republicans only  care about fighting with each other. Democrats behave like adults. I  hope rational, reasonable, moderate Republicans, if any are left, will  join us and reject the MAGA extremists who behave like spoiled rotten  children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``hell no'' on this rule and a ``no'' vote on  the underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
