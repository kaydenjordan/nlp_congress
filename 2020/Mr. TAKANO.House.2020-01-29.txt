 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to the  Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020 that would prohibit the inclusion of  arrest records on a consumer report if the arrest did not lead to a  conviction.   Consumer reporting in this country is extremely broken, and consumer  reports regularly have unexpected errors. Millions of public records do  not contain accurate information, which means that reports have been  found to include outdated information and misclassified offenses.   Additionally, incomplete reports fail to say whether or not a person  who faced an arrest was exonerated or if criminal charges against them  were dropped.   An arrest does not prove criminal conduct and it is not a presumption  of guilt. If a consumer was arrested and there was no subsequent  conviction, that arrest should not be allowed to show on a consumer  report.   Now, due to the extreme bias in our criminal justice system, people  of color are arrested and convicted at disproportionate levels in this  country. For example, we know that African Americans and Hispanics are  approximately two to three times more likely to be arrested than their  White counterparts.                                time  1600    These disproportionate levels of arrests can negatively impact the  ability for African Americans and Hispanics to obtain housing or find  employment. That is why California, New York, and Kentucky have  prohibited the inclusion of arrest records without a conviction on  consumer reports. We need to  [[Page H694]]  follow their lead and implement this nationwide.   I am encouraged by the work of my colleagues on the Financial  Services Committee to limit the time adverse information can remain on  a consumer credit report, including information pertaining to  convictions.   My amendment goes one step further by prohibiting arrest records from  being included if they do not lead to a criminal conviction. Consumers  deserve a fair shot in society and should not be penalized for wrongful  arrests or arrests that did not lead to a guilty conviction.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   I want to point out to the gentleman that my amendment pertains to  records of arrests that appear on consumer reports that did not lead to  a conviction, so, what is recorded on the report is an arrest.   I don't believe most Americans believe that it is fair for that  consumer to suffer adverse ability to gain housing or to gain credit or  whatever it may be, a job, but employers look at job----    Mr. Chairman, is the gentleman concerned about the  pending arrest?    Mr. Chairman, we believe in those instances where there  has been an arrest and there is a pending trial, so the arrest shows up  on their record and there is a pending trial, we think it is a very  small number of cases.   I do agree with the gentleman from North Carolina that is something  we should address, and I would be more than happy to work with him on  final language if this should gain legs. I believe we can cure that  particular instance.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the spirit in which the gentleman from North Carolina  understands the intent here. I believe that most Americans seeing this  language on its face would say it makes common sense. There is a kind  of netherworld for that person who has been arrested but, yet, who has  not been tried.   I still say that our system of jurisprudence says that the person who  has been arrested and not yet tried is still presumed to be innocent,  and I still maintain that it is reasonable for Congress to hold a  consumer reporting agency accountable to only reporting records of  arrest for those who have been convicted.   I understand there is some netherworld here, but I still think we  need to err on the side of our system of jurisprudence, which says that  we presume a person to be innocent until proven guilty, and a person  who has been arrested and not yet gone to trial is in that status.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I urge that my colleagues back this very commonsense amendment, which  would ensure that any person who has been arrested but never convicted  or whose case has never been brought to trial--actually, not been  convicted. I want to make it very clear, if they have not been  convicted, they should not be listed on a consumer credit report.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
