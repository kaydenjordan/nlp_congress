 Mr. Chairman, I thank Dr. Dunn for leading this  amendment.   I had an over three-decade experience and great working relationship  with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, as well as nurse  anesthetists. I believe one of the secrets to that great work that we  did was the collaboration between us and how we worked together.   I firmly believe that whenever narcotics are involved, there needs to  be a very close working relationship between the supervising physician  and these other groups and societies. As narcotic and opioid abuse has  become a national crisis, we need to be working even more closely  together so as not to exacerbate the problem.
