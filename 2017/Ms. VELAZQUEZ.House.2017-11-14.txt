 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2874.   This bill makes flood insurance more expensive, less available, and  less fair for millions of working families.   This bill all but abandons Hurricane Sandy victims.   Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New York and New Jersey 5 years ago,  causing approximately $60 billion in damage. More than 50 people lost  their lives.   Today--half a decade later--more than 1,000 homeowners still have not  obtained proper resolution of their flood insurance claim.   That is why I have worked for almost 1\1/2\ years on legislation to  improve FEMA's claims processing system and to bring proper oversight  and management to the write-your-own program. While some of my  recommended changes were included in this bill, language was also  included that blows a direct hole in these reforms. This bill requires  policyholders to exhaust all administrative remedies on any disputed  claim before having their day in court.   However, we have already seen that FEMA's administrative system is  broken--and this bill will enable dishonest insurance providers to  continue hiding behind an unreachable threshold--meaning policyholders  will never be made whole.   After more than 5 years, with more than 1,000 families still awaiting  resolution of their Hurricane Sandy claim, we must seek to meaningfully  reform the claims process, not make it harder for families to return to  their home.   A vote for this bill is a vote to abandon Hurricane Sandy victims.  Vote ``no.''
