 Mr. Speaker, the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) published a report on August 3rd with findings  that ``black identity extremists'' and their views on police brutality  have very likely contributed to an uptick in premeditated violence  against police officers. While many questions about the origins and  intentions behind this report still remain unanswered, I cannot help  but feel that this troubling assessment is reminiscent of the 1960's  era Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) that targeted black  activists during the Civil Rights Movement.   There are no doubts that the 2012 shooting of Treyvon Martin or the  2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri have paved the way  for increased tension within our communities. The subsequent protests  and rise of the Black Lives Matter movement born out of the 2013  acquittal of Treyvon Martin's murderer fueled further tension between  law enforcement and racial minorities. However, these protests--while  interspersed with bouts  [[Page H8074]]  of violence--have been largely peaceful at their core.   Interestingly, we have yet to also see a comparable FBI report  investigating the white supremacists that have emerged during rallies  in Charlottesville, VA and other parts of the country. This apparent  double standard sets a dangerous precedent for race relations in the  United States. The FBI's recent report is also extremely troubling  given the rise and prominence of far-right movements throughout the  country during this tense moment in our history.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus has called for an FBI  briefing on the origins of this report and the Bureau's intentions on  next steps. I will join my colleagues in eagerly awaiting a response  from the FBI, so that we can make sure that there is no impropriety or  racial bias fueling this investigation. I am disappointed in the FBI's  report and urge my colleagues to tread carefully as we look to avoid a  repeat of history by using government institutions and resources to  unfairly target racial minorities.                            ____________________
