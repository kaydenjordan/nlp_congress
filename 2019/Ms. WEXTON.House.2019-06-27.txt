 Madam Speaker, in 2016, Russian hackers tried to break  into Virginia's election system. In response to this information,  Virginia took active steps to secure the integrity of our elections. We  sped up our transition to paper ballots to ensure that our elections  were secure and the results could be verified and audited.   But it is not just about any one election or just about any one  adversary. Passing the SAFE Act is about securing our elections from  all threats, foreign or otherwise. These threats are coming for us in  every State, red or blue, rural or urban.   In 2016, State election websites in Illinois and Arizona were hacked  by intruders that installed malware and downloaded sensitive voter  information.   In 2018, electronic voting machines in Georgia and Texas deleted  votes for certain candidates or switched votes from one candidate to  another.   In Johnson County, Indiana, e-poll books failed in 2018, halting  voting entirely for 4 hours, with no extension of polling hours.   It is clear that Congress must take action. Passage of the SAFE Act  will secure our elections by updating our election infrastructure,  speeding up the transition to paper ballots, and making necessary  investments in cybersecurity.   Every Member of Congress took an oath to protect this Nation from  threats foreign and domestic, and I urge my colleagues to honor that  oath. Let's protect our democracy while we still have one.
