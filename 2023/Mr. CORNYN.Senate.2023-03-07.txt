 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, communities across the country have paid  the price of Democrats' soft-on-crime policies. The Democratic Party  has backed woke prosecutors who refuse to enforce broad swaths of the  Criminal Code. It has endorsed ``defund the police'' policies and  candidates, and it has consistently shown more sympathy for the  criminals who commit crimes than for the victims who were hurt by them.   It is no surprise that these decisions carry very dangerous  consequences, which are being felt across America. Businesses are  fleeing Portland, OR, due to surging crime. The mayor of Chicago was  just defeated in her primary because she failed to address rampant  crime in that city.   One city that is not immune to these consequences is our Nation's  Capital, Washington, DC. So far this year, the District of Columbia has  seen more than three dozen homicides--a nearly 40 percent increase  compared to last year. Forty percent. Sex crimes have more than doubled  compared to last year, and there have been more than 1,200 motor  vehicle thefts, including carjackings, which is more than double the  number at this point last year. In total, the Nation's Capital, where  we are located, reported a 25-percent increase in crime compared to  last year.   With crime on the rise, you would expect that the elected leaders of  the DC City Council would take steps to improve public safety, but that  is not what they did. In fact, council members took the exact opposite  approach. Forget deterring criminal conduct; the DC City Council  responded to this crime wave by reducing penalties for violent crimes.  It actually passed legislation that decreases punishment for many of  the same crimes that have been on the rise over the last year--lower  penalties for carjackings, home invasions, and robberies and lower  penalties for convicted felons who illegally carry firearms and for  felons who use guns to commit other crimes. There are no mandatory  minimum sentences for any crime other than first-degree murder.   It is a slap in the face of every law-abiding resident and visitor to  this city; every person who worries about getting carjacked on their  way home from work, like the people who work for us here in the  Nation's Capital; or being robbed on the Metro, like the visitors from  our States who come to the Nation's Capital who don't expect to be  assaulted and robbed; or individuals who have their residence targeted  by a serial burglar.   This is not the kind of legislation that is meant to keep people  safe; it is just the latest iteration of failed soft-on-crime policies.  It is no surprise that DC's Criminal Code rewrite was met with severe  backlash.   Even the Washington Post published an editorial entitled ``DC's crime  bill could make the city more dangerous.'' Well, I give them credit for  stating the obvious.   The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia warned that this  measure prevents courts from imposing penalties that appropriately  reflect the seriousness of the offense and the defendant's criminal  history.   One local elected official used especially harsh words to describe a  portion of the bill that would allow someone convicted of sexual  assault to petition for early release after 20 years. She said:         I don't think the DC Council should be helping rapists get       out of prison early. That's crazy.    Crazy indeed--so crazy, in fact, that the city's liberal Mayor,  Muriel Bowser, even vetoed this measure when it reached her desk,  saying it ``does not make us safer.''   I don't find myself agreeing with the Washington Post editorial board  or the Mayor of the District of Columbia often, but they are both right  here.   DC Council members should have viewed her veto and the public outrage  as a sign that they should go back to the drawing board, but  unfortunately they doubled down. DC City Council overrode the Mayor's  veto. They ignored the deep concerns of citizens of this city and the  dire warnings from public safety advocates and plowed ahead.   Fortunately, that is not the end of the road for this dangerous and  deeply misguided bill. The Constitution of the United States gives  Congress exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the District of  Columbia. It is a Federal district. We must take action to prevent  [[Page S666]]  this criminal-friendly measure from going into effect.   As we have seen, this effort has broad bipartisan support, starting  at the White House. Last month, the House of Representatives passed a  resolution of disapproval by a vote of 250 to 173, with more than 30  Democrats crossing the aisle to support it. Thanks to the Senator from  Tennessee, Senator Hagerty's leadership, that resolution will receive a  vote on the Senate floor this week. I expect it will pass with strong  bipartisan support, as it should, and put a final nail in the coffin of  this dangerous and deeply misguided legislation.   Soft-on-crime policies have had a devastating impact on cities across  America, and we can't let our Nation's very Capital become a  consequence-free playground for lawbreakers. So I appreciate Senator  Hagerty's leadership on this resolution and his work to ensure that it  receives a vote in the Democrat-led Senate.
