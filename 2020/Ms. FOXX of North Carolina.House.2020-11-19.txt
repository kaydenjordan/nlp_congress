 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8294, which kills the  ability for businesses and industry to fill in-demand jobs.   Republicans and Democrats agree that apprenticeships play a critical  role in addressing our Nation's workforce needs and preparing workers  for meaningful, well-paying careers; however, the narrow-minded  approach  [[Page H5966]]  taken by Democrats in H.R. 8294 doubles down on a system that limits  apprenticeship opportunities.   Many who know me here in Congress know that I have advocated for  these job-creating programs all my career. Nothing can prepare a  student quite like on-the-job experience, and apprenticeships are a  tried-and-true method of preparing students to enter the workforce with  the skills they need to succeed.   Unfortunately, the potential for a strong bipartisan effort to expand  beyond the existing registered apprenticeship model to reach more  workers and industries has been eclipsed by the Democrats' typical  partisan games.   While our economy continues to recover from COVID-19, workers and job  creators need the flexibility to innovate. Republicans understand that  employers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best what skills their  employees require to excel in the workplace.   The Trump administration also recognizes the importance of employer- led innovation in the apprenticeship space and has taken important  steps to expand and innovate work-based learning programs. More than  430 companies and organizations have signed the President's pledge to  American workers, committing to providing more than 16 million new  education and on-the-job learning opportunities for American students  and workers.   Additionally, the Department of Labor is moving forward with  Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs to give employers the  flexibility to shape apprenticeship programs that will attract workers  and prepare them for the 21st century.   We have seen real success stories unfold when we let employers  innovate. Opportunity America and the Brookings Institution recently  published a study on the Federation for Advanced Manufacturing  Education, or FAME, an organization that connects educators, employers,  and students with hands-on learning to strengthen the manufacturing  industry.   The study found Kentucky FAME graduates, when compared to their non- FAME counterparts, earned up to 63 percent more 1 year after  graduation. Five years after, FAME graduates earned $98,000, compared  to $52,783 for non-FAME graduates.   This study represents not only a success story in Kentucky, but it  uncovers a larger narrative. There is untapped potential in the  apprenticeship space waiting to be unleashed because the existing  registered model doesn't meet the need of many companies right now.   Instead of giving workers and employers more autonomy to create  programs that are responsive to workforce needs, the Democrats' bill  clings to an 80-year-old system that shuts the door on flexibility and  innovation and enshrines union giveaways.   In a letter to Committee Republicans, John Pallasch, Assistant  Secretary for Employment and Training at the Department of Labor,  cautioned that ``if enacted, this bill would inhibit the ability of the  Department to fulfill its mission in providing more Americans access to  apprenticeships.'' Mr. Pallasch went on to warn that H.R. 8294 puts  job-filling programs in jeopardy due to an ``excessive number of  requirements that are overly prescriptive.''   Still, House Democrats want to make registered apprenticeships the  only possible model under the National Apprenticeship Act. This  approach is flawed. The numbers speak for themselves. In fiscal year  2019, 252,000 individuals entered apprenticeships, and only 81,000  graduated from the registered system.   It is obvious that we can and should do better, but Democrats are  turning a blind eye to needed improvements that will allow more  Americans to get back to work and achieve the American Dream.   The bill before us will force job creators to deal with overly  prescriptive requirements, additional bureaucracy, and time-consuming  paperwork. This stifling environment has discouraged new and small  businesses from participating in the registered apprenticeship system  for years now.   The majority claims that this legislation will create 1 million new  apprenticeship programs simply by virtue of throwing more money at the  registered system without solving the underlying problems that prevent  employers from participating or allowing for alternative models. It  seems the new definition of insanity is the Federal Government spending  more taxpayer dollars on decades-old programs and expecting different  results.   An all-of-the-above approach is the best way to connect more workers  with apprenticeship opportunities so they can secure meaningful, well- paying careers. That is why Republicans on the Education and Labor  Committee introduced a commonsense amendment during the bill's markup  to unleash the full potential of apprenticeships and help fill in- demand jobs.   Among other provisions, it would allow the Department of Labor the  flexibility to pursue other forms of work-based learning under the  National Apprenticeship Act, including in response to COVID-19. It  would reduce the paperwork burden on States by allowing them to submit  State plans under the preexisting framework of the Workforce Innovation  and Opportunity Act rather than forcing them to establish a duplicative  application process.                                time  1515    Rarely is more government intervention the solution, which is why the  amendment would strike provisions in H.R. 8294 that would add to the  existing bureaucracy in the form of advisory committees and interagency  agreements. The amendment also provides States with more discretion  over how they spend their money, instead of letting the Federal  Government dictate where their dollars must go.   This amendment also makes it easier for more programs, and therefore,  more apprentices to access the registered apprenticeship system by  removing the requirement setting an uneven playing field between union  and nonunion program sponsors for the ratios of apprentices to  instructors. This particular provision is just another scheme by  Democrats to force workers into unions. Unfortunately, this  commonsense, forward-looking amendment was struck down on a party line  vote by committee Democrats.   Thankfully, the full House will have the opportunity to vote on this  amendment during floor consideration, and I hope Democrats will take  this opportunity to adopt legislation that will actually increase work- based learning opportunities.   At a time when workers and job creators are working hard to overcome  the challenges presented by COVID-19, we shouldn't close potential  pathways to work. Apprenticeships can help put more Americans to work  as we recover from the pandemic, but only if job creators are given the  flexibility to innovate and develop high quality earn-and-learn  programs. And the Democrat bill fails on that front.   I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the  gentlewoman from California (Congresswoman Davis) for her work on this  bill and her career in Congress. We all respect her. And I earnestly  wish we could have come up with a bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, our bench on the Republican  side is very strong, and it is especially strong because of the  Representatives from Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne), who has been an extremely valuable  member of this committee, and we will miss him in the next term.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume   Mr. Speaker, others have spoken to this bill being a gift to the  unions this afternoon. It is no surprise that the Democrats want to pay  favor to the union bosses who line their pockets. Their end goal must  be what all socialist countries have in common: control of the  workforce through unions. After all, they have spent this Congress  pushing one socialist agenda after another.   The bill before us is just another example. Democrats' blatant  favoritism towards unions will block countless jobseekers from  receiving apprenticeship opportunities. America's workers and their  families will pay the price. This bill reinforces the idea that there  is only one way to do things--the government's way.   When will Democrats learn that the American people are not interested  in government-mandated socialist policies?   Once again, Democrats are choosing to bend to the will of Big Labor  instead of putting American workers first. It is shameful, Mr. Speaker,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, millions of workers will need reskilling due to  pandemic-related job loss and displacement.   The World Economic Forum discusses this issue at length in their  recent report titled: ``The Future of Jobs Report 2020.'' In the report  they point to a double disruption scenario impacting workers due to  both automation and COVID-19 workplace disruptions. This double  disruption is further reinforced in their findings that ``84 percent of  employers are set to rapidly digitalize working processes.''   The demand for reskilling workers is high, and we will be left  chasing the needs of our workforce with the current one-size-fits-all  approach this bill seeks to enshrine into law. As in-demand skills  evolve in the years to come, the skills gap will continue to  [[Page H5975]]  grow in the absence of forward-thinking reform.   I, again, urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join  Republicans in creating new apprenticeship pathways through innovative  models such as the industry recognized apprenticeship model.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, earlier we heard from our  colleagues that there is going to be a $3 return to the American people  for every tax dollar they give up to get this program funded in the  next 5 years. I want to tell you that I think the American people would  be happy to see that return.   Show me any Federal program that returns to hardworking taxpayers $3  for every dollar they pay in, and I will show you some swampland in New  Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder than words. When it comes to  Democrats' delivering on promises, Americans are often left  disappointed. Workforce development and apprenticeships are no  exception. Take their so-called Heroes Act as an example.   Democrats tout the impactful role apprenticeships will play as our  country recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet their bill allocates a  miniscule percentage of money for workforce development initiatives,  and it doesn't do anything to ensure the money is used to develop and  educate workers.   In the first Heroes Act only .07 percent of total funding was  allocated to the Employment and Training Administration.  Unsurprisingly, in the Heroes Act 2.0, only 0.1 percent of total  funding was allocated to the Employment and Training Administration.  This is hypocrisy at its best.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, workforce programs like apprenticeships will aid in  closing the skills gap and put more Americans to work, but only if  employees and job creators are given the flexibility to innovate and  develop high-quality earn-and-learn programs without overreach from  Washington.   That is why Republicans want to expand employers' opportunities to  address the needs of their current and prospective workers through an  all-of-the-above approach to apprenticeships rather than closing  potential pathways to work.   Unfortunately, H.R. 8294 doubles down on a narrow and prescriptive  approach and gives Washington bureaucrats, not job creators, more  control. This flawed legislation will prevent more job seekers from  accessing apprenticeship opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on  H.R. 8294, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition, though  I am not opposed to the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that Representative Stefanik's  amendment was made in order.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Stefanik).    Mr. Speaker, Representative Stefanik's  amendment is a valuable change that would make it easier for programs  of shorter length to be approved specifically in fields where  apprenticeships have not traditionally seen growth or expansion.   While most of the other amendments in this en bloc are  unobjectionable, I do want to highlight three amendments where I have  concerns.   The amendment offered by Representatives Beyer and Pressley is mostly  unobjectionable. We certainly share the majority's intent in ensuring  access to apprenticeships for people with disabilities. However, it  also includes a provision that would actually hold apprenticeship  program sponsors to a higher standard than the standard to which  section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 currently holds Federal  agencies, which are the target of that particular provision.   While this was likely well intentioned, the underlying bill already  prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability and requires  program sponsors to provide accommodations for individuals with  disabilities, so holding small business and other employers who are  seeking to expand opportunities for individuals with disabilities to a  higher standard than we hold ourselves in the Federal Government is a  guaranteed way to ensure fewer apprenticeship opportunities rather than  more.                                time  1630    Another amendment concealed within the en bloc is offered by  Representative Moore, which will lead to excessive paperwork and little  real outcomes for low-income individuals or individuals with barriers  to employment.   Finally, the amendment offered by Representative Horsford claims to  ensure equity and opportunity in the apprenticeship system. In reality,  I am afraid it may cause confusion at best. The amendment would add new  criteria to the definition of ``national qualified intermediaries,''  requiring them to support the increased participation of nontraditional  apprenticeship populations and nontraditional apprenticeship industries  or occupations.   Even if they wanted to, some national qualified intermediaries may  not be in a position to do this, either because of their location or  the nature of their program.  [[Page H5980]]    If there is an opportunity in the new Congress to resume bipartisan  conversations on reauthorization of the National Apprenticeship Act, I  welcome the chance to discuss what the intent is here and to seek out  common ground. In fact, I hope the new Congress brings about true  bipartisan work from my colleagues.   While these three specific amendments cause me concern, on balance,  this en bloc consideration is worthy of support even if it won't  ultimately redeem the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we aren't here debating a bloc of  amendments that will work to address the failings of the underlying  bill.   I am pleased to see at least one amendment in this group will help  bring some flexibility to States.   I urge support of the en bloc consideration of these amendments, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this en bloc incorporates three amendments to the  underlying bill that would enhance opportunities in the registered  apprenticeship system.  [[Page H5981]]    The amendment offered by Mr. Kilmer of Washington and Mr. Fitzpatrick  of Pennsylvania amends the grant program within the underlying bill to  promote offerings for computer science programs.   Modernizing the 80-year-old National Apprenticeship Act ought to  include apprenticeship opportunities within a variety of sectors. Far  too often, society paints apprenticeships as only applying to the  ``trades.'' While there are certainly valuable pathways within those  fields, we need to expand the horizons of what apprenticeships are  capable of providing for workers. This is also why I think it is  important to call these ``professions'' rather than the ``trades.'' A  broader policy should not be limited by how it has traditionally been  viewed or how we speak about it.   Computer science is a high-growth and promising career path leading  to in-demand lucrative jobs for workers.   We hear too often that students are graduating without the technical  skills they need to be successful in today's workforce. This amendment  would support employers in recruiting and developing new employees with  the computer science competencies they need to make up for these  deficits and help fill a widening skills gap.   Similarly, the amendment offered by Ms. Titus of Nevada and  cosponsored by several Members on both sides of the aisle adds  hospitality and tourism to the list of nontraditional apprenticeship  industries that are eligible for grants under this act.   If this grant program is to live up to its name and reflect the  economy of the 21st century, we must break free from antiquated, narrow  ideas of apprenticeships and bring more opportunities to promising  sectors. The hospitality and tourism industries are a prime example of  areas in which students would benefit from more on-the-job learning  experiences and employer-led instruction than they would from a  traditional college education.   Finally, the amendment offered by Mr. Lamb of Pennsylvania and Mr.  Taylor of Texas includes veterans service organizations in several key  places. Specifying VSOs as partner organizations for involvement in the  registered apprenticeship system ensures the needs of veterans will be  considered and incorporated into apprenticeship programs.   The amendment also highlights the VSOs as entities that should be  contacted for promoting and raising awareness about apprenticeship  opportunities, making sure our veterans have full access to and  information about apprenticeship opportunities.   Because apprenticeships recognize and build on prior knowledge and  skills, veterans stand to benefit greatly from these opportunities and  should be engaged in the system as much as possible.   We want apprenticeships to support all workers seeking to access and  enhance career opportunities. These amendments ensure the 21st Century  Grant program expands opportunities in promising sectors and that the  registered apprenticeship system engages veterans.   I support these amendments, encourage my colleagues to do the same,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
