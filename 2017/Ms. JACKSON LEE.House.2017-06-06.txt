 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 354,  which condemns the violence, on American soil, against peaceful  protestors outside the residence of the Turkish Ambassador to the  United States and calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.   On May 16, 2017, the President hosted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  of Turkey for an official meeting at the White House to discuss  counter-terrorism cooperation and bilateral issues.   That evening, over two dozen protestors peaceably assembled outside  the Turkish Ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C., to voice their  opposition to Turkish Government policies.   It was not long before unprovoked violence erupted, when pro-Erdogan  supporters and individuals from the Turkish Embassy grounds pushed past  District of Columbia police officers to brutally attack the peaceful  demonstrators.   These Turkish officials violated the First Amendment rights of United  States citizens, and multiple armed Turkish officials beat, kicked, and  choked unarmed demonstrators.   Multiple video recordings show the violence with which these  demonstrators were attacked.   The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and  the Department of State confirm that the demonstrators did not  instigate the violence.   Two armed Turkish officers attached to a security detail were  detained at the scene for physically assaulting Federal agents but were  later released and allowed to leave the United States because they held  diplomatic immunity.   Mr. Speaker, it is beyond dispute that the life of President Erdogan  was never in any danger.   It must be noted that immunity for diplomatic personnel and certain  other foreign officials is a core principal but so is the  constitutionally protected right to protest peacefully and freely in  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third instance of violence perpetrated by  members of Turkish President Erdogan's security detail on United States  soil.   In 2011, a brawl erupted in the halls of the United States Nations  General Assembly between members of Turkish President Erdogan's  security detail and United Nations security officers, resulting in one  United Nations security officer being hospitalized due to serious  injuries.   In 2016, members of Turkish President Erdogan's security detail  engaged in unwarranted violence against journalist reporting on an  event at the Brookings Institution.   On May 21, 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson affirmed that  violence outside the Turkish Embassy was ``outrageous'' and ``simply  unacceptable.''   It is imperative that the right to assembly, peaceful protest, and  freedom of speech are not abridged because they are the bedrock of  democracy.   For this reason, the United States Secret Service and the Diplomatic  Security Service of the Department of State should review this incident  and confirm with the Turkish National Police the standards expected by  visiting security details to prevent future violent incidents.   The Department of State should also conduct a review of its own  security procedure to determine how to mitigate the likelihood of  similar events in the future.   It is the duty of this House to stand for our ideals and take steps  to strengthen freedoms for the press and civil society in countries  such as Turkey, and oppose efforts by foreign leaders to suppress free  and peaceful protest in their own countries.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee and as a member of the Congressional Refugee Caucus,  I rise in strong support of H.R. 390, the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide  Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017.''   This legislation makes clear that it is the policy of the United  States to ensure that assistance for humanitarian, stabilization, and  recovery needs is directed toward those individuals and communities  with the greatest need, including those individuals from communities of  religious and ethnic minorities, and communities of religious and  ethnic minorities, that have been identified as being at risk of  persecution, forced migration, acts of genocide, crimes against  humanity, or war crimes.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a timely and important response to  acts of genocide and other war crimes committed by ISIS in a its  continuing effort to subjugate the Yazidi religious minority in Syria  and Iraq.   ISIS has targeted and continues to target Muslims, Jews, Sikhs,  Christians, Yazidis and its reprehensible actions are reminiscent of  what we have seen in some of the darkest periods of human history.   For example, according to reports of human rights watchgroups, Shiite  Muslims have been killed by ongoing waves of ISIS bombings of Shiite  neighborhoods, and Shiite members of Iraq's security forces have been  victims of mass ISIS executions.   ISIS is believed to be holding 3,500 people as slaves, and most of  the enslaved are women and children from the Yazidi community.   ISIS claimed credit for the twin blasts that struck Christian  Egyptian churches during Palm Sunday services, in which at least 47  Christians were murdered.   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, in our own country we are witnessing an alarming  increase in violence, bigotry, and acts of terror against members of  many of our religious minorities:   1. Muslim college students have been shot and killed, execution- style, in their living room and outside of their mosques.   2. Jewish communities are struggling to deal with desecrated  cemeteries and waves of bomb threats being called to their community  centers and places of worship.   3. Two Sikh men were killed in New York City, a crime police declared  to be a hate-shooting.   4. Nine African American parishioners were shot to death during Bible  study at a Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in  Charleston, South Carolina.   H.R. 390 aims to promote accountability in Iraq and Syria for the  atrocities committed against the religious minorities living in those  countries.   It also provides emergency relief for victims of genocide, crimes  against humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria.   Specifically, the bill authorizes the providing of financial and  technical assistance to those in need, as well as working with  nongovernmental organizations with expertise in international criminal  investigations and law to investigate and address crimes of genocide,  crimes against humanity, or war crimes, and their constituent crimes,  occurring in Iraq since January 2014.   H.R. 390 also authorizes United States aid agencies to provide  assistance to entities determined to be capable of effectively managing  and delivering recovery, humanitarian, or stabilization assistance to  Iraqi and Syrian religious or ethnic minorities that have been  victimized by ISIS.  [[Page H4638]]    Mr. Speaker, the crimes ISIS has committed against Iraqi and Syrian  religious and ethnic minorities are horrific.   The victims of this campaign of terror are innocent and in dire need  of humanitarian and stabilization assistance.   As the global leader and champion of human rights and human dignity,  the United States has an obligation to lead the international effort to  defeat ISIS and ameliorate the suffering caused by its heinous acts.   H.R. 390 is a welcome and positive step in the right direction and I  urge all Members to join me in voting for this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res.  355, which expresses the condolences of the United States to the  twenty-two innocent victims who lost their lives and the fifty-nine  individuals who were seriously injured in the barbaric attack  perpetrated by a terrorist in Manchester, United Kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution's condemnation of this  terrorist attack for the depraved, cowardly act that it is.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the  victims.   Moreover, our heartfelt appreciation goes out to the first responders  and others who selflessly came to the aid of those affected by this  act.   Manchester will emerge from the attack more vibrant and united than  ever before with the same resiliency that has enabled it to grow and  evolve from the ``birthplace of the Industrial Revolution'' to the  modern, progressive, and welcoming metropolis that it is today.   As Manchester recovers and responds, I hope that Mancunians and  Britons as a whole will take comfort in the knowledge that the people  of the United States stand in solidarity with them.   This attack is a reminder of the common danger that democratic,  peace-loving nations of the world face from those who reject the norms  of civilized society and abuse the liberties and freedoms afforded them  by free societies.   This terrorist attack in Manchester was a horrific act on innocent  civilians perpetrated by a depraved individual who had the support of  those who misuse the peaceful religion of Islam for their own misguided  purposes.   Those who claim responsibility for this crime against humanity should  make no mistake; they will be held accountable for their actions.   Today, however, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of  Manchester, a city that represents everything terrorists despise--that  is, a place that welcomes people from all walks of life to live  together in harmony.   That symbol is recognizable to Americans, because we are a society  formed by diverse individuals intertwined to create a mosaic that is  altogether lovely, strong, and unique.   Given our special relationship with the United Kingdom, the people of  the United States of America offer our unwavering support to the people  of Manchester and of the United Kingdom.   Today, I ask a moment of silence for the victims killed and injured  in the terrorist attack in Manchester.    Mr. Speaker, our word is our bond.   The United States, when it engages internationally with our allies  and friends, and even our enemies, our word is our bond.   The meetings that the administration had recently in Saudi Arabia, I  am sure there were some positive results, but there is no positive  result to the disruption that is now occurring between Mideast  countries and Qatar.   Qatar has some of our military assets that are enormously important.  Rumor has it that the administration may be thinking of a regime  change. Yes, we have had our concerns with Qatar. We have been  concerned about human rights or concerned about various positions with  Al Jazeera, but we have worked with them, and we have realized that the  emir, over the years, has worked with us in an honest and decent way  and treated their people in a manner of decency.   I hope this is straightened out. They can't be starved. We cannot  continue to encourage or be part of any disruption in that region. We  need them to collaborate against terrorism. We do not need one being  fought by others.   I would ask that the administration straighten this out, working with  those of us who are concerned about our friends in Qatar, and to  recognize that there is no specializing and isolating and picking  friends. We have to work with all of them in that region to fight  against the terror in Iran.   I would offer, again, my acknowledgment of D-Day and thank those who  sacrificed their lives. God bless them.                            ____________________
