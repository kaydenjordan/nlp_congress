 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we aren't here to debate the government healthcare  repeal plan. We aren't here to debate that because Republican  leadership and the White House are huddled behind closed doors as we  speak, making deals that will have very real, very serious, very  dangerous consequences for millions of Americans.   Instead, we are here to debate a martial law rule that will allow  Republicans to rush their bill with its brand-new backroom deals to the  floor today without any proper deliberation. As a matter of fact, it  would let them rush any bill to the floor today, or any day through  Monday.   It is a blanket martial law rule that lasts past the weekend--not  specific to their healthcare bill, and not even specific to the topic  of health care.   What other bills could they be contemplating considering?   We saw the Buffalo bribe is already in the manager's amendment, but  this rule lets them bring up any other bill before the public has a  chance to even know what it is. Maybe something on the Russia  investigation, perhaps? I have seen a lot of news on that lately. Or  maybe we will give President Trump's friend Putin a Congressional Gold  Medal. It is the least the Republicans could do after his help with the  election.   But let's talk about what we have learned so far in the press. We  first learned from news reports last night that Republicans were  considering changes to the bill that would kill the essential health  benefits in current law. Now, let me say that again. Essential, as in  ``absolutely necessary; extremely important,'' as defined by the  dictionary.   And, sure enough, we reported out this martial law rule in the dark  of night, which will allow Republicans to bring the new and unimproved  version of the bill--again, now with even more backroom deals--to the  Rules Committee later today, or in the dead of night, and take it  straight to the floor. Apparently, there is no time to even have it sit  for 1 day so that Members can read it, let alone get analysis from the  nonpartisan experts at CBO.   Are they hoping that if they move quickly enough, no one will figure  out what they are up to?   Well, let me lay it out for everybody. Essential health benefits  require insurance plans to cover basic essential benefits, such as  emergency services, maternity care, mental health care and substance  abuse treatment, pediatric services, and prescription drugs.   Now, The New York Times this morning pointed out that this late- breaking Republican proposal could lead to plans that cover  aromatherapy, but not chemotherapy.   I mean, really? Are Republicans seriously contemplating making a  change this massive without hearings? Without a markup? No CBO estimate  of the impact? No chance to read the bill?   I have seen a lot in my years here, but this is truly unbelievable.  You guys take my breath away.                                time  0930    That is not even considering the already dangerous bill we were  supposed to be down here considering right now. Let me just make it  clear what that bill actually is.   First, it is a massive tax cut for millionaires and billionaires,  paid for by taking health insurance away from 24 million people,  period. Anyone who takes 5 minutes to look at any unbiased analysis of  the bill knows that this is true: massive tax cuts for the well-off at  the expense of 24 million people.   Now, let me paint a picture of how big that number is:   Twenty-four million people is basically the entire population of the  country of Australia.   It is more people than live in the States of Kansas, New Mexico,  Nebraska, West Virginia, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode  Island, Montana, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont,  Wyoming, and the District of Columbia, combined.   You know how I know this bill is a tax giveaway for the wealthy, and  it is not a healthcare bill? Because, according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office--and this is truly incredible--it would  actually result in more people uninsured than if the Affordable Care  Act were simply repealed. Let that sink in for a minute.   Second, their bill would cause people to pay more in terms of out-of- pocket expenses, and in return, they will get lower quality health  insurance. That is right. Republicans are asking people to pay more for  less coverage. In particular, lower income and older Americans will see  their costs skyrocket--those people who can least afford to pay more.   Third point, and this is a big one, the bill guts Medicaid and  Medicare. Now, don't take it from me. The AARP said: ``This bill would  weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability, dramatically increase  healthcare costs for Americans aged 50 to 64, and put at risk the  health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities, and  poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term services  and supports and other benefits.'' That is the AARP.   In fact, Americans aged 50 to 64 will pay premiums five times higher  than what others pay for health coverage no matter how healthy they  are. This bill is an age tax, plain and simple, and Republicans are  cutting $880 billion from Medicaid. That is a 25 percent cut in  funding.   All this to give tax cuts to the rich and to corporations. The bill  must look like a cruel joke to the most vulnerable among us.   Representative Mo Brooks, a member of the Republican Conference said  just the other night: ``Quite frankly, I'm persuaded that this  Republican healthcare bill . . . long-term, is a detriment to the  future of the United States of America.''   Finally, even before imposing martial law last night, this process  was horrendous. The Republican majority rushed their bill through the  committee process without any hearings--none, zero--just holding  marathon markups where no Democratic amendments were accepted--none,  not one. They didn't even wait for a CBO score.  [[Page H2355]]    Then, when the score finally came, it showed that the bill would kick  24 million people off their insurance. Did they stop then? No, of  course not.   Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, we rushed ahead with a cobbled- together manager's amendment--I am sorry, four cobbled-together  manager's amendments since the originals had errors and, again, no CBO  score on the updated bill.   Didn't my colleagues learn their lesson from last week?   And even worse, the main manager's amendment, which we received just  36 hours before our meeting, is so full of backroom deals, as I  mentioned, like the Buffalo bribe, a cynical--likely unconstitutional-- agreement with wavering New York Republicans who know the Republican  healthcare plan would devastate New York.   And now they are saying: Don't worry. If you don't like this bill, it  is just step one of three. You will get another chance to vote on  health care during step three. Never mind that they can't give us the  full slate of bills that are part of this mysterious step three.   Or maybe I should just take Republican Senator Cotton's word for it.  He said: ``There is no three-step plan. That is just political talk.  It's just politicians engaging in spin.''   Republican Ted Cruz from my colleague's State of Texas called the  third prong of this three-bucket strategy ``the sucker's bucket.'' The  sucker's bucket--that is your own Member calling you a sucker if you  vote for this.   We heard testimony all day yesterday and well into the night about  how disastrous this bill would be for hardworking Americans. We heard  about how countless major health organizations oppose this plan, from  the American Medical Association to the American Hospital Association,  to the National Rural Health Association, to the AARP, to the American  Society of Addiction Medicine, to the National Alliance on Mental  Illness, and I could go on and on and on and on.   This reverse Robin Hood will steal from the working class and give to  the wealthy. Under the Republican plan, $2.8 billion in tax breaks will  go to the 400 richest families in America each year. My colleagues on  the other side of the aisle seem to be rushing this through in hopes  that no one will figure out that it is a tax break for the rich  masquerading as a healthcare bill.   Now we find ourselves on the floor debating a martial law rule that  will take that reckless process from light speed to warp speed. Let me  just remind my colleagues again that we are talking about people's  lives here. I am pretty sure the middle class Americans, whom  Republicans claim to be helping would be okay with delaying this  reckless bill for a little while to give us a chance to find out what  the impacts will be.   Mr. Speaker, this process is beyond the pale. I am honestly still  stunned that we are even here debating a martial law rule on  legislation of this magnitude when changes to people's basic, essential  health benefits are being contemplated without so much as a single  hearing, let alone a CBO score. And again, we have no real clue what  Republicans will be bringing to the floor later today.    I am just going off what I read in the news since we haven't gotten  any actual updates from the other side of the aisle, but this rule  would allow them to bring anything to the floor today or tomorrow or  Saturday or Sunday or Monday--literally anything.   Will there be a new bill? Who knows.   Will it even be on health care? Beats me.   What mysterious changes are they contemplating that are so broad they  can't even narrow their martial law authority down to the topic of  health care?   Please, please, I would ask my colleagues to slow down. Be  thoughtful. This is not a game. You don't get extra points for being  fast. This healthcare repeal affects millions upon millions upon  millions of Americans.   Don't jam a disastrous bill through the House with patched-up fixes.  Wait for a revised CBO score. Listen to what members of your own  Conference are saying. Or better yet, don't do this at all. Let's go  back to the drawing board.   It is clear Republicans never really had a plan to replace the  Affordable Care Act. Don't pretend you did and then make our most  vulnerable pay the consequences.   This is a sad day. This is a sad day for this institution, but it is  even a sadder day for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Illinois, but let me  just say to him that the Republican plan is not a rescue mission. It is  a full-fledged attack on the middle class--a rescue plan for the rich,  maybe, slamming the middle class with a tax hike.   Ripping away coverage and undermining Medicare is not a rescue  mission, I assure you. I have seen the townhalls around the country.  They want nothing to do with your rescue plan.   Rescuing something you sabotaged, offering Americans a plan that  costs more and covers less, going after essential services--please,  that is not what the American people want.   To my colleague from Texas, the distinguished chairman of the Rules  Committee, he is assuring us that Republicans are huddled somewhere.  Well, I have got news for him. I have been reading press reports that  Republicans have canceled their 9 a.m. Conference meeting. As I  understand it, one Republican Member told the reporter that that move  ``tells me it's panic time.''                                time  0945    Another Republican source is quoted as saying: This is such a  disaster. Representative Massie said: Frankly, it is not very well  thought out.   So I don't think people are huddling. I think people are dispersed,  and so it makes me even more wary about what we are going to see later  today.   By the way, all we are asking is that we actually see the bill. We  had a Rules Committee hearing yesterday on a bill that, quite frankly,  will not be the bill we are going to consider later today or tomorrow  or Saturday or Sunday or Monday.   We are talking about health care that affects millions and millions  of people, and nobody in this Chamber has seen what we are going to  vote on. This is ludicrous. How can this be? What are you thinking? Do  this right. There is no rush. You don't get extra points for being  fast.   When we read about some of the compromises that are being talked  about--going after essential services that basically help the most  vulnerable in this country, services like mental health treatment,  treatments for opiate addiction, maternity care--essential benefits are  being compromised or being taken away. So what will end up happening is  you will get up and say: Yeah, we will sell you insurance. It will be  cheap, but you get no coverage. Nothing is covered.   That is not what the American people want.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) says the Republican bill is  simple and easy to understand. My question is: Where the hell is it?  Maybe it is under the table. We haven't seen it.   Every time we get the bill, it changes. So maybe they ought to start  with giving us the bill so people know what the bill would do.   Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to my colleagues, this is a new  analysis from the Tax Policy Center and the Urban Institute's Healthy  Policy Center that shows just how dramatically these tax cuts benefit  the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and working class  families. This bill really is a giveaway to the rich. This chart  clearly illustrates that disparity.   The rich would benefit greatly from the tax cuts in the bill, with a  family making more than $200,000 receiving a $5,680 tax cut, and a  family making more than a million dollars a year getting a $51,410  break on their taxes. That is too high to even fit on the chart.  Meanwhile, families making less than $50,000 will be paying the price.   This bill really is a massive giveaway to the well-off and to the  wealthy. This  [[Page H2357]]  is going to hurt the middle class. This is not what the American people  want.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that I feel bad for the  gentleman from Texas for having to defend this lousy rule and this  lousy bill all by himself. We have so many speakers here, we don't have  enough time to accommodate them all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article from today's New  York Times titled, ``Late GOP Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover  Aromatherapy But Not Chemotherapy.''                  [From the New York Times, Mar. 23, 2017]   Late G.O.P. Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy But Not                                Chemotherapy                          (By Margot Sanger-Katz)         Most Republicans in Congress prefer the type of health       insurance market in which everyone could ``choose the plan       that's right for them.''        Why should a 60-year-old man have to buy a plan that       includes maternity benefits he'll never use? (This is an       example that comes up a lot.) In contrast, the Affordable       Care Act includes a list of benefits that have to be in every       plan, a reality that makes insurance comprehensive, but often       costly.        Now, a group of conservative House members is trying to cut       a deal to get those benefit requirements eliminated as part       of the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act       moving through Congress. (The vote in the House is expected       later today.)        At first glance, this may sound like a wonderful policy.       Why should that 60-year-old man have to pay for maternity       benefits he will never use? If 60-year-old men don't need to       pay for benefits they won't use, the price of insurance will       come down, and more people will be able to afford that       coverage, the thinking goes. And people who want fancy       coverage with extra benefits can just pay a little more for       the plan that's right for them.        But there are two main problems with stripping away minimum       benefit rules. One is that the meaning of ``health       insurance'' can start to become a little murky. The second is       that, in a world in which no one has to offer maternity       coverage, no insurance company wants to be the only one that       offers it.        Here is the list of Essential Health Benefits that are       required under the Affordable Care Act:        Ambulatory patient services (doctor's visits)        Emergency services        Hospitalization        Maternity and newborn care        Mental health and substance abuse disorder services,       including behavioral health treatment        Prescription drugs        Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices        Laboratory services        Preventive and wellness services, and chronic disease       management        Pediatric services, including oral and vision care        The list reflects some lobbying of the members of Congress       who wrote it. You may notice that dental services are       required for children, but not adults, for example. But over       all, the list was developed to make insurance for people who       buy their own coverage look, roughly, like the kind of       coverage people get through their employer. A plan without       prescription drug coverage would probably be cheaper than one       that covers it, but most people wouldn't think of that plan       as very good insurance for people who have health care needs.        Under the Republican plan, the government would give people       who buy their own insurance money to help them pay for it. A       20-year-old who doesn't get coverage from work or the       government, for example, would get $2,000. If the essential       health benefits go away, insurance companies would be allowed       to sell health plans that don't cover, say, hospital care.       Federal money would help buy these plans.        But history illustrates a potential problem.        In the 1990s, Congress created a tax credit that helped       low-income people buy insurance for their children. Quickly,       it became clear that unscrupulous entrepreneurs were creating       cheap products that weren't very useful, and marketing them       to people eligible for the credit. Congress quickly repealed       the provision after investigations from the Government       Accountability Office and the Ways and Means Committee       uncovered fraud.        Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the       Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who tends       to favor market solutions in health care, said that while the       Obamacare rules are ``paternalistic,'' it would be       problematic to offer subsidies without standards. ``If       they're going to offer a tax credit for people who are buying       insurance, well, what is insurance?'' he said, noting that       you might end up with the government paying for plans that       covered aromatherapy but not hospital care. ``You have to       specify what's included.''        A proliferation of $1,995 plans that covered mostly       aromatherapy could end up costing the federal government a       lot more money than the current G.O.P. plan, since far more       people would take advantage of tax credits to buy cheap       products, even if they weren't very valuable.        There's another reason, besides avoiding fraud, that health       economists say benefit rules are important. Obamacare       requires insurers to offer health insurance to people who       have preexisting illnesses at the same price as they sell       them to healthy people, and the Republican bill would keep       this rule. But if an insurance company designs a plan that       attracts a lot of sick people, it will be very expensive to       cover them, and the insurance company will either lose money       or end up charging extremely high prices that would drive       away any healthy customers.        Sherry Glied, the dean of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate       School of Public Service at New York University, who helped       work on the essential health benefits in the Obama       administration, raised the example of mental health benefits.       Parents of adolescents with schizophrenia will be sure to buy       insurance that covers only mental health services. Other       parents won't care about that benefit.        The result: Any company offering such benefits will end up       with a lot of customers requiring expensive hospitalizations,       while its competitors that drop them will get healthier       customers who are cheaper to insure. If mental health       services are optional, no insurance company will want to       offer them, lest all the families with sick children buy       their product and put them out of business.        And then healthy people who develop mental illness, or drug       addiction, will also learn that their illness isn't covered.       The result could be a sort of market failure: ``If you don't       require that these benefits are required, they often just get       knocked out of the market altogether,'' she said.        Before Obamacare passed, there were few federal standards       for health insurance bought by individuals, and it was not       uncommon to find plans that didn't include prescription drug       coverage, mental health services or maternity care. But plans       tended to cover most of the other benefits. That was in a       world where health insurers could discriminate against sick       people. In that era, insurers in most states could simply       tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't buy       insurance. That made it less risky for insurers to offer       mental health benefits to everyone else.        David Cutler, a professor at Harvard who helped advise the       Obama administration on the Affordable Care Act, said he       thinks the kind of insurance products that would be offered       under the proposed mix of policies could become much more       bare-bones than plans before Obamacare. He envisioned an       environment in which a typical plan might cover only       emergency care and basic preventive services, with everything       else as an add-on product, costing almost exactly as much as       it would cost to pay for a service out-of-pocket.        ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid-arthritis-      you-should-pay-$30,000 provision,'' he said. Such a system       would mean that Americans with costly problems--cancer,       opioid addiction, H.I.V.--would end up paying a substantially       higher share of their medical bills, while healthy people       would pay lower prices for insurance that wouldn't cover as       many treatments.        There is most likely a middle way. Republican lawmakers       might be comfortable with a system that shifts more of the       costs of care onto people who are sick, if it makes the       average insurance plan less costly for the healthy. But       making those choices would mean engaging in very real trade-      offs, less simple than their talking point.     Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted if we had actual text  to look at right now, but, instead,  [[Page H2360]]  we are forced to rely on news reports, and what I am reading in the  news is not good.   The article that I just included in the Record also quotes a Harvard  professor who says: ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid- arthritis-you-should-pay-$30,000 provision.''   The article says that we could go back to a world where insurers  could simply tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't  buy insurance. It is ironic that the Republicans want to take away a  woman's choice about a pregnancy, and then it looks like they are going  to take away any insurance she needs for prenatal care or maternity  care.   What are we doing here, Mr. Speaker? What will we be asked to vote on  later today? If these sorts of dangerous ideas are being considered,  we, the American people, deserve to know. Twenty-four million people  are going to lose their insurance under the proposal the Republicans  are considering. People will pay more and get less. There will be huge  tax cuts for the rich. Again, we don't even have the final text. This  is awful. This is unacceptable.   I will remind my colleagues that this is about the American people.  Put the people of this country ahead of your party, ahead of your  ideology, and ahead of this President who just discovered that health  care is complicated.   This is a life-or-death issue for many in this country. Health care  is very personal. Don't take it away from people. Let's work in a  bipartisan way to make the improvements in the Affordable Care Act that  we all know need to be made, but don't just tear apart a healthcare  system that is providing an additional 20 million Americans health  insurance.   Please don't do this. Slow down. Provide us the text of the bill.  Let's have hearings. Let's bring the American people into the Congress  and listen to what they have to say. Listen to what your own  constituents have been saying to you in townhalls. They don't want what  you are selling here today. They don't want your rescue plan. They want  health care for themselves and their families, and that is what they  deserve.   So, please, vote down this martial law rule and go back to the  drawing board.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
