 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  772, to designate the post office in Wayzata, Minnesota, on the shores  of Lake Minnetonka as the Jim Ramstad Post Office.   Congressman Ramstad spent 10 years representing the 45th District in  the Minnesota Legislature and 18 years representing Minnesota's Third  District in this Chamber. As the current Representative for Minnesota's  Third, I am humbled to have followed in the footsteps of such a  gentleman, public servant, and statesman.   Throughout his life in public service and throughout his entire life,  Jim led with principle, with compassion, and with grace. His battle  with and recovery from alcoholism gave voice to millions of Americans  facing the very same challenge and illuminated every aspect of his life  and his service.   From the statehouse to this House, Jim embodied the spirit of  honesty, resilience, transparency, and accountability. He was a noted  consensus seeker and a champion of bipartisan policies to reduce  discrimination against those suffering from mental health challenges  and addiction. His signature legislation, the Paul Wellstone Mental  Health Treatment Act, was enacted in 2008 just before his retirement  from Congress.                                time  1630    Congressman Ramstad will go on to continue his service as a fellow at  Harvard University, and as adviser to Minnesota's Hazelden treatment  center. He lived the final 39 years of his life in sobriety.   Congressman Ramstad passed away on November 5, 2020, after a battle  with Parkinson's disease.   Naming a post office in Wayzata is a small gesture to commemorate the  passing of a giant of Minnesota politics. But as former Minnesota State  Senator and Jim's former district director, Paul Anderson, told me:  ``Jim loved Wayzata, and Wayzata always loved Jim back.''   So I send my love to Jim's wife, Kathryn, and to all of his family  and friends and colleagues who continue to mourn his loss.   May his memory be for a blessing. May his spirit and legacy of  bipartisanship--and I note that Jim was a Republican and I am a  Democrat--inspire this Congress. May his name grace the post office in  the town he loved and the town that loved him back for generations to  come.
