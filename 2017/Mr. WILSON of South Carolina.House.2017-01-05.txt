 Mr. Speaker, in an Associated Press  article titled, ``As Obama accomplished goals, the Democratic party  floundered,'' the disastrous statistics of the Obama legacy were  revealed.  [[Page H109]]    The Associated Press analyzed:         There's one number you will almost never hear: more than       1,030 seats. That's the number of spots in State       legislatures, Governor's mansions, and Congress lost by       Democrats during Obama's Presidency. It is a statistic that       reveals an unexpected twist of the Obama years.    The Associated Press went on to say:         The defeats have all but wiped out a generation of young       Democrats, leaving the party with limited power in       statehouses and a thin bench to challenge an ascendant GOP       majority eager to undo many of the President's policies . . .       but, say experts, Obama's tenure has marked the greatest       number of losses under any President in decades.    When it comes time to the battle of programs, American families  overwhelmingly choose limited government and expanded freedom over the  alternative: Big Government and lesser freedom. This is clear with the  failing of ObamaCare destroying jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his  actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on  terrorism.   Congratulations to our colleague Congressman Ted Poe on his remission  under treatment of cancer. God bless Ted Poe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ed Royce  for yielding. I appreciate your leadership for peace.   I am in strong support of the House resolution, which is taking a  firm stand and clear stand objecting to the United Nations Security  Council resolution as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace.   The United States has stood with Israel against one-sided, biased  resolutions at the United Nations and in other international forums.  Additionally, the United States has been adamant that a peaceful  resolution will only come from direct, bilateral negotiations, not  addressed by an international forum. The distorted ideology of moral  neutrality is suicidal for civilization, encouraging what the chairman  correctly identified as ``pay for slay,'' as evidenced by the murder of  American tourist Taylor Force just last year.   On December 23, my constituents were shocked as the Obama  administration betrayed the people of Israel, undermining the peace  process by failing to veto the U.N. Security Council resolution.  President Obama and Secretary Kerry's actions revealed dangerous  irresponsibility, putting Israeli and American families at risk of more  terrorist attacks. Fortunately, Governor Nikki Haley, President-elect  Donald Trump's appointee, will soon be making a positive difference as  U.N. Ambassador of the United States, promoting peace through strength.   Today, I am grateful to stand strong with Israel by being an original  cosponsor of H. Res. 11. I appreciate the leadership of Majority Leader  Kevin McCarthy, Chairman Ed Royce, and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for  sponsoring this resolution. I urge my colleagues to support it.
