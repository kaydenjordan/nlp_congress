 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Infrastructure  Week, a week to highlight the importance and necessity of rebuilding  our country's crumbling infrastructure, thus investing in our own  future.   The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. infrastructure a  ``D plus'' with over 56,000 bridges considered structurally deficient,  major airports unable to keep up with the demand and outdated water  pipelines experiencing an estimated 240,000 water main breaks annually.   In fact, my own district in Central Florida, one of the fastest  growing in America, is crisscrossed by Interstate 4, which has been  deemed one of the most dangerous highways in the entire Nation.   The need to invest in highway improvements, auxiliary roads, public  [[Page H3827]]  transportation, and airports is palpable.   As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  upgrading infrastructure with 21st century technology would benefit all  Americans, and can be done in a bipartisan manner.   If we seek to sustain the economic growth witnessed these last 2  years or simply keep our citizenry safe, further expansion of  infrastructure hubs is necessary, and we should no longer delay in  investing in our future. It is time to build and time for Congress to  get to work.                            ____________________
