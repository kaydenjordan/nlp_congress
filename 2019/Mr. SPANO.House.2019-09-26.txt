 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to one of the  most important issues facing our Nation and world.   This weekend is World Heart Day, a time for individuals around the  globe to annually be informed about the issues surrounding  cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease and stroke, and to  highlight the actions that individuals can take to prevent and control  the disease.   You see, cardiovascular disease is the world's leading cause of  death. Each year it claims the lives of almost 18 million people, while  devastating many more families.   You see, I have cardiovascular disease; and as someone with a heart  condition, I humbly stand before the House and I say that we can do  better.   World Heart Day is about families, communities, and governments  around the globe coming together, regardless of affiliation, to combat  a shared enemy that affects the lives of far too many.   With controlling our diets, sticking to an exercise regimen, and  avoiding the use of tobacco products, 80 percent of premature deaths  from cardiovascular disease can be avoided.   Please join me in taking control of your health before it is too  late.                            ____________________
