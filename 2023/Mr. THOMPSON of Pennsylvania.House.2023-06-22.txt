 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the smallest city in the United States of America: the city  of Parker in Armstrong County. Nestled in the beautiful Allegheny River  Valley, Parker City is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year.   What started as a village with nearly 1,000 people grew almost  overnight to become a booming oil metropolis with a population of more  than 20,000 in the late 1800s.   For the next 10 years, Parker became a place of great activity with  more than 1,000 oil wells, saloons, stores, hotels, and machine shops.   While the oil boom was short-lived, the spirit of Parker was strong.  By the 1890s, the population of Parker was back to nearly 1,000.   Madam Speaker, today Parker is a great retreat for those wanting to  enjoy the quiet river setting as a peaceful escape from urban life. The  population stands at about 900 people, making it the smallest city in  the USA.   Parker is celebrating 150 years as a city on July 15. They will have  fireworks, parades, local vendors, and a river float.   Madam Speaker, if you ever find yourself in the foothills of the  Allegheny Mountains along the banks of the Allegheny River, I encourage  you to visit Parker.                            ____________________
