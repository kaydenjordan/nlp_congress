 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting America's  Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act, legislation offered by my  good friend, the gentlewoman from Washington State and the chair of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   Over the first 2 years of the Biden administration we have seen an  unprecedented level of hostility toward America's energy producers. The  administration has made every effort to undermine, avoid, and restrict  oil and gas production in North America, while at the same time moving  to drain our strategic reserves in an attempt to offset the price  increases caused by the President's own policies.   Playing politics with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has resulted in  the lowest level it has been in decades.   If this wasn't alarming enough, just wait until you hear who has  benefited from our reserves being drained: the Chinese Communist Party.  As part of this administration's Strategic Petroleum Reserve sales, a  little under 1 million barrels were bought by UNIPEC, the Chinese  Petrochemical Corporation.   The shortsightedness shows the Biden administration is willing to put  our national security at risk by selling vital reserves to our  adversaries to manipulate market prices in hopes of getting political  advantage. This is not right, and every single Member of this body  should be opposed to such actions.   While we investigate these actions, we must ensure they never happen  again. That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor to the  Protecting America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   This bill would prevent the Secretary of Energy from selling any  products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to any entity owned or  under the control or influence of the Chinese Communist Party, or to  any other entity that intends to export products to China.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
