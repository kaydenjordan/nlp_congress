 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Bipartisan  Budget Agreement. This deal will protect American families and our  economy from a devastating default on our Nation's bills in just 5  days. It will also shield our veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and  schools from the worst of the extreme demands my Republican colleagues  issued while holding our economy hostage.   This deal is far from perfect, but we can't allow perfect to be the  enemy of the good when the stakes are this high. A default would mean  an immediate recession, millions of jobs lost, devastated retirement  accounts, and higher borrowing costs for Americans.   Compromise means that no one gets everything they want, so we have a  choice between a catastrophic outcome or a chance to move forward with  a bipartisan compromise. The worst outcome here would be a default.   Mr. Speaker, let's get this done and over to the Senate so we can  take default off the table.
