 Mr. Speaker, some of the greatest contributions to  medicine have been made by African Americans in this country.   The first open-heart surgery in the United States was successfully  completed by Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, a Black man. Not only was he a  pioneer of this lifesaving surgery, but also, in the late 1800s, he  opened the country's first hospital with an interracial staff,  Provident Hospital in Chicago.   Then, in the 1930s, Dr. Helen Dickens did her internship at Provident  Hospital before becoming the first Black woman admitted to the American  College of Surgeons.   And then, while Dr. Dickens was doing her internship at Provident, a  young Black girl growing up in segregated Arkansas dreamed of becoming  a doctor. Sixty years later, in 1993, Dr. Joycelyn Elders became  America's first African American Surgeon General.   Mr. Speaker, Black history is not something that is in the past. It  is constantly unfolding. It is American history.   Our stories are being written and expanded upon all the time. That is  why Black History Month is so important--not just to honor our past,  but to celebrate our present and prepare for our future.                            ____________________
