 Madam President, when a popular sheriff's deputy  from Daviess County, KY began what seemed to be a routine call in 1989,  he had no reason to anticipate that his life would soon be hanging by a  thread. He served a restraining order without incident and returned to  his vehicle. But then, in the blink of an eye, he was shot multiple  times, beaten severely, and was nearly run over by the assailant as he  fled the scene.   Deputy David ``Oz'' Osborne was left to die on a driveway along a  country road, but Clarence and Mary Hulsey had made an unplanned--and  for them, unusual--decision to go to town to get ice cream on that May  evening. First spotting Osborne's hat, they quickly found him, summoned  help, and remained with him until first responders could take over.   This assault nearly ended Osborne's life 30 years ago, but although  he was badly wounded and temporarily paralyzed, he recovered  completely, returned to duty, raised his family, and was later elected  Daviess County clerk.   More impressive than this narrative is the fact that the convicted  assailant later contacted Osborne from prison, seeking his forgiveness,  and Osborne agreed. Citing his Christian faith as his motivation, he  said that forgiveness ``did not happen overnight, but it did happen.''   It is clear why the citizens of Daviess County have so much respect  for Oz Osborne to this very day. His story reminds us of the risks that  our law enforcement officers and first responders face in the line of  duty, but it teaches all of us an indelible and rare lesson about  forgiveness and mercy.                            ____________________
