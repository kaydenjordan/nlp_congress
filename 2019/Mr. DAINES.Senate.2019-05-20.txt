 Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Civil Air Patrol Cadet Colonel Shelby Petersen of  Kalispell. Cadet Colonel Petersen is the first Montanan since 2004 to  receive the General Carl A. Spaatz Award, which is the Civil Air  Patrol's highest cadet honor.   The Spaatz Award is given to cadets who have demonstrated excellence  in leadership, character, fitness, and aerospace education. The  selection process is extremely rigorous, and only 5 out of every 1,000  cadets earns the award. Cadet Colonel Petersen joined the Civil Air  Patrol at the age of 12, following in the footsteps of her older  brother. From day 1, her goal was to become squadron commander and win  the Spaatz Award. She has thrived as a member of the Flathead Composite  Squadron, receiving 18 promotions and achieving her goal of becoming  the squadron commander. I had the pleasure of meeting Cadet Colonel  Petersen in March 2018, when she was selected to participate in the  prestigious Civil Air Patrol Leadership Academy. There, cadets spend a  week in Washington, DC, and gain greater insight into the inner  workings of government through meetings with Members of Congress, the  State Department, and the intelligence community. She is an outstanding  young Montanan who understands what it means to put service before  self.   As squadron commander, she has taken a keen interest in mentoring  younger cadets and pushes them to set and meet high expectations for  themselves. In fact, her final assignment as a Civil Air Patrol cadet  is cadet commander for this summer's Civil Air Patrol boot camp.   Cadet Colonel Petersen is currently finishing her senior year at  Glacier High School in Kalispell and upon graduation will enlist in the  Marine Corps to continue her service to our country. I congratulate  Cadet Colonel Petersen on winning the Spaatz Award, and I thank her for  her service. I know that she will continue to make her community and  Montana proud.                            ____________________
