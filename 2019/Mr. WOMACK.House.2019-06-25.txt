 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend, French Hill from  Little Rock, for leading on this very important issue, and I rise in  strong support of his amendment.   I am a proud cosponsor of this important amendment that restores  funding for the Regional Innovation Cluster program within the Small  Business Administration. The Regional Innovation Cluster program  provides region- and industry-specific technical assistance to startup  businesses. This program focuses on helping startups scale up to meet  the growing needs of their customers.   While there are success stories from across the country, one is near  and dear to my heart. The Ozarks Regional Innovation Cluster is based  in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in my district. Last year alone, the Ozarks  Regional Innovation Cluster serviced 572 small business owners. It  created 517 net jobs, raised $81.5 million in capital and received  eight new patents for their work.   Nationwide, businesses participating in the Regional Innovation  Cluster program have seen tremendous growth both in jobs created and in  revenue.   As we know, startups and small businesses account for about two- thirds of all new jobs and the growth that comes with these new jobs.  Let's support  [[Page H5135]]  them today by restoring funding for this important program.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment of my friend from  Arkansas.
