 Mr. President, I request to have printed in the  Congressional Record my full remarks delivered on January 20, 2021, at  the 59th inaugural ceremonies.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Mr. President, Well, I should have known when Senator       Klobuchar got involved, at least there would be a touch of       snow up here this morning. Of all the things we considered, I       don't think snow was on my agenda until I walked out the door       a moment ago.        But thank you, Senator Klobuchar, and thanks to the other       members of the Joint Congressional Committee on the       Inauguration as we officially begin the 59th Inaugural       Ceremony. I also want to thank the Joint Committee staff and       our partners, particularly our security partners, for the way       they have dealt with unprecedented circumstances.        When I chaired the Inauguration four years ago, I shared       President Reagan's 1981 description of this event as       commonplace and miraculous. Commonplace because we've done it       every four years since 1789. Miraculous because we've done it       every four years since 1789.        Americans have celebrated this moment during war, during       depression, and now, during pandemic. Once again, all three       branches of our government come together as the Constitution       envisions. Once again, we renew our commitment to ``Our       Determined Democracy, Forging a More Perfect Union.''        That theme for this Inauguration, ``Our Determined       Democracy, Forging a More Perfect Union,'' was announced by       the Joint Committee before the election--with the belief that       the United States can only fulfill its promise and set an       example for others if we are always working to be better than       we have been.        The Constitution established that determined democracy with       its first three words, declaring the people as the source of       the government. The Articles of Confederation hadn't done       that. The Magna Carta hadn't done that. Only the Constitution       says the government exists because the people are the source       of the reason it exists. They immediately followed those       first three words with the words ``to form a more perfect       Union.'' The founders did not say ``to form a perfect       Union.'' They did not claim that in our new country nothing       would need to be improved. Fortunately, they understood that       always working to be better would be the hallmark of a great       democracy.        The freedoms we have today, the nation we have today, is       not here just because it happened, and they aren't complete.        A great democracy, working through the successes and       failures of our history, striving to be better than it had       been. And we are more than we have been and we are less than       we hope to be.        The assault on our Capitol at this very place just two       weeks ago reminds us that a government designed to balance       and check itself is both fragile and resilient.        During the last year, the pandemic challenged our free and       open society and called for extraordinary determination and       sacrifice--and still challenges us today. Meeting that       challenge head on have been and are health care workers,       scientists, first responders, essential frontline workers,       and so many others we depend on in so many ways.        Today, we come to this moment. People all over the world,       as we're here, are watching and will watch what we do here.        Our government comes together. The Congress and the Courts       join the transition of executive responsibility.        One political party more pleased today, and on every       inaugural day, than the other.        But this is not a moment of division. It's a moment of       unification. A new administration begins and brings with it a       new beginning. And with that our great national debate goes       forward and a determined democracy will continue to be       essential in pursuit of a more perfect Union and a better       future for all Americans. What a privilege for me to join you       today.        Thank you.                            ____________________
