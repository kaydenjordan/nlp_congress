 Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for his leadership on tonight's topic. I also associate  myself with his comments, as well as the comments of Delegate Eleanor  Holmes Norton. Congresswoman Norton has been a steward on the issue of  judicial appointments in the United States Congress for many decades,  and it is an honor to follow her tonight in her leadership against the  Trump administration's attempt to stack the courts with extreme  rightwing political allies.   Just as President Trump has attacked our Nation's free press, just as  he has attacked our intelligence agency, this President is now  targeting our Nation's third branch of government, our treasured court  system. We cannot let President Trump destroy yet another institution  of American democracy.   The importance of a fair and nonpartisan court system cannot be  overestimated. It is our Supreme Court, overall, that decided Brown v.  Board of Education, the case that ended segregation in America's  schools. It was our courts which struck down voter suppression laws,  like poll taxes that freed and allowed lots and lots of African  Americans in my home State of Alabama to vote. It was the Supreme Court  that protected the work of the free press and our Nation's newspapers  when President Nixon attempted to silence them. And it was our Supreme  Court which struck down discriminatory State laws prohibiting  interracial and gay marriage.   Those court decisions were the product of judges and justices in our  judicial system, who put our Constitution and the law first,  irrespective of the pressure they faced from politicians and from  Presidents.   Mr. Speaker, the opposite can be true as well. When our courts are  stacked with political allies, who put politics first and justice last,  our Nation suffers. We need think of no other than the infamous Supreme  Court decision which paved the way for Japanese American internment  camps as an example. It is a reminder of all that can go wrong when our  courts are stacked with political allies.   Today, our court system continues to decide questions that will have  consequences for generations to come. When it comes to gerrymandering  and discriminatory voter ID laws, our courts are still considering  cases that will impact our right to vote.   As this administration continues its assault on our free press, we  should have no doubt that the courts will be  [[Page H6643]]  faced with First Amendment questions in the years to come.   That is why President Trump's attempt to stack the court is so  concerning. Last year, this administration appointed nine appellate  judges, more than any President since President Nixon during their  first term in office. And where do those open appellate seats come  from? These are judgeships which Republicans systematically held open  during President Barack Obama's final 2 years. I can speak with  authority on that fact because, in the State of Alabama, we had not  one, not two, but three open Federal judgeships that were held open for  2-plus years, and one 11th Circuit appellate judgeship that was held  open for 2 years.   Yes, the people of Alabama were not well served by the fact that my  Republican colleagues withheld appointing any person to that, in hopes  that they would win the Presidential election in 2016. Now it was a  good bet for them, but it was a bad bet for the American people and for  the people of Alabama. For you see, the judges that were sitting, took  on an inordinate amount of caseload that was unacceptable.   I know that for one, in the Middle District of Alabama, there was a  senior judge by the name of Myron Thompson, who had 120 percent  caseload. Yes, that is right. As a senior judge, he not only had a  caseload that surpassed his caseload when he was an active judge, but,  as a senior judge, took on an extraordinary number of cases. Why?  Because in the Middle District of Alabama, there was only one judge  sitting, as well as one senior judge, Judge Thompson.   This is unacceptable. This is an unacceptable play towards politics  that, in the end, disserved the people of Alabama and disserved the  American public.   The same was true on the Supreme Court level. Yes, Judge Merrick  Garland was supremely qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, and was  President Obama's choice to sit on the Supreme Court. But a year prior  to the 2016 election, the GOP decided that it was not the time for a  judge to be appointed when a Federal election was going to take place  within a year.   Now, one can say the same thing about the fact that we have a midterm  election that is coming up in 2018. But, oh, no, we don't get the same  courtesy. This is politics before people, it is unacceptable, and we  should not take it sitting down. That is why I am very happy that the  Congressional Black Caucus tonight, under the leadership of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania, is talking about stacking of the Supreme  Court and its importance to all Americans.   I can speak firsthand how important the court system was to the civil  rights and voting rights movement of America. As a daughter of Selma,  Alabama, and as the first Black congresswoman from the State of  Alabama, I can tell you, unequivocally, that it was because of  th protections of the equal protection amendment, it was because of the  Constitution and those brave judges, judges like Frank Johnson of the  Middle District of Alabama, who stood against pressure to do what was  right for all Americans, interpreting the Constitution as it was meant  to be: that all men and women are created equal, and that the equal  protection of the law extends to all Americans, irrespective of race  and gender.    So I think it is really important that we remember from whence we all  come. This is a proud tradition that is important that we uphold.   What is even more concerning is the temperament displayed by the  court picks under this administration and their lack of qualification  for the job. Last year, President Trump nominated four judicial  nominees who didn't pass the American Bar Association's standard for  being rated qualified by the ABA. Now, that is a simple standard.   The ABA standard of requiring that one be qualified is simple: a  nominee must show integrity, professional competence, and judicial  temperament. During his 8 years in office, President Obama never--I  repeat--never selected a judicial nominee who received an unqualified  rating from the ABA. Yet, this President nominated four unqualified  judicial candidates in a single year, which is the worst record in  American history.   One was to a Federal bench in Alabama. The nominee was Brett Talley,  who withdrew his name in 2017 for his lack of judicial experience. He  had never tried a case, and yet this person was nominated by this  administration to a life appointment on the bench in the Middle  District of Alabama. Unacceptable. Thank God, calmer and cooler heads  prevailed and he withdrew his name. But the reality is, having  unqualified candidates should not go under this administration. We  should stand up and speak out against it.   That is why I am glad to join with my colleagues from the  Congressional Black Caucus as we talk about what is at stake. A heck of  a lot is at stake. We have a lot to lose under this administration, and  it starts with the Federal courts.   The reason President Trump has elected so many unqualified judges to  fill our courts is that they are political allies of the extreme right.  Every single one of President Trump's judicial nominees are allies of  the rightwing, attacking women's rights, attacking human rights,  attacking healthcare and workers' rights, and, of course, attacking  voting rights.   President Trump's recent nominee of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme  Court is no different. A review of Judge Kavanaugh's record shows that  he will drive the Supreme Court further to the right, threatening and  further attacking healthcare, our right to vote, affirmative action,  and all of the important progress that we have made as a Nation when it  comes to civil rights and civil liberties.   It was Judge Kavanaugh who upheld a discriminatory voter ID law as a  judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals. Faced with a South Carolina voter  ID law, which the Obama administration reported would disenfranchise  tens of thousands of minority voters, Judge Kavanaugh ruled that the  measure was not discriminatory.   The Obama administration said this same voter ID law violated the  Voting Rights Act of 1965, a similar piece of legislation, and Judge  Kavanaugh approved it. That is bad news for voting rights. And where I  come from, representing Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, the  voting rights, and the civil rights district of America, that is bad  news for Americans. We should stand up for the equal rights of all  Americans to vote. There should be no modern-day barriers to voting.  And to have a Supreme Court nominee who has so blatantly gone against  that is unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, on voting rights and so many other issues, from  healthcare to police brutality, the American people cannot trust  Trump's judicial nominees to put the law before politics. We must call  on the Senate to stop President Trump's attempt to stack the courts.  Nothing less than the third branch of government, our democracy, is at  stake.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for allowing me  to speak on this issue, and I ask that all Americans oppose this  nominee to the Supreme Court.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Pennsylvania  is exactly right. The swamp only needs to be cleaned up when the swamp  doesn't agree with this President.   We have seen, in the nomination of Brett Talley to Alabama's Middle  District, that he did not report that his wife worked for the White  House counsel. Now, this, to me, is an important disclosure. You can't  be more on the inside, in the swamp, drowning in the swamp, than to  have a relationship like your wife working for the White House.   I think it is really hypocritical that this White House would talk  about draining the swamp, and yet choose judicial nominees that are  clearly in line with far rightwing views and are clearly a part of the  problem, not a part of the solution.  [[Page H6644]]    I think that we, the American people, need to really speak out when  it comes to the Supreme Court nominee, and, actually, all Federal  judgeships.   I had the great honor of clerking for the first African American  judge in the State of Alabama, Judge U.W. Clemon. It was a great honor  of my life as a young lawyer to sit at his feet and to learn. And I  have to tell you that it is disheartening to me to see people who are  woefully unqualified getting the opportunity to be nominated to a  Federal bench. These are life appointments, life appointments that  allow people to sit in those seats for decades to come and, therefore,  decide decisions decades to come.                                time  2045    I know that when you talk to our Senators, they will, if they are  truthful, tell you that some of the most pressing legacy issues for  them are the nominations to the Supreme Court and the nominations to  the Federal court. Why? Because these nominations, life appointments,  have lasting effects that yield way beyond the actual nomination  itself.   It is unfortunate to me, because when we think about, of the three  branches government that worked for the civil rights movement and  worked for all those freedom fighters, it was the Federal court that,  with its independence, was able to grant so many opportunities to those  freedom riders.   I think about Frank Johnson, a young judge from Montgomery, Alabama,  who grew up in rural Alabama and had the temerity, had the audacity,  had the courage to do what was right in the face of mounting pressures  that came from his White citizenry around him to do the right thing and  to actually issue that injunction that allowed marchers, such as our  colleague,  John Lewis, to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which  brought us the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Where is our courage today? I ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania. We  have to stand up in the face of such overt partisanship and speak out  against it.   The balance of the Court is so important. So much of the progress  that we have seen as a Nation, we have always been one Supreme Court  Justice away from a lot of that progress being eroded. It is with great  sadness that I see Justice Kennedy leave, but it is with greater  sadness that I see the nominee, Kavanaugh, coming before the Senate for  confirmation as the next Federal Justice.   I do know that politics and elections have consequences, but when I  think about the scale of progress and what affects that progress,  nothing is more telling, nothing is more important, than the Supreme  Court.   I hope that aggrieved persons, irrespective of their gender,  irrespective of their race and who they love, that they can come before  the Supreme Court and get a fair hearing.    Well, he has a very expansive record. He sat  on the bench now for over a decade, so there is an expansive record  there. I believe in looking at a person's record to be able to tell  what they will do in the future.   His past has shown that he is squarely aligned with the Federalist  Society, squarely aligned with the far right. It is because of his  extreme views that he is now the nominee.   Now, I would love for him to prove me wrong, but one's history, one's  past, is a judge of what one will do in the future. So my great fear is  about issues such as the right of the executive branch to overreach.  His decisions that relate to that, to me, are why I believe this  President chose him, because there has been some overreaching going on  in the executive branch, and this President feels that this judge will  be more partial toward him.   Now, let's just be very clear. The judge should be about being  partial toward the facts and toward the law, irrespective of who the  petitioner is. I can tell you that often people say that justice is  blind. But the reality is justice often is seen through the eyes of the  experience of the judges. That is why it is important to have a bench  that is diverse, a bench that has diversity of thought, diversity of  philosophy and ideas, because, at the end of the day, we are not  monolithic as a people. We all have different views, and we come to  those perspectives based on our experiences.   Frankly, this particular judge, this particular nominee, Kavanaugh,  does not show that diversity of experience. His views have been clearly  aligned with the far right, and I believe that that is woefully out of  character with the American public.   I believe that the American public is far more centrist than that and  that the American public deserves better than that.
