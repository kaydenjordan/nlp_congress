 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5110) to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965 to clarify that the prohibition on the use of Federal education  funds for certain weapons does not apply to the use of such weapons for  training in archery, hunting, or other shooting sports, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5110         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Hunting Heritage       and Education Act''.       SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL                     EDUCATION FUNDS FOR CERTAIN WEAPONS AND RELATED                     TRAINING.         Section 8526(7) of the Elementary and Secondary Education       Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7906(7)) is amended by inserting ``,       except that this paragraph shall not apply to the use of       funds under  [[Page H4472]]       this Act for activities carried out under programs authorized       by this Act that are otherwise permissible under such       programs and that provide students with educational       instruction or educational enrichment activities, such as       archery, hunting, other shooting sports, or culinary arts''       before the period at the end.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 5110, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of the Protecting Hunting Heritage and  Education Act, H.R. 5110.   Last year, Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  While most Republicans weren't in favor of its provisions, the few that  eventually voted for the bill voted with the assumption that the Biden  administration would not try to misconstrue the language to end the  vital hunter and archery classes in our K-12 schools.   Now, due to the overly antigun Department of Education, the law is  being used to pressure schools rather than enhance their security.  Republican negotiators feel frustrated by the Department's actions.  Democrats feel let down by the Department. Above all, the American  people feel wronged by the Department and scared that at a Federal  level it would take such actions.   This is because the Department has taken the funding ban for the  provision of or training in the use of a dangerous weapon and  misinterpreted it as a funding ban on archery, shooting, and hunter  safety programs--some even speculate culinary programs.   How do I know that this anger is widespread? Look no further than the  commentary from Democrats over the past few weeks. Without explicitly  naming names, Democrats have called the administration overly  ambitious, simply mistaken, and with a blatant disregard for the law.  Too many people on the other side of the aisle are looking for any  pretext to prevent American citizens from using firearms, even if the  purpose is to increase safety.   Archery and hunting safety programs are not dangerous. They instill  core values in schoolchildren--values like responsibility, patience,  and discipline. In fact, our society could use more of these values and  more of these programs.   Moreover, education programs such as hunting and archery foster a  sense of connection and belonging among classmates. They are a win-win  for our schools and communities. In Wisconsin alone, we have 272  schools offering archery programs, 37 of which are located in my  district.   What we have here is yet another example of Federal bureaucrats who  are out of touch with the American people. I know my constituents back  home support these programs, and so do I. Therefore, I urge passage of  H.R. 5110, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the author of this  bill, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Owens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Moran).     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, overturning the funding ban on hunting and archery  programs is a no-brainer. I was glad, as a member of the Committee on  Education, to see that when this bill passed, it came out of committee  unanimously 42-0. That is because the value of these programs is  universally recognized. They are certainly not unsafe. In fact, the  best thing we could do would be to expand them, offer more of them, and  teach more children how to handle recreational tools appropriately.   Furthermore, just like when the effort was made by the Governor of  New Mexico, there is a bipartisan consensus that the people who were  trying to restrict ownership or restrict acquainting themselves with  firearms were shot down on a bipartisan basis.   Because of this administration's actions, however, many schools were  proactively nixing hunting and archery programs to comply with the  Department's wrongheaded and heavy-handed reading of the law. That is  already going too far.   Congress should respond quickly with swift action and pass the  Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
