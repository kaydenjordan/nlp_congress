 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of 32-year-old  Darren Drake from New Milford, New Jersey, whose promising life was cut  short in last month's tragic and senseless act of ISIS-inspired lone- wolf terror in Manhattan.   Darren was one of our best and brightest, and a son of New Jersey  through and through. A hardworking project manager at Moody's and a  lifelong Jets fan, Darren earned more than three degrees from New  Jersey universities. Not only was he driven and accomplished, Darren  was also a committed public servant, serving as president of the New  Milford School Board.   Darren was beloved. It was intensely moving to see so much of the  North Jersey community come together at his wake and funeral last week  and this week.   To his parents, Jimmy and Barbara, and everyone whose life he  touched, I want to express my deepest condolences. Darren's death is  our profound loss. He packed more into his years than most do in a  lifetime. His life enriched our lives beyond measure.   No act of terror will ever be able to diminish the bright and burning  love he had for his home, my State, and our country. I will spend my  days here fighting terrorism at home and abroad in Darren's honor.   May God rest his soul.                            ____________________
