 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 657) to amend title 5, United States Code, to extend certain  protections against prohibited personnel practices, and for other  purposes, as amended.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Follow the Rules Act''.       SEC. 2.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 657, the Follow the  Rules Act, introduced by Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin.   Less than 1 month ago marked the 28th anniversary of the  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. That bill was a landmark  accomplishment establishing enforcement mechanisms to protect those who  help identify waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. It  also protects those who, in good conscience, refuse orders that could  violate the law.   Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  considered the case of Dr. Timothy Rainey. Dr. Rainey, an employee of  the State Department, refused an order to violate the Federal  Acquisition Regulation.   Dr. Rainey's supervisors subsequently took away his responsibilities  as a contracting officer representative. He argued it was because of  his refusal to obey the order. Thus, the Federal Circuit considered  whether Federal managers can retaliate against employees who refuse to  obey an order that would violate a government rule or regulation rather  than a statute.   Unfortunately, the Federal Circuit has a record of misinterpreting  the law on whistleblowers. That is precisely what happened here. The  court held such employees were not protected. Ironically, the court  relied on a significant 2015 Supreme Court decision, DHS v. MacLean,  which reaffirmed the protections of the Whistleblower Protection Act.   The Federal Circuit's decision puts Federal employees in an  impossible situation. It forces them to choose between following their  superior's orders or following the agency's rules or regulations. In  many ways, an agency's rules and regulations are the standing orders of  the head of the agency.   My colleague, Representative Duffy, introduced the Follow the Rules  Act to fix this problem. H.R. 657 makes clear that employees are  protected from retaliation for disobeying orders that would violate an  agency rule or regulation. Refusing to obey such orders is exactly the  type of action for which Federal employees should be protected from  retaliation.   This legislation has bipartisan, bicameral support. It passed the  House by voice vote near the end of the last Congress.                                time  1715    I hope that this legislation will be signed into law this Congress  and Federal employees will be protected in trying to do the right  thing. I thank Representative Duffy for his leadership on this issue.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 657, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1242, the 400 Years of African- American History Commission Act, introduced by Congressman Bobby Scott  of Virginia.   H.R. 1242 establishes a historical commission commemorating the 400th  anniversary of the arrival of Africans in Virginia in 1619. The bill  creates a commission to plan programs and activities in 2019 to  recognize the arrival, influence, and historical importance of Africans  in America.   Congress has previously established similar commissions to celebrate  historical anniversaries. For example, there was a commission on the  400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, Virginia, and the 450th  anniversary of the founding of St. Augustine, Florida.   As we reach the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Africans in  Virginia, establishing this commission allows for the opportunity to  acknowledge the horrible impact slavery has had in America. This is an  opportunity to commemorate the resilience and contributions of African  Americans in our country. While that chapter in our history is a  painful one, this is a story that must be told to acknowledge how  profoundly unrecognizable our Nation would be without the contribution  of African Americans.   The commission will work with State and local groups to coordinate  the commemoration and public education. The commission will be funded  by private donations, not taxpayer dollars, and will terminate shortly  after the anniversary activities conclude. The bill authorizes the  commission to provide grants to further the historical and cultural  activities carried out in commemoration of the anniversary.   The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved this bill  on March 28, 2017.   I thank Congressman Scott for his leadership on this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1242, ``400  Years of African-American History Commission Act'', which establishes  the 400 Years of African-American History Commission to develop and  carry out activities throughout the United States to commemorate the  400th anniversary of the arrival of Africans in the English colonies at  Point Comfort, Virginia, in 1619.   Through this bill, the commission must:   1. Plan programs to acknowledge the impact that slavery and laws that  enforced racial discrimination had on the United States;   2. Encourage civic, patriotic, historical, educational, artistic,  religious, and economic organizations to organize and participate in  anniversary activities;   3. Assist states, localities, and nonprofit organizations to further  the commemoration; and   4. Coordinate for the public scholarly research on the arrival of  Africans in the United States and their contributions to this country.   The commission may provide:   1. Grants to communities and nonprofit organizations for the  development of programs;   2. Grants to research and scholarly organizations to research,  publish, or distribute information relating to the arrival of Africans  in the United States; and   3. Technical assistance to states, localities, and nonprofit  organizations to further the commemoration.   The commission must prepare a strategic plan and submit a final  report to Congress that contains a summary of its activities, an  accounting of its received and expended funds, and its recommendations.   The commission would submit a final report to the Congress and  terminate on July 1, 2020.   H.R. 1242 would authorize the appropriation of the necessary amounts  for those purposes.   The commission would consist of 15 members who would serve without  pay but would be reimbursed for travel expenses.   CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1242 would not increase net direct  spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year  periods beginning in 2028. Enacting H.R. 1242 would not affect  revenues.   H.R. 1242 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as  defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs  on state, local, or tribal governments.   August of 2019 will mark 400 years since the first documented arrival  of Africans who came to English America by way of Point Comfort, Va.   Not only is it appropriate to establish a commission that would  recognize the contributions of African Americans, but it is  historically significant to acknowledge that the ``20 and odd''  Africans (as it was recorded) were the first recorded group of Africans  to be sold as involuntary laborers or indentured servants in the  English colonies.   The commission would be charged with highlighting the resilience and  contributions of African Americans, as well as acknowledging the  painful impact that slavery and other atrocities have had on our  nation.   African Americans have contributed to the economic, academic, social,  cultural and moral well-being of this nation.   Could we claim America as the most innovative nation on earth without  the invention of the modern traffic light, the perfection of the carbon  filament or the use of the mathematics that propelled Apollo astronauts  to the moon?   African-American culture is American culture, and African-American  discoveries are American discoveries. Without the accomplishments of  African Americans, the United States could not boast the ingenuity and  cultural richness that we cherish.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1242, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
