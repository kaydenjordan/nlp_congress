 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Supporting  Seniors with Opioid Use Disorder Act with my colleague from Maryland,  Senator Cardin. I very much appreciate his leadership on this issue.  The United States is experiencing an opioid overdose and addiction  crisis with devastating effects on communities across the country. The  opioid epidemic is claiming the lives of far too many people, with a  record 716 Mainers and nearly 110,000 Americans lost in 2022. While  many perceive the face of opioid addiction as young, the epidemic harms  older adults as well. In Maine, approximately 12 percent of drug  overdose deaths last year were among residents age 60 and older.   Each and every opioid death is preventable, and more can be done to  ensure that the unique needs of older Americans struggling with  addiction are not forgotten. In December 2021, the Department of Health  and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, OIG, identified an  urgent need to increase the number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving  treatment for opioid use disorder. The legislation we are introducing  today would help improve seniors' awareness of, and access to, opioid  use disorder, OUD, treatment covered by the Medicare Program.   The challenges of the pandemic, combined with the increased  prevalence of fentanyl entering our country, have aggravated this  national crisis. Even before COVID-19, however, the number of people  age 55 or older treated in emergency rooms for nonfatal opioid  overdoses was increasing, with a shocking 32 percent jump in ER visits  from 2016 to 2017. In 2018, when I served as chairman of the Senate  Special Committee on Aging, I chaired a hearing on this topic to shed  light on the unique challenges faced by this often-overlooked  population. One expert witness told the Aging Committee, ``Medicare  beneficiaries are the fastest growing population of diagnosed opioid  use disorders.'' Dr. Charles Pattavina, an emergency medicine physician  in Bangor, ME, also explained how increased incidences of acute  illnesses and injuries among older Americans make them more susceptible  to opioid misuse.   In 2021, the Office of the Inspector General investigated the extent  to which Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with opioid use disorder  received medication and behavioral therapy through Medicare. The report  found that more than 1 million Medicare beneficiaries were diagnosed  with OUD in 2020, yet fewer than 16 percent of those patients received  medication to treat their OUD. The report also concluded that older  beneficiaries were three times less likely to receive medication to  treat their OUD than younger beneficiaries. Even fewer beneficiaries  received both medication and behavioral therapy. The conclusion was  clear: Medicare beneficiaries are not receiving the OUD treatment they  need.   A followup OIG report from September 2022 revealed that the situation  has largely failed to improve over time. About 50,400 Part D  beneficiaries experienced an opioid overdose--from prescription  opioids, illicit opioids, or both--during 2021. While the overall  proportion of beneficiaries with opioid use disorder receiving  medication increased slightly from 16 percent in 2020 to 18 percent in  2021, still fewer than one in five Medicare beneficiaries received the  medication they need. This report echoed the call to implement the 2021  OIG recommendations.   The Supporting Seniors with Opioid Use Disorder Act would put into  law the recommendations made by the HHS OIG regarding how to improve  beneficiaries' awareness of Medicare coverage for OUD treatment and how  to identify gaps and opportunities to better meet the needs of this  unique population. Specifically, our legislation would require CMS to  conduct additional outreach to beneficiaries to increase awareness  about Medicare coverage for the treatment of OUD, such as by revising  enrollment materials, making State and national contact information for  healthcare providers publicly available and easily accessible, and  developing or improving continuing education programs about opioid  medications and substance use disorder treatment programs. Our bill  would also improve data sharing within Agencies at HHS with the goal of  obtaining a better understanding of current treatment gaps.   Finally, the bill would require HHS to convene a stakeholder meeting  to share best practices on the use of behavioral therapy among  beneficiaries receiving medication to treat opioid use disorder.  Emerging research points to evidence that patients receiving medication  to treat opioid use disorder may also benefit from behavioral therapy,  so this opportunity for collaboration on strategies to support better  treatment engagement and continuity could be beneficial to both  patients and healthcare professionals.   The drug crisis continues to ravage our country, and it is critical  that people who are suffering from opioid use disorder have access to  the treatment they need to survive and thrive--including our seniors.  Challenges in treatment and recovery will persist, but we can begin by  better supporting older Americans' access to opioid use disorder  services and by strengthening our understanding of potential  disparities in treatment. I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr.          Cornyn, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Tillis,          and Ms. Hirono):    S. 3328. A bill to exempt for an additional 4-year period, from the  application of the means-test presumption of abuse under chapter 7,  qualifying members of reserve components of the Armed Forces and  members of the National Guard who, after September 11, 2001, are called  to active duty or to perform a homeland defense activity for not less  than 90 days; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
