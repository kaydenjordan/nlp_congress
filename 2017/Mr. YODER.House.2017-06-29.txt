 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule of law,  of strengthening the enforcement of our immigration system, and of  improving the security of our Nation's borders. The safety and security  of our constituents should be our absolute top priority for this  Congress.   Sanctuary cities are a direct threat to our safety. That is why I led  an effort to defund sanctuary cities through the appropriations  process, and those sanctuary cities and their threat to our safety is  why we are here today.   What happened to Kate Steinle was a tragedy. No parent should have to  go through the anguish of losing their child, especially when it could  have been avoided.   Unfortunately, the deadly toll of sanctuary cities is not limited to  Kate. Last year, in my own community back in Kansas, Master Deputy  Brandon Collins, a Johnson County sheriff's deputy with nearly 21 years  of service, was struck and killed by a drunk driver while he was  performing a routine traffic stop. Deputy Collins was a devoted and  caring husband, father, son, brother, uncle, and friend whose life was  tragically cut short.   The drunk driver, who fled from the scene of the crash, was an  undocumented or an illegal immigrant who had prior convictions for DUI  in California in 2001, and was also arrested for driving without a  license in 2013. He should have never been behind the wheel of that car  when he killed Deputy Collins.   Despite his prior offenses, the man was able to remain in the  country. He was able to be here to commit this crime because of the  failure to enforce the law, and it ultimately led to Deputy Collins'  death.   No nation of laws should tolerate this.   For these reasons--for Deputy Collins and the many other victims and  their loved ones dealing with an unspeakable loss--for them, I support  this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in its passage.
