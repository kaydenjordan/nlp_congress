 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to introduce my amendment to  reduce the salary of Special Envoy to Iran Robert Malley to $1.   While President Biden has made a series of bad political  appointments, Rob Malley, the special envoy, may be one of the worst.  Before even joining the administration, Rob Malley had a history of  legitimizing organizations like Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist  group. He has blamed Israel for Palestinian terrorist attacks, and has  helped negotiate the disastrous 2015 Iran nuclear deal.   Despite his history, the Biden administration appointed Mr. Malley to  be the Special Envoy to Iran. Not only did Mr. Malley tarnish the great  work of previous envoys like Brian Hook and Elliott Abrams, but Malley  was working to circumvent U.S. law by striking a deal with Iran without  first disclosing the contents of this deal to Congress.   The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, otherwise known as INARA,  requires deals with Iran must be disclosed to Congress, whether in  writing or not. However, Mr. Malley worked for years and, according to  some reports, reached an oral agreement with Iran, yet still nothing  has been disclosed to Congress.   In June, Envoy Malley was placed on unpaid leave due to an  investigation into mishandling of classified information, which case  has been referred to the FBI for criminal investigation and  prosecution. Was Malley handing over State secrets to Iran? We still  don't know, and the administration is refusing again to update  Congress.   Most concerningly, a recent bombshell report revealed that three top  aides to Malley were part of an Iranian Government network. That is  right, the Special Envoy to Iran's self-appointed top aides were  potentially compromised Iranian assets. This is beyond incompetent.  This could be criminal. It could be treasonous, and it is the very  definition of harming U.S. national security.   While Mr. Malley is currently on unpaid leave pending an  investigation, he cannot be allowed to return to his post. For that  reason, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.                                time  1915    Unfortunately, my co-lead on this, Mr. Ogles from Tennessee, is not  able to be here.   Mr. Chair, this amendment is simple. The American people should not  be forced to support a top-level government official who surrounded  himself with foreign assets from a designated sponsor of terrorism.   If you care about U.S. national security, you should support this  amendment. If you oppose a corrupt nuclear deal with Iran and oppose  the despotic Iranian mullahs, you should support this amendment.  [[Page H4829]]    If you oppose state sponsors of terrorism having premier access to  the U.S. Government, then you should support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to defund Rob Malley's salary and  make it clear that this House stands against compromised foreign  assets.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to prohibit  any Federal funds to be used to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel out of  Jerusalem.   In October 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act. This bill  passed this Chamber by a vote of 374-27 and passed the Senate by a vote  of 93-5. That is overwhelming.   Members spanning the political spectrum from Speaker Gingrich to  Senator John Kerry voted for this bill requiring the President to move  the U.S. Embassy to its rightful capital in Jerusalem.   However, Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama waived this provision  every 6 months, often claiming that such a move would jeopardize the  peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians. This did  nothing to support the peace process, as Palestinian terrorism  continued to target Israeli citizens.   Finally, in 2018, President Trump fully implemented this law and  moved our U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the undisputed capital  of the State of Israel.   While some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle expressed  opposition to this move, it would be ludicrous to have our Embassy  outside the capital of one of our greatest allies.   The fact of the matter is that we cannot go back. We cannot allow the  Biden administration to move the Embassy out of Jerusalem again.   This amendment should not be controversial. Again, this was  originally passed in 1995 on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, at this time, when Israel faces some of its  greatest threats such as Iran and Palestinian terrorism, we must stand  resolute with our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel.   Any attempts to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem would  delegitimize Israel's sovereignty and would be counterproductive to  encouraging peace negotiations.   Any theoretical negotiation with the Palestinians must revolve around  the fact that Jerusalem is the undisputed capital of Israel and has  been since ancient times.   Some of my colleagues have argued that this amendment is unnecessary  since President Biden does not intend to move the Embassy. If that is  the case, then my colleagues should have no problem voting for this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to stand with Israel, our  greatest ally in the Middle East, and support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
