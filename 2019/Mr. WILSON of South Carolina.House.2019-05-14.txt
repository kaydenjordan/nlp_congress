 Mr. Speaker, on this day last year, I  was grateful to lead nine House colleagues on a congressional  delegation to Jerusalem for the opening of the U.S. Embassy.   We had the opportunity to meet with Members of the Knesset, the  Israeli Parliament, and to meet the Knesset Foreign Affairs chairman,  Avi Dichter.   It was an honor to be welcomed to the office of Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu. We have a shared priority to stop terrorism and  anti-Semitism in both of our countries and around the world. I am  confident in the leadership of Israel and know they will do all they  can to protect and serve its citizens.   I am thankful for the strong commitment shown to the American-Israeli  alliance by President Donald Trump, with promises made and promises  kept. Ambassador David Friedman enthusiastically coordinated the  Embassy movement, fulfilling a vote of Congress in 1994 to relocate  from Tel Aviv to the capital of Jerusalem.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
