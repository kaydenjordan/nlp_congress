SEC. 205. CONTRACT OR GRANT SPECIFICATIONS.         Section 108 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education       Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5329) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ``subject to       subsections (a) and (b) of section 102,'' before ``contain'';        (2) in subsection (f)(2)(A)(ii) of the model agreement       contained in subsection (c), by inserting ``subject to       subsections (a) and (b) of section 102 of the Indian Self-      Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C.       5321),'' before ``such other provisions''; and        (3) in subsection (b)(7)(C) of the model agreement       contained in subsection (c), in the second sentence of the       matter preceding clause (i), by striking ``one performance       monitoring visit'' and inserting ``two performance monitoring       visits''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 209, the PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act, introduced  by Senator Hoeven of North Dakota, will enhance the Department of the  Interior's self-governance process and provide Indian Tribes with  greater flexibility.   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is one of  the most important legislative acts affecting Indian Country in the  last 40-plus years as a key driver to improving the Tribal communities.  Enacted in 1975, the act was a Nixon-era initiative signed into law by  President Gerald Ford yet strongly supported by Democrats at the time.   Pursuant to the act, Tribes are able to enter into self-governance  contracts, commonly known as 638 contracts, with BIA and IHS, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service, to manage and  administer Federal Indian programs.   In 1994, the ISDEAA was amended by adding title IV, which authorized  Tribes to enter into negotiated compact agreements with the BIA under  which Tribes can assume control of the Department programs and  associated funding and tailor those programs to the needs of their  Tribal communities.   In 2000, the act was again amended to add title V, which authorizes  similar Tribal compacts with the Indian Health Service, the IHS,  through the Department of Health and Human Services.   There are more than 350 self-governance Tribes in the country, and  the vast majority of them manage programs within both DOI and IHS and  have achieved great success. In my home State of New Mexico, there are  six pueblos engaged in self-governance: Sandia, Santa Clara, Taos,  Cochiti, Jemez, and Ohkay Owingeh.   Tribal self-governance programs are successful in their  acknowledgment that Tribes have the right to govern themselves with  minimal Federal oversight and maximum flexibility to meet local Tribal  needs. However, significant differences between the title IV and title  V amendments have forced self-governance Tribes to operate under two  separate sets of legislative and administrative requirements.  [[Page H4557]]    The PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act would largely reconcile these  differences, streamline the self-governance process, improve  efficiencies, and strengthen reservation economies.   Passage of the PROGRESS Act is a top legislative priority for self- governance Tribes and is supported by the National Congress of American  Indians, United South and Eastern Tribes, the Alaska Federation of  Natives, the Midwest Alliance of Sovereign Tribes, the Affiliated  Tribes of Northwest Indians, and many more Indian Tribes. The  administration and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are also on record in  support of this legislation.   This legislation is a product of over a decade of bipartisan  negotiations, which is why S. 209 passed the Republican-controlled  Senate on a voice vote. If bipartisan consensus was so easily found in  the Senate in this Congress, then it should be clear that this is a  commonsense bill that both sides of the aisle can support as well.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to be the sponsor of the House version of  the legislation, H.R. 2031, along with my dear colleagues,  Representatives   Tom Cole of Oklahoma and   Don Young of Alaska and  others. I hope that you will join me in passing S. 209 and sending it  to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As I stated before, this legislation is a result of over a decade of  bipartisan, bicameral negotiations.   Since self-governance was first enacted in 1994, there have been no  assumptions by Tribes of Bureau of Reclamation projects--none. Under  the 1994 law, the conditions, requirements, and limitations mitigating  against any such Tribal assumption of a Bureau of Reclamation project  have resulted in no such assumptions.   S. 209 does not change the 1994 authority in this regard. This is why  the gentlewoman's concerns are completely unfounded and why we defeated  an amendment on this in committee in the first place.   More so, S. 209 already contains a lengthy disclaimer specifically  stating that it does not affect, in any way, the ability of Tribes to  take over programs or projects of Interior agencies other than the BIA.                                time  1215    Unless I'm not privy to yet another department reorganization, the  Bureau of Reclamation is not part of the BIA.   This bipartisan bill is critical to the furtherance of self- governance and improvements in Tribal communities. I strongly urge my  colleagues to do the right thing and support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, versions of this bipartisan bill have lain before this  House and the Senate for nearly 2 decades, passing each body several  times. It is time to finally push this legislation across the finish  line so that Tribes can finally move to effectively-managed programs  for their people.   I urge my colleagues to show their support for Tribal self-governance  and Tribal sovereignty by passing S. 209, the PROGRESS for Indian  Tribes Act.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3160) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to take  certain land located in Pinal County, Arizona, into trust for the  benefit of the Gila River Indian Community, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3160         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Blackwater Trading Post Land       Transfer Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Blackwater trading post land.--The term ``Blackwater       Trading Post Land'' means the approximately 55.3 acres of       land as depicted on the map that--        (A) is located in Pinal County, Arizona, and bordered by       Community land to the east, west, and north and State Highway       87 to the south; and        (B) is owned by the Community.        (2) Community.--The term ``Community'' means the Gila River       Indian Community of the Reservation.

(4) Reservation.--The term ``Reservation'' means the land       located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation       created under sections 3 and 4 of the Act of February 28,       1859 (11 Stat. 401, chapter LXVI), and Executive orders of       August 31, 1876, June 14, 1879, May 5, 1882, November 15,       1883, July 31, 1911, June 2, 1913, August 27, 1914, and July       19, 1915, and any other lands placed in trust for the benefit       of the Community.        (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. LAND TAKEN INTO TRUST FOR BENEFIT OF THE GILA RIVER                     INDIAN COMMUNITY.         (a) In General.--The Secretary shall take the Blackwater       Trading Post land into trust for the benefit of the       Community, after the Community--        (1) conveys to the Secretary all right, title, and interest       of the Community in and to the Blackwater Trading Post Land;        (2) submits to the Secretary a request to take the       Blackwater Trading Post Land into trust for the benefit of       the Community;        (3) conducts a survey (to the satisfaction of the       Secretary) to determine the exact acreage and legal       description of the Blackwater Trading Post Land, if the       Secretary determines a survey is necessary; and        (4) pays all costs of any survey conducted under paragraph       (3).        (b) Availability of Map.--Not later than 180 days after the       Blackwater Trading Post Land is taken into trust under       subsection (a), the map shall be on file and available for       public inspection in the appropriate offices of the       Secretary.        (c) Lands Taken Into Trust Part of Reservation.--After the       date on which the Blackwater Trading Post Land is taken into       trust under subsection (a), the land shall be treated as part       of the Reservation.        (d) Gaming.--Class II and class III gaming under the Indian       Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) shall not be       allowed at any time on the land taken into trust under       subsection (a).        (e) Description.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall cause the full       metes-and-bounds description of the Blackwater Trading Post       Land to be published in the Federal Register. The description       shall, on publication, constitute the official description of       the Blackwater Trading Post Land.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks, and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3160, introduced by our colleague, Representative    Tom O'Halleran of Arizona, authorizes the United States to place 55.3  acres of historically and culturally significant land into trust on  behalf of the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona.   This parcel of land is commonly referred to as the Blackwater Trading  Post Land, because it once contained the Ellis family's Blackwater  Trading Post, which sold goods to members of the Gila River Indian  Community since the 1930s.   After purchasing the trading post in 2010, the community found around  1,000 cultural artifacts on the property, including 126 Akimel O'odham  baskets. Following this discovery, the community decided to apply to  take the parcel of land into trust.   However, legislation is required for this exchange, as the  community's 2004 water rights settlement explicitly requires that any  lands located outside of the community's existing reservation  boundaries be taken into trust through Congressional action.   Passage of H.R. 3160 will ultimately allow the community to preserve  a piece of their heritage by incorporating this contiguous parcel of  land into its reservation land base.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative O'Halleran for his work  on this legislation, and urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3349) to authorize the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to  establish the Republic of Texas Legation Memorial as a commemorative  work in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3349       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The Daughters of the Republic of Texas may       establish a commemorative work on Federal land in the       District of Columbia and its environs to commemorate and       honor those who, as representatives of the Republic of Texas,       served in the District of Columbia as diplomats to the United       States and made possible the annexation of Texas as the       twenty-eighth State of the United States.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of the daughters of the republic of       texas.--The Daughters of the Republic of Texas shall be       solely responsible for acceptance of contributions for, and       payment of the expenses of, the establishment of the       commemorative work under this section.        (d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If upon payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the memorial (including the maintenance and       preservation amount required by section 8906(b)(1) of title       40, United States Code), there remains a balance of funds       received for the establishment of the commemorative work, the       Daughters of the Republic of Texas shall transmit the amount       of the balance to the Secretary of the Interior for deposit       in the account provided for in section 8906(b)(3) of title       40, United States Code.        (2) On expiration of authority.--If upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas shall transmit       the balance to a separate account with the National Park       Foundation for memorials, to be available to the Secretary of       the Interior or the Administrator (as appropriate) following       the process provided in section 8906(b)(4) of title 40,       United States Code, for accounts established under section       8906(b)(2) or (3) of title 40, United States Code.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks, and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3349, the Republic of Texas  Legation Memorial Act, introduced by Representative Lloyd Doggett.   This bill would authorize the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to  establish a commemorative work to honor the representatives of the  Republic of Texas who served here in the District of Columbia as  diplomats to the United States.   Shortly after Texas declared its independence from Mexico in 1836,  the Republic of Texas sent diplomats to several countries to represent  the Republic's interests. Among other things, these diplomats advocated  for protection from Mexico, financial assistance, and annexation by the  United States.   London and Paris have each erected commemorative works to recognize  the role their Texas legations played in their countries, and it seems  only fitting to install one here in the capital of the country proud to  claim Texas as its own.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Doggett for his  efforts to elevate this unique and often untold story of our Nation's  history, and urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4559]]         Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3465) to authorize the Fallen Journalists Memorial  Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of  Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3465         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Journalists Memorial       Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation       may establish a commemorative work on Federal land in the       District of Columbia and its environs to commemorate       America's commitment to a free press by honoring journalists       who sacrificed their lives in service to that cause.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of the fallen journalists memorial       foundation.--The Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation shall       be solely responsible for acceptance of contributions for,       and payment of the expenses of, the establishment of the       commemorative work under this section.        (d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If upon payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the commemorative work (including the       maintenance and preservation amount required by section       8906(b)(1) of title 40, United States Code), there remains a       balance of funds received for the establishment of the       commemorative work, the Fallen Journalists Memorial       Foundation shall transmit the amount of the balance to the       Secretary of the Interior for deposit in the account provided       for in section 8906(b)(3) of title 40, United States Code.  [[Page H4560]]         (2) On expiration of authority.--If upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work, the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation shall       transmit the amount of the balance to a separate account with       the National Park Foundation for memorials, to be available       to the Secretary of the Interior or Administrator (as       appropriate) following the process provided in section       8906(b)(4) of title 40, United States Code, for accounts       established under section 8906(b)(2) or (3) of title 40,       United States Code.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3465, the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act  introduced by my fellow committee member, Representative Napolitano.   This bill would authorize a memorial to honor the reporters,  photojournalists, producers, editors, and countless others who have  lost their lives while performing their jobs.   Every day, journalists at home and abroad place their lives at risk  in pursuit of the truth and in defense of our First Amendment right to  a free and independent press.   In 2018 alone, nearly 80 journalists from around the world were  murdered in their line of work. Yet, with the closure of the Newseum  earlier this year, there is no memorial that commemorates those who  have paid the ultimate sacrifice while fulfilling their duty to deliver  the news.   The memorial envisioned in H.R. 3465 would be a fitting tribute to  their sacrifices and an affirmation of our Nation's commitment to a  free press.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4957) to amend the Indian Child Protection and Family  Violence Prevention Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4957         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Child       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4957, introduced by Representative Ruben Gallego  from Arizona, amends and reauthorizes several programs within the  Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act in order to  improve the prevention, investigation, treatment, and prosecution of  family violence, child abuse, and child neglect involving Native  American children and families.   There is an enormous need for family violence prevention and  treatment resources in Tribal communities. Native children experience  child abuse and neglect at an elevated rate, which leads many to  require special education services, to be more likely to be involved in  the juvenile and criminal justice systems, and to have long-term mental  health needs.   The passage of H.R. 4957 will create technical assistance programs in  the Bureau of Indian Affairs, allow for urban Indian organizations to  partner with Tribal governments, and ensure culturally competent care.   I thank subcommittee Chair Ruben Gallego for introducing and  championing this vitally important legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 4957.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4562]]     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 294) to establish a business incubators program within the  Department of the Interior to promote economic development in Indian  reservation communities.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 294         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Business       Incubators Program Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) entrepreneurs face specific challenges when       transforming ideas into profitable business enterprises;        (2) entrepreneurs that want to provide products and       services in reservation communities face an additional set of       challenges that requires special knowledge;        (3) a business incubator is an organization that assists       entrepreneurs in navigating obstacles that prevent innovative       ideas from becoming viable businesses by providing services       that include--        (A) workspace and facilities resources;        (B) access to capital, business education, and counseling;        (C) networking opportunities;        (D) mentorship opportunities; and        (E) an environment intended to help establish and expand       business operations;        (4) the business incubator model is suited to accelerating       entrepreneurship in reservation communities because the       business incubator model promotes collaboration to address       shared challenges and provides individually tailored services       for the purpose of overcoming obstacles unique to each       participating business; and        (5) business incubators will stimulate economic development       by providing Native entrepreneurs with the tools necessary to       grow businesses that offer products and services to       reservation communities.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 294, introduced by Senator Tom Udall from the great  State of New Mexico, will establish a business incubators program  within the Department of the Interior to promote entrepreneurship and  economic development on Indian reservations.   Indian Tribes face many unique obstacles in their mission to bring  industry and economic development to Indian Country. The end result is  an increased cost of doing business in Indian Country, which stifles  outside investment.   Moreover, every entrepreneur faces challenges when transforming ideas  into a profitable business. However, there are specific and unique  challenges associated with establishing a business in Indian Country  that put native entrepreneurs at a disadvantage.   For example, much of the land in Indian Country is held in trust by  the Federal Government. Consequently, the Secretary of the Interior  must approve activities on these lands as part of the Federal trust  responsibility, which creates added expenses and uncertainty for Native  entrepreneurs and their potential business partners.   Additionally, since trust land cannot be alienated and cannot be used  as collateral to obtain financing, Native entrepreneurs must look to  other methods of raising capital to start and grow their businesses.   Finally, many Indian nations and reservations are located in rural,  often remote, areas. The lack of infrastructure in these areas,  including access to high-speed broadband, is another roadblock that  prevents Native entrepreneurs from succeeding.   Enactment of S. 294 will enhance Indian Country's ability to become  more self-reliant by giving Native entrepreneurs the tools they need to  develop their businesses and create jobs in reservation communities.   These incubators will provide essential services, such as a  workspace, a collaborative environment, comprehensive business skills,  training, and opportunities to build professional networks.   Also, by involving institutions of higher learning in the incubator  program, including Tribal colleges and universities, the bill will  establish the vital school-to-business pipeline that has been proven to  be so successful for startups.   I am proud to be the sponsor of the House version of this  legislation, along with members of the Congressional Native American  Caucus, Representatives   Tom Cole,   Don Young, and Norma Torres, and  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting S. 294.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, because I won't be here this afternoon, I would like  to take a moment to speak on two significant missing and murdered  indigenous women bills coming to the floor today: S. 982, the Not  Invisible Act, and S. 227, Savanna's Act.   Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for ensuring  these bills are heard today and highlighting this critical issue that  has been overlooked for too long.   First, S. 982, the Not Invisible Act, introduced by Senator Cortez  Masto of Nevada, will help combat the longstanding missing and murdered  indigenous women crisis. This bill will establish an advisory committee  on violent crime to make recommendations to the Department of the  Interior and Department of Justice to establish best practices to  combat the epidemic of missing persons, murder, and trafficking of  Native Americans and Alaska Natives. It will also create a point person  within the Bureau of Indian Affairs charged with improving coordination  of violent crime prevention efforts across Federal agencies.   All this work will be undertaken with an understanding of the unique  challenges faced by Tribal communities when combating crime, violence,  and human trafficking. The advisory committee will be comprised of  local law enforcement, Federal partners, service providers, and, most  importantly, survivors and Tribal leaders.   This bill is about including indigenous voices by putting Native  American survivors in the driver's seat on the crisis of missing and  murdered indigenous women that has plagued Tribal communities for  centuries. The Not Invisible Act is about elevating indigenous voices,  because survivors of these  [[Page H4565]]  horrific crimes and Tribal leaders know what is best for their own  communities.   Throughout history, the Federal Government has told Tribes and Native  people how they should approach issues on their own lands without  intentionally including their voices. Often, these one-sided solutions  have fallen short or no real action was taken. I am here today to tell  you that photo ops and empty promises are no longer enough.   While there are many Federal programs and resources that can be used  to combat violent crimes in Indian Country, there is no overarching  plan or strategy to do so. There is little awareness or coordination of  services, and Federal resources may not consider the actual needs of  American Indians and Alaska Natives. These unique cultural  considerations and the complex framework of criminal jurisdiction on  Tribal lands simply cannot be navigated by a one-size-fits-all  approach. More importantly, a real solution will never be found without  the voices of indigenous survivors, which is what is so special about  this bill.   The crisis of missing, murdered, and trafficked Native women has  devastated families and communities but has gone unaddressed throughout  history. These losses are an open wound in our Tribal communities and  add to the generational trauma facing Native American families that  many of us have experienced.   That is why my dear friends and colleagues, Representatives   Tom  Cole, Sharice Davids, and Markwayne Mullin, helped me introduce this  bill in the House as the first bill in history to be sponsored by four  federally recognized Tribal members of the Pueblo of Laguna, the  Chickasaw Nation, the Ho-Chunk Nation, and the Cherokee Nation,  respectively.   Enactment of S. 982 will be one step toward finally acknowledging the  pain that our families have felt and giving our survivors the platform  that they need to begin healing the open wound Native American people,  especially our women, have felt in this country for so long.   My hope is that, together, we can use the Not Invisible Act to do  just that: not be invisible anymore.   The second bill that I would like to highlight is S. 227, Savanna's  Act. This bill was introduced by Senator Murkowski and is named in  honor of Savanna Greywind, who was a 22-year-old member of the Spirit  Lake Tribe.   Savanna was 8 months pregnant when she was tragically murdered in  August of 2017. At the time of her death, she had recently gotten a job  as a nursing assistant and was looking forward to starting her family  by welcoming her first child with her partner, Ashton, in North Dakota.  However, this ended abruptly when Savanna was brutally strangled after  having her child removed from her belly in a violent attack.   Savanna was just one of the many Native American women who have been  victims of the silent crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women  in the United States. Native women experience murder rates 10 times  higher than the national average, and murder is the third leading cause  of death for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Eighty-four percent  of Native women endure violence during their lifetime, and they are  twice as likely to experience sexual assault or rape in their lifetimes  than any other group. This is unacceptable.    Even though these alarming rates persist, there are no reliable  systems available to track this data or know exactly how many Native  American women and girls go missing each year, because the databases  that hold statistics of these cases are outdated and there is a lack of  coordination between local, State, and Tribal law enforcement agencies.   Savanna's Act addresses these discrepancies to find practical  solutions to address the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous  women by approving Tribes' access to Federal crime information  databases, requiring the United States to track and publish data  relating to the disappearance of our women, and providing training and  technical assistance to Tribal law enforcement agencies to adequately  respond to these cases.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Norma Torres for inviting me to  colead this critical piece of legislation to help improve data  collection of indigenous women where none exists to help law  enforcement follow-up rates and response times for cases that take  place on and off Tribal lands.   Most importantly, this bill will help develop new guidelines to  improve law enforcement communications with families of victims to  disseminate information of cases involving their loved ones, which is  crucial, because many times no efforts are made to update families  currently.   To the former partner of Savanna, Ashton Matheny, and her daughter,  Haisley Jo, who turned 3, 1 month ago today, I would like to send my  sincerest condolences to their family. While the passage of this bill  will never make up for their devastating loss, I hope that it brings  honor to Haisley's mother, and know that it will impact generations to  come.   I am proud to be the sponsor and colead of the House versions of S.  982, the Not Invisible Act, and S. 227, Savanna's Act, to help address  the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting both of  these bills.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 832) to nullify the Supplemental Treaty Between the United  States of America and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Indians of  Middle Oregon, concluded on November 15, 1865.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 832         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NULLIFICATION OF TREATY.         The Supplemental Treaty Between the United States of       America and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Indians of       Middle Oregon, concluded on November 15, 1865, and entered       into pursuant to the Senate resolution of ratification dated       March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. 751), shall have no force or effect.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 832, introduced by Senator Merkley of Oregon, will  nullify the supplemental treaty of 1865 between the United States and  the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Indians of Middle Oregon.   The Warm Springs Confederated Tribe signed a treaty with the United  States in 1855 in which they relinquished millions of acres of their  land but reserved the Warm Springs Reservation for their exclusive use,  as well as off-reservation fishing, hunting, and gathering rights.   After the treaty's signing, the Tribes maintained their accustomed  practice of traveling regularly to the Columbia River to harvest  salmon. However, non-Indian settlers in the area convinced the Oregon  Superintendent of Indian Affairs to pursue efforts to keep the Tribes  away.  [[Page H4566]]    As a result, in 1865, a small number of Warm Springs members were  fraudulently made to sign a supplemental treaty that claimed to strip  the Tribe's off-reservation rights and to prohibit their members from  leaving the reservation without a written permit issued by the Federal  Indian agent.   Both the Indians of the Warm Springs Reservation and the United  States Government recognized that this was a deceptive action and have  consistently ignored the 1865 agreement while also reaffirming the  Tribes' off-reservation treaty rights. Passage of S. 832 will finally  officially correct this historic injustice and nullify the 1865 treaty.   Madam Speaker, I thank and congratulate Senator Merkley for his work  on moving this bill through the Senate. I also want to thank our  colleague from Oregon, Representative   Greg Walden, for his work on  the House version of the legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge quick adoption of this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 139) to establish the Springfield Race Riot National  Historic Monument in the State of Illinois, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 139         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Special Resource Study.--        (1) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a special resource       study of the study area.        (2) Contents.--In conducting the study under paragraph (1),       the Secretary shall--        (A) evaluate the national significance of the study area;        (B) determine the suitability and feasibility of       designating the study area as a unit of the National Park       System;        (C) consider other alternatives for preservation,       protection, and interpretation of the study area by the       Federal Government, State or local government entities, or       private and nonprofit organizations;        (D) consult with interested Federal agencies, State or       local governmental entities, private and nonprofit       organizations, or any other interested individuals; and        (E) identify cost estimates for any Federal acquisition,       development, interpretation, operation, and maintenance       associated with the alternatives.        (3) Applicable law.--The study required under paragraph (1)       shall be conducted in accordance with section 100507 of title       54, United States Code.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 139, the Springfield Race  Riot Study Act, introduced by Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois.   In August 1908, Springfield, Illinois, was the site of a multiday  riot, with violence directed at the African-American community.   The mob shot innocent people, burned almost 50 homes, looted and  destroyed two dozen stores, and mutilated and lynched two elderly Black  men who were merely innocent bystanders.                                time  1300    All of this violence came about because two other African-American  men were wrongly accused; one accused of attacking a White woman who,  not long after the riots, admitted that her attacker was a White man;  and one accused on slight evidence of attacking a White girl and of  murdering her father.   In part, as a response to the riot, the NAACP was formed in 1909 to  work to end segregation, discrimination, and ensure African Americans  are provided their constitutional rights.   This was the one bright light that emerged out of that dark moment in  our history, and it is an origin story that certainly resonates today  as the Nation continues to grapple with race relations and social  justice.   This bill will authorize the National Park Service to conduct a full,  special resource study to determine the most appropriate method to  preserve, interpret, and protect the resources associated with the riot  and the founding of the NAACP.   I want to thank Representative Davis for his efforts on this bill,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support its adoption.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1702) to waive the application fee for any special use  permit for veterans demonstrations and special events at war memorials  on Federal land, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1702         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Free Veterans from Fees       Act''.       SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1702, the Free Veterans from  Fees Act introduced by Representative Greg Steube.   This bill seeks to honor the sacrifices made by our veterans and  their families by waiving application fees for veterans' special events  at war memorials in our Nation's Capital for veterans and Gold Star  families.   Although the National Park Service has a longstanding practice of  waiving application fees for special use permits for most veterans'  events at war memorials, oftentimes, veterans' organizations have to  pay administrative fees and processing costs to obtain permits for  events such as Honor Buses.   By codifying a version of this routine practice and policy in law, we  can help honor the sacrifices made by our veterans and Gold Star  families by ensuring that they are not required to pay when visiting  national war memorials built to commemorate their bravery and our  fallen heroes.   I thank Representative Steube for introducing this legislation and  urge my colleagues to support it.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 490) to designate a mountain ridge in the State of Montana as  ``B-47 Ridge''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 490         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``B-47 Ridge Designation       Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF B-47 RIDGE, MONTANA.         (a) Designation.--        (1) In general.--The unnamed mountain ridge located at       4514'40.89" N., 11043'38.75" W. that runs south and west of       Emigrant Peak in the Absaroka Range in the State of Montana,       which is the approximate site of a crash of a B-47, shall be       known and designated as ``B-47 Ridge''.        (2) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       ridge described in paragraph (1) shall be deemed to be a       reference to ``B-47 Ridge''.        (b) Authorization for Plaque.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Agriculture may authorize       the installation and maintenance of a plaque on B-47 Ridge       that--        (A) memorializes the 1962 crash of the B-47 aircraft at the       site; and        (B) may include the names of the victims of the crash.        (2) Authorized terms and conditions.--The Secretary of       Agriculture may include any terms and conditions in the       authorization for a plaque under paragraph (1) that the       Secretary of Agriculture determines to be necessary.        (3) Funding.--No Federal funds may be used to design,       procure, install, or maintain the plaque authorized under       paragraph (1).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 490 the B-47 Ridge Designation  Act.   One of our priorities on the House Natural Resources Committee this  Congress has been to enhance public lands access for veterans and  servicemembers and that includes allowing our public lands to honor  those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.   This bill would designate an unnamed mountain range near Emigrant  Peak in the State of Montana as ``B-47 Ridge'' and allow the  installation of a commemorative plaque at the site.   The name and plaque would memorialize the tragic end to a routine  training flight on the night of July 23, 1962. Four U.S. Air Force  servicemembers lost their lives when their B-47 strategic bomber  crashed at 8,500 feet. Debris from the crash can still be seen on the  ridge today.   This bill appropriately honors the memory and sacrifice of Captain  Faulconer, Lieutenant Lloyd Sawyers, Lieutenant David Sutton, and  Lieutenant Hixenbaugh.   I urge its immediate adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 895) to allow tribal grant schools to participate in the  Federal Employee Health Benefits program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 895         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal School Federal       Insurance Parity Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT.         Section 409 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25       U.S.C. 1647b) is amended by inserting ``or the Tribally       Controlled Schools Act of 1988 (25 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.)''       after ``(25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 895, introduced by Representative Dusty Johnson of  South Dakota, authorizes Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations  operating Tribally controlled schools the ability to access the Federal  Employees Health Benefits Program.  [[Page H4569]]                                     time  1315    Prior to 2010, Tribal employees generally lacked access to the FEHB  program. To fix this, Congress passed the Indian Healthcare Improvement  Act in 2010.   However, eligibility for Federal health benefits was granted only to  the Tribal nations that utilized the Indian Self-Determination and  Education Assistance Act, leaving behind the tribally controlled  schools that operate pursuant to the Tribally Controlled Schools Act.   This gap has resulted in significant financial strains on 126  tribally controlled schools and has made it difficult for them to  recruit and maintain quality educators. Passage of H.R. 895 will remove  this disparity and ensure that all BIE-operated and BIE-funded tribally  operated schools' employees have access to the FEHB program.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our colleague, Representative Johnson,  for championing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  895, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
