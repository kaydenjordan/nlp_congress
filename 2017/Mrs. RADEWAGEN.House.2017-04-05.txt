 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th  anniversary of the swearing in of the first woman to serve in Congress,  Jeannette Rankin of Montana.   As the first woman to represent American Samoa, I could not be more  honored and humbled to be here today to salute this great woman who  paved the way for each and every one of us serving in Congress today.   Imagine the difficulties she had to deal with as the first woman in  Congress--in 1917, no less--a woman who stood by her convictions no  matter the cost. It must have been extremely harrowing for her at  times, but she soldiered on as one would expect from the first female  in what was at the time, and in many ways still is, a male-dominated  world.   The Congresswoman was a woman of rock-solid principles which she  absolutely would not budge from, as evidenced by her being the only  Member of Congress to vote against involvement in both world wars, a  position that was very unpopular at the time. But she stood by her  beliefs and could not be swayed, an example for all of us.   While Congresswoman Rankin served only two terms in Congress, her  legacy lives on in all of the women who have served since and those who  will in the future. She famously once said, and we have all said it  several times because it is worth saying and repeating:   ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the  last.''   She was absolutely correct, and I am grateful for her determination  to ensure that the women of this great Nation have a voice in  Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in saluting this  remarkable woman and the lasting legacy she has left behind as an  example to all women.
