 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak as in morning business for up to 17 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                         Our Nation's Infrastructure     Mr. President, with the Republican plan to defeat the  Affordable Care Act itself defeated, President Trump says he wants to  move beyond healthcare to focus on other priorities. One area that he  has often highlighted is our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, which  is a priority that many of us share and is something I would like to  discuss today.   All of our kids, I suspect, dread having to bring home a lousy report  card. They would be facing a serious talk.   Every 4 years, the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a  report card for American infrastructure. Our 2017 report card--out just  this month--shows lousy marks across the board for American  infrastructure. Our ports and bridges got C-pluses, flat Ds for both  drinking water infrastructure and roads, and our energy grid got a D- plus. Overall, the United States took home a D-plus grade point  average. It is not pretty, and not an improvement over the scores we  got 4 years earlier.   A report card is a progress report, and our grades show we are not  making progress. So it is time to get serious about the sorry state of  America's roads, bridges, ports, and pipes, which literally keep our  economy moving.   The Civil Engineers estimate that we need an additional $2 trillion  in infrastructure investments over the next 10 years to get our  infrastructure back to a B grade level. The study also found that there  is a cost for lousy infrastructure--that we are set to lose nearly $4  trillion in GDP and $7 trillion in lost business sales by 2025, which  would result in 2.5 million fewer jobs that year.   America's declining infrastructure also faces growing demand. The  Bipartisan Policy Center estimates an additional 100 million more  people will rely on our transportation system by midcentury. The U.S.  Department of Transportation says that we can expect twice the level of  freight traffic on our highways and roads by then, so our already worn- down infrastructure is going to take an even heavier beating. We have  to be ready for this. We have to make smart investments in the  infrastructure backbone of American commerce. We should make those  investments now, and we should make them for the long term.   I am hopeful. Transportation infrastructure has been a rare  bipartisan bright spot in Congress. After all, our red States and our  blue States both have bridges that age and water mains that rupture.   Congress has tried many times to push large bipartisan infrastructure  bills. In the 112th Congress, a bipartisan group led by Senators Kerry,  Graham, and Hutchinson, introduced the BUILD Act to create a national  infrastructure bank that would have authorized up to $10 billion to  underwrite transportation, water, and energy projects.   The Partnership to Build America Act, introduced in the 113th  Congress by Senators Bennet and Blunt, also proposed an American  infrastructure fund, this time financed with a form of tax  repatriation.   In the 114th Congress, we were actually able to pass the first long- term transportation law in 10 years. The FAST Act--short for Fixing  America's Surface Transportation--authorized more than $300 billion in  transportation infrastructure investment over a 5-year period.   We also passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation  Act to address drinking water emergencies and authorize a number of new  Army Corps of Engineers projects, including the removal of pilings and  debris from the Providence River in Rhode Island. These bipartisan  successes, however, barely put a dent in our Nation's total  infrastructure needs.   Out on the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump spoke broadly  of a $1 trillion infrastructure push. I agree we have to make that  investment in America's infrastructure, but we also need to make sure  we get real commitment from Washington, not just public-private  partnerships and nebulous tax cuts. To bring our roads and bridges into  the 21st century, we need a far-reaching infrastructure program like  Franklin Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration.   The Joint Economic Committee's Democratic contingent put out a report  analyzing the President's proposal to use investor tax credits to close  our infrastructure gap. What they found was that using these tax  credits alone would actually ``cost nearly 55 percent more than  traditional infrastructure financing.'' We can't let infrastructure  turn into a special interest boondoggle.   In the absence of any sort of Executive plan or strategy, Senate  Democrats, led by Minority Leader Schumer, put forward our own  blueprint to rebuild America's infrastructure. It would invest $1  trillion in the Nation's infrastructure, as the President wished,  creating over 50 million American jobs. The blueprint encompasses not  just roads and bridges but parks, schools, hospitals, and airports. It  calls for investing $100 billion in smalltown communities that need  revamped infrastructure, over $100 billion in aging water and sewer  systems, $50 billion in our railways, over $100 billion in public  transportation, and $30 billion in our essential port infrastructure.  It would put billions toward modernizing our energy grid by connecting  rural areas and driving investment in clean energy.   It includes strong support for American workers--something the  President claims as a priority--with ``Buy American'' provisions to  promote American-made products and protections like the Davis-Bacon law  to make sure Americans earn fair wages.   For a coastal State like Rhode Island, which has to prepare for  rising seas and increased storm surges from climate change, the  blueprint includes $25 billion to improve coastal infrastructure and  make coastal communities more resilient. This includes competitive  critical infrastructure resiliency funding, a new Resilient Communities  Revolving Loan Fund, and support for the National Oceans and Coastal  Security Fund, which I authored sometime ago to research, restore, and  reinforce our cause. Our plan is big, it is bold, and it should garner  the support of anyone who says they want to improve America's  infrastructure and create jobs at home.   This work is vitally important in my home State. The American Society  of Civil Engineers' report card shines a light on Rhode Island's  particular infrastructure woes. It shows we need $148 million for  drinking water infrastructure needs and nearly $2 billion for  wastewater infrastructure fixes over the next 20 years. We have $4.7  million of backlogged park system repairs and a $241 million gap in  needed upgrades at schools.   More than half of our roads are in poor condition. A lot of our  infrastructure, unlike Alaska, dates back to colonial days when the  foundations of our roads were first traveled by ox carts. This state of  disrepair costs my constituents a lot of money. I have been told by the  transportation research group TRIP that driving on cracked and  crumbling roads in Rhode Island costs our motorists $604 million per  year--more than $810 per motorist, per year, in vehicle repair and  operating costs from banging into potholes.   In our State, 56 percent of the bridges are deficient or obsolete.  That, I am sorry to say, is the worst rate in the country. Those  bridges have been around a long time in many cases, and they are  literally falling down piece by piece. It can be pretty shocking to  see.   This photo shows part of the 6/10 Connector in Providence. The  interchange is a vital link in the State's highway network for vehicles  traveling between  [[Page S2067]]  Interstates 95, 195, and 295. It was built in stages through the 1950s,  and it can no longer accommodate the approximately 100,000 automobiles  and heavy trucks that travel on it each day. Our department of  transportation has spent millions of dollars on temporary maintenance  to keep the interchange shored up and in operation, but you can see  that this type of jury-rigging is not a lasting solution.   While Rhode Island directs millions of State funds to repair and  replacement of these structures, we need some Federal financing to  ensure that this work gets done before a serious failure occurs, which  could disrupt commerce up and down the entire Northeast Corridor.   The evidence of dangerous disrepair is all over my State. This photo  depicts a crumbling bridge on Route 37, the east-west freeway servicing  the cities of Cranston and Warwick. The tumbledown cement and rusting  ironwork are not reassuring. Here is another graphic showing a rusted  and ramshackle bridge over Highway 95. We can save money in the long  term--a stitch in time saves nine--if we can get on to these repairs  and get these bridges fixed.   We also have to consider the bridges, roads, ports, rails, and other  transit systems in the Ocean State that are, as you might imagine, very  close to our coast. This infrastructure is at particular risk from sea  level rise, from storm surge, and from the more severe storms that come  at us offshore, driven by warming seas and climate change.   Recently, NOAA released updated global sea level rise estimates, and  they focused those global estimates on the U.S. coastline. The estimate  for their ``extreme'' scenario--that is, if we continue to emit high  levels of carbon pollution--was increased by half a meter, to a total  of 2.5 meters or over 8 feet of global mean sea level rise by 2100.   My State's Coastal Resources Management Council has adopted the  ``high'' scenario for planning purposes and made the adjustments for  the local conditions, and they now put 9 vertical feet of sea level  rise as the expectation for Rhode Island's coast by 2100. Of course, as  any coastal Senator knows, when you go straight up 9 feet, you can go a  long way back, pushing the shoreline into what is now inland, flooding  a lot of infrastructure.   We need to protect evacuation routes from flooding, we need to  bolster hurricane barriers, and we need to replenish beaches and  nourish wetlands. To protect infrastructure from storms, we need to  raise ports and reinforce bridges that are exposed to corrosive  saltwater from storms. We need to manage upstream reservoirs to control  downstream flooding. We need to protect groundwater drinking water  supplies from intruding saltwater. We need to retrofit lowland  wastewater treatment plants that are in danger of flooding. Some of  them are not just in flood zones, they are actually in velocity zones  where wave action is expected against the structures. These  improvements are essential to meeting our infrastructure needs over the  coming decade.   Every coastal State--especially those in the Northeast and the  western Gulf of Mexico, which are expected to see the most dramatic  rises in sea level--should be nervous. That is why the Democratic  infrastructure blueprint includes funding for resilient coastal  communities, including support for the National Oceans and Coastal  Security Fund. I have worked to establish this lifeline for coastal  infrastructure since my early days in the Senate. Once we fund it, it  can be a tremendous resource for coastal communities needing  infrastructure improvement and smart coastal adaptation.   President Trump has said he wants a $1 trillion infrastructure bill.  I am ready to roll up my sleeves and ``git 'er done.'' Democrats have  put forward a blueprint for making the investments our Nation so badly  needs. Congress can come together on a plan that can provide direct,  long-term support and help communities address current needs, while  also preparing for the changes we know are coming down the pipeline at  us. I say to my Senate colleagues and to the administration, let's get  to work.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.                              Middle East Codel
