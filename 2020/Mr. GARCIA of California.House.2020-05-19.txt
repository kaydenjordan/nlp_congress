 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California and Leader McCarthy for that very gracious introduction. I  want to thank you all for being here today. First and foremost, I want  to thank my beautiful bride and wife, Rebecca, and our two beautiful  boys, Preston and Jett, for being the backbone of my survival, and the  spirit of this campaign for over a year now. So thank you very much.   Madam Speaker, I also want to thank the 715,000 people in  California's beautiful 25th Congressional District that helped me get  here, and it is a huge honor that has been bestowed upon me to  represent you in this body, I do it with humility and with, hopefully,  performance that represents all of us in the 25th District.   I can think of no better way to serve this country, to serve our  district, than  [[Page H2267]]  to be here today taking this oath and doing the job before me over the  course of the next several years.   For 244 years, this beautiful Nation has thrived and survived on the  back of those who showed up at the right time to do the right thing,  and for the right reasons.   I, as an American, someone who is a first-generation American who  served my country, I show up today, not only as a patriot, but now a  citizen legislator, to make sure that we do what is right for our  country first, to make sure that we do what is right for my district  that I represent, and to, hopefully, get through this crisis as a  solid, unified country, becoming stronger as we do so, more cooperative  in the efforts and, hopefully, making this Nation the strongest the  world has ever seen for several decades, millenniums to come.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate all the support. Thank you for being  here, and may God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
