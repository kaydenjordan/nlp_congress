 DOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to one of my constituents, Mr. Henry Parham, who is  believed to be the last surviving African American combat veteran from  D-day. Mr. Parham served in the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, the  only African American combat unit to land in Normandy on June 6, 1944.   Men from the 320th were in the first waves to land on Omaha Beach  that day. They had the vital task of preventing enemy aircraft from  attacking the beaches where men in equipment were pouring ashore. Their  balloons prevented enemy planes from making effective attacks, but the  balloons also made excellent targets for enemy fire.   Back then, the Army, like most of American society, was segregated.  Nevertheless, these African Americans risked their lives to serve their  country, even as Blacks faced Jim Crow laws and racist violence back  home.   Needless to say, the German bombs and bullets didn't discriminate.  Two thousand Americans died on Omaha Beach that day, including men from  the 320th. Many more were wounded.   I want to recognize Henry Parham from the 320th Barrage Balloon  Battalion for his heroic service to our country. I am very proud to  represent Mr. Parham in Congress.                            ____________________
