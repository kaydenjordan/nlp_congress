 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Gun Violence  Survivors Week.   Every year, roughly 36,000 Americans are killed from gun violence.  This is an  [[Page H776]]  average of 100 Americans every single day. Also, there are close to  100,000 Americans injured every year from gun violence, yet we do very  little to prevent these preventable injuries and deaths.   I am proud to come from a State with effective gun laws. In New  Jersey, we have strong background checks, a ban on high-capacity  magazines, and an extreme risk protection order for possible victims.  That is why New Jersey has one of the lowest firearm death rates in  America. If we had national laws such as the ones in New Jersey, we  could save lives and spare families the hurt and horrors of gun  violence.                            ____________________
