 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Technical Sergeant Cam Kelsch who is stationed at Hunter Army Airfield  in the First Congressional District of Georgia. He recently received  the Silver Star Medal on April 9 at the Mighty Eighth Air Force Museum.   The third highest medal for gallantry in the Nation, Sergeant Kelsch  received the award for extraordinary acts of bravery during a nighttime  raid in Afghanistan. Throughout the raid, he exposed himself to enemy  fire multiple times, once to call in air support, and another time to  eliminate an enemy machine gun.   He was also struck by enemy fire while saving the life of a wounded  American as he dragged him to safety while under fire.   Stories like these from our soldiers abroad are sober reminders of  the dangerous situations they endure to make our world and our Nation a  safer place to live.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sergeant Kelsch for his service, his bravery,  and his sacrifice, and congratulate him on receiving the Silver Star.  He deserves it.                            ____________________
