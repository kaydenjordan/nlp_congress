 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I object for  the reason I previously stated. I want to thank the Senator for the  courtesy of presenting the unanimous consent immediately. I appreciate  that very much.   I am the first chairman to endorse the type of changes the Senator  from New York has proposed as they apply to sex-related offenses under  the UCMJ. It is my intent to include the administration's proposals in  the base markup of the Defense bill next month, subject to amendments.  And I anticipate numerous amendments being offered by Members on both  sides of the aisle. Further, as I have already committed, the committee  will consider these proposals to include a vote on them, in committee,  if that is what any Senator desires. That is, in fact, the tradition of  the committee. If a member wants a vote on an amendment, we will vote.   I would note that, according to committee records, there has not been  a vote on this proposal in the committee since 2013, 8 years ago, and  has not even been introduced as an amendment in committee since that  time.   I look forward to having this debate when the committee meets to mark  up the fiscal year 2022 Defense bill.   With that, I would reiterate my objection and again thank the Senator  for her willingness to introduce the unanimous consent initially.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Corporate  Management Accountability Act, which asks each publicly traded company  to disclose its policies on whether senior executives or shareholders  bear the costs of paying the company's fines and penalties.   In 2014, William Dudley, then the President of the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York, gave a speech titled ``Enhancing Financial Stability  by Improving Culture in the Financial Services Industry.'' In this  speech, President Dudley said, ``in recent years, there have been  ongoing occurrences of serious professional misbehavior, ethical lapses  and compliance failures at financial institutions. This has resulted in  a long list of large fines and penalties and to a lesser degree than I  would have desired employee dismissals and punishment . . . The pattern  of bad behavior did not end with the financial crisis, but continued  despite the considerable public sector intervention that was necessary  to stabilize the financial system. As a consequence, the financial  industry has largely lost the public trust.''   Since 2009, banks around the world have paid $394 billion in  penalties, according to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). This is an  increase of $22 billion from the last time I introduced this  legislation. It has been evident that simply fining and penalizing  financial institutions at the corporate level is not enough to deter  bad actors. Senior executives, many of whom are all too eager to take  credit for a company's good news, must also take more responsibility  for the bad news, especially if it is true that the buck stops with  them.   According to Professor Peter J. Henning, who also writes the White  Collar Watch column for the New York Times, ``a problem in holding  individuals accountable for misconduct in an organization is the  disconnect between the actual decisions and those charged with  overseeing the company, so that executives and corporate boards usually  plead ignorance about an issue until it is too late.''   The Corporate Management Accountability Act I am reintroducing today  is one attempt at helping to solve this problem. The bill simply asks  publicly traded companies to disclose whether they expect senior  executives or shareholders to pay the cost of corporate fines or  penalties. This proposal has been supported by University of Minnesota  Law School Professors Claire Hill and Richard Painter, who also served  as President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer, as well as Americans  for Financial Reform.   I urge all my colleagues to join this legislative effort to hold  senior executives accountable for their actions.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. Shaheen):   S. 2146. A bill to establish within the Office of the Secretary of  Health and Human Services a special task force on ensuring Medicare  beneficiary access to innovative diabetes technologies and services; to  the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Stronger  Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act along with Senator Grassley and  Senator Leahy. This bill will help securities regulators better protect  investors and demand greater accountability from market players. Even  in the midst of an unprecedented public health and economic emergency,  we continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and  without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an  effective deterrent, I worry this disturbing culture of misconduct will  persist.   The amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  can fine an institution or individual is restricted by statute. During  hearings I held in 2011 as Chairman of the Banking Committee's  Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee, I learned how this  limitation significantly interferes with the SEC's ability to execute  its enforcement duties. At that time, a Federal judge had criticized  the SEC for not obtaining a larger settlement against Citigroup, a  major actor in the financial crisis that settled with the agency in an  amount that was far below the cost the bank had inflicted on investors.  The SEC indicated that a statutory prohibition against levying a larger  penalty led to the low settlement amount. Indeed, then SEC Chairman  Mary L. Schapiro in 2011 also explained that ``the Commission's  statutory authority to obtain civil monetary penalties with appropriate  deterrent effect is limited in many circumstances.''   The bipartisan bill we are reintroducing aims to update the SEC's  outdated civil penalties statutes. This bill strives to make potential  and current offenders think twice before engaging in misconduct by  raising the maximum statutory civil monetary penalties, directly  linking the size of the penalties to the amount of losses suffered by  victims of a violation, and substantially increasing the financial  stakes for serial offenders of our nation's securities laws.   Specifically, our bill would broaden the SEC's options to tailor  penalties to the particular circumstances of a given violation. In  addition to raising the per violation caps for severe, or ``third  tier,'' violations to $1 million per offense for individuals and $10  million per offense for entities, the legislation would also give the  SEC more options to collect greater penalties based on the ill-gotten  gains of the violator or on the financial harm to investors.   Our bill also seeks to deter repeat offenders on Wall Street through  two provisions. The first would authorize the SEC to triple the penalty  cap applicable to recidivists who have been held either criminally or  civilly liable for securities fraud within the previous five years. The  second would allow the SEC to seek a civil penalty against those who  violate existing federal court or SEC orders, an approach that would be  more efficient, effective, and flexible than the current civil contempt  remedy. These updates would greatly enhance the SEC's ability to levy  robust penalties against repeat offenders.   According to the SEC's FY 2022 Congressional Budget Justification,  ``the SEC is responsible for reviewing the disclosures and financial  statements of more than 7,400 reporting companies.'' The SEC further  notes that a ``record 67 million U.S. families held direct and indirect  stock holdings in 2019, up 13 percent from 2010,'' and the agency is  ``charged with overseeing approximately $100 trillion in annual  securities trading on U.S. equity markets and the activities of more  than 28,000 registered entities.'' All of our constituents deserve a  strong regulator that has the necessary tools to go after fraudsters  and pursue the difficult cases arising from our increasingly complex  financial markets. The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act will  enhance the SEC's ability to demand meaningful accountability from Wall  Street, which in turn will increase transparency and confidence in our  financial system. I urge our colleagues to support this important  bipartisan legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Leahy):   S. 2147. A bill to enhance civil penalties under the Federal  securities laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs.
