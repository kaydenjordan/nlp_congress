 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise to address an amendment that I have placed in the bill, and I  want to thank the chairman for his grace in allowing that. It talks  about addressing racial and ethnic impacts of legislation that we pass  here.   America is known for the words at the United States Supreme Court:  ``Equal justice under the law.'' Equal justice.   We struggle in our country with equality. Why? The color of  somebody's skin? Their ethnic background? Who they might love?   I think it is important to recognize that above me are the words: ``E  pluribus unum,'' ``Out of many, one.''   We are all children of God. If we so choose, we can bring people  together. We can start right here, and we can begin right now. We need  to remember the words kindness, respect, decency, compassion, empathy.  In other words, embrace the golden rule.   I wear these yellow wrist bands on my hands every day, and they say:  Practice the golden rule every day. Do unto others as you would have  done unto you.   That is what I am attempting in this amendment. God bless.
