 Mr. President, the Federal Communications Commission  Schools and Libraries program, commonly known as E-Rate, has helped  connect our schools and libraries to high-speed broadband. Recent  changes allowed for schools to pay for Wi-Fi on campuses, recognizing  that students are using laptops and other devices for learning. This  bill, cosponsored by my friends Senators Gardner, Cortez Masto, and  Whitehouse, would allow schools to receive reimbursement for Wi-Fi on  school buses--an idea inspired by a New Mexico high school student. A  few years ago, a football player from Hatch Valley High School in  Hatch, New Mexico told me how, after being on a bus for hours after a  game, he would sit in the dark parking lot of his school doing his  homework--because he didn't have high-speed broadband at home. Making  Wi-Fi available on school buses is one piece to solving the homework  gap--especially in rural areas. Adequate internet is an absolute  necessity in this day and age. And I will continue to work with my  colleagues to make sure every home in the country has adequate internet  access.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 738         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. E-RATE SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL BUS WI-FI.         (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``school bus''       means a passenger motor vehicle that is--        (1) designed to carry a driver and not less than 5       passengers; and        (2) used significantly to transport early child education,       elementary school, or secondary school students to or from       school or an event related to school.        (b) Rulemaking.--Notwithstanding the limitations under       paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A) of section 254(h) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254(h)) regarding the       authorized recipients and uses of discounted       telecommunications services, not later than 180 days after       the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications       Commission shall commence a rulemaking to make the provision       of Wi-Fi access on school buses eligible for support under       the E-rate program of the Commission set forth under subpart       F of part 54 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations.                                   ______                                         By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Barrasso, Mr.          Whitehouse, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Capito, Mrs.          Gillibrand, Mr. Cramer, and Mr. Van Hollen):   S. 747.
