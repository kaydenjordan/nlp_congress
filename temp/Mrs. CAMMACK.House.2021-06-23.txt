 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge immediate  consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and  Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act.   Our Nation has stood unified in our opposition to federally funded,  on-demand abortion services for the past 40 years. The Hyde amendment  has acted as a stopgap against publicly funded abortion and as a  safeguard for our Nation's most vulnerable, the unborn.   Before the Hyde amendment took effect in 1980, over 300,000 American  children per year were denied their most basic right to life and were  aborted using taxpayer-funded dollars. This fight is one that we must  undertake in  [[Page H3023]]  Congress to protect our most fundamental rights and important tenets  that make our country great.   The Biden administration and congressional Democrats seem to have  forgotten the bipartisan support the Hyde amendment has received from  both Republican and Democrat administrations in the past, as well as  the overwhelming support from the American public, for this important  provision.   It is a national shame for this administration and congressional  Democrats to overlook and marginalize the right to life that we, as  Americans, hold dear. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is  not just a saying; it is a guiding principle by which we should all  govern.   Let's come together as Americans, leave party lines behind, and  support the right to life because America's future depends on it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question  and provide for immediate consideration of H.R. 18 for the sake of  America's future generations.
