 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I believe Americans are  compassionate people. I also believe Americans are angered by  injustice, and I know Americans are eager to protect the defenseless.   In a past hearing before the Judiciary Committee on this bill, Dr.  Maureen Condic said in her testimony: ``Imposing pain on any pain- capable living creature is cruelty. And ignoring the pain experienced  by another human individual for any reason is barbaric.''   H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, gives us a  chance to choose compassion by preventing abortions from taking place  if the child is 20 weeks or older. Science proves that not only can  these children feel pain, but since their pain inhibitors are  undeveloped, they feel pain even more intensely than we can. In Dr.  Condic's words: ``We simply have to decide whether we will choose to  ignore the pain of the fetus or not.''   Mr. Speaker, I am choosing not to ignore their pain. I strongly urge  my colleagues to support this compassionate bill.
