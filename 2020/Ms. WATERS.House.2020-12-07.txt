 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), for yielding, and I  commend him for organizing this Special Order on the 155th anniversary  of the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of  the United States and the important relationship between the  Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.   Since our founding, the United States has been engaged in a constant  struggle to realize the full promise and potential of our founding  principles, most especially the right for all people, regardless of  race, color, or gender, to vote and participate in our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, despite the fact it has been more than 150 years from  the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, I  was absolutely horrified by the level of voter suppression that took  place in the last election.   The President and some Members of this body falsely claim that there  was voting fraud, while courts have dismissed 43 cases the President's  legal team has brought.   What is underappreciated and not discussed is the lengths the  President and Republicans and States across the country went to to stop  minorities from voting: fake vote-by-mail boxes, racist robocalls  encouraging Blacks not to vote by mail, and the President's absolute  sabotage of the United States Postal Service to stop people from  voting.   Mr. Speaker, the next Congress and the new administration must come  together to strengthen voting rights next year. We cannot wait.                                time  1715    Those who fought and died for the right to vote must be remembered,  and we honor their work by ensuring future generations have the right  to vote.
