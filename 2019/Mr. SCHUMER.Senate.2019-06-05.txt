 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday on the floor I said I don't  believe President Trump will follow through on his threat to impose  tariffs on Mexico. Why? First, because the President has a tendency for  bluster. There are many examples of the President taking a maximalist  position before eventually backing off and announcing some different  solution. Nine times out of ten, after a few months, everyone realizes  that the so-called solution isn't real and doesn't work, but the  President needs a way out of his bluster. That may well be true with  the tariff issue.   Second, most Senate Republicans oppose the President's idea of  slapping tariffs on Mexico. They know how that could destabilize our  economy and Mexico's and that it could actually make the migration  problem worse.   Publicly, the President has continued the tough talk on tariffs with  Mexico--he responded to my statement on the floor with a tweet last  night--but ultimately I continue to believe he will back off. That has  been his MO. When he does, I would urge him to consider a real solution  to the border problem, not some fake solution that he and the Mexicans  announce, and then it does nothing--they don't follow through, it  doesn't have effect, whatever.   Here is a commonsense policy that will actually reduce the problems  at the border: Many of the migrants that arrive at our southern border  are fleeing untenable situations--gang violence, drug cartels,  corruption, domestic abuse, economic depravity. If you are starving, if  you are worried that your child will be mugged, if you are worried that  your daughter will be raped, you ain't staying there. The governments  of those countries have failed to provide safety or security for people  living within their borders in Nicaragua, in Honduras, and in El  Salvador. Their citizens--or some of them--feel compelled to embark on  a dangerous 1,000-mile journey on foot rather than stay put because  staying put is even worse for them.   These are not evil people. The President would like to make them all  out to be drug dealers or criminals. Most of them are poor people who  are trying to escape the dangers created by the problems of gang  violence, economic hardship, social oligarchy.   We Democrats have crafted legislation that would help address the  problems in those three Central American countries that are causing the  migrants to flee in the first place.   First, we would allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum within their  own countries. That thousand-mile trek across Mexico is dangerous. It  is often expensive. You have to pay a coyote or buy off drug dealers or  other criminals. Let them apply in Honduras, in El Salvador, in  Guatemala and not amass at the border. Second, we provide significant  security assistance to Central American countries to build their  capacity, crack down on the gangs and drug cartels and human  trafficking that is endemic in those countries, and we would increase  the number of immigration judges and personnel to reduce the current  backlog of cases at the border.    These policies make eminent sense, and unlike the President's plan to  impose tariffs on Mexico, our proposals do not threaten the U.S.  economy. We would urge our Republican colleagues to join us in this  commonsense solution.   When the President inevitably retreats from his tariff threat--which  may be as soon as this afternoon--we should proceed on these  commonsense policies, not some fake thing that sounds good in an  announcement and then goes away like we have seen over and over again  when the President conducts foreign policy--North Korea being one of  the most notorious examples.   Over the past year, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, despite some  positive domestic reforms, has too often acted like a brute in the  Middle East rather than a stabilizing force.   I understand that Saudi Arabia worries about Iran. I share those  concerns about the Iranian Government, but the Saudis have all too  often reacted in the wrong way. In Yemen, the Saudis are fighting a  proxy war that has resulted in untold human suffering and the slaughter  of innocents of many children. Internally, the Saudi Government has  conducted a widespread campaign of political repression, including the  imprisonment of women's rights campaigners. We all know how the Saudis  were responsible for the vicious torture and chilling murder of a  journalist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi.   Despite these gross violations of international norms and values, the  Trump administration has just cozied up with Crown Prince Muhammad bin  Salman and offered almost no criticism.   We have just learned, according to reports, that the Trump  administration approved seven transfers of American nuclear technology  to the Saudis, including two after Khashoggi's murder. Now the  administration is using its favorite tool, claiming emergency powers to  justify another 22 arms sales to the Saudis and others, including  precision-guided munitions for Saudi's operations in Yemen.   Has the Trump administration lost all perspective when it comes to  Saudi Arabia--providing excuses and cover for the brutal murder of a  journalist and American resident, aiding and arming the Saudis in a  human rights tragedy in Yemen, which will only come back to hurt him in  the long run. What are we doing here?   Congress has already voted, in bipartisan majorities, to unwind  America's involvement in Yemen, which, of course, the President vetoed,  and now we ought to vote to disapprove these arms sales.   The chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign  Operations, Senator Graham, urged by our ranking member of Foreign  Relations and our leader on this issue, Senator Menendez, has  thankfully announced the bipartisan effort to do just that. I strongly  support that effort.   Let me say, my Republican friends, over the last years of the Obama  administration, bitterly complained about the way President Obama used  Executive authority. The amount of Executive authority used by  President Obama could fit in a thimble compared to the abuse of  Executive authority by President Trump. Yet it seems, in the past, our  Republican colleagues who so criticized Obama for much less have been  totally silent when President Trump abuses Executive authority, but now  maybe there are some green shoots.   Maybe some of our Republican colleagues in the Senate are waking up  to the idea that in America we have a three-branch government, not a  one-branch government, and maybe some of our Republican colleagues are  recognizing that and beginning to act--the possible green shoots. Two  instances; one is tariffs. Our Republicans don't like these tariffs.  Will they have the guts, if the President implements them, to oppose  the President? We will see.   Now, on Saudi arms sales, a number of Senate Republicans are  beginning to  [[Page S3227]]  say we need to constrain the President the way the Congress has  traditionally constrained the executive branch. I am hopeful, but I am  also skeptical.   If the past is prologue, my Republican friends will ultimately back  down. Leader McConnell, his MO, will let a few of them off the hook so  they can go home and say they supported it but never enough to make  sure Congress provides an effective check on the President. It is sort  of a wink and a nod. Well, let's hope this time it is different. Let's  hope that these murmurings among Republicans about the Saudi arms sales  and about the tariffs are real, and they will actually stand up to him,  which is what a Congress should do even when they are of the same party  as the President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the climate, as I have said so many  times, no threat poses a greater danger to our planet than that of  climate change. The last 5 years have been the warmest on record. There  is more carbon dioxide in the air than any point in human history. Our  children and grandchildren will live with the consequences of the  decisions we make today. We need all hands on deck--the Federal  Government, local governments, municipalities, corporate leaders,  global efforts--if we are to meet the challenges of climate change  head-on, but for years our government has been too slow to act and more  often than not we have done nothing or very little.   Just yesterday, President Trump once again--not based on fact, based  on whim, as he so often acts--voiced a dangerous skepticism about  climate change while meeting with Prince Charles.   Now, one of the biggest reasons for the slow progress on climate  policy has been the oppressive grip of Big Oil, Big Gas, and Big Coal,  on our political system. They spent untold millions to debunk climate  science and torpedo climate legislation. One of the largest  perpetrators has been the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which never reveals  its donors and has acted all too often as a front for Big Oil.   Recently, as public support for action upon climate change has grown  even more overwhelming, the chamber is starting to sing a different  tune. They have launched a campaign for cleaner energy sources. They  have added a new section to their website, ``Addressing Climate  Change.'' They now even say that, on this issue, ``inaction is not an  option.'' Well, I could not agree more; inaction is not an option, but  color me skeptical about the chamber.   I hope to see the chamber follow its public stance with real action,  but until I do, I fear this change is merely cosmetic. All too often,  the big oil and big coal companies don't act themselves, although some  do, but they let the chamber do their dirty work for them. So today  Sheldon Whitehouse and I, along with a number of our colleagues, will  be sending a letter to the chamber, calling on them to speak out  against the administration's effort to undermine the ``National Climate  Assessment.'' It is not enough to simply say: Oh, well, it is a  problem.   Inaction is not an option. They must do something concrete. This is a  concrete action we are proposing that will make a difference. I read in  today's New York Times that companies are now beginning to plan for how  climate change will cost them more money in the next 5 years. They  don't think it is no problem. They don't think it is a 30-year problem.  These companies and their interest in their profits--that is how they  should be interested, although I would like to see them a little more  interested in workers and communities and climate. These companies, for  their own bottom lines, are saying climate change is real, and we  better do something.   Well, one way the chamber can move things along is to speak out  against this administration in its efforts to undermine the ``National  Climate Assessment.'' For years, this study has been the gold standard  for climate research within our government. It is not partisan. It is  factual; it is based on science; and it assesses the long-term threats  to climate change.   The President is sort of, on climate, a member of the Flat Earth  Society, just denying the facts. It would be as if Columbus sailed, and  the President still said the earth is flat. That is how he is acting on  climate. Well, the Chamber ought to break with that. They ought to let  science and facts determine how we act.   This is a moment when the Chamber could actually use its influence to  convince the administration to reverse course. If the business  community said this, it would make a big difference. So this is a  moment. Let's see if the chamber really wants to prove that they are  for climate change. Let's see. Let's see. If they don't, we ask their  members who say they believe in climate--and who are even planning for  the problems we face--to put pressure on them to do it. Let's hope.  Let's hope.   Now, before I yield the floor, I just want to send a kudos--he  reminded me that the word ``kudos'' is singular, not plural, which I  did not know for all of my years here. Mr. President, I see by your  reaction, you did not know either. It is a kudos. So let me gave a  kudos to Sheldon Whitehouse's leadership on this issue. One of his many  positive traits is he knows grammar and all of that much better than  most of us, but one of his greater traits is how he has been relentless  in pushing forward on climate and on pushing corporate America to do  more.   I look forward to continuing to work with him to shed light on the  role that Big Money plays in undermining climate policy, and I look  forward to hearing from the chamber of commerce on what they have to  say about the administration's latest attacks on climate science.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
