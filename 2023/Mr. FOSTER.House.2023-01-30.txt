 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 342, the Cost- Share Accountability Act.   This bill, which I co-led with its sponsor, Congressman Obernolte,  was born out of a joint hearing that we held last Congress, which  discussed best practices for financial assistance agreements within the  Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy.   This bill mandates reports on the Department's use of cost-sharing  practices, which require organizations receiving grants from the  Department of Energy to fund a portion of the project's costs.   I am a big fan of cost-sharing agreements as a mechanism to make sure  that taxpayer dollars are well spent. There are circumstances under  which they may appropriately be waived, but in order for Congress to  fulfill our oversight responsibilities, we must be able to access  information on how those requirements are being implemented and when  they are being waived.   This legislation is fundamental good governance, an important step to  increase the transparency of the Department of Energy's funding  practices, and I look forward to working with the Department of Energy  to ensure that cost-sharing is implemented fairly and effectively and  that it is supporting the Department's and Congress' priorities.   I thank Representative Obernolte for his leadership on this  legislation, which passed the House in a strong bipartisan vote last  Congress, and also for his service as ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight that I chaired last  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
