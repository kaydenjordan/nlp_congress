 Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump  made the courageous decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range  Nuclear Forces Treaty last week. This was long overdue. Sadly, there  have been obvious Russian violations since 2011.   The 1987 INF Treaty was achieved by President Ronald Reagan to  prohibit development of ground-launched cruise missiles. The INF Treaty  was seen as the gold standard of arms control agreements for years, but  Russia has been in violation of the agreement, while we have continued  to limit our research and development.   Allowing Russia to violate the INF Treaty endangers American  families. Now, Russia will find more incentive to return to the  negotiating table, encouraged by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.   We must continue to seek peace through strength. It was this strategy  implemented by President Reagan that prompted Moscow to sign the INF  Treaty in the first place.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
