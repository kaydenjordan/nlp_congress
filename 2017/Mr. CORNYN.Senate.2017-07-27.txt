 Mr. President, this week we are about the business of  keeping our promises. For 7 years, we have promised to help the  millions of Americans who have been let down, not to mention deceived,  by the promises of ObamaCare. It is absolutely critical that we fulfill  our commitments.   This is not just about moving past the failures of ObamaCare but  laying the groundwork for providing Americans access to better care. We  said all along that we have four principles:   One is to help stabilize the insurance markets so people living in  Iowa, for example, would make sure they have a place where they can  actually buy health insurance.   It is about getting premiums lower by eliminating the mandates and  making it possible for people to choose alternatives that happen to  suit their needs at a price they can afford.   Third, we said we are going to continue to do everything in our power  to protect people with preexisting conditions so they are not afraid  about changing jobs and being excluded from their new employer's  insurance coverage because of something we have done here. We protect  people against the preexisting conditions exclusion.   Fourth, what we said we want to do is to take Medicaid, an essential  safety net healthcare program, and make sure we put it on a sustainable  path. I know there are some in Washington, DC, who think we can just  continue to spend borrowed money endlessly. Well, we can't. It really  jeopardizes the very viability of some of our most essential safety net  programs like Social Security, Medicare, and, yes, Medicaid in this  instance.   What we have done, and what we intend to do, working with our  colleagues in the House, is to put Medicaid on a sustainable path while  we grow the expenditures to Medicaid each year, over a 10-year period,  by $71 billion.   So those who say we are somehow gutting Medicaid or we are cutting  Medicaid, I think, they simply have to deal with those facts. I haven't  heard a satisfactory explanation for how you can conclude that somehow  we are gutting Medicaid or cutting it when we are actually making it  sustainable in the long run.   Throughout this process, what I have learned is, Senators have a lot  of different ideas. Everybody has come to the table to try to help make  this better. I would say, unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have  chosen not to participate in the process. This would be a lot easier-- and the product we come up with would be a lot more durable over the  long haul--if, in fact, Democrats would work with us.   The fact is, in this amendment process we are engaged in, and will be  engaged in this evening, any Senator, Democrat or Republican, majority,  minority party Member, can offer an amendment and get a vote on it. So  I don't really understand why our Democratic colleagues are sitting on  their hands and will not participate in the process.   I fear what they want is to change nothing about the structure of  ObamaCare, notwithstanding the failed experiment of the last 7 years.  Then what they want to do is come back and throw money at the insurance  companies under these cost-sharing risk pools. We are willing to do  what we need to do to stabilize the insurance market, but I am not  going to vote for an insurance company bailout without reform.   Leader McConnell reiterated yesterday that our constituents are  counting on us. I can tell you, the 28 million Texans I have the great  privilege of representing are counting on me and Senator Cruz to do our  part to come up with a solution. The Texan whose premiums have tripled  and lost his doctor is counting on us. The ER employee who witnessed  the emergency room busting at the seams with Medicaid patients--people  who ostensibly have coverage under Medicaid but who can't find a doctor  who will accept a new Medicaid patient so they end up going to the  emergency room--is counting on us. The small business owner who was  forced to fire employees to avoid a $100,000 fine, that person is  counting on us too. The young woman coming out of nursing school who  was forced to change her plan three times, only to end up with a plan  with coverage options she didn't want, at a price she could barely  afford, she is counting on us too.   My constituents in Texas and Americans across the country are  counting on us. They are sick and tired of the bickering and the lack  of productivity here in Washington, DC, and I don't blame them one  bit. They are counting on us to free them from some of ObamaCare's  mandates that force them to make very tough economic decisions, like  the 28 million people under ObamaCare who either pay a fine--about 6.5  million of them--or, the rest,  [[Page S4371]]  who claim hardship exemptions so they don't have to buy insurance. But  in Texas alone, there are more than 400,000 Texans who earn less than  $25,000 a year who can't afford to buy the insurance. So they pay the  fine to the government. So their government fines them for not buying a  product they can't afford.    So now is the time to deliver some relief to our constituents. They  are counting on us to keep the deeply personal choice of healthcare  plans and doctors in their hands and not the Federal Government's. So  it is time to deliver, and my goal is to make sure we find a solution  and get it to the President's desk.   One of the most offensive parts of the Affordable Care Act--or we  should have called it the un-Affordable Care Act, since premiums have  gone up 105 percent since 2013 alone--is that people who were told a  family of four would see a reduction of $2,500 a year in their premiums  have seen their premiums go up by more than $3,000. There are a lot of  stories--I am sure even here in this room, in this Chamber--where  people simply have seen their premiums go up, up, and up along with  their deductibles, basically denying them the benefit of their  insurance. But the individual mandate is a prime example of government  getting in the way of individual freedom and the right to choose.   The so-called individual mandate--we really should call this the  penalty that government imposes on its citizens for failing to purchase  a product they don't want and, in some cases, don't even need--forces  them to do so at a cost that was crippling and continues to be  crippling for many individuals and families.   Here is a shocking statistic. An estimated 8 million Americans pay  the fine associated with this mandate each year. Eight million  Americans are penalized by their own government, forced to pay a fine  that could be used on coverage that might actually suit their needs. If  ObamaCare would make it possible that the market could prosper and  insurance companies offered a variety of products at different prices  that people could choose from, maybe some of these folks could take the  money they are paying their own government as a penalty and actually  buy insurance coverage.   Then there is the employer mandate. This is one of the most  pernicious of the mandates. I remember sitting with a friend of mine,  who happens to own a small architectural firm in San Antonio, back when  ObamaCare passed, and I explained to him: If you have more than 50  employees, then you are going to have to buy or provide ObamaCare- compliant healthcare for your employees.   He said: Well, I may have to lay off some people because we have 54  employees. So I am going to have to fire at least four of them to get  below that 50-person threshold so I can avoid the fine and the  insurance that I can't afford to provide for my employees.   So this has literally been a job-killing employer mandate. This is  not some benign or innocuous requirement. This has been one of the  reasons why the economy has been so anemic even since the great  recession of 2008, and this is the reason why so many people feel like  the economy has not really recovered, because it hasn't provided them  job opportunities and larger wages. So this mandate has stifled  business growth, to be sure, especially among small businesses, which  are the primary job engine of our economy. Oftentimes jobs were cut in  order to avoid bankrupting the business through ObamaCare fines.   So Americans have been forced by their own government, no less-- government is supposed to serve the people, not the other way around-- to live under mandates, taxes, broken promises, and collapsing markets  for too long. So this week is about keeping our promises, demonstrating  that we can govern, even, unfortunately, without the assistance of our  Democratic colleagues, and paving the way to tackle other important  issues, like tax reform, infrastructure construction--things we need to  do to keep the economy growing and moving forward.   So we will be hearing more about a possible solution and a way  forward, something I call ``the freedom to choose'' plan, where we free  the American people from the destructive impact of this so-called  individual mandate, where we free small employers from the employer  mandate, letting them hire the employees they need and not having to  choose between that and bankruptcy.   And, yes, we are going to push more power out of Washington, DC, and  back to the States. I know, based on the public opinion polling I have  seen, that people sure trust their States a lot more than they trust  Washington, DC, when it comes to healthcare. So we are going to provide  the flexibility and tools that the States, the Governors, and the  legislators need, as well as the insurance commissioners, to come up  with a viable market using resources we are going to provide to them.   It would be better if we could all come together to find a solution  to engage in debate--Republicans and Democrats alike--and pass a final  product and get it to the President's desk. That is, actually, how the  legislature is supposed to function. But unfortunately we are in  unusual times, when almost half of the Senate refuses to participate.  Actually, they will be actively trying to undermine our efforts to come  to the rescue of the people that are hurting as a result of the  deception and the failures of ObamaCare. I don't know how you explain  that. You certainly can't explain it to constituents like I have. I bet  you a dollar that every single one of the Senators here who is trying  to blow up this process and undermine the progress we are making has  constituents back home who are suffering the same way my constituents  are, but they are turning a deaf ear to them and saying: You know what,  politics and party and ideology are more important to me than actually  addressing the needs of my constituents. That is what their actions are  effectively saying, and it is a shame.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I think it  is only fair that each side gets 5 minutes to speak. Everybody is ready  to vote. We had 2 hours of debate. So I would ask to amend the  unanimous consent request that each side be given 5 minutes to close,  divided up any way you want.   I ask unanimous consent that each side be given 5 minutes to speak.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, it is important to remember how we got  here. I still remember voting on the Affordable Care Act at 7:30 in the  morning on Christmas Eve. Because this bill--the 2,700-page bill that  our Democratic friends did not read and which Ms. Pelosi said we have  to pass it before we know what is in it--that bill was passed on a  party-line vote and signed into law by President Obama without any  participation of Republicans. So it is a little hard on the ears to  hear my friend, the Democratic leader, plead for bipartisan solutions  now.   I agree with him, it is not too late because this is an open  amendment process. Our Democratic friends, rather than trying to kill  the bill, can help us make this bill better.   I suspect that based on their comments, that they really need--we  need to have some sort of remedial legislation 101 because this is not  the end of the process. But in order for the House and the Senate to  work together to come up with a bill we both agree to, there is a  conference committee, which Members of both parties can appoint Members  to the conference committee to work out differences. I don't believe my  friend, the Democratic leader, is really interested in working on a  bipartisan basis to fix the structural defects in ObamaCare.   We know the individual market is in meltdown. Premiums are  skyrocketing, contrary to the promises made by the President when the  bill was sold. We know deductibles are so high that people are  basically denied the benefit of their coverage and, yes, insurance  companies are fleeing because they are bleeding red ink, and they can't  economically sell insurance on the exchanges anymore.   So we all know something needs to be done, but we are not interested  in just throwing more money at insurance companies, bailing out  insurance companies, which is what I have heard from our friends on the  other side. Well, it is not true. It is not the only thing we have  heard. We have also heard the Senator from Vermont, for example,  advocate for a single-payer system.   What this bill does do is it repeals the individual mandate, which to  us is an unacceptable government coercion of American citizens forcing  them to buy a product they don't want and they can't afford, because  currently 28 million people are uninsured under ObamaCare. I thought it  was supposed to provide coverage for everybody, but in my State, about  450,000 Texans who earn less than $25,000 a year are paying the penalty  because they can't afford the insurance, so they pay the penalty, and  it is not working.   We are doing everything we can, given the fact that our friends on  the other side of the aisle are simply sitting on their hands and not  participating in the process, other than to try to undermine it.   We intend to pass a bill and go to conference with the House to make  this bill better because our goal is to stabilize the markets, to bring  down premiums, to protect people with preexisting conditions, and to  put Medicaid, the safety net for low-income Americans, on a sustainable  path. You would think those would be things that our colleagues across  the aisle would want to join us in and participate in but apparently  not.   We need to move on. We can't let the fact that our Democratic friends  are unwilling to participate keep us from doing our duty the best we  can under the circumstances, and that is what this bill represents. It  is not perfect,  [[Page S4415]]  but it is better than the status quo, and we intend to do our duty.   Mr. President, I yield back.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1664         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
