 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the $1.2  trillion bipartisan infrastructure law which was signed into law by  President Joseph Biden on this historic day last year.   The bipartisan infrastructure law is undeniably the largest long-term  investment in U.S. infrastructure in almost 100 years, in almost a  century. As we all know, our great economy relies on an immense  infrastructure of roads and bridges, freight rails and ports,  electrical grids, access to high-speed internet, and on and on.   Yet, many of the current systems in place were built decades ago and  needed to be enhanced to guarantee our Nation's optimal economic  performance.  [[Page H8498]]    That is why, when passing the bipartisan infrastructure law, we knew,  as President Biden said, ``We could grow the economy, enhance our  competitiveness, create good jobs, and make our economy more  sustainable, just, and resilient.''   Mr. Speaker, I believe we have done that. As I explained to many of  my colleagues last year, the Infrastructure of my home in the U.S.  Virgin Islands has suffered extremely from systematic lack of  investment. Our infrastructure issues were further exacerbated by the  2017 Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which were both Category 5 hurricanes.    When you hear that 1 in 5 miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our  highways and major roads, and 45,000 bridges across the United States  are in poor condition, think about what that looks like on a hurricane- prone island where residents may rely on a single road for passage of  crucial resources and emergency services vehicles.   As Americans, the residents of the Virgin Islands needed us, as  Congress, to step up. By passing the bipartisan infrastructure plan, we  answered the call for all Americans.   To date, the Virgin Islands has been allocated $18.4 million, of an  expected $96 million, to rebuild and strengthen our roads and bridges.  In addition, over 1,600 households in the U.S. Virgin Islands have  already enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, which aims to  provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. That is  about 43 percent of the total households on the island of St. John  alone who now have access to high-speed internet.   Turning to the island's power supply, we now have much-needed capital  to weatherize our power lines, which will prevent outages and make the  power grid more resilient. Put differently, we are now better equipped  to save lives.   In addition to these historic investments, I would like to highlight  the announcement of two key projects:   First, under our Watershed Project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  will invest $51.7 million to reduce flood risk and damage to the Savan  Gut area in our capital, Charlotte Amalie. The area is within the 100- year old flood plain and has recurring flooding problems primarily in  the central business district and local elementary school. Therefore,  as I am sure you can tell, the completion of this project is vital to  protecting the future of our children, schools, and local businesses.   Second, in our Airport Project, the Department of Transportation has  awarded nearly $4 million to Cyril E. King Airport to support its  modernization and improve safety.   There are so many projects that all Americans are guaranteed because  of the work of these House Democrats, along with our President, who  have put the people of America forward in ensuring that infrastructure  will meet the needs of a future America.   So, today, as we celebrate the many successes of the infrastructure  plan, creating good-paying jobs, union jobs, helping fight climate  change, advancing environmental justice, boosting domestic  manufacturing, strengthening critical links in our supply chains, and  ultimately lowering the cost of living for working families, I would  like to challenge and encourage all of us to continue to work together  to address the challenges of the American people, this country, and our  world. Together, we can make a difference.                            ____________________
