 Madam Chair, the President should be sending the  Red Cross to the border, not the United States military.   I stand today with many of my colleagues to ensure that our  government is not misusing funds, resources, and personnel that  Congress has provided. We have seen again and again how this  administration manipulates the law, congressional intent, and allocated  funding in order to impede the immigration process and play with  people's lives.   There is no reason for the administration to force the Department of  Defense to advance his anti-immigrant agenda and use our valuable  troops to conduct immigration enforcement duties. These are young  children and women who are fleeing desperate situations, and they  should be treated for what they are, folks seeking asylum at the U.S.- Mexico border who are lawfully petitioning for asylum in the United  States.   We don't need the military there. We need the Red Cross.
