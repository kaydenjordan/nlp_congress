 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work on this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3053,  the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. Spent nuclear fuel currently  sits in 121 communities across 39 States, simply because we lack a  permanent geological repository to dispose of the waste. That is why I  am proud to join my colleagues as a cosponsor of H.R. 3053, which would  enact critical reforms to our nuclear waste management strategy.   Back home, in Georgia's 12th, we are leading the way in the expansion  of our Nation's nuclear energy resources. My district is the proud home  of every nuclear reactor in the State, with an additional two reactors  under construction at Plant Vogtle. Nuclear energy is Georgia's most  reliable power source and provides over 6,000 high-skilled jobs, many  of which are filled by my constituents in Georgia's 12th. But without a  permanent solution, nuclear waste remains on those sites.   Now is the time for Congress to act on fulfilling our obligation to  dispose of the spent nuclear fuel sitting in our States. I thank the  Energy and Commerce Committee for passing this important legislation,  and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  bill.
