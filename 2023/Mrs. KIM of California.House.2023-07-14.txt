 Mr. Speaker, July 16 marks one year of the  988 hotline. This nationwide number is available 24/7 to provide  confidential support to Americans facing mental health, substance use,  and suicide crises.   Nearly 5 million Americans have called 988 in the last year to talk  to someone about an issue they face. As we celebrate this progress, we  acknowledge there is more to be done. A recent poll by the National  Alliance on Mental Illness found that only 17 percent of Americans are  aware of 988. That means more than four in every five Americans are  unaware of this resource at our fingertips.   No one should feel alone. Whether it is strangers, friends, and foes  alike, we never know what someone is going through.   I am proud to support the 988 hotline that can be a lifeline for  those struggling. I will also do my part to promote kinder communities  in California's 40th district and across the Nation.                            ____________________
