 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dave  Raak from Hospers, Iowa.   Dave recently passed away from a long and courageous battle with a  rare organ condition.   Dave dedicated his life to serving his community. His great- grandfather started Hospers Telephone Company in the early 1900s. Dave  eventually took over the company from his dad and worked tirelessly to  ensure that rural communities served by HTC Communications had quality  telecommunication services.   Dave was instrumental in building a fiber network in the 1990s across  Iowa which now serves as the backbone of our economy by connecting  rural Iowa to the world.   Dave also leaves behind his wife of 54 years, Arlene; and their  children; Ruth, Rachel, and Paul; along with their many grandchildren.   Dave was truly a family man.   Please join me in praying for his loved ones as they say goodbye.                            ____________________
