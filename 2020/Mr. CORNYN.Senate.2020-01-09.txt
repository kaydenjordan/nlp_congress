 Mr. President, it has now been more than 3 weeks since  the House passed two Articles of Impeachment against the President of  the United States. It was a big day for them at the time and one they  have been dreaming of and speaking of since the President was  inaugurated nearly 3 years ago.   For as long as the House Democrats have been wanting to impeach the  President, they spent only a short time on the impeachment inquiry  itself. As a matter of fact, they rushed headlong into the impeachment  process, and now they are trying to make up for the mistakes that  Chairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi made when proceeding in the first  place.   For example, now they want to relitigate things like executive  privilege and whether the testimony of other witnesses should be  included in the Senate impeachment trial. In other words, the House  wants to tell the Senate how to conduct the trial.   Well, the House had its job to do--and, frankly, I think mishandled  it--but now they have no say in the way the Senate conducts the  impeachment trial, when and if Speaker Pelosi decides to send the  articles over here. Twelve weeks was all it took for House Democrats to  come up with what they believed was enough evidence to warrant a vote  on Articles of Impeachment. I think they are experiencing some buyers'  remorse. During that 12 weeks, we repeatedly heard House Democrats say  how urgent the matter was, seemingly using urgency as an excuse for the  slapdash investigation that they did and that they now regret. When the  House concluded their rushed investigation and passed two Articles of  Impeachment, we expected those articles to be sent to the Senate  promptly.   This will be only the third time in American history where the Senate  has actually convened a trial on Articles of Impeachment, so this is  kind of a new, novel process for most of us here in the Senate. I think  there are only 15 Senators who were here during the last impeachment  trial of President Bill Clinton. Most of us are trying to get up to  speed and figure out how to discharge our duty under the Constitution  as a jury that will decide whether to convict or acquit and, if  convicted, whether the President should be removed. This is serious.   Here we are, about 11 months before the next general election. It  strikes me as a serious matter to ask 535 Members of the U.S. Congress  to remove a President who was voted into office with about 63 million  votes. This is very serious.   Well, despite the House leadership and Members stating time and again  before the Christmas holidays how pressing the matter of impeachment  was, there hasn't been an inch of movement in the House since those  Articles of Impeachment were voted on. Here we are, more than 3 weeks  later, and Speaker Pelosi is still playing her cat-and-mouse game with  these Articles of Impeachment.   Last night, the Speaker appeared to have dug in her heels even deeper  when she sent a letter to our Democratic colleagues about the delay.  Following the majority leader's announcement that every Republican  Senator supports using exactly the same framework that was used during  the Clinton impeachment trial, the Speaker, as you might imagine, was  not particularly happy because her gambit obviously didn't work. She  has zero leverage and zero right to try to dictate to the Senate how we  conduct the Senate trial, just as we had zero leverage and zero input  into how the House conducted its responsibilities.   Speaker Pelosi told her caucus that the process is both unfair and  ``designed to deprive Senators and the American people of crucial  documents and testimony.'' Clearly, she doesn't think those documents  and testimony were crucial enough to be included in the House  investigation in the first place, but I digress.   The Speaker is trying to make the most out of a very bad situation of  her own creation and intentionally trying to mislead the American  people into thinking this framework prevents any witnesses from  testifying, which is a false impression. It is demonstrably false.  These are the same parameters that guided the Clinton impeachment  process, during which witnesses were presented by deposition, giving  sworn testimony that was then presented by the parties.   In 1999, 100 Senators agreed to this model. You would think if this  was fair enough for President Clinton, it would be fair enough for  President Trump. To apply a different standard would be just that--a  double standard.   All 100 Senators agreed during the Clinton impeachment trial to allow  the impeachment managers to present their case, to allow the  President's lawyers to present their case, and then to permit the  Senators to ask questions through the Chief Justice and to get  additional information, and then--and only then--decide whether  additional witnesses would be required.   Under the Clinton model, and now under the model that will be used-- the Clinton model that we will be using in the Trump impeachment  trial--if Members felt like they needed more information, they could  vote to hear from additional witnesses. That opportunity is still  available to them under the Clinton precedent that will be applied in  the Trump impeachment trial. That is exactly what happened in the  Clinton impeachment trial. After the arguments and evidence were  presented, Senators voted to hear from three additional witnesses who  were then deposed and whose sworn testimony was then offered.   You know, it makes me a little crazy when people say that this is a  question  [[Page S105]]  of witnesses or no witnesses. There were about 17 witnesses, as I count  them, who testified in the House impeachment inquiry. All of that  evidence, such as it is, is available to the impeachment managers to  offer here in the Senate. If, in fact, the Senate decides to do as the  Senate did in the Clinton impeachment, authorize subpoenas for three  additional witnesses or more, that still is the Senate's prerogative,  which is not foreclosed in the least by this resolution.    Well, the Intelligence Committee alone held 7 public hearings with 12  witnesses that totaled more than 30 hours. Presumably, they are proud  of the product--the evidence--that was produced during the course of  those hearings or else they wouldn't have conducted them in the first  place. This isn't a matter of witnesses or no witnesses, as some of our  Democratic colleagues and the media attempts to characterize it; this  is a matter of letting the parties to the impeachment decide how to try  their case.   I had the great honor, over a period of 13 years, to serve as a State  court judge. I presided over hundreds of jury trials during the course  of my experience as a district judge. Never have I seen a model where  the jury decides how to try the case. The jury sits there and listens  to the evidence presented by the parties, and that is exactly what we  are proposing here. So this idea of letting Senators decide how to try  the impeachment managers' case or the President's case is something  totally novel and unheard of.   Setting the rules on whom we hear from, when, and how--as the Speaker  wants to do--on the front end makes no sense. Let me try an analogy. It  would be like asking an NFL coach to outline every play in the Super  Bowl--in order--before the game actually starts. Well, that is not  possible. Having this discussion over Speaker Pelosi's demands on  witnesses completely ignores the fact that this is simply not her  prerogative.   Now, I know the Speaker is a powerful political figure. She rules the  House with an iron fist, but her views simply have no weight  whatsoever, in terms of how the Senate conducts its business, including  an impeachment trial under the Constitution.   This has all been diversion and, frankly, a lot of dissembling and  misleading arguments about things that just simply aren't true. The  Constitution outlines a bicameral impeachment process, with each  Chamber having its separate and independent responsibilities.   As I said, just as the Constitution gives the House ``the sole power  of impeachment''--that is a quote from the Constitution--it also gives  the Senate ``the sole power to try all impeachments.'' Nowhere is found  a clause granting the Speaker of the House of Representatives supreme  authority to decide this process. Yes, she has been very influential  leading up to the vote of the Articles of Impeachment, over which the  Senate had no voice and no vote. Now her job is done, such as it is,  but for sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.   Speaker Pelosi's refusal to transmit the articles unless her demands  are met is a violation of the separation of powers, and it is an  unprecedented power grab. I must say, I have some sympathy with the  Speaker's position. Last March, she said that impeachment was a bad  idea because it was so divisive, and unless the evidence was compelling  and the support for the Articles of Impeachment was bipartisan, it  wasn't worth it. Well, that was in March of 2019. Obviously, things  changed, and the best I can tell is she was essentially forced by the  radical Members of the House Democratic Caucus to change her position,  and now she finds herself in an embarrassingly untenable and  unsustainable position. This isn't entirely her fault.   While she has been playing games, though, with the Articles of  Impeachment, she has been infringing, I believe, on the President's  constitutional right to due process of law. Due process is based on the  fundamental notions of fairness. That is what we accord everybody in a  civil or criminal proceeding--due process of law. The Sixth Amendment,  for example, guarantees the right to a speedy trial for every American,  and it doesn't exempt certain cases no matter how high- or low-profile  they may be. Now, while the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial may  not, strictly speaking, apply to an impeachment trial because this  isn't a civil or criminal case, the whole fundamental notion of  fairness does apply: a right to a speedy trial.   It is clear that while Speaker Pelosi dangles these Articles of  Impeachment over the President like a sword of Damocles, this is not  fair to the President. It is not fair to the Senate. It is not fair,  most importantly, to the American people. This distraction--this  impeachment mania--has consumed so much oxygen and attention here in  Washington, DC, that it has prevented us from doing other things we  know we can and should be doing that would benefit the American people.   I came here on two occasions to offer a piece of bipartisan  legislation that would lower out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs  by eliminating some of the gamesmanship in the patent system, only to  find--even though it is a bipartisan bill, voted unanimously out of the  Judiciary Committee--that the only person who objected to us taking it  up and passing it was the Democratic minority leader. Those are the  sort of games that, unfortunately, give Washington and Congress a bad  name and a bad reputation.   I must say this is not just this side of the aisle that thinks the  time is up for Speaker Pelosi to send the Articles of Impeachment over  here. There is bipartisan agreement here in the Senate that it is time  to fish or cut bait.   Speaker Pelosi's California colleague, our friend, Senator Feinstein  from California, said:         If we're going to do it, she should send them over. I don't       see what good delay does.    Well, good for Senator Feinstein.   Our friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, said:         We are reaching a point where the articles of impeachment       should be sent.    Senator Murphy, his colleague from Connecticut, said:         I think the time has passed. She should send the articles       over.    I think we all share the sentiment expressed by Senator Angus King  from Maine. He said:         I do think we need to get this thing going.    He has a gift for understatement.   It is high time for the Speaker to quit using these Articles of  Impeachment as a way to pander to the most radical fringes of her  party. The Members of the House have completed their constitutional  role. They launched their inquiry. They did their investigation, such  as it was, and they held a partisan vote. That is their prerogative. I  don't agree with it, but that is their prerogative, and they have done  it. The Speaker should send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate  without further delay so we can perform our responsibilities under the  Constitution in a trial.   I yield the floor.
