 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on S.  2093. S. 2093 is the new S. 1. It is the latest version of the so- called For the People Act, which is a massive, massive Federal takeover  of election law.   So why are we taking up a massive Federal takeover of election law?  Well, that is a good question. Two years ago, Democrats told us that we  needed to pass this law because our electoral system was broken. Well,  then came 2020. We had a record voter turnout, the largest voter  turnout since the election of 1900, the largest turnout in 120 years in  American history. And Democrats won the White House.   After that, it got a little awkward to complain that our electoral  system was broken. So Democrats found a new argument. Now, we have to  pass this legislation to stop States from taking away voting rights.  According to Democrats, States' moves to update or clarify their  election laws in the wake of pandemic challenges and vote-counting  confusion are really plots to restrict voter access.   Of course, so far, most 2021 State election law updates have proved  to be both standard and mainstream, but that hasn't stopped Democrats  who have, at times, resorted to outright lies in their efforts to  persuade Americans  [[Page S4665]]  that we are facing a voting rights crisis.   After all, Democrats need to give some reason for why we should allow  the Federal Government to take over our entire electoral system. And  Democrats' real reason--because they think S. 1 will give them an  advantage in future elections--is not really one that they can use to  sell the bill, although Speaker Pelosi did admit on national television  that she thought S. 1 would boost Democrats' electoral chances.   The question is where to start when it comes to the bill's content.  As I said, like the original S. 1, the new S. 1 is an unprecedented  Federal takeover of elections. Historically, running elections has  largely been a matter for States, which tailor election laws to the  particular needs of their cities and communities.   S. 1 would impose one-size-fits-all, Federal regulations on  elections--in many cases, deeply problematic regulations. S. 1 would  require States to allow unlimited ballot harvesting, which is the  controversial practice of allowing political operatives and others to  pick up and deliver ballots, with all of the possibilities for fraud  that that creates.   It would gut State voter ID laws--laws which, I would point out, are  supported by a strong majority of the American people. A recent poll  said 80 percent of Americans support voter ID laws. It would remove  legal penalties for registering individuals who are here illegally--and  so much more.   But the new S. 1, like the old S. 1, goes way beyond undermining the  security of our elections and increasing the likelihood of voter fraud.  It would implement public funding of political campaigns, which would  mean that government dollars, money that belongs to the American  taxpayer, would go to funding yard signs and attack ads. Sitting  Senators alone could qualify for more than $1.8 billion in public  funding. And that doesn't count their challengers.   Yes, with a record high debt, Democrats apparently think that  dropping a couple billion dollars here and there on attack ads and  partisan rallies is a good use of taxpayer dollars.   And from there, believe it or not, the ideas only get worse. S. 1  would permanently undermine confidence in our electoral system by  turning the Federal Election Commission, the primary enforcer of  election law in this country, into a partisan body. That is right. The  Democrats' bill would turn the primary enforcer of election law in this  country into a partisan body. Now, I am interested to hear how this is  supposed to enhance voter confidence in our electoral system. Every  single FEC ruling would be suspect.   And on top of all this, S. 1 makes a concerted attack on freedom of  speech. It would impose onerous requirements and restrictions on  political speech. It would open up private Americans to retaliation and  intimidation simply for making a donation to support a cause they  believe in. And it would allow the IRS to consider organizations'  beliefs when deciding whether or not to grant them tax-exempt status.   In fact, the ACLU--the American Civil Liberties Union--actually  opposed the House's version of S. 1 in the last Congress because the  bill would ``unconstitutionally burden speech and associational  rights.'' That is right. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the  legislation because the bill would ``unconstitutionally burden speech  and associational rights.''   As hard as it is to believe when you look at the bill's provisions,  S. 1 was billed as an election integrity bill. In fact, this  legislation would undermine election integrity, making our elections  less secure and more susceptible to fraud. And it would undermine voter  confidence in our elections.    The partisan divide in this country has reached new heights, and  voters on both sides have lost confidence in our electoral process. Any  election legislation that we take up should be focused on building  voter confidence in the fairness of our electoral system, not  undermining it.   Do my Democratic colleagues seriously believe--seriously believe-- that S. 1 would do anything to increase voter confidence in the  unbiased character of our electoral system? Do they seriously believe  that their bill looks like a nonpartisan attempt to protect American  elections? They can't possibly.   From the newly partisan FEC to an IRS empowered to reject tax-exempt  status for organizations whose beliefs it doesn't like, S. 1 is very  clearly a bill designed purely and simply to enhance political power-- the political power, Democrats hope, of the Democratic Party. It is the  very opposite of a nonpartisan reform bill.   And I have to ask my Democratic colleagues, do you really want an  electoral system that is perceived as partisan and which half the  country doesn't trust? Haven't we seen the consequences of that? Are  you really prepared to sacrifice voter confidence in our electoral  system just so you can win elections?   Later this afternoon, we will vote on S. 1. And I fully expect that  this legislation will be blocked, and it should be. The Senate's rules,  which require the agreement of 60 Senators to move forward to consider  legislation, were designed--designed--for times just like these, times  when a narrow partisan majority attempts to shove through partisan  legislation, times when a partisan majority attacks the freedoms that  our government exists to protect.   The Senate was established to act as a monitoring body and check  attempts to ride roughshod over minority rights or to curtail our  rights and our liberties. And today the Senate will fulfill that role  and prevent this dangerous, partisan takeover of our electoral system  from moving forward.   To elaborate on that point for just a moment, when I asked the  question earlier on about why would you bring this bill to the floor-- it is a good question, I think, knowing full well that it is going to  fail, and should fail later today, but why would you bring it to the  floor? Well, allegedly, the reason to bring it to the floor was to  provide pressures on certain Democratic Members that this is the reason  that they need to vote to do away with the legislative filibuster,  which is something that has been part of the Senate going back to our  Founding Fathers. In fact, the very reason the Founding Fathers created  the U.S. Senate was a check and balance against majoritarian rule and  running roughshod over the rights of the minority here in the U.S.  Senate. And the legislative filibuster has ensured and provided that  protection, so much so that it was used extensively in the last 6  years, when Republicans were in control of the Senate, by the Democrats  to filibuster legislation. In fact, it was used to filibuster  coronavirus relief bills. It was used to filibuster police reform  bills. It was used over and over to block the former President's  nominees. And yet, now, we are being told that the Senate needs to get  rid of the legislative filibuster and that all those Democrats, all  those on the other side of the aisle who used it extensively to block  Republican legislation over the past 6 years, now believe that we need  to get rid of this legislative filibuster and that this bill is example  No. 1 for why that is necessary.   Well, it is really ironic and interesting to hear Members on the  other side make that argument, given where they were a couple of years  ago. It was just a couple of years ago--maybe 3 years ago--that 33  Democratic Senators signed a letter--a letter--to the Republican leader  at the time, Senator McConnell, saying that we need to preserve the  filibuster, the legislative filibuster, in the Senate because it is so  crucial to the essence of the Senate and the protections that it  provides for the rights of the minority here in the U.S. Senate.  Thirty-three Democrats, many of whom are still serving in this body,  adopted that position.   And, in fact, the Democratic whip, my counterpart on the Democratic  side, said, a couple of years ago on a morning show:         I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it       was originally devised and created going back to our Founding       Fathers. We have to acknowledge our respect for the minority,       and that is what the Senate tries to do in its composition       and in its procedure.    ``I can tell you,'' he said, the Democratic whip, the Senator from  Illinois, ``that it would be the end of the Senate as it was originally  devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers.'' In other  words, we need to preserve the filibuster to preserve our democracy. It  is essential. That was the view as recently as a couple of years ago.  And now, now, we have to get rid of the filibuster to preserve our  democracy 2  [[Page S4666]]  years later. The filibuster, the legislative filibuster, which in  various forms has served our Republic now for over two centuries. It  has been a part of the U.S. Senate checks and balances that the  Founders envisioned for this country.   And yet here we are bringing a bill to the floor for no other purpose  than to have a show vote to try and pressure certain Democratic  Senators who, rightfully, are defending the legislative filibuster as  an essential element of protecting the rights of the minority in the  Senate, of requiring cooperation and collaboration and bringing people  together on legislation. Solutions in the Senate, historically--and I  was a staffer here back in the 1980s. That is how long my tenure, at  least as a staffer and now subsequently as a Member, goes back. But the  Senate is a place where solutions tend to be found in the middle  because that is required. It is required that there be 60 votes to move  consequential legislation. And as a result of that, Members on both  sides have to come together. If you want to pass big things in the  Senate, you have to figure out a way to get 60 votes. And right now  that would require--in the Senate, if you had every Democrat, 50  Democrats, you would have to get 10 Republicans. As was the case when  we had the majority in the Senate, we had to get seven Democrats to do  anything. And so, in order to even move essential legislation like the  coronavirus bill, we had to reach out to the other side. And it forced  that compromise, that collaboration, that willingness to come together  and work in a bipartisan way on solutions that are durable, that are  durable for this country.    It is really interesting in this Washington Post op-ed by Senator  Sinema, where she points out--makes that very point that if you can do  something at 51 votes today, and one side blows up the rules in the  Senate, that when the majority changes--and it always does in the  Senate, and she points out that sometimes when you get in the majority,  you think you will be there forever. Well, I have been here long enough  to have been in the majority and the minority and in the majority and  the minority again. It goes back and forth.   So what are you going to do then the next time the Senate majority  flips and all those things that the other side thinks are awful, awful  ideas that the Republicans have, and they would love to be able to  block them or at least force Republicans to come to the table and  negotiate a solution that would require some bipartisan participation  to get to 60 votes--what are you going to do then, where we have 51  votes when one side gets the majority and 50 votes and we go back and  forth and we have this policy, this kind of policy roller coaster that  provides no certainty, no predictability, and certainly gets away from  the checks and balances that the Founders intended?   The filibuster--the legislative filibuster, the rules of the Senate,  the procedures of the Senate, are designed to protect and preserve  democracy not to undermine it. What undermines it are cynical attempts  to try and use a piece of legislation that the leadership on the other  side knows is going nowhere and bring it to the floor for a show vote  to put pressure--to put pressure--on Senate Democrats, who, as I said,  rightfully, are defending that very procedure, which has worked so well  to their advantage for the past 6 years.   And now we are told the reason they have to change it is because  Republicans are being so--we are not cooperating. We are not--you know,  we are sticks in the mud. We are stopping and blocking things.   We haven't even been in the minority now for 6 months. We spent the  last 6 years in the majority, as the other side extensively--and I  emphasize ``extensively'' because any study of the data would suggest  that--to block Republican initiatives, to force Republicans to come  together to find 60 votes. That was their position and posture for the  past 6 years, including 33 Democratic Senators who, as recently as 3  years ago, sent a letter to the Republican leader, saying that we have  got to protect the legislative filibuster--statements like the one made  by the Senator from Illinois that doing away with the filibuster would  end the Senate as it was originally devised and created, going back to  our Founding Fathers.   One of the essential elements of this Republic constitutionally was  the need for checks and balances. And the bicameral creation of the  Founding Fathers, the House, which is based upon the majority, 2-year  terms, designed to reflect the will of the of people, the balance and  check that was created against that was the U.S. Senate, with 6-year  terms, where you have procedures and rules that make it more difficult  and challenging, that force this place to be more deliberative, to be  more compromising, to consult and work together.   And so what we are doing today, you are going to get up, and my  colleagues on the other side are going to talk about how critical it is  that we do this because all these States are enacting these terrible,  terrible election reforms. And as I said earlier, most of which, at  least from what I have seen, are very mainstream and consistent with  what the Founders designed in our Constitution, and that is for States  to have principal primacy when it comes to controlling and regulating  elections in this country. But as I said, it was argued 2 years ago, 3  years ago, in 2019, when this bill was introduced, that it needed to be  introduced because we have got to do something to increase  participation in our elections; that we really need to encourage people  to be more active in our elections; that we have got to get people to  vote, which they did, in record numbers--the biggest turnout since  1900, biggest voter participation in the 2020 election literally in 120  years in American history.   So now they introduced a bill this year, and the stated reason is, we  have to do this to stop all these States that are adopting these  legislative solutions that are going to make it more difficult for  people to vote. Well, all I can say is, the rationale for what we are  doing today changes depending on the year, depending on the election,  but the goal is the same, and that is to create a permanent political  advantage for one party--that is all this is about--and to persuade and  pressure certain Democratic Senators to do away with one of the  fundamental elements of the U.S. Senate in the form of a legislative  filibuster.   I hope this vote will make at least some Democrats think twice about  the wisdom of permanently politicizing our electoral system and that it  will encourage them to make sure that any future election reform  proposals are genuinely bipartisan in nature.   Unfortunately, I think it is more likely that Democrats are going to  use this vote to argue for destroying the Senate's longstanding  protections for minority rights. But today--today, at least, the Senate  will fulfill its constitutional mandate and act as a check on this  attempt to undermine our basic freedoms.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
