 Mr. Speaker, too many Americans feel that Washington  is out of touch with their priorities. They feel that too few people  have too much influence. Americans want the culture of corruption  cultivated by rich lobbyists and massive corporations to end.   Look no further than Big Pharma, the pharmaceutical companies. Since  1998, they have spent $4 billion in lobbying and campaign  contributions. They employ 1,400 lobbyists, three lobbyists for every  Member. No wonder the system seems rigged against commonsense solutions  to lower drug prices.   Americans are getting a raw deal when big money controls politics.  Democrats offer A Better Deal for our democracy: a bold, comprehensive  program to bolster our Nation's ethics laws, overhaul our campaign  finance system, and create more transparency and accessibility.   Americans deserve a government that works for them. They deserve A  Better Deal.   I want to acknowledge Mimi Quin, with me today as part of Foster  Youth Shadow Day.                            ____________________
