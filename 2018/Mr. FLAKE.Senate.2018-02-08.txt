 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the massive  spending increases included in the proposed budget measure. To propose  increasing Federal spending by nearly $300 billion over the next 2  years, on top of the spending increases already established, is simply  beyond comprehension. This is all with a national debt of $20 trillion  a year, and the current deficit is running $600 billion to $700  billion. Yet we are about to vote on a bill to abandon self-imposed  limits on Federal spending. As anybody who has spent time in Washington  will know, once you raise spending limits, you just don't get them back  down.   I love bipartisanship, but not when it is bought and paid for with  billions of taxpayer dollars. That is precisely what this measure does.  If you sprinkle enough money around, you can get bipartisan support.   While I was in the House for 12 years, I kept a journal of events. In  December of 2007, when we passed a massive omnibus bill, at that time,  I noted in my journal:         The Democrats singled out the funding for the Iraq war,       which required a separate vote. The tally board on the House       chamber wall explaining the vote said the following:       ``Agreeing to House amendment to Senate amendment to House       amendment.''    I said at that time:         That clears it up. But that's the point. Liberal Democrats       could vote against the war funding and for more domestic       funding. Conservative Republicans could do the opposite.       Enough moderates in the middle would vote for both pieces of       legislation to ensure that each passed separately.    I continued:         Then we could all of us, Republicans and Democrats, go beat       our collective chests and go home for Christmas.       Bipartisanship at its best.    I wrote further in my journal at that time:         All these shenanigans led one Republican colleague to lean       over to me on the House floor and muse: ``You know, Jeff,       sometimes the toughest thing about being a member of Congress       is remembering everything you're supposed to be outraged       about.''    I agreed.   Here we are today, and it is clear what we should be outraged about-- a $300 billion spending hike, a return to trillion-dollar deficits, and  an apparent end to any attempt to rein in Federal spending.   Fiscal responsibility is more than a political talking point to trot  out when the other guys are in charge. The rules and principles do not  change with the legislative session. It should not take hundreds of  billions of dollars in government spending to prompt bipartisanship or  to secure a budget agreement.   If we Republicans support precisely the kind of reckless spending  that we have for so long criticized, it will mean an end of genuine  fiscal conservatism in Washington, and it will establish a government  without any meaningful spending restraints.   I urge my colleagues to consider their commitment to conservatism and  whether their past protests over government spending were anything more  than convenient political props. Let's be conservative no matter who is  in charge, no matter who is in the White House or who controls each  Chamber in Congress.   With that, I yield the floor.
