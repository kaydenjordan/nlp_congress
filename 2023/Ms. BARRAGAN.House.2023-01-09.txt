 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule.   The rules package is anti-Latino. It makes in order bills that attack  abortion rights and reproductive health that Latinas rely on. It  doubles down on Republicans' inhumane treatment of Latino migrants  fleeing violence and persecution.   Later today, Republicans plan to rush a vote on a bill that protects  wealthy and ultrawealthy tax cheats, leaving low-income Black and  Latino communities to bear the brunt of tax audits because they make  easy targets.   Republicans have begun this Congress with chaos and now plan to push  extreme policies that do nothing to help Latinos in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule.
