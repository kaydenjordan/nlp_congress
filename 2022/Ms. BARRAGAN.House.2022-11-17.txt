 Madam Speaker, it was an honor to join Speaker Pelosi  with the congressional delegation to Egypt to the United Nations'  annual climate conference, COP27.   Our bottom-line message to world leaders: America is all in to fight  the climate crisis. We stand with our global partners to reduce  emissions, go green, and meet our goals under the Paris climate  agreement.   Shipping emissions is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases  in the world. Congress has acted with the Inflation Reduction Act.  Record climate investments are included in the IRA to accelerate our  transition to a clean energy future. That includes a $3 billion  investment from my bill, the Climate Smart Ports Act, to reduce  emissions from ports across the country.   As someone who represents the Port of Los Angeles, I know firsthand  the work we must do to go zero emissions and commit with other  countries to reduce shipping emissions through the Green Shipping  Challenge.   To get there at the speed and scale necessary, it is critical that  Congress invest in zero-emission shipping technologies and provide the  EPA with the resources to regulate emissions from ships.   Working together, we can exceed our 2030 emissions reduction target  and take collective action to save our planet.           Recognizing National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. During this month, we honor the  millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's, including my mom, along  with selfless family members and caregivers.   The nearly 6 million people with Alzheimer's are our sisters, our  brothers, our parents, our grandparents, our neighbors, and our fellow  Americans.   This epidemic will only continue to grow. In the next 30 years, the  number of Americans with Alzheimer's is expected to reach nearly 14  million.   Fortunately, we are at an inflection point in scientific progress  where life-changing treatments may become available, but they also need  to be affordable, and we need to continue to invest in research.   That is why I am introducing a bill this month to improve access to  new, innovative Alzheimer's treatments that become available. I will  continue to work with CMS to ensure all drugs receive fair and accurate  consideration for Medicare coverage.   Our fight against this heartbreaking disease is nowhere near done.                 Supporting National Family Caregivers Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Family Caregivers Month. Today, more than one in five Americans provide  care to someone with health or functional needs.   Caregivers are the backbone of our families and communities. They are  [[Page H8548]]  our coworkers, siblings, parents, grandparents, and neighbors.   Their service and sacrifice for our families and country are  essential and immeasurable work, but their contributions are often  overlooked and undervalued.   Caregiving requires time, money, resources, and patience. It can take  a toll on a caregiver's physical and mental health.   As a caregiver for my own mom, I want every family caregiver to know  that you are not alone, that we are in this with you. Your efforts do  not go unnoticed. You deserve to feel celebrated.   We must do more to ensure that you have the support that you need.  You have a champion in Congress who will fight for higher wages and  better benefits for you.   We must continue to invest in programs like IHSS and WPCS so that our  elders can stay home and have the dignity to be in their homes in their  later years and be taken care of.   Thank you again to all the caregivers out there for everything you  do.                            ____________________
