 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 166 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 166         Resolved, That immediately upon adoption of this       resolution, the House shall proceed to the consideration in       the House of the bill (H.R. 1319) to provide for       reconciliation pursuant to title II of S. Con. Res. 5. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided among and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       the Budget or their respective designees and the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, today the Rules Committee met for over  10 hours and reported a rule, House Resolution 166, providing for  consideration of H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, under  a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and  controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members, or their  designees, of the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Ways and  Means.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment by Chairman Yarmuth and  provides one motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, since the emergence of the coronavirus, our Nation has  been in a perpetual state of mourning. The number of Americans killed  by this pandemic is nearly equal to one death a minute every minute for  a year.   Every corner of society has been impacted: More than 18 million  Americans are receiving unemployment benefits; nearly 24 million  Americans are going hungry with roughly 12 million children living in  households with food insecurity; up to 40 million Americans cannot  afford to pay rent; 8 of 10 minority-owned businesses are on the brink  of closure; and I could go on and on and on, Madam Speaker. This is a  time to act and to act boldly.   That is why we began work on the American Rescue Plan nearly 1 month  ago. Nine committees have now marked up portions of the bill, spending  more than 100 hours debating more than 400 amendments. We have acted  swiftly, Madam Speaker, but we have also acted deliberately, guided by  the reality that the American people need us to act urgently.   More vaccines need to get to more people, so this plan will set up  community vaccination sites nationwide. Our schools need to safely  reopen, so this bill will deliver new resources to help them do so.  Working families need more immediate relief, so the American Rescue  Plan also provides an additional $1,400 per person and direct  assistance. That will bring the total amount of direct assistance  recently provided to $2,000 per person.   This bill also extends unemployment benefits and boosts the Federal  minimum wage so that 27 million workers get a raise. Sadly, the Senate  rules will cause this provision to be removed when it is considered  there.   But I want the American people to know this, we, on the Democratic  side, we will not stop fighting to make a minimum wage increase a  reality. No one, and I mean no one, who works full time in the richest  nation on this planet should have to live in poverty.   There is also nutrition assistance included to combat the growing  hunger crisis. And support for local communities on the frontlines of  this health emergency. There is aid here for small businesses, expanded  PPP eligibility, and resources for our first responders, for our  teachers, for our transit workers, and so much more.   This is what it looks like when Congress acts in a way that matches  the scale of the problem that we face. Nearly 7 in 10 Americans support  this plan. More than 150 leaders of our Nation's top businesses came  out this week in support of this plan.   Republican officeholders like the Governor of West Virginia have  encouraged Congress to go big here. And local Republican leaders, like  the mayor of Miami, and so many other Republican mayors across this  country from red States, support our President's proposal. This is a  bipartisan response to the coronavirus crisis.   We all joined together on the Capitol steps on Tuesday to mark the  500,000 lives lost to the coronavirus in this country. We didn't stand  as Democrats or Republicans, but as one Congress. We mourn the empty  seats at dinner tables, and the missed graduations, and weddings the  same way, not from our partisan corners, but as one American family.   Through our grief, we should respond here the same way. United in our  purpose to defeat this pandemic and rebuild our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to stand together and with  the American people in support of this plan. Let's act big. Let's act  bold. Let's crush this virus.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), who is a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  The Washington Post, titled ``Biden is winning Republican support for  his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan. Just not in Washington.''                 [From the Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2021]   Biden Is Winning Republican Support for His $1.9 Trillion Coronavirus                    Relief Plan--Just Not in Washington                              (By Griff Witte)         The pandemic has not been kind to Fresno, the poorest major       city in California. The unemployment rate spiked above 10       percent and has stubbornly remained there. Violent crime has       surged, as has homelessness. Tax revenue has plummeted as       businesses have shuttered. Lines at food banks are filled       with first-timers.        But as bad as it's been, things could soon get worse:       Having frozen hundreds of jobs last year, the city is now       being forced to consider laying off 250 people, including       police and firefighters, to close a $31 million budget       shortfall.  [[Page H764]]         ``That,'' said Jerry Dyer, mayor of the half-million-strong       city in the Central Valley, ``is going to be devastating.''        The looming cuts explain why Dyer's eyes are fixed on       Washington, where President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus       relief plan dangles the tantalizing prospect of a reprieve.       Though Dyer is a Republican, he's rooting for the president       to successfully push through federal aid that, after a       nightmarish year for Fresno, will ``help get us to the end.''        The first-term mayor's stance reflects a broader split, one       that gives Biden and his fellow Democrats a key tactical       advantage as negotiations near an expected climax early next       month.        Republicans in Congress overwhelmingly oppose the relief       bill, casting it as bloated and budget-busting, with some       heaping particular scorn on a measure to send $350 billion in       assistance to states and cities. Should Biden go ahead       without their approval, GOP leaders say, it will prove that       his mantra of bipartisanship rings hollow.        But to many Republicans at city halls and statehouses       across the country, the relief package looks very different.       Instead of the ``blue-state bailout'' derided by GOP       lawmakers, Republican mayors and governors say they see badly       needed federal aid to keep police on the beat, to prevent       battered Main Street businesses from going under and to help       care for the growing ranks of the homeless and the hungry.        ``It's not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue,'' said       Dyer, who became mayor last month following a long career as       the city's police chief. ``It's a public health issue. It's       an economic issue. And it's a public safety issue.''        Surveys show that a broad majority of Americans support the       assistance, including large numbers of Republicans. Only a       minority among Republican voters agree with GOP lawmakers       that the aid package is too large, polls have found.        Biden on Friday highlighted the rift, inviting a bipartisan       group of mayors and governors to the White House to discuss       the specifics of the bill.        You folks are all on the front lines and dealing with the       crisis since day one,'' he told the group, which included the       Republican governors of Maryland and Arkansas, as well as       Republican mayors.        Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) later told reporters from       the podium in the White House briefing room that he had       spoken with Biden and Vice President Harris more in the first       several weeks of their administration ``than I had spoken to       the prior administration in the entirety.''        Biden said he brought the group to the White House to ask       ``what do they think they need most.''        To many mayors and governors, it's a long list.        ``I don't know of any city that hasn't been affected       negatively,'' Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt (R) said. ``Some       may be worse off than others. But we have all had to make       cuts.''        The impact has not been as severe as some economists       initially projected, however. When the pandemic first struck       American shores and much of the U.S. economy shut down last       spring, the prognosis for states and cities looked dire.       Analysts warned that cities--some of which had still not       fully recovered from the Great Recession more than a decade       ago--could be forced into bankruptcy.        But some of the worst consequences have already been       blunted by previous rounds of federal aid, as well as by the       nature of the economic recovery, with high-income       individuals--who contribute much of the state and local tax       base--bouncing back relatively quickly, even as poorer       families languish.        When 10 Republican senators visited the White House this       month to lay out their slimmed-down $618 billion       counterproposal to the president's plan, Mitt Romney (Utah)       came brandishing details from a J.P. Morgan analysis showing       that most states had seen only modest revenue declines.        Romney later told reporters that Biden's insistence on $350       billion in state and local aid was the biggest stumbling       block in negotiations.        ``That kind of number just makes no sense at all,'' he       said. The Republican plan proposed to cut it entirely.        Yet as the J.P. Morgan analysis shows, the impact of the       pandemic has been unevenly felt, with some states--especially       those whose economies are heavily dependent on tourism or oil       and gas extraction--suffering dramatic declines.        A Brookings Institution analysis in September found that       although income tax revenue had proved resilient during the       pandemic, sales tax and transportation-related revenue had       been hit especially hard. As a result, states and cities were       projected to lose out on more than $450 billion over three       years.        And the pain hasn't only been on the revenue side. New       needs arising from the pandemic have created new costs.        ``Cities were confronting some really big challenges even       before this crisis--income inequality, homelessness, housing       affordability,'' said Tracy Gordon, acting director of the       Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.        All have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, she       said. But many cities now have fewer resources with which to       address them.        In Oklahoma City, Holt said, revenue has been down by about       5 percent, a sharp departure from the robust growth the city       had become accustomed to before the pandemic. To compensate,       he said, the city has had to leave jobs unfilled and cut       funding for parks and recreation, even as the overall needs       of citizens and businesses have grown.        ``We don't do much fluff here,'' he said. ``So whatever       we've had to cut, residents have experienced it.''        Republican lawmakers in Washington have dismissed aid to       cities as a bailout for governments that have long spent       beyond their means.        But Holt called that ``a red herring.'' Most state and city       governments--unlike the federal government--have to balance       their budgets, just as a business would.        But unlike businesses large and small that have received       grants or loans to make up for the damage done by the       coronavirus, cities have been left out.        ``In a sense, we're the only employer that hasn't been able       to make an application to anyone to save our jobs and save       our services,'' said Holt, who noted that the city government       is one of his metro area's biggest employers. ``Support for       cities and states is way overdue.''        There has been some relief. The Cares Act, signed into law       by President Donald Trump last March, included $150 billion       for states and for the nation's 38 largest cities. But money       had to be spent directly on coronavirus expenses, creating       logistical hurdles in getting it out the door. Nearly a year       later, some of it remains unspent, a point Republicans make       in arguing for why additional taxpayer dollars should not be       allocated.        The aid proposed by Biden would not have the same       restrictions. Mayors say that will make it easier to quickly       get it into the hands of those who need it and to stimulate       economic growth.        Betsy Price proudly calls Fort Worth, the metropolis of       nearly 900,000 she has led for the past decade, ``a fiscally       conservative city.'' But the Republican said the pandemic has       forced the city government to spend more just to keep people       afloat, doling out small-business support, rental assistance       and help with utility bills.        Price joined more than 400 fellow mayors late last month--      including many Republicans--in signing a U.S. Conference of       Mayors letter that called on Congress to quickly pass Biden's       coronavirus relief plan. She said she had spoken with both of       Texas's senators--Republicans Ted Cruz and John Cornyn--and       made the same case.        ``We're not asking the Democrats or the Republicans to put       money into city coffers,'' she said. ``We're asking them to       put it into the community to help people get back on their       feet.''        The National Governors Association has not released a       letter similar to the one endorsed by the mayors. But the       group did call for $500 billion in relief for states last       spring. And individual Republican governors have spoken up to       back Biden's relief plan, which can be enacted without GOP       support. That includes moderates such as Maryland's Larry       Hogan, as well as Trump-aligned conservatives such as West       Virginia's Jim Justice, who has urged Congress to ``go big.''        Suarez, the Miami mayor, has pushed the same message and       has put pressure on Florida's two Republican senators, Marco       Rubio and Rick Scott, to follow through.        The Republican recently co-wrote an op-ed with St.       Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, a Democrat, in which they       addressed the senators directly and enumerated the problems       facing their cities, including unemployment, bankrupt       business and lines at food pantries that look like       ``gridlocked freeways.''        ``Florida's cities are in agony and are crying out for       help,'' they wrote. ``This is not sustainable.''        In an interview, Suarez said both senators have been       receptive to his message in private, though they also       expressed concerns about the price tag--concerns that Suarez       said he could understand, to a point.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Agriculture.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. Let me just remind my colleagues that 70 percent of the  American people support this bill. Republican governors and Republican  mayors from all across the country support this bill. The only place  where it isn't bipartisan is here in the Congress.   Republicans say, oh, the people can't be trusted to know what is in  the bill. The fact of the matter is, people support this because they  support more money for vaccinations; more money in terms of direct  payments to individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits; and more  money for our cities and towns, our first responders, our police and  our fire departments, and so many other things.   I know my Republican friends have developed this habit of trying to  overturn the will of the American people. Well, enough. The American  people want this, and we are going to deliver it for them.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chair of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), the distinguished chair of the Committee on  Small Business.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chair of the Committee on  Financial Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chair of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform.    Madam Speaker, we are in the midst of a pandemic, the  likes of which we haven't seen in 100 years. It is catastrophic in  every way imaginable. To hear some of my Republican friends try to  nickel-and-dime our response, they should talk to an economist. If they  did, they would discover what will happen if we don't pass this package  now.   We could end up with 4 million fewer jobs this year. That is  according to Moody's.   It will take another 4 years of suffering before the GDP returns to  its prepandemic levels. That is according to the nonpartisan CBO.   Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: ``The smartest thing we can do  is to act big. In the long run, the benefits will far outweigh the  costs.''   Mark Zandi, former adviser to John McCain, said: ``You don't need a  textbook to know this is when you push on the fiscal accelerator.''   Now, let's be clear what we cannot afford. We cannot afford more  delay tactics, another lapse in unemployment assistance, or another  moment of inaction. This plan is what our economy needs, and it is what  America needs, bold, urgent action.   So, let's pass this rule and the underlying legislation, and let's  let the Senate do its job and send this bill to the President's desk  without delay. This historic crisis deserves a historic response. The  American people are counting on us.   Listening to the Republicans debate on the floor and in the Rules  Committee has been a disappointing experience. Barely, barely a word of  empathy or compassion for those who are suffering or for those who are  struggling.   What we have heard are delay tactics. What we have heard are  distortions. What we have heard is divisive talk.   My friends talk about bailouts. This is not a bailout. It is a rescue  package. My friends are out of touch with the American people.   People are struggling. People right now are trying to figure out how  they are going to put food on the table to feed their families. Here on  the House floor, what we hear is indifference, what we hear is  distraction.   The good news is this. We are going to pass this bill today. This is  a big deal. We are going to send it over to the United States Senate,  and we have a Senate that is not going to put this in the trash can. It  is going to debate it and vote on it, and then we are going to send it  to the President.   The good news to the American people is: Help is on the way. We  promised you that we would step up to the plate and that we would  respond appropriately to this crisis, and that is what we are going to  do.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and  Republicans, to support this rule and to support this package.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 166         Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the       following:        Sec. 1. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into  [[Page H772]]       the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union       for consideration of the bill (H.R. 1371) making supplemental       appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021,       providing coronavirus emergency response and relief, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the       Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on       the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1371.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
