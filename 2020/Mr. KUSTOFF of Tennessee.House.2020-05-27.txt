 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the incredible 95 years of life of Rudi Scheidt. Although born in  Germany and raised in San Francisco, Rudi spent most of his life in  Memphis.   Through Rudi and his wife, Honey's, active philanthropy and  dedication to the arts, he touched almost every aspect of cultural life  in the Memphis community.   Rudi and Honey helped expand the University of Memphis Music School,  now known as the Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music. They aided the  Memphis Wonders Series to both evolve and prosper.   Rudi was committed to the Jewish community, serving as President of  Temple Israel. He remained a true leader for his synagogue.   Tony Bennett's lyrics were wrong on this occasion, for, you see, Rudi  Scheidt didn't leave his heart in San Francisco. Rudi left his heart in  Memphis.   I feel lucky to be able to call Rudi a friend. I know the city of  Memphis and the Jewish community will feel his impact for years to  come. Roberta and I will miss him.   My thoughts are with his wife, Honey, as well as their children:  Susan; Helen; Rudi, Jr.; and Elkan during this difficult time.                            ____________________
