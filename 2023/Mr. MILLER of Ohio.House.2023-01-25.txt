 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of the  many leaders of industry in Ohio's Seventh Congressional District,  Momentive Technologies.   Headquartered in Strongsville, Ohio, Momentive Technologies is a  global leader in quartz and ceramic materials for semiconductors and  one of the largest producers of boron nitride in the world. Momentive  Technologies' products are indispensable components in a broad range of  goods, from semiconductors, aerospace, water purification, and  pharmaceuticals to consumer electronics and telecommunications.   I had the privilege of visiting their headquarters while I was back  home for last week's district work period. Momentive Technologies has  invested heavily in its Ohio operations. Its year-over-year capital  spend has increased 35 percent each year since 2020, and it hopes to  continue that strong record of investment for the benefit not only of  Ohio but of America's economic security.   I look forward to working together with Momentive Technologies and  others across different industries to ensure American economic and  industrial security for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and  colleague, Ms. Tenney, for yielding and for her leadership on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 7. Today, the  United States House of Representatives stands up for human rights, for  the same freedoms that we as Americans hold so near and dear in our own  country and against the brutal regime in Iran.   The Iranian Government has a long track record of vile human rights  [[Page H309]]  abuses. Notably, they are the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the  world, not just against the United States, but also against countries  such as our own democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel.   In September, the senseless murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini at the  hands of the so-called morality police for wearing her hijab improperly  once again put the regime's human rights record front and center for  the world to see.   Now, as the Iranian people protest in the streets of more than 133  cities across the country, demanding basic human rights, the regime's  response is to crack down even harder. Since the protests broke out in  September, more than 450 have been killed, including 58 children. At  least another 18,000 were arrested.   This is reprehensible, unacceptable, and inexcusable. No government  should ever treat its people this way.   The United States must continue to support the Iranian people in  their struggle for freedom. The Biden administration should take a  strong stand and end its quest for a new Iran nuclear deal. Great  American companies, like Starlink, should help bring much-needed  internet access to those protesting in the streets, which will  significantly increase their communication and information sharing.   That is why I am proud to stand here on the floor of the House of  Representatives today and support H. Con. Res. 7.
