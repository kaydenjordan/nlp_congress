(a) Overpayments Under ERISA.--Section 206 of the Employee       Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1056) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(h) Special Rules Applicable to Benefit Overpayments.--        ``(1) General rule.--In the case of an inadvertent benefit       overpayment by any pension plan, the responsible plan       fiduciary shall not be considered to have failed to comply       with the requirements of this title merely because such       fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary       discretion, not to seek recovery of all or part of such       overpayment from--        ``(A) any participant or beneficiary,        ``(B) any plan sponsor of, or contributing employer to--        ``(i) an individual account plan, provided that the amount       needed to prevent or restore any impermissible forfeiture       from any participant's or beneficiary's account arising in       connection with the overpayment is, separately from and       independently of the overpayment, allocated to such account       pursuant to the nonforfeitability requirements of section 203       (for example, out of the plan's forfeiture account,       additional employer contributions, or recoveries from those       responsible for the overpayment), or        ``(ii) a defined benefit pension plan subject to the       funding rules in part 3 of this subtitle B, unless the       responsible plan fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its       fiduciary discretion, that failure to recover all or part of       the overpayment faster than required under such funding rules       would materially affect the plan's ability to pay benefits       due to other participants and beneficiaries, or        ``(C) any fiduciary of the plan, other than a fiduciary       (including a plan sponsor or contributing employer acting in       a fiduciary capacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties       resulted in such overpayment, provided that if the plan has       established prudent procedures to prevent and minimize       overpayment of benefits and the relevant plan fiduciaries       have followed such procedures, an inadvertent benefit       overpayment will not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.        ``(2) Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery       from responsible  [[Page H3932]]       party.--Paragraph (1) shall not fail to apply with respect to       any inadvertent benefit overpayment merely because, after       discovering such overpayment, the responsible plan       fiduciary--        ``(A) reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount       provided for under the terms of the plan, or        ``(B) seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible       for the overpayment.        ``(3) Employer funding obligations.--Nothing in this       subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation       imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the       minimum funding standards under part 3 of this subtitle B or       to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in       accordance with section 203.        ``(4) Recoupment from participants and beneficiaries.--If       the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its       fiduciary discretion, decides to seek recoupment from a       participant or beneficiary of all or part of an inadvertent       benefit overpayment made by the plan to such participant or       beneficiary, it may do so, subject to the following       conditions:        ``(A) No interest or other additional amounts (such as       collection costs or fees) are sought on overpaid amounts for       any period.        ``(B) If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a       non-decreasing periodic benefit by reducing future benefit       payments--        ``(i) the reduction ceases after the plan has recovered the       full dollar amount of the overpayment,        ``(ii) the amount recouped each calendar year does not       exceed 10 percent of the full dollar amount of the       overpayment, and        ``(iii) future benefit payments are not reduced to below 90       percent of the periodic amount otherwise payable under the       terms of the plan.      Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments       of a non-decreasing periodic benefit through one or more       installment payments, the sum of such installment payments in       any calendar year does not exceed the sum of the reductions       that would be permitted in such year under the preceding       sentence.        ``(C) If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a       benefit other than a non-decreasing periodic benefit, the       plan satisfies requirements developed by the Secretary for       purposes of this subparagraph.        ``(D) Efforts to recoup overpayments are--        ``(i) not accompanied by threats of litigation, unless the       responsible plan fiduciary reasonably believes it could       prevail in a civil action brought in Federal or State court       to recoup the overpayments, and        ``(ii) not made through a collection agency or similar       third party, unless the participant or beneficiary ignores or       rejects efforts to recoup the overpayment following either a       final judgment in Federal or State court or a settlement       between the participant or beneficiary and the plan, in       either case authorizing such recoupment.        ``(E) Recoupment of past overpayments to a participant is       not sought from any beneficiary of the participant, including       a spouse, surviving spouse, former spouse, or other       beneficiary.        ``(F) Recoupment may not be sought if the first overpayment       occurred more than 3 years before the participant or       beneficiary is first notified in writing of the error.        ``(G) A participant or beneficiary from whom recoupment is       sought is entitled to contest all or part of the recoupment       pursuant to the plan's claims procedures.        ``(H) In determining the amount of recoupment to seek, the       responsible plan fiduciary may take into account the hardship       that recoupment likely would impose on the participant or       beneficiary.        ``(5) Effect of culpability.--Subparagraphs (A) through (F)       of paragraph (4) shall not apply to protect a participant or       beneficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this paragraph,       a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual       bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through       misrepresentations or omissions that led to the overpayment),       or if the individual knew, or had good reason to know under       the circumstances, that the benefit payment or payments were       materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding       the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely       because the individual believed the benefit payment or       payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if       the individual raised that question with an authorized plan       representative and was told the payment or payments were not       in excess of the correct amount. With respect to a culpable       participant or beneficiary, efforts to recoup overpayments       shall not be made through threats of litigation, unless a       lawyer for the plan could make the representations required       under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the       litigation were brought in Federal court.''.        (b) Overpayments Under Internal Revenue Code of 1986.--        (1) Qualification requirements.--Section 414 of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by this preceding       provisions of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(bb) Special Rules Applicable to Benefit Overpayments.--        ``(1) In general.--A plan shall not fail to be treated as       described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of section       219(g)(5)(A) (and shall not fail to be treated as satisfying       the requirements of section 401(a) or 403) merely because--        ``(A) the plan fails to obtain payment from any       participant, beneficiary, employer, plan sponsor, fiduciary,       or other party on account of any inadvertent benefit       overpayment made by the plan, or        ``(B) the plan sponsor amends the plan to increase past or       future benefit payments to affected participants and       beneficiaries in order to adjust for prior inadvertent       benefit overpayments.        ``(2) Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery       from responsible party.--Paragraph (1) shall not fail to       apply to a plan merely because, after discovering a benefit       overpayment, such plan--        ``(A) reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount       provided for under the terms of the plan, or        ``(B) seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible       for such overpayment.        ``(3) Employer funding obligations.--Nothing in this       subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation       imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the       minimum funding standards under sections 412 and 430 or to       prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance       with section 411.        ``(4) Observance of benefit limitations.--Notwithstanding       paragraph (1), a plan to which paragraph (1) applies shall       observe any limitations imposed on it by section 401(a)(17)       or 415. The plan may enforce such limitations using any       method approved by the Secretary of the Treasury for       recouping benefits previously paid or allocations previously       made in excess of such limitations.        ``(5) Coordination with other qualification requirements.--      The Secretary of the Treasury may issue regulations or other       guidance of general applicability specifying how benefit       overpayments and their recoupment or non-recoupment from a       participant or beneficiary shall be taken into account for       purposes of satisfying any requirement applicable to a plan       to which paragraph (1) applies.''.        (2) Rollovers.--Section 402(c) of such Code is amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(12) In the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment       from a plan to which section 414(bb)(1) applies that is       transferred to an eligible retirement plan by or on behalf of       a participant or beneficiary--        ``(A) the portion of such overpayment with respect to which       recoupment is not sought on behalf of the plan shall be       treated as having been paid in an eligible rollover       distribution if the payment would have been an eligible       rollover distribution but for being an overpayment, and        ``(B) the portion of such overpayment with respect to which       recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan shall be permitted       to be returned to such plan and in such case shall be treated       as an eligible rollover distribution transferred to such plan       by the participant or beneficiary who received such       overpayment (and the plans making and receiving such transfer       shall be treated as permitting such transfer).      In any case in which recoupment is sought on behalf of the       plan but is disputed by the participant or beneficiary who       received such overpayment, such dispute shall be subject to       the claims procedures of the plan that made such overpayment,       such plan shall notify the plan receiving the rollover of       such dispute, and the plan receiving the rollover shall       retain such overpayment on behalf of the participant or       beneficiary (and shall be entitled to treat such overpayment       as plan assets) pending the outcome of such procedures.''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply as of the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Certain Actions Before Date of Enactment.--Plans,       fiduciaries, employers, and plan sponsors are entitled to       rely on--        (1) a good faith interpretation of then existing       administrative guidance for inadvertent benefit overpayment       recoupments and recoveries that commenced before the date of       enactment of this Act, and        (2) determinations made before the date of enactment of       this Act by the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise       of its fiduciary discretion, not to seek recoupment or       recovery of all or part of an inadvertent benefit       overpayment.      In the case of a benefit overpayment that occurred prior to       the date of enactment of this Act, any installment payments       by the participant or beneficiary to the plan or any       reduction in periodic benefit payments to the participant or       beneficiary, which were made in recoupment of such       overpayment and which commenced prior to such date, may       continue after such date. Nothing in this subsection shall       relieve a fiduciary from responsibility for an overpayment       that resulted from a breach of its fiduciary duties.       SEC. 302.

(d) Additional Safe Harbors.--The Secretary shall expand       the EPCRS to provide additional safe harbor means of       correcting eligible inadvertent failures described in       subsection (a), including safe harbor means of calculating       the earnings which must be restored to a plan in cases where       plan assets have been depleted by reason of an eligible       inadvertent failure.        (e) Eligible Inadvertent Failure.--For purposes of this       section--        (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the       term ``eligible inadvertent failure'' means a failure that       occurs despite the existence of practices and procedures       which--        (A) satisfy the standards set forth in section 4.04 of       Revenue Procedure 2021-30 (or any successor guidance), or        (B) satisfy similar standards in the case of an individual       retirement plan.        (2) Exception.--The term ``eligible inadvertent failure''       shall not include any failure which is egregious, relates to       the diversion  [[Page H3935]]       or misuse of plan assets, or is directly or indirectly       related to an abusive tax avoidance transaction.        (f) Application of Certain Requirements for Correcting       Errors.--This section shall not apply to any failure unless       the correction of such failure under this section is made in       conformity with the general principles that apply to       corrections of such failures under the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986, including regulations or other guidance issued       thereunder and including those principles and corrections set       forth in Revenue Procedure 2021-30 (or any successor       guidance).''

TITLE VII--BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 701. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2954 will help all Americans successfully save  for a secure retirement by expanding coverage and increasing retirement  savings, simplifying the current retirement system and protecting  Americans' retirement accounts.   Retirement security has consistently been one of my top priorities as  chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. Too many workers in this  Nation reach retirement age without having the savings they need. In  fact--and I hope people will listen to this number--it is estimated  that up to 50 percent of the individuals in America who go to work  every single day do not have enrollment in a qualified retirement plan.  That means those households are at risk of not having enough to  maintain their living standards in retirement.   We need to do more to encourage workers to begin planning for  retirement earlier and we need to make saving considerably easier.   Last Congress, Mr. Brady and I worked together on a bipartisan basis  to do that by enacting the SECURE Act, one of the most significant  retirement bills to become law in well over a decade.   Thanks to the SECURE Act, 4 million more Americans are now able to  save for retirement through their employers, and as many as 700,000 new  retirement accounts will be formed.   Last year, we built on this progress with the passage into law, my  legislation, the Butch Lewis Act. After years of fighting for a  solution to the multiemployer pension crisis, the Butch Lewis Act saved  multiemployer pension plans from insolvency and secured the financial  future of over a million workers and retirees who have played by the  rules and made responsible savings decisions. Think of that and couple  it with what we are about to do today with the guarantee of Social  Security, and we will help to improve the opportunity for members of  American families to have a secure retirement.   Madam Speaker, but more work needs to be done. That is why I am  pleased the H.R. 2954, the Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022, is  before us today.   This bipartisan legislation--and by bipartisan, let me thank Mr.  Brady again for his good work on this legislation as well--will expand  automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans by requiring 401(k), 403(b), and  SIMPLE plans to automatically enroll participants upon becoming  eligible, with the ability for employees to opt out of coverage--which  I think, by the way, is not the best idea, but we do provide that  option. Expansion of automatic enrollment will significantly increase  participation in retirement savings plans at work.   H.R. 2954 also enhances the start-up credit, making it easier for  small businesses to sponsor a retirement plan. And the legislation  increases the required minimum distribution age to 75 and indexes the  catch-up contribution limit for individual retirement accounts. These  changes will make it  [[Page H3940]]  easier for American families to prepare for a financially secure  retirement.   On a related note, I think it is important to highlight that U.S.  defined contribution plans have created a unique reservoir of capital  in the innovation economy. Retirement plans are investing in areas such  as tech, financial services, digital commerce, and biotech. That means  that workers' retirement assets are directly tying middle-class workers  to our national innovation economy. That certainly is a win-win for all  of us.   Madam Speaker, I am really pleased that Ranking Member Brady and I  were able to come together on a bipartisan basis to develop this  important legislation. Once again, it passed the Committee on Ways and  Means unanimously. Our efforts have resulted in an excellent product  that has broad support from organizations representing diverse  interests, including retirees, charitable organizations, financial  services providers, police officers, small businesses, and employers.  The list of specific supporters is too long to read but we can start  with the American Red Cross, AARP, and many others, which we will  submit for the Record. Hundreds of groups have endorsed this plan.   Let's work together to expand retirement savings in America.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), a real champion of retirement savings.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), a real champion of retirement savings,  including all things Social Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), another real champion of retirement savings.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), another real champion of retirement savings.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), another real champion of  Social Security and retirement.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, might I inquire of the ranking member how  many more speakers he might have.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, we are waiting on one more speaker. If Mr.  Brady has anybody else he wants to thank, that would be great.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that has  been signed by 50 different charities in support of this legislation.                                                     March 27, 2022.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chair, Ways and Means Committee,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chair, Education & Labor Committee,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Ways and Means Committee,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Education & Labor Committee,      House of Representatives.        Dear Chairmen Neal and Scott and Ranking Members Brady and       Foxx: On behalf of the undersigned nonprofits, including       charities and faith-based organizations, we want to express       our strong support for the inclusion of the Legacy IRA Act in       the bipartisan Securing a Strong Retirement Act (H.R. 2954,       section 310). The Legacy IRA Act was originally introduced as       H.R. 2909 by Representatives Don Beyer (D-VA-08) and Mike       Kelly (R-PA-16).        We appreciate you placing a priority on families in America       who are saving for retirement and simplifying the retirement       system through the broader Securing a Strong Retirement Act.       Specifically, the Legacy IRA provision will encourage more       charitable giving by enabling seniors to make tax-free       contributions from their traditional IRAs to charities       through life-income plans. It is an important piece of       broader efforts to increase charitable giving to enable       nonprofits to continue to provide critical services in local       communities such as health research and patient education,       food assistance, domestic violence services, childcare, youth       homeless shelters, and cultural and arts programming.        Many of our organizations are dependent on private       philanthropy, including gift planning. We believe the Legacy       IRA provision simply offers seniors another philanthropic       option and would incentivize more giving to help charities       while helping middle-income seniors who need a lifetime       income.        We strongly support the inclusion of the Legacy IRA Act in       the Securing a Strong Retirement Act and urge the House of       Representatives to approve this measure. America is stronger       when everyone has the opportunity to give, to get involved,       and to strengthen their communities.

AARP,                                                     March 28, 2022.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chair, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert Scott,      Chair, House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Education and Labor,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairs Neal and Scott, Ranking Members Brady and Foxx:        On behalf of our 38 million members and all older Americans       nationwide, AARP appreciates your leadership to improve       retirement savings opportunities via the Securing a Strong       Retirement Act of 2022. While Social Security continues to be       the bedrock of retirement income for most American workers       and their families, individuals want and need additional       retirement income sources. Your bipartisan legislation would       make several significant enhancements to current law.        AARP strongly supports the provision in this bill that       would provide an annual paper statement of benefits to ensure       families know where they stand when saving for retirement. As       the U.S. increasingly relies on individual account-based       retirement savings, workers and their families must timely       understand, monitor, and manage their lifetime savings. Full       and meaningful disclosure is critical to individual planning       and pension law generally. As such, to be effective, Congress       needs to ensure all workers and plan participants will       receive and can review important retirement plan documents in       the form that most workers and families want. No document is       more fundamental than an individual's annual benefit       statement. AARP also supports the optional delivery--and       retention--of important information electronically.        The Securing a Strong Retirement Act also takes important       steps towards improving worker access to retirement plans.       Under this bill, more people who work part-time will be able       to enroll in their employers' retirement savings plans by       allowing them to save after only two (rather than three)       years of employment. More than 27 million employees across       the country work less than full-time. This provision will be       especially helpful to the many older workers who can only       find part-time work or need to work part-time due to       caregiving responsibilities. In addition, employers with more       than ten employees would be required to automatically enroll       workers in new retirement savings plans under this bill. This       provision will help many employees benefit from automatic       savings tools.        For workers who are struggling to save for retirement, the       bill expands the current SAVERS tax credit to provide an       enhanced matching contribution to millions of additional low-       and moderate-income families. The matching contribution is       both an incentive for individuals to save for retirement       while also providing additional retirement funds.        Additionally, the creation of a national retirement Lost       and Found database will help workers locate retirement       accounts they may have had with previous employers. This is       increasingly important as more and more workers change jobs       several times over the course of their careers. The       legislation also establishes limitations and safeguards for       retirees who may have mistakenly received plan overpayments,       including allowing a retirement plan to forego recouping the       overpayment. Finally, we urge the retention of  [[Page H3945]]       the pretax option for catch-up contributions to help the 50+       save for retirement.        We look forward to continuing to work with you to help       every American adequately save for retirement in order to be       independent as they age.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Sweeney,                                              Senior Vice President,                                                Government Affairs.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Oftentimes in this Chamber, you will hear the phrase  ``transformative.'' Sometimes it is hyperbolic, but on this occasion,  this is transformative legislation.   We have fundamentally changed the opportunities for retirement for  the American family, for millions and millions of people. I want to  acknowledge the work of the ranking member on this, Mr. Brady, because  his input has been invaluable in helping to get to this moment.   We are proud of this work. We are helping Americans prepare for a  secure retirement. The catch-up provisions alone are startling in this  legislation.   Remember, there are a lot of people in America who are trying to  simultaneously educate their children and save for retirement. It is a  real challenge.   The catch-up provisions here mean that if people wish to work longer  or begin to set aside more prescribed dollars for retirement because  they couldn't do it during certain years of paying college expenses, we  provide that opportunity.   This has been meaningful for Members on both sides. I have heard  Members on the Republican side point out their contributions to it, and  they are entirely correct.   We, on our side, have also included Mr. Davis' legislation that  ensures workers with student loans don't miss out on 401(k) matching  contributions. Representative Murphy's legislation to increase the  required minimum distribution age to 75 is here as well.   We created a higher catch-up contribution amount for those years just  before retirement, a provision particularly important for pilots who  have a mandatory retirement age. That was a priority of Representatives  Sanchez and Pascrell.   Mr. Kind's bills have been included. His legislation fixing a problem  with startup credits and multiple employer plans is here as well.   SECURE 2.0 contains Representative Chu's legislation that would  enhance the saver's credit, which was also a priority for  Representative Sewell.   We have included Representative Panetta's legislation that provides  403(b) custodial accounts that are permitted to invest in collective  investment trusts, as well as his legislation reforming family  attribution rules.   We have included Representative Sewell's legislation to reduce by 1  year the period of service requirement for long-term part-time workers  to participate in 401(k) plans. This provision is particularly  important for women who tend to work part-time more frequently than  men.   Mr. Suozzi contributed legislation that would direct Treasury to  issue regulations addressing a glitch with respect to insurance- dedicated exchange-traded funds.   Mr. Beyer's legislation is included. That was important to the  charitable community and would, among other things, index the inflation  rate for annual IRA charitable distribution limits.   The bill includes Representative Moore's legislation that would  provide penalty-free withdrawals from retirement plans for individuals  in case of domestic abuse.   We have included Representative Evans' legislation directing the  Labor Department to update its disclosure rules to allow better  comparisons amongst investments to aid participant decisionmaking.   Finally, we have included Representative Pascrell's legislation that  would allow first responders to exclude service-connected disability  pension plans and payments from their gross income after they reach  retirement age. That also touches upon Representative Higgins' ESOP  Fairness Act.                                time  1645    Mr. Brady noted earlier, and let me reinforce, the exceptional work  of the Ways and Means Committee staff on this occasion. As I have said  many times before, we are blessed with amongst the brightest, smartest,  and hardest working staff members in Congress. Let me thank MaiLan  Rodgers for her work and Kara Getz, who has been integral to the  development of not only this legislation but also the SECURE Act and  the Butch Lewis Act, both of which became law.   The SECURE Act was one of the most significant retirement  opportunities, and this legislation will become law, I hope, in the  near future. Let's not wait another decade to enact the important  provisions of this legislation. This bill goes a long way in addressing  this country's retirement crisis.   I want to point out something I said earlier. Half the people who get  up and go to work every day in America are not in a qualified  retirement plan. We need to continue to address that issue.   This is important legislation. I know it will pass. I think the last  time this legislation came to the floor, all but four Members of this  Chamber voted for this legislation.   I thank Mr. Brady, again, for his good work and the good work of his  staff.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), and I ask unanimous consent that he be permitted  to control the remainder of the time.  [[Page H3946]]
