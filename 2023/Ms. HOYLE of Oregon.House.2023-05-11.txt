 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Teachers  Appreciation Week. The best way that we can show appreciation in  Congress for our teachers is to fight for good wages, hours, and  working conditions in the classroom.   In Oregon, the average starting teacher salary is a little over  $39,000. That is lower than the national average. Educators also make  81 cents on the dollar compared to other professionals with similar  experience, credentials, and degrees.   Mr. Speaker, 94 percent of U.S. teachers spend their own money on  their students to ensure classrooms have the resources they need, like  books, supplies, music, and art. Put this all together and it is no  wonder teachers can't pay off their student loans or buy homes in the  communities where they teach.   We need workers to be able to afford to buy homes in their  communities, and we also need to raise teacher pay. Their current  salaries aren't keeping up with the rising cost of living. The pay gap  is only growing and creating a teacher shortage crisis.   That is why, on National Teachers Appreciation Week, I am proud to  cosponsor the American Teachers Act, which would help States raise the  minimum teacher salaries to $60,000 for public K-12 schools.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our teachers. It is far past time we back them  up.                            ____________________
