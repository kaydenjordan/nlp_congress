 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address a  significant issue that would affect the hardworking families and  farmers of North Carolina--the FDA's proposed rule to ban menthol  cigarettes and flavored cigars.   Having grown up cropping tobacco to help my family make ends meet, I  know firsthand how this industry impacts eastern North Carolina, rural  America, and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, we must be mindful that this well-intended ban could  have an unintended consequence. It might increase the availability of  illegal tobacco products and, more concerning, jeopardize the  livelihoods of families and farmers by eliminating at least 6,000  menthol cigarette industry jobs in North Carolina. We must always  protect our communities and their well-being.   To be clear, we need jobs. That is why I sent a bipartisan letter to  the President with my North Carolina colleague, Representative   David  Rouzer, and asked this administration to thoroughly consider the  economic implications of this proposed ban before taking decisive  action.                            ____________________
