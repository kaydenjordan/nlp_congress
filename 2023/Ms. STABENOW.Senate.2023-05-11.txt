 Mr. President, I thank our leader for all of his  wonderful work, all the time.   I rise today to pay tribute to a phenomenal member of my staff, a  leader who has played a key role in so many things I have been able to  accomplish here in the Senate.   Emily Carwell is leaving the upper Chamber for a new leadership  change across the Rotunda--dare I say, the lower Chamber--after more  than 8 years in my office. And, honestly, it feels like Emily has been  with me forever. To speak in Senate terms, Emily has been my  legislative director for 2,383 votes.   It is actually quite fitting that she is returning to the House,  though, because it is where she started, sort of. When I first  interviewed her, I loved her right away: her Midwestern sensibilities,  her enthusiasm, her eagerness to work for the people of Michigan.  Anyone who has met Emily knows exactly what I mean. As somewhat of an  afterthought, I asked her: You were in the House, right? You have House  experience, right?    She said yes.   It turns out that her House experience was an unpaid fellowship.  But--do you know what?--it didn't even matter. She joined my office as  a legislative assistant. She hit the ground running, and she simply has  not stopped.   She organized the first-ever bipartisan delegation to tour all of our  Michigan military installations, which was very significant for us to  do.   And, as legislative director, Emily has played a key role in so many  areas that I couldn't even list them all. But I have to say, at the top  of the list is our work on mental health.   Her passion and tenacity are a major reason why we were able to get  certified community behavioral health clinics signed into law, the  largest Medicaid expansion since the Affordable Care Act. And it was a  wonderful bipartisan effort. And you can bet I will keep her number on  speed dial as these clinics are expanded across the country.   Emily has also served as policy director of our Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee, a job she has excelled at. And, Mr.  President, as vice chair of the DPCC, I know you know that well.   She has led amazing efforts to modernize the committee, including  launching the ``DPCC FloorWatch'' app to bring us into the 21st  century, which features everything from floor alerts to amendments, to  floor and committee hearing videos.   If you had to describe Emily in one word--although there are so many  words, but if you had to describe her in one word--``relentless'' would  be a good choice. During vote-aramas, when everyone else was collapsed  at their desks in the middle of the night, Emily was still typing away  on amendments to make sure our caucus members had the information they  needed. And she was tireless during the earliest days of the pandemic,  when we had to figure out how to run a Senate office remotely while  helping the people of Michigan in every way we could.   She has been a wonderful partner on codels, and we have traveled the  world together. I will never forget the time when we were in Jordan at  a refugee camp, meeting with Syrian refugees. Emily speaks fluent  Arabic. So she was able to connect with these people who had been  through so much in such a special, incredible way. I was listening, but  I wasn't able to speak to them in their language. And it was very  powerful.   On a lighter note, Emily, I know about the time when you neglected to  tell me that you were accidentally given the hotel suite I was supposed  to get, and I got a smaller room. I just want you to know now that I  know that.   Just as important as the work she has done is the positive energy she  has brought to the office. Emily has a way of bringing people together,  whether it is for an office happy hour around her desk, an impromptu  lunch outing, or Costco pizzas in the conference room.   Her family is very important to her, and I am so glad her sister is  here with us today. And she treats her coworkers like she treats her  own family. Just one example: hand-delivering a tin of two kinds of  homemade cookies to the home of a coworker who was sick.   Emily is an amazing team player, skills she likely learned on the  basketball court. She played on her college team, and she has also  played against U.S. Senators who are at least twice her size. And all I  am going to say is you will have to ask Senator Tester how that game  went.   Emily, thank you so much for everything--for your hard work, your  talent, your dedication, your service to the people of Michigan and our  country. And, most importantly, I am so grateful for your friendship.  You will always be a part of my family. I have no doubt that you will  excel in your new position, and the House is so lucky to get you back-- this time, in a paid position.   And I am also very happy that you will be only 7 minutes away. We  actually timed it. So Godspeed and, again, all the best, always.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
