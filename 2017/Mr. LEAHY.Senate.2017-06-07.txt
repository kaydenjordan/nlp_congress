 Mr. President, founded more than two centuries ago,  Vermont boasts a trove of historically preserved buildings, structures,  and towns. These are part of our heritage, and our State's character.  Making a priority of managing and preserving our cultural heritage  makes Vermont a National leader in this field.   Of course, many of these historic structures do not meet modern fire  prevention codes and lack basic features such as sprinklers, which can  drastically reduce the potential for irreparable damage from a fire.  Today I am reintroducing the Historic Downtown Preservation and Access  Act, a bill that would create a refundable tax credit for the  installation of fire suppression systems and elevators in older, multi- use buildings in historic downtowns. Every year, fires destroy numerous  historic buildings that often serve as the center of towns and villages  across the nation. In 2011, the Brooks House in Brattleboro, Vermont,  burned down after almost 150 years in use as a hotel and later, as a  multi-use building for residential housing and commercial space. After  six years of rebuilding and restoring, those who were displaced by this  fire are finally getting back on their feet.   The Historic Downtown Preservation and Access Act will establish a 50  percent refundable tax credit of up to $50,000 that incentivizes the  installation of sprinkler systems in order to help prevent and minimize  damage caused by fire, including potential loss of life, extensive  property damage, and, in some instances, federal funding that is  reinvested during the restoration process. This bill also includes a  provision to encourage the installation of elevators in our historic  buildings, making them accessible to all. This would ensure that upper  floors for commercial or residential use are accessible to everyone,  including tenants and their guests. Finally, this bill is updated to  establish a tax credit for the costs incurred when removing hazardous  substances from historic buildings, like lead paint, asbestos, and  radon.   We should encourage the maintenance of the history and character of  historic buildings and downtowns, while also ensuring that they remain  safe and accessible to all. This bill is a responsible step forward in  those efforts. As we look ahead to comprehensive tax reform, I hope  that Congress will consider commonsense legislation like this that will  help preserve our towns' unique histories and legacy features for  decades to come, while promoting the safety of all Americans.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Hassan, Ms. Warren, Ms.          Harris, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Leahy, and Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 1307.
