 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  International Women's Day on March 8 to call attention to women around  the world who have risked their personal safety and freedom to speak  out for the rights of all women.   I am particularly inspired by the example of three brave Saudi women  who have spent nearly 2 years imprisoned or under house arrest because  of their fearless advocacy.   These three women, Loujain Al-Hathloul, Nouf Abdulaziz, and Eman Al- Nafjan, are outstanding examples of the many Saudi activists who  bravely fought to stop Saudi Arabia's male guardianship, fought to end  its prohibition on women driving, and fought to open up female  participation in elections and public office.   And although the government ostensibly granted such freedoms in 2018,  these three women continue to face different injustices, including  torture or threats of murder and sexual violence and limited access to  family or legal representation.   Loujain has been particularly targeted for her courageous leadership  within this women's movement. Her selfless commitment has paved the way  for crucial social reforms, but unfortunately, the Saudi Government has  attempted to undermine her contributions with politically-motivated  criminal charges, a lengthy imprisonment, and inhumane abuse.   This incredible woman deserves to be honored, not jailed, which is  why I recently led several colleagues in nominating Loujain for the  Nobel Peace Prize and will continue to advocate for her through the Tom  Lantos Human Rights Commission's Defending Freedoms Project.   This Congress, we have already adopted a bipartisan resolution in the  House to urge for the release of these women and other activists.  Today, we call on Saudi Arabia once again to free these women and to  lift the threat of their continued persecution.   To maintain our international leadership, the United States has a  moral obligation to uphold democratic principles. The President, the  Secretary of State, and the entire Trump administration must increase  its diplomatic pressure to demand the release of these women and hold  the Saudi Government accountable for its appalling disregard of human  rights.   As we recognize this International Women's Day, we are reminded to  look beyond our borders; to continue to bring attention to the urgent  and ongoing human rights violations that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is  committing.   I ask that all women and their allies throughout the United States  and around the world and all men join me in standing with these amazing  Saudi feminists in demanding that they be freed.                            ____________________
