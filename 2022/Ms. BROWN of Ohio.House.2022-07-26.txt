 Madam Speaker, when President Biden took office,  we wasted no time getting to work to rebuild a devastated economy.   From the Build Back Better Act to the American Rescue Plan, we have  taken bold steps to make possible the incredible economic progress we  see today. Progress that made the United States the first major economy  in the world to recover and exceed prepandemic levels of its GDP, and  2021 saw the most jobs created in American history, while keeping 3.7  million children out of poverty.   Whether it is more good-paying jobs or the cost of groceries and gas,  our goal remains the same, to create a balanced economy so that  Americans can thrive.   Together with President Biden, we are fighting every day to make it a  reality.                            ____________________
