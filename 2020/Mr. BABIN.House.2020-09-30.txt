 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to stand here today and  recognize a handful of remarkable individuals from my congressional  district for their exceptional contributions to the health and safety  of communities across southeast Texas since the outbreak of the COVID- 19 virus.   I have seen people come together like never before to help and  support each other throughout this unprecedented time. People from all  walks of life and from different backgrounds and ideologies have put  their own needs aside to respond to the crisis at hand without  hesitation.   Today I wish to personally honor and say thank you to our frontline  healthcare workers. You have selflessly put yourselves in the path of  the virus  [[Page H5060]]  in order to protect the rest of us, and you are true American heroes.   To the doctors, nurses, technicians, EMTs, pharmacists, home health  aides, and everyone else who supports patient care, from the bottom of  my heart, thank you. You have gone above and beyond. Your dedication,  courage, and strength deserve our most profound admiration and  gratitude. Your service to your community has impacted and saved  countless lives.   It would take days for me to appropriately honor each and every  person who deserves special recognition. Unfortunately, I have limited  time today, so I want to highlight just a few of these heroes.   From my neck of the woods in Tyler County, Texas, I want to thank  Carrie Holland Evans, a registered nurse who was infected with COVID-19  in the line of duty. Since her recovery, Carrie has participated in  virology studies and has donated convalescent plasma to save lives.   I want to recognize Dr. Qamar Arfeen, who delivers home health and  hospice care across southeast Texas and is the head of the COVID-19  unit at Baptist Hospital, for all of his work with convalescent plasma.   From Houston Methodist in Baytown, I want to mention four brave and  resilient registered nurses: Jennifer Vera, LaDuska James, Dorothy  Terry, and Jon Ann Watson. Your contributions to the hospital and  dedication to patient care were simply awe inspiring.   Also, from Houston Methodist in Baytown, I want to thank Gina Cotter,  who collaborated across disciplines to educate and upskill nurses to  provide respiratory care, while also serving as a frontline respiratory  therapist.   From Houston Methodist in Clear Lake, I want to thank Dr. Omar Acres,  Dr. Nina Zatikyan, and Dr. Arthur Lim, who all cared for many infected  patients. I also want to recognize three registered nurses--Stephanie  Dockter, Diana Freyberger, and Nicole Herrick--who all volunteered to  care exclusively for COVID-19 patients so their other staff members  would not have to.   I want to acknowledge the largest hospital system in southeast Texas,  Memorial Hermann Health System, which has been on the front lines of  the region's response to the pandemic. Memorial Hermann's more than  6,000 physicians, 8,000 nurses, and hundreds of case managers and  social workers have been caring for patients and their families in one  of the country's most significant hot spots. They risk their lives  every day to care for our community and have worked tirelessly to slow  the spread of this disease.   And, finally, I want to mention a handful of heroes from CHI St.  Luke's. Thank you to Dr. Lou Hamer, a pulmonologist who closed his  outpatient practice and instead fully dedicated his services to  supporting the needs of COVID patients.   Thank you Dr. Monte Orahood for working day and night since the  pandemic started and for your clinical oversight, which has undoubtedly  resulted in successful patient outcomes.    Dr. George Rodriguez, thank you for providing clinical guidance and  leadership on patient care and protocol development.   And I thank Dr. Zaher Shebib, who has consulted on every single  COVID-19 patient case for St. Luke's.   Also from St. Luke's, allow me to highlight lab director, Charlie  Combs, who is described by his colleagues as an unsung hero, as well as  Chelsea Pavlowich, Christina Andrews, Sarah Hill, Candace Fernandez,  Jason Case, Nidia Johnson, Cole Morse, Cassie Fire, and Lisa Agler, who  are all superhero nurses and whose commitment to patients supersedes  any fear of this dangerous virus.   And to the thousands of healthcare workers who, due to time  constraints were not mentioned today, please know this: You are the  heroes of this unprecedented time.   This country and your Congressman will forever be grateful. May God  bless each and every one of you, and may we see an end to this global  pandemic very soon.   God bless you.                            ____________________
