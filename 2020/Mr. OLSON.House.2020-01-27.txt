 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind America that Fort Bend  County, Texas, is the ice-skating mecca of our country.   Here is Fort Bend's Tara Lipinski, the youngest woman ever to win a  figure skating gold medal in Olympic history.   I regret that I have some bad news for Tara. She is about to become  the second youngest woman to win a gold medal in skating.   Here is the soon-to-be youngest woman gold medalist. This is Kaylee  Tolleson. She lives in Fort Bend County, just like Tara did. She has  already won a gold medal--her life.   Last year, at 9 years old, young Kaylee found out that she had a  cancerous tumor the size of a softball on her ovary. Kaylee fought to  live. With the love of mom and dad; the miracle workers at Texas  Children's Hospital; and her personal idol, Channel 13 weatherman  Travis Herzog, recently, Kaylee rang a bell. She is now cancer-free.   Mr. Speaker, I invite all of America to watch Kaylee skate in the  World Olympics in 2026 in Milan, Italy. May God bless Kaylee, and we  look forward to watching her on TV.                            ____________________
