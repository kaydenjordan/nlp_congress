 Madam Speaker, I rise today in observance of Women's  History Month to honor Women of Steel, an advocacy-arm of the United  Steelworkers.   Throughout the years, women from diverse backgrounds have played an  instrumental role in paving the way for women in the steel industry.   Among these remarkable leaders was Ola Kennedy, a resident of Gary,  Indiana, who worked for 28 years at Hammond Valve. A devoted community  leader, Ola was involved in many union and civic organizations and was  one of the founding members of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists.   I also want to celebrate Roberta Wood who, along with Ola, cofounded  the steelworker women's caucus in the Chicago-Gary district of the  Steelworkers union. In 1976, Roberta was elected the first female  member of the USWA Local 65's executive board and is currently a member  of the Steelworkers Organization of Active Retirees.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to celebrate Women's History Month and  recognize the role Women of Steel have played to organize, unionize,  rally, and inspire workers to fight for justice. These extraordinary  women continue to be fearless, strong, and vocal advocates for more  women in leadership and carry on the march to fight for full gender  equality in the workplace. I commend these women.                            ____________________
