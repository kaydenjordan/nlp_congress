 Mr. Speaker, the liberal national media have two  choices.   First, they can continue their dislike--some would call it hatred--of  President Trump that results in severely slanted coverage. This is the  road to self-destruction. The media's credibility has hit a record low,  and the American people soon will stop looking to them for news.   Or, second, the liberal national media can start covering President  Trump objectively. This means not portraying his actions in the worst  possible light but sometimes giving President Trump the benefit of the  doubt. It means giving his side of the story. It means, most of all,  recognizing that President Trump represents the legitimate hopes and  fears of millions of Americans.   If the liberal national media continue to treat President Trump  unlike they would a Democrat, the public will grow tired of the double  standard.   The American people have an innate sense of fairness, which the media  should not ignore. For their own sake and for the sake of our  democracy, the media should change their ways.                            ____________________
