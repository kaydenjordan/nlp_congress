 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I, along with  Senator Moran and Senator Murray, be permitted to complete our remarks  before the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the crisis  in Afghanistan and to honor the distinguished service of those who gave  the last full measure of their devotion protecting Americans there.   For the last month, Americans have watched, horrified, at the scenes  of chaos and terror and bloodshed: Americans trapped at the Kabul  Airport, terrified as the enemy closed in; innocent civilians fleeing  for their lives, abandoned by their government; a young man desperately  clinging to a departing plane's landing gear, he was so desperate to  escape, only to fall then to his tragic death; 13 marines, the pride of  our Nation, cut down by terrorists, never to see home again; and, then,  as American planes finally departed, hundreds of American civilians  left behind to the enemy.   Let me say that again: hundreds of American civilians left behind to  the enemy.   And after all of that, who can forget the image of the President of  the United States, declaring this mission that he planned, that he  executed, that he oversaw--this mission that left 13 marines dead, that  left hundreds of American civilians behind enemy lines; this mission  that resulted in chaos and terror and bloodshed--who can forget this  President saying that this mission was, and I quote, ``extraordinarily  successful''?   An extraordinary success--really? Has a Commander in Chief in  American history ever before uttered words like that? Has a Commander  in Chief ever celebrated as ``successful''--``successful''--the  abandonment of American civilians to an enemy, the death of American  soldiers, terrorizing of American citizens and American allies?   I hope I will not live to ever hear again in my lifetime such  shameful and disgraceful words from a President of the United States.   And make no mistake, this President is a disgrace. His behavior is  disgraceful. He has dishonored this country with his shameful  leadership in this crisis, and it is time for him to resign. And if he  had the responsibility of leadership, he would resign for the crisis  that he has himself led this Nation into and the responsibility he  bears for the lives that have been lost and for the American citizens  who are, even now as I speak, trapped in Afghanistan, left to the enemy  because of his failures and his shameful, disgraceful leadership.   Even the shameful performance of America's leaders cannot disguise or  cover over the heroism of America's soldiers, and I want to talk about  one of those soldiers now. He was Marine Corps LCpl Jared Schmitz. He  was from Missouri.   He was from Wentzville, in St. Charles County, to be exact, and he  had wanted to be a marine since he was a teenager. Lance Corporal  Schmitz was only 6 months old when terrorists attacked this country on  September 11, 2001. He wasn't old enough to remember the beginnings of  this long war in which he would go on to so valiantly serve. He had  only graduated from high school, from Fort Zumwalt South High School,  in 2019.   Jared signed up to join the Marines shortly before his 18th birthday.  He had dreamed of it since before his sophomore year. He began training  with recruits even before he enlisted. He wanted to serve this Nation  because he was a man who served others. His father said Jared was  always smiling nonstop. He brought light and hope to every place he  went, and he wanted to bring those gifts and service to his country-- and he did.   He was a fine marine. He was sent on his first deployment to Jordan  earlier this year and then received orders to Afghanistan. Jared  Schmitz, Lance Corporal Schmitz, was there on August 26--there at the  Kabul airport, doing his duty, serving his country, smiling nonstop  when the enemy attacked. And it was there that Lance Corporal Schmitz,  age 20, gave his life for the  [[Page S6470]]  people he loved and for the Nation he served. He died so that others  might live.   I had the privilege of speaking to Lance Corporal Schmitz's family  just hours after we learned of Jared's death. I said this to them, and  I promised that I would say it for the whole Nation: that Jared Schmitz  lived a life of honor, he lived a life worth living, and his sacrifice  was not in vain.   Jared didn't have to serve. He didn't have to deploy halfway around  the world. He didn't have to stand protecting Americans and other  innocent people as disaster unfolded. He didn't have to do any of it.  He chose to do it. He chose to serve. He chose to give his life for  others. That is a hero. That is an American.   Lance Corporal Schmitz deserves this honor. He deserves this  recognition. Frankly, it is the least of what he deserves. And so,  today, I am introducing in this body a resolution to honor Lance  Corporal Schmitz and all the Missourians who made the ultimate  sacrifice during the war in Afghanistan. They will not be forgotten.   Over the last 20 years, we have often heard numbers used to describe  the costs of this long war: $2 trillion spent, over 20,000 soldiers  wounded in action and thousands more who came home with invisible  wounds, and 2,461 American personnel who gave their very lives. But  each of these numbers was a son, a daughter, a husband, or wife, or  father, or friend. They have names. They have lives. And they deserve  to be honored.   As this chapter of American history concludes, I want to recognize in  the Congressional Record each of my fellow Missourians who, during the  war in Afghanistan, made the ultimate sacrifice serving this Nation. I  ask that each of us reflect together and pray together for each one of  the fallen, and also their families who have sacrificed so much, who  have sacrificed all they have to sacrifice. These men and women will  live in our hearts and in the memory of this Nation.   They are Christopher Michael Allgaier; Michael Chad Bailey; Michael  Joe Beckerman; Brian J. Bradbury; Paul Douglas Carron; Jacob Russell  Carver; Joseph Brian Cemper; Robert Keith Charlton; Richard Michael  Crane; Robert Wade Crow, Jr.; Justin Eric Culbreth; Robert G. Davis;  Edward Fred Dixon III; Jason David Fingar; James Matthew Finley;  Zachary Michael Fisher; Jacob Rudeloff Fleischer; Blake Wade Hall;  Nicholas Joel Hand; James Warren Harrison, Jr.; Jonathon Michael Dean  Hostetter; James Roger Ide V; Issac Brandon Jackson; Christopher M.  Katzenberger; Jeremy Andrew Katzenberger; William Jo Kerwood; Daniel  Leon Kisling, Jr.; Donald Matthew Marler; Matthew David Mason; Richard  Lewis McNulty III; Bradley Louis Melton; James Douglas Mowris; Michael  Robert Patton; Joseph Michael Peters; Robert Wayne Pharris; Ricky Linn  Richardson, Jr.; Charles Montague Sadell; Charles Ray Sanders, Jr.;  Ronald Wayne Sawyer; Patrick Wayne Schimmel; Jared Marcus Schmitz;  Roslyn Littman Schulte; Billy Joe Siercks; Adam Olin Smith; Tyler James  Smith; Christopher Glenn Stark; Sean Patrick Sullivan; Philip James  Svitak; Phillip David Vinnedge; Matthew Herbert Walker; Jeffrey Lee  White, Jr.; Matthew Willard Wilson; Vincent Cortez Winston, Jr.;  Sterling William Wyatt; and Gunnar William Zwilling.   Mr. President, the sacrifices of so many brave men and women demand  that we in Congress bring all the facts of this long war to light.  These sacrifices demand that we in Congress prioritize transparency and  full accountability. And these sacrifices demand that we hold  responsible those who bear the blame for the failure of the last month  and of all the months that preceded it.   For 20 years, our soldiers who fought in Afghanistan did what we sent  them there to do. They went after al-Qaida, killed Osama bin Laden, and  prevented terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base for attacking our  homeland. They did their duty, and they did it honorably.   But by now it is abundantly clear President Biden has not done his.  President Biden turned an orderly evacuation into a disaster; that much  is painfully clear.   First, Joe Biden pulled our troops out; then he sent thousands back  in. He failed to protect Americans still in the country. He failed to  account for lethal American military equipment he left behind. He  failed to anticipate worsening conditions on the ground. He failed in  his judgment that the Afghan security forces would hold their own when  our own intelligence estimates said that they wouldn't. He failed to  anticipate a new offensive by the Taliban. He failed again and again  and again until American blood at the Kabul airport paid the price for  that failure. Then he celebrated it as an ``extraordinary success.''   Joe Biden's team is responsible too. Men like Secretary Austin;  Secretary Blinken; Jake Sullivan, the National Security Adviser, they  overestimated the Afghan security forces' willingness to hold the line;  and instead of planning for the worst, they planned for the best.  Because of them, we have Americans stranded behind enemy lines and over  100,000 Afghan refugees arriving now to this country at this eleventh  hour without vetting or precautions.   This was never necessary. It did not have to be this way and it  shouldn't have been. Joe Biden is responsible for today's failure and  now there must be accountability. Instead, the President's team is even  now coming to Capitol Hill and blaming others, shirking responsibility.  That is cowardly.   I, for one, am not willing to look the other way. Let me be clear. I  will not consent to the nomination of any nominee for the Department of  Defense or for the Department of State until Secretary Austin and  Secretary Blinken and Jake Sullivan resign. Leaders take responsibility  for their failures. And the failure of these individuals, the failure  of this administration has cost Americans their lives and has left  American civilians to the enemy. There must be accountability and there  must be a new start.   I believe that a century from now, when the history of this long war  is written by our children's children, they will note the heroism and  the honor of our soldiers and veterans who, in the aftermath of the  worst attacks on our Nation's soil in a century, stood steadfast and  resolute in unity; and who, despite the grave mistakes of their leaders  over many years, served their country with bravery and distinction and  defense of our freedom.   The great Winston Churchill, who was himself the veteran of one war  and leader of another, said this almost 70 years ago:         We have surmounted all the perils and endured all the       agonies of the past. We shall provide against and thus       prevail over the dangers and the problems of the future,       withhold no sacrifice, grudge no toil, seek no sordid gain,       fear no foe. All will be well. We have, I believe, within us       the life-strength and guiding light by which the tormented       world around us may find the harbour of safety, after a       storm-beaten voyage.    Mr. President, I believe, as Americans, we have that life-strength. I  believe we have in us the light and the hope to survive this troubled  time and to provide the world around us the harbor of safety after a  storm-beaten voyage.   God bless our troops.   I yield floor.
