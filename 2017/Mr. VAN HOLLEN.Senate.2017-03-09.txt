 Mr. President, one of the most significant bipartisan  accomplishments of the last Congress was the Every Student Succeeds  Act, the long-overdue reauthorization of K-12 education law. The Every  Student Succeeds Act returned more flexibility to States while ensuring  accountability to ensure that every child gets a quality education.   Today, however, the majority has brought before the Senate a measure  that would take a step backward. This Congressional Review Act  resolution would repeal Department of Education regulations that the  Department put in place to give States and school districts clarity  about their responsibilities under the law and guidance to ensure that  students receive their guaranteed civil rights protections. The  regulations resulted from of a year of stakeholder feedback. States are  already using this guidance to write their State plans.   If we pass this resolution today, we would pull the rug out from  under the very local stakeholders that we promised to empower with the  Every Student Succeeds Act. Passing this resolution would disrupt their  planning process and interfere with their operations. This resolution  would also hurt our most vulnerable students by weakening  accountability and protections for students with disabilities and  students of color.   As the National Disability Rights Center has said, ``To rescind these  regulations would not only be a disservice to the spirit of ESSA and  diminish the efficacy of the law, but would also serve to undermine the  equity of educational opportunity for all students, including students  with disabilities.''   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights concurred,  arguing: ``The underlying accountability and state plan regulation will  help states, districts, and schools to faithfully implement the law and  meet their legal obligations to historically marginalized groups of  students. . . .''   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also opposes repealing this regulation,  saying: ``Just as we believe the Every Student Succeeds Act  incorporates our principles, we believe the [accountability]  regulations do as well. And they provide states with the clarity they  need to move forward.''   The Every Student Succeeds Act was the result of years of painstaking  work and bipartisan compromise. The implementing regulation was the  product of stakeholder input. We should not undermine that important  progress and throw our education system into chaos with this  resolution. I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, today, we commemorate the 75th  anniversary of the founding of Johns Hopkins University's Applied  Physics Laboratory.   I am fortunate to represent Maryland, a State that plays a leading  role in science, technology, and innovation. From NASA's Goddard Space  Flight Center, to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Maryland is at  the frontier of discovery and innovation. Among Maryland's leaders in  space, science, and innovation is the Applied Physics Laboratory, or  APL   From its humble beginnings in a converted auto dealership in Silver  Spring, MD, to its current state-of-the-art facility in Howard County,  APL has designed, built, and launched countless spacecraft and  instruments. Like the Goddard Space Flight Center, APL provides a great  economic boost for Maryland, employing thousands of Marylanders and  generating $1 billion in annual revenues. APL serves both civil and  national security clients, in areas from homeland protection and  undersea warfare to missile systems and biomedicine.   Early on the morning of July 14, 2015, along with representatives  from NASA and the Southwest Research Institute, and my old friend Dr.  Tom Krimigis, I was able to visit APL to witness the Pluto flyby of the  spacecraft New Horizons. I waited eagerly as New Horizons flew 7,800  miles above the surface of Pluto, making it the first spacecraft to  explore the dwarf planet. The excitement and pride in the room was  palpable. Maryland and the Applied Physics Laboratory were once again  playing a critical role in the history of human discovery.   I am grateful for the work that APL has done. And I look forward to  the work that APL will continue to do, well into the future. I join my  Colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, in sponsoring a resolution  congratulating the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab on the  75th anniversary of the Lab's founding.   Humanity has long asked: From where did we come? And are we alone?  Places like APL will help us answer fundamental questions like these. I  am proud to represent them here in the  [[Page S1742]]  U.S. Senate, and I look forward to working with them to keep science,  space, and space technology strong and vibrant in Maryland and the  United States for years to come.   I congratulate APL, Johns Hopkins, and its many partners as they  celebrate this important milestone.                            ____________________
