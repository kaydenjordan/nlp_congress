 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in honor of our guest  chaplain, Marshall Dunbar, of Cross Roads, Texas.   Chaplain Dunbar is the vice president of Spiritual Life and interim  vice president of Programs for Christian Community Action, one of the  largest private nonprofits in north Texas. He has an extensive record  of service to our country and the north Texas community, including  years in active military service, law enforcement, and homeland  security.   Chaplain Dunbar was commissioned into the United States Army Reserve  Chaplain Corps as a chaplain candidate in 2011, beginning his  chaplaincy career at the VA Hospital in Dallas. In 2014, he ended his  military career as a first lieutenant.   Chaplain Dunbar holds a B.S. in ministry and leadership from Dallas  Christian College and a master of divinity in chaplaincy from Liberty  Baptist Theological Seminary. He is currently working toward his doctor  of ministry degree in Christian leadership and spiritual formation at  Dallas Theological Seminary.   I am grateful to Chaplain Dunbar for his service to north Texans and  the American people. It is a true pleasure to have him here in the  House, along with his wife, Melinda, and daughter, Elle-Simone. We are  grateful for his service and we welcome him to the House.                            ____________________
