 Madam President, the Senate had an opportunity  yesterday to affirm our commitment to the dignity of human life. We had  a chance to state plainly that newborn babies who happen to have  survived abortions are entitled to the same legal protections and  professional care as other newborns.   In all honesty, the fact that this legislation even needed to be  written is a sad reminder of the degree to which our society is at risk  of losing some crucial moral bearings, and the fact that the U.S.  Senate could not even vote to advance this bill is beyond dismaying.   The legislation was silent on the abortion issue. All it would have  done is to have affirmed the rights of these newborn babies, but  apparently even that was a bridge too far, not just for the far-left  fringe--not anymore--but for the vast majority of our Democratic  colleagues right here in the Senate.   We are no longer dealing with a normal, traditional Democratic Party;  we are looking at a party that has been dragged so far to the left, it  would have been unrecognizable to folks just a few years ago. In 1996,  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan condemned partial-birth abortion by  comparing it to infanticide. He was a distinguished, mainstream  Democratic Senator from New York about 20 years ago. And today? Ninety- four percent of Senate Democrats could not even vote to protect babies  after they are born. The only explanations they could offer were  bizarre euphemisms and vague references to issues that have no bearing  once a child has already been born alive.   It was a sorry display, but I can say this: This fight isn't over.  The Republicans will not let this stunning extremism from our  Democratic colleagues be the last word on this subject.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, fortunately, the  Senate did make progress in another area. Yesterday, we advanced what  will be the 31st circuit court nomination to be confirmed so far during  the Trump administration.   As I discussed yesterday, Eric Miller has a distinguished record in  both public service and private practice. He holds degrees from Harvard  and the University of Chicago, and his legal experience includes  holding prestigious clerkships on our Nation's highest courts. Yet,  rather than take my word for it, I urge my colleagues to consider the  endorsements of those with whom the nominee has studied and worked.   For example, 54 members of the University of Chicago Law School's  class of 1999, with their wide-ranging views on politics and judicial  philosophy, have offered a ringing endorsement for Eric Miller. In a  letter to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, they cite Mr.  Miller's ``diligent work ethic, his keen legal mind, and his deep  consideration for every legal issue he confronts.'' All in all, his  classmates--many of whom have also been his colleagues over the years-- say that Mr. Miller is ``extraordinarily well qualified to serve as a  Federal judge.''   I urge each of my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm this  fine nominee soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a final matter, anyone who has  been attentive to the news these past few days has learned about the  complete debacle that unfolded in last November's election for North  Carolina's Ninth Congressional District. Soon after election day,  allegations of illegal ballot harvesting and vote tampering clouded a  close result. The wrongdoing seemed to have benefited the Republican  candidate over the Democratic. Just last week, we saw the State Board  of Elections unanimously call for a new election.   For years and years, every Republican who dared to call for  commonsense safeguards for Americans' ballots  [[Page S1448]]  was demonized by Democrats and their allies. We were hit with leftwing  talking points that insisted that voter fraud was not real--it never  happens, they said--that fraud just didn't happen and that modest  efforts to ensure that voters are who they say they are and are voting  in the proper places were really some sinister, rightwing plot to  prevent people from voting.   As you might expect, now that an incident of very real voter fraud  has become national news and the Republican candidate seems to have  benefited, these longstanding Democratic talking points have been  really quiet. We haven't heard much lately from the Democrats about how  fraud never happens. They have gone silent. Now some are singing a  different tune. There is a new interest in ensuring the sanctity of  American elections.   I have been focused for decades on protecting the integrity of  elections, so I would like to welcome my friends on the left to their  new realization. They have just discovered that this subject really  matters, but I have yet to see any evidence that they are actually  interested in cleaning up the conditions that lead to messes like this  one in North Carolina.   At the root of the North Carolina debacle is a practice that is known  as ballot harvesting. Essentially, it is a means by which campaign  representatives can collect absentee ballots on the premise of  delivering them to a polling place or an election office. That is what  ballot harvesting is. So think about it. Who in American politics keeps  long lists of potential voters? Who mobilizes networks of people to go  door-to-door? Who funds and stands up to these kinds of canvassing  organizations? Who does those things?   I am sorry to say that there are not huge teams of politically  neutral Eagle Scouts who rove the country and hope to use ballot  harvesting to politely make voters' lives more convenient. This is not  an Eagle Scout activity. The folks who really lick their lips at the  prospect of mass ballot harvesting are political operatives, of  course--political operatives, interest groups, and one-sided political  machines. This is why many jurisdictions, including in North Carolina,  have outlawed the practice altogether. I will say that again. Many  jurisdictions, including in North Carolina, have outlawed this practice  altogether.   Ballot harvesting threatens to change the nature of our  representative democracy. Forget about persuading people and spurring  them to turn out to the polls; this practice makes elections a kind of  scavenger hunt to see which side's operatives can return to  headquarters with the most ballots in the trunks of their cars, and  once those operatives take ahold of these ballots, the voters have no  way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered.   Of course, a system that invites political operatives to be rewarded  for turning up ballots will open the door to misbehavior. Remember, it  is illegal in North Carolina and in most States for the obvious reason,  but I have noted with interest that the Democrats' new focus on this  practice has yet to extend to California. I wonder why. Well, in  California, it is legal. It is a common practice in California.  California allows anyone--not just family members but anyone--to show  up at polling places on election day with ballots that are not theirs.  Welcome to California.   Reports suggest that Orange County alone saw--listen to this--250,000  absentee ballots dropped off on election day last year. The county's  registrar told the newspaper that some individuals dropped off hundreds  of other people's ballots. We have no way to know if those ballots were  sealed or if the people had even voted when they were harvested. The  only evidence we have that the voter cast his or her ballot is the  signature.   This past election cycle turned out favorably for California  Democrats, amazingly enough. These late-arriving ballots seemed to help  turn several races their way. Maybe this helps explain why: When House  GOP leaders expressed concern over ballot harvesting in California, the  State's Democratic secretary of state mocked their concern by saying:  ``What they call strange and bizarre we call democracy.'' Now ballot  harvesting has thrown out an election result in the U.S. House of  Representatives--legal in California, illegal in North Carolina.   Maybe that helps explain why, as it stands, the Democrat Politician  Protection Act--Speaker Pelosi's massive new Federal takeover of the  way States and communities run their elections--contains no effort  whatsoever to crack down on ballot harvesting. It is not in there.  Instead, it contains provision after provision that would erode the  protections that are supposed to ensure votes reflect the voices of the  voters whose names are on the envelopes.   It contains provision after provision that would erode the  protections that are supposed to ensure that votes reflect the voice of  the voter whose name is on the envelope.   Provision after provision would erode commonsense protections and  bring the guardrails down. So would a serious reform bill aimed to take  away States' abilities to impose meaningful ID or signature  requirements for voters. Would someone concerned about restoring  democracy dismiss signature verification as an obstacle to be removed?  I don't think so.   Perhaps these facts signal that Democrats see a political advantage  in eroding commonsense protections and would rather keep that advantage  than make episodes like the North Carolina mess less likely to happen  in the future.   An example of real-live voter fraud is staring the country right in  the face right now in North Carolina. Yet Democrats choose at this  moment to propose a sprawling Federal takeover of election law that  would erode the integrity of our elections even further.   So that, I think, pretty well underscores what the priorities of  today's Democrat Party is.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    I know of no further debate on the Miller nomination.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
