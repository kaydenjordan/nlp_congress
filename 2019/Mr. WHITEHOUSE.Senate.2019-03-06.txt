 Mr. President, I understand that the majority has the  floor, and so I will be very brief. I have enormous regard for Senator  Blunt and for those who have spoken already. I just want to say that,  for the people who say we want to have a discussion about this issue,  we are so eager to have a discussion about this issue. I come here  every week hoping to have a discussion about this issue, and I would  love to have a discussion about this issue. I would love to have  hearings in the Environment and Public Works Committee about a climate  bill.   I would love to have people working together to solve this problem. I  will say that Senator Schatz and I have a piece of climate legislation  that is not this one, but it does have the support of seven Republican  former chairs of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, six  current and former Republican Congressmen, four former Republican EPA  Administrators and Secretaries of Treasury and State, two former  Republican chairs of the Federal Reserve, and one former Republican CBO  Director. A Republican congressman referred to that bill as not just an  olive branch reaching out to Republicans but an olive limb reaching out  to Republicans.   I hope we can emerge from this with a real conversation about real  bills, and in the context of that, we will be very interested to know  what the Republican proposal is to deal with climate change.   I yield the floor.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I appreciate the courtesy of my  distinguished colleagues.
