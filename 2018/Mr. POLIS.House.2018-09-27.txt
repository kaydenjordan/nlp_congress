 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the 50th anniversary  of Front Range Community College in Colorado, which I am proud to  represent.   The college first opened in 1968 with only 2,000 students enrolled in  a few programs. Today, they have campuses in Fort Collins, Westminster,  Longmont, and Brighton--28,000 students, over 160 degree and  certificate programs.   Over the years, FRCC has seen continual enrollment increases, serving  even more students. Go, Wolves.   During my time in Congress, I have worked with FRCC to reduce the  cost of textbooks, expand access to dual and concurrent enrollment  programs with our school districts, support career and technical  education, and ensure students who have obtained credits are able to  get their associate's degree.   We recognize the hard work and perseverance of the students and the  staff at Front Range Community College as we celebrate the 50th  birthday of Front Range Community College and how it has helped  transform people's lives and communities across Colorado.   For 50 years, Front Range Community College has fostered successful  lives and strong futures for everybody. Congratulations and happy  birthday, FRCC.                            ____________________
