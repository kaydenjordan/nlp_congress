 Madam Speaker, today, my former  colleagues in the North Carolina General Assembly reached an agreement  to pass a new State budget with the expansion of Medicaid.   More than a decade after the Affordable Care Act became law, 95,000  eastern North Carolinians trapped in the Medicaid coverage gap have  been waiting or, in some cases, dying without access to lifesaving  healthcare.   Since entering Congress, healthcare has been my top legislative  priority, having led, co-led, or cosponsored more than 50 bipartisan  pieces of legislation. My very first acts in Congress included  introducing a resolution to affirm support for Medicaid expansion and  restarting the State Medicaid Expansion Caucus.   To the people of eastern North Carolina, know that I stand ready to  fulfill my commitment to Medicaid expansion by working closely with  officials to see this through and tackle the unacceptable healthcare  disparities in our community.                            ____________________
