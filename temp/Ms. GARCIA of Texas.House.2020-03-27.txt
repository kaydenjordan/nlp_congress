 Mr. Speaker, we have never faced a public health  threat of this magnitude.   Hardworking people have lost their jobs and are on the edge of making  rent or putting food on the table. That is why our rescue efforts have  been focused on people.   This bill offers additional unemployment benefits, injects billions  into our healthcare system, provides billions to small businesses to  keep their workers on the payroll, and gives every eligible adult a  $1,200 check and $500 for every eligible child.   However, this bill isn't perfect. It leaves out immigrants who  contribute to our economy, pay taxes, and are also on the front lines  of this pandemic. This virus does not discriminate based on immigration  status or race, and our response shouldn't either.   However, despite this shortcoming, I do plan to vote for this bill,  and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   Hardworking families are at risk. They need help now. Many lives are  at stake.
