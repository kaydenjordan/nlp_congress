 Mr. Speaker, the skyrocketing costs of prescription  drugs are forcing families to make impossible choices every day.   No one in America should have to decide between putting food on the  table and paying for the lifesaving medication their children need, but  pharmaceutical corporations will keep raising their prices for one  simple reason: because they can.   There are a number of things that we can do, and number one is  negotiate prescription drug prices under Medicare; number two, shed  light on the pharmaceutical corporations' drug pricing system; number  three, end patent system abuse by eliminating tactics that thwart  competition; number four, allow safe importation of prescription drugs  from other countries; and number five, ensure access to affordable  drugs through fair trade agreements.   Lukewarm pharma-friendly approaches just won't work. Failing to take  truly meaningful action could mean the difference between life and  death.                            ____________________
