 Madam President, I enjoyed listening to the comments of  my friend from Ohio. I think you guys are going to like the amendment I  am getting ready to offer.   Today I rise to offer an amendment to S. 2155--the Economic Growth,  Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act--of which I am a  cosponsor.   My amendment is a simple correction that would clarify the intent of  this original bill as it relates to custodial banks.   As originally introduced, section 402 was intended to provide better  tailored capital requirements for true custodial banks. However, there  have been concerns raised that the current definition of this section,  following revisions during the committee consideration, could open this  provision to a wider group of financial institutions.   I know that was not the intent of my colleagues, and this technical  correction amendment makes clear that section 402 applies only when the  primary focus of the banking organization is custodial activities.   Section 402 is not intended to provide relief to an organization  engaged in consumer banking, investment banking, or other businesses,  and that also happens to have some custodial business or a banking  subsidiary that engages in custodial activities.   In conclusion, section 402 was intended as a very narrowly tailored  provision, focused on true custodial banks. This technical correction  amendment would clarify the scope of 402.   I am requesting a vote and urge my colleagues to support adoption of  this amendment.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
