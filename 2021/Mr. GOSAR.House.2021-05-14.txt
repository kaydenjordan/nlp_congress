 Madam Speaker, this week is National Police Week. I rise  today to honor the courageous men and women in blue.   We know that a single week is simply not enough to recognize the  service and sacrifice that police officers and their families make.  Thank you for your dedication and thank you for putting your lives on  the line in order to make our communities safer each and every day.   Unfortunately, our brave law enforcement officers have come under  attack by the liberal media and leftists who dangerously and wrongfully  suggest that the answer to all problems is to defund the police. This  growing antipolice rhetoric is disgusting, and it threatens the safety  and security of communities across America.   Members of our law enforcement community regularly face dangerous and  demanding circumstances, yet they possess a willingness to set aside  their own safety for the sake of others.   Let me be perfectly clear, I back the blue 100 percent. You have our  unwavering support and gratitude. Once again, during National Police  Week, thank you for your sacrifices and leadership you provide our  communities. May we never forget how appreciated you are every single  day.                            ____________________
