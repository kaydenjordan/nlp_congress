 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight Raleigh's own Ali  Ingersoll, who won the title of Ms. Wheelchair America last month.   Ms. Wheelchair America is not your typical beauty pageant.  Contestants are evaluated on their community advocacy and achievements,  and the winner carries the responsibility of being a champion for the  61 million Americans living with disabilities.   Ali Ingersoll has embodied that mission since an incident left her  paralyzed 12 years ago. She has dedicated much of her adult life to  advocating for affordable healthcare for individuals with disabilities.   As Ali personally experienced in 2020, insurance companies often deny  coverage of important equipment to help these Americans lead fulfilling  lives. Now, Ali is fighting for full coverage of medically necessary  equipment.   I am honored to represent Ms. Wheelchair America and look forward to  everything she will accomplish in the future.                            ____________________
