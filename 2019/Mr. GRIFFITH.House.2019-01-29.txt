 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate all who have been here today  giving speeches.   The government shutdown is now over, but the crisis continues on the  border. About 10 days ago, I was down on the border, and I saw  firsthand what was happening down there and talked to people who were  down there.   So, hopefully, during this time period, because the Democrats said  repeatedly that if we reopen the government they would negotiate,  hopefully we can negotiate and come to a bipartisan resolution that  will help us to secure our southern border and continue to work on  other ways that we can improve our immigration process.                            ____________________
