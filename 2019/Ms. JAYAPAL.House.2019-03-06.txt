 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today to speak on this  amendment that simply requires unpaid government employees to comply  with the same ethics rules as paid employees.   President Trump has exploited this ethics loophole for his daughter  Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who both work in the  White House.   Requiring your daughter and your son-in-law to be subject to the same  [[Page H2491]]  ethics rules as everyone else is simply basic common sense. It is not a  Democratic issue or a Republican issue, but it is core to our democracy  and our national security.   The purpose of ethics rules, Mr. Chairman, is to ensure that  conflicts of interest do not interfere in the operations of our  government. This is critical so that the American people trust that the  people guiding our country's laws and policies are acting with the best  interests of our country and the American people at heart and not  foreign or business interests. But President Trump's hiring of his  daughter Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as unpaid  advisers has raised serious concerns.   Shortly after the 2016 elections, Ivanka Trump participated in her  dad's meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister as her namesake clothing  brand, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, was simultaneously negotiating a  licensing deal with Sanei International, a company whose largest  shareholder is the Japanese Government.   In addition, her company received preliminary approvals for 16 new  trademarks from China during the President's trade war with China. In  one case, Ivanka Trump and Chinese President Xi dined together at Mar- a-Lago the same day that China approved the three trademarks for the  First Daughter.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the incredible  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), who has been leading this  effort.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, once again, I just reiterate that what we are saying is  whether you are paid or unpaid, you have to go through the same  security clearances; and whether you are paid or unpaid, you have to  deal with the same ethics regulations. Particularly when unpaid  employees are put into serious positions where national security  clearances are required and where they have access to top secret  information, we need to make sure that those ethics rules apply to  everybody.   Now, frankly, we didn't see this as a loophole in the past because it  hasn't been exploited in the same way, but, unfortunately, that is what  is happening now.   Mr. Chairman, I think that this should raise serious concerns for  anybody. We need to make sure that the people who are in our government  are facing the same transparent ethics rules whether you are a relative  of the person in the Oval Office or not.   We have ethics laws for a reason. The United States is not a despotic  country built on nepotism, and we need to make sure that it is in  everyone's best interest when all of these employees are subject to  ethics laws, including laws that prohibit employees from participating  in matters in which they have a financial interest or from misusing  their official positions.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would stop lobbyists from  working on behalf of foreign governments with gross human rights  violations.   Countries with human rights abuses should use the diplomatic process  to express their views and not try to influence the American Government  when hiding behind highly paid K Street lobbyists.   H.R. 1, the For the People Act, is a historic bill that aims to  restore the promise of our Nation's democracy and the culture of  corruption in Washington, reduce the role of money in politics, and  return power back to the American people. My amendment furthers this  goal by limiting the role of dark money in our foreign policy.   Take, for instance, Mr. Chairman, Saudi Arabia. After 9/11, Saudi  Arabia was implicated in the most destructive attack on American soil  in our history. Yet 15 years later, the country was the leading  recipient of U.S. arms sales.   For nearly 4 years, Saudi Arabia has perpetrated the worst  humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, with U.S. military participation in  its bombings and complicity in a blockade that has deprived millions of  food and medicine. Despite the Saudis' indiscriminate killing of  civilians, Secretary of State  [[Page H2492]]  Mike Pompeo has certified that the country has been protecting  civilians just last year.   Most recently, Saudi Arabia murdered U.S.-based journalist Jamal  Khashoggi while President Trump rejected the evidence from his own  intelligence agencies that Saudi Arabia's crown prince ordered the  murder.   How does Saudi Arabia maintain its relationship with the United  States? It shouldn't surprise anyone that Saudi Arabia spent about $27  million on U.S. lobbying and public relations in 2017 alone.   Individuals affiliated with the Trump administration like Paul  Manafort and Michael Flynn have also taken substantial sums of money  from foreign countries to lobby the American Government.   Paul Manafort lobbied on behalf of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine in  2005, and prosecutors allege that Mr. Manafort was working on Ukrainian  politics well into 2018, even after Special Counsel Mueller indicted  him. He didn't even report the payments he was receiving for his  lobbying efforts, in flagrant violation of current law.   Though not charged with lobbying illegally, Manafort has still had a  long history of lobbying on behalf of the world's most brutal  dictators, including Mobutu Sese Seko, Ferdinand Marcos, and Jonas  Savimbi. He is rumored to have accepted a briefcase from a Marcos  affiliate with $10 million in cash to give to the Reagan campaign.   Finally, Michael Flynn, President Trump's former National Security  Advisor, worked on a $15 million plan to kidnap a political enemy of  Turkish President Erdogan and fly him to an island prison. Mr. Flynn  was paid at least $530,000 for lobbying on behalf of the Turkish  Government between August and November of 2016. Mr. Chairman, he did  not retroactively register as a foreign agent with the Justice  Department until March 7, 2017.                                time  1845    This is a commonsense amendment that brings transparency and ensures  that we protect our system from this type of lobbying from those  countries that have gross human rights violations.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues on the other side who  are just quoting the ACLU tonight are with us on everything else that  the ACLU supports. I look forward to seeing that.   I got a little distracted in the last speech, so I wanted to remind  people what we are talking about in this amendment, which is that we  would not allow lobbyists that are working on behalf of foreign  governments with gross human rights violations to actually pay a bunch  of lobbyists and hide behind highly paid K Street lobbyists to get  their agenda.   They should just use the diplomatic process. It is not like they are  not going to have a voice. They can use their diplomatic process.   That is all this amendment is. It is a smart amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment cleans up the so-called legal  defense funds.   Many Americans don't know this, but it is perfectly legal for  government employees to set up a fund to help them pay their legal  bills when they are in trouble with the law. Amazingly, they can pack  this slush fund with unlimited donations from wealthy individuals and  large corporations.   In other words, employees in the White House can fund their legal  defenses with contributions from the President's campaign backers or  people who want to influence the President's decisions.   Not surprisingly, this President's team has set up a legal defense  fund, the Patriot Fund, to help staffers pay for their legal fees  related to the Russia investigation. The Patriot Fund was cleared by  the Office of Government Ethics under the Acting Director, David Apol,  who was appointed by--you guessed it--President Trump.   Former Trump campaign staffer Rick Gates and former National Security  Advisor Michael Flynn have also set up legal defense funds.   According to a political report from a month ago, Sheldon Adelson,  who is the single largest donor to the Trump campaign, and his wife,  Miriam, have each contributed $250,000 to the Patriot Fund, for a total  of half a million dollars.   The fund is flush, Mr. Chair. It is no wonder that one of Trump's  former campaign staffers who has been interviewed by the House  Intelligence Committee referred to the Patriot Fund as ``a real  blessing.''   Trump lawyers have said that decisions about which staffers' legal  funds are paid out of the Patriot Fund will not be related to whether  the individual in question defends the President. But since the fund  manager has sole discretion over who will benefit from the fund, it is  almost impossible to know whether access to Patriot Fund dollars will  be used to reward those who might be loyal to the President. That  creates an extraordinary conflict of interest for any President, not  just this one.   It is time to put a stop to this in perpetuity. That is why I have  offered this amendment to direct the Office of Government Ethics to  promulgate regulations on basic requirements to ensure transparency of  donations to legal defense funds in the executive branch and to ensure  that Federal employees cannot obtain money from prohibited sources.  These regulations will be similar to rules that are already established  for Members of Congress, and I think that that is just common sense.   My amendment closes loopholes and eliminates conflicts of interest in  these legal defense funds in several ways.   First, it limits the gifts and donations that can be made to legal  defense funds to no more than $5,000 per person per year.   Second, it prohibits registered lobbyists, foreign governments, and  individuals involved in activities that are regulated by the agency  that is employing the individual who will receive the legal defense  fund dollars from contributing to their legal defense fund.   Third, it clarifies that employees may not accept gifts and donations  outside of legal defense funds to pay for  [[Page H2494]]  legal fees and expenses from civil or criminal proceedings.   And, fourth, it makes legal defense funds public by requiring that  the source of contributions and the amount of those contributions be  publicly disclosed.   Mr. Chair, this is a sensible amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, in conclusion, I would say this bill, H.R. 1,  is about reclaiming our democracy, ensuring transparency and  accountability for the American people. For evidence of obstruction of  justice, public corruption, and abuses of power for any President and  the people surrounding him, we believe that this bill is essential, and  this amendment is essential.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
