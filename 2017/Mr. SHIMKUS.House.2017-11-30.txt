 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 631, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3017) to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  [[Page H9539]]  Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to reauthorize and improve the  brownfields program, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3017.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3017, the Brownfields  Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act of 2017.  This legislation has broad bipartisan support, and I would like to  thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko.   I would also like to specifically thank a few of my colleagues who  have exhibited leadership and commitment on this issue, Congressman  David McKinley, my fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member, who  introduced this important bill, and my colleagues on the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman John Katko and Congresswoman  Elizabeth Esty who guided a similar bill through their committee.   We have been working closely with our colleagues on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee over these past few months,  and the bill that we will vote on today reflects compromise on both  sides.   The bill takes a very important step in reauthorizing the  Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields program for the first  time since the law was enacted, and so I would like to also thank  Chairman Shuster for his leadership and support as we move forward.   The bill we are voting on today makes several important changes to  the brownfields law that will result in more contaminated sites being  cleaned up and returned to productive use, such as the creation of  multipurpose grants, which will allow communities to use grant funds  for both assessment and remediation, as well as allow communities to  clean up more than one site in a designated area.   The bill also provides liability relief to States and municipalities  who voluntarily acquire brownfields property through their authority as  a sovereign, which will allow local units of government to address  contamination on property they acquire through tax delinquency,  bankruptcy, and/or abandonment.   The bill expands grant eligibility for nonprofit organizations and  for publicly owned brownfields sites that acquired the property prior  to January 11, 2002, which will put more parties into the mix of  persons eligible for grant funding, which will result in more sites  being assessed and cleaned up.   The legislation increases the limit for remediation grants from  $200,000 to $500,000. As we learned from witnesses at our hearings,  this will result in more brownfields sites being cleaned up because  many of the sites that remain to be addressed are more complicated and,  therefore, more expensive.   The bill provides for a limited amount of grant funds to be used for  administrative costs, which will allow small and rural communities to  be able to receive and utilize grant funds, and it carves out grant  money to assist Indian Tribes in small, rural, and disadvantaged  communities as they work to assess and clean up contaminated  properties.   The EPA brownfields program is critical to States and local  communities as they address contaminated industrial and commercial  properties and return them to productive use. Cleaning up these sites  is great for the economy because brownfields grants can be directly  leveraged into jobs, additional redevelopment funds, and increased  residential and commercial property values.   In fact, the brownfields program, on average, leverages over $16 in  private investment for every Federal dollar spent and leverages 8\1/2\  jobs for every $100,000 of brownfields funds expended on assessment and  cleanup.   The brownfields program is a proven results-driven program that has  changed the way contaminated property is perceived, addressed, and  managed. A visible, national example of the brownfields program at work  was the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers facing off in game  three of the World Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas. Minute  Maid Park sits on a former brownfields site that the city of Houston  redeveloped and obviously returned to a very productive reuse,  especially for the Astros.   The EPA brownfields program is uniquely positioned to protect the  environment and spur the economy. You can tell, from the broad  bipartisan support that H.R. 3017 enjoys, the support for the EPA  brownfields program is unqualified. The program has strong support from  local and State governments, private developers, and all sectors of the  economy.   Because brownfields funding is so important to States and local  communities across the country, I want to encourage my colleagues on  the appropriations committee to fully fund this important and  successful program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        I write concerning H.R. 3017, the Brownfields Enhancement,       Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act of 2017. This       legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure will forego action on the       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that foregoing consideration of the bill does       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.       Further, this is conditional on our understanding that       mutually agreed upon changes to the legislation will be       incorporated into the bill prior to floor consideration.       Lastly, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       request your support for the appointment of conferees from       the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.        I would ask that a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest as well as the       mutually agreed upon changes to be incorporated into the bill       be included in the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor, to memorialize our       understanding.        I look forward to working with the Committee on Energy and       Commerce as the bill moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, November 4, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 3017, Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment,       and Reauthorization Act of 2017, on which the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure received an additional       referral.        I appreciate your committee's willingness to forego action       on H.R. 3017 so that this legislation may be brought before       the House of Representatives in an expeditious manner. I       agree that foregoing consideration of the bill does not       prejudice your committee with respect to the appointment of       conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within your committee's Rule X jurisdiction.       Further, I agree that our mutually agreed upon changes to the       legislation will be incorporated into the bill prior to floor       consideration. Lastly, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I will support your request for the appropriate       appointment of conferees from the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure during any House-Senate conference       convened on this or related legislation.        I will place a copy of your letter and this response into       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko), a cosponsor of the legislation and also a major  leader on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gibbs), who is a member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Faso), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.   (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the bill we are voting on today makes  several important changes to the brownfields law that will result in  more contaminated sites being cleaned up.   The changes we are making also bring more parties into the process by  clarifying their eligibility to receive funding under the brownfields  program, including making nonprofit entities eligible to receive all  forms of brownfields funding.   Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency provided us  technical assistance a week ago, telling us that the definition we used  for how to delineate which nonprofit organizations should be included  was too limited, and would exclude a number of important organizations  that the EPA currently provides funding to through the brownfields  program, including the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste  Management Officials, commonly known as ASTSWMO, and other entities  organized under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code that are  involved in the cleanup of brownfields sites around the country.   We need to address this issue as this process moves forward. We need  to figure out how to ensure that these organizations do not lose the  funding that they rely on to make significant contributions to the  brownfields program.   Does the gentleman agree?    I thank the gentleman for his courtesies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am just going to sum up, too, with thanking my ranking member of  the full committee, Mr. Pallone; obviously, my ranking member on the  subcommittee, Mr. Tonko; the associated staffs on both that had been  mentioned numerous times. They did a lot of work in this process. It  was good to get to know the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  a little bit better, and we look forward to working with them more.                                time  1515     I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield the time to the  gentleman. They tell me what to do sometimes, also, even on that side  of the  [[Page H9547]]  aisle; so, happy to yield. I just want to thank them.   Mr. Speaker, everybody has examples of brownfields in their district  throughout the State. They are all pretty good stories about returning  them to productive use.   I have one produced by the EPA from Danville, Illinois. There are  eight sites. We can go through them.   The point is, here is a successful program that we have authorized.  Our appropriators helped appropriate money that really leverages a  little bit of Federal dollars with private or local community dollars  to bring these locations back to productive use. It is a good effort.   Mr. Speaker, we have got other things on the horizon to work together  on. I enjoyed the opportunity to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, I ask them to vote yes on the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
