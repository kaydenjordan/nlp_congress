 Madam Pesident, I intend to offer the following motion  to commit that would send H.R. 1628 to the Finance Committee with  instructions to eliminate any provision that would hurt the clinics  serving miners with Black Lung by increasing the number of uninsured  individuals. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  The motion is supported by Senators Manchin, Brown, Warner, Kaine, and  Coons.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Manchin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would eliminate any provision that would weaken the       financial viability of the Black Lung Clinics serving coal       miners with pneumoconiosis, including any provision that       would cause an increase in the rate of uninsured individuals       in the communities served by those clinics.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to commit that would send H.R. 1628 to the Finance Committee to include  provisions of S. 523, as introduced in the Senate on March 2, 2017, the  Budgeting for Opioid Addiction Treatment Act, commonly referred to as  the LifeBOAT Act. This amendment would increase funding for substance  use disorder treatment by establishing a 1-cent fee on every milligram  of an opioid medication. It would exempt medication assisted treatment  and include a rebate for cancer and hospice patients. I ask unanimous  consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is supported by  Senators Manchin, Murphy, Whitehouse, King, Klobuchar, Nelson,  Heitkamp, Shaheen, Baldwin, and Blumenthal.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Manchin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee;        (2) include the provisions of S. 523, as introduced in the       Senate on March 2, 2017, the Budgeting for Opioid Addiction       Treatment Act (commonly referred to as the ``LifeBOAT Act'');       and        (3) offsets any increased spending that results from such       changes.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to commit that would send H.R. 1628 to the Finance Committee with  instructions to include provisions that would improve health literacy  and access to wellness programs and provisions to encourage State and  local governments to educate their constituents about healthy choices.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is  supported by Senator Blumenthal.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Manchin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would--        (A) improve health literacy and access to wellness       programs, including through Medicaid managed care and health       insurance plans that offer education and wellness incentives;       and        (B) encourage State and local health officials to expand       health literacy and wellness programs, particularly among the       newly insured.
