 Madam Speaker, the Salad Bowl of the world lost a key  ingredient this week with the sudden passing of Dennis Caprara. In his  74 years, Dennis contributed so much to our leading industry of  agriculture and our fundamental identity in the Salinas Valley.   A true local boy, Dennis grew up in Gonzales, grew fond of farming,  and grew to appreciate the hard work and sound judgment necessary to  succeed in agriculture.   Starting RC Farms and RC Packing, Dennis and his family became the  definition of what it means to be a successful family farm.   But Dennis was not just a farmer, he was a leader; chairman of the  Grower-Shipper Association, director of the Salinas Valley River  Coalition, and a distinguished fellow at a local college.   Dennis also gave back to the community that gave him so much; as a  member of the Swiss Rifle Club, and always attending the local  livestock auctions where he and his wife, Janice, were active bidders,  supporting the kids of 4H and FFA.   Dennis was a friend and a mentor to many, including myself. And  although he often fondly called me a donkey, not necessarily referring  to my political party, he offered so much more to those who knew him,  who worked with him, who listened to him, and who loved him.   Madam Speaker, today we mourn the loss of Dennis Caprara. But because  of Dennis, every day we realize that the Salad Bowl of life tastes so  good, not just because of its products, but also because of its people.                            ____________________
