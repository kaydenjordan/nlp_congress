 Mr. President, after 4 years of Secretary DeVos'  efforts to promote greater privatization of our education system and  dismantle the civil rights of students, Miguel Cardona is the person we  need to restore the promise of America's schools. A former public  school teacher who went on to be a leader in the same district where he  was once an English learner, Dr. Cardona has demonstrated a lifelong  commitment to our public schools and the belief that all children are  entitled to a quality education in a safe and nurturing learning  environment. He also has a proven track record of effectively  responding to the pandemic, helping students overcome the digital  divide, and safely reopening schools as the Connecticut Education  Commissioner.   The pandemic has upended our education system, disrupting learning  and exacerbating inequities. From day one as Secretary of the  Department of Education, Dr. Cardona will need to be prepared to meet  the challenges facing our students and educators, from addressing  learning loss and social, emotional, and mental health to reversing  declining higher education enrollment rates and a sky-rocketing  affordability crisis. Additionally, as deep disparities continue to  shortchange low-income students, students of color, and students with  disabilities, Dr. Cardona will be a key partner in working toward  closing these funding and educational opportunity gaps.   I am proud to support Dr. Cardona's nomination, and I look forward to  working together to at last make good on our promises to fully fund  title I and IDEA, to expand access to quality early childhood education  and community schools, and to ensure higher education is accessible for  everyone.
