 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 667 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 667         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3755) to       protect a person's ability to determine whether to continue       or end a pregnancy, and to protect a health care provider's       ability to provide abortion services. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived.

Sec. 7. (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Friday, September 24, 2021, the Speaker may entertain motions       offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the House       suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV with       respect to multiple measures described in subsection (b), and       the Chair shall put the question on any such motion without       debate or intervening motion.        (b) A measure referred to in subsection (a) includes any       measure that was the object of a motion to suspend the rules       on the legislative day of July 26, 2021, July 27, 2021, or       September 21, 2021, in the form as so offered, on which the       yeas and nays were ordered and further proceedings postponed       pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX.        (c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.        Sec. 8. (a) Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule XX or section       7 of House Resolution 555, further proceedings on a vote by       the yeas and nays on the question of adoption of a motion       that the House suspend the rules offered on the legislative       day of July 26, 2021, or July 27, 2021, may continue to be       postponed through the legislative day of October 1, 2021.        (b) Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule XX, further       proceedings on a vote by the yeas and nays on the question of       adoption of a motion that the House suspend the rules offered       on the legislative day of September 21, 2021 may be postponed       through the legislative day of October 1, 2021.        Sec. 9.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 555, agreed to July       27, 2021), is amended by striking ``September 22, 2021'' each       place it appears and inserting (in each instance) ``October       27, 2021''.        Sec. 10.  The ordering of the yeas and nays on the motion       that the House suspend the rules and pass S. 2382 is vacated       to the end that the motion be considered as withdrawn.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 667, providing for consideration of  three measures.   First, H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act, under a closed  rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman  Pallone, provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 4350, the  National Defense Authorization Act, under a structured rule. The rule  self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Smith, provides 1  hour of debate on the bill equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services, and  provides one motion to recommit. The rule makes in order 476  amendments, provides en bloc authority, and provides one motion to  recommit.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 5305, the  Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act,  under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate on the bill  equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority  member of the Committee on Appropriations, and provides one motion to  recommit.   The rule provides the majority leader or his designee the ability to  en bloc requested roll call votes on certain suspension bills through  September 24. Requested roll call votes on certain suspension bills may  be postponed through October 1.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same day authority to October 27 and provides that the ordering of  the yeas and nays on the motion that the House suspend the rules and  pass S. 2382 is vacated.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the three bills in this rule, H.R.  4350, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022; H.R.  5305, the continuing resolution; and H.R. 3755, the Women's Health  Protection Act.   I want to start by recognizing the contributions of the North  Carolinians and all American servicemembers who served in Afghanistan  over the past 20 years. Your sacrifices will never be forgotten.   It is in honor of these American heroes that I am proud to support  the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. This bill  invests in our servicemembers and their families and ensures that the  United States is ready to confront future threats to our Nation.   This NDAA provides our men and women in uniform with a 2.7 percent  pay increase; makes critical changes to how the military addresses  sexual assault; and improves TRICARE coverage and benefits, including  by removing cost sharing for contraceptive coverage.   I am grateful that three of my amendments were made in order. Two of  these amendments aim to support military women and families by  requiring reports on access to menstrual products and accommodations  and on potential TRICARE coverage of preconception and prenatal genetic  carrier screening tests.   My other amendment expands the definition of PFAS to better align  with the current science. This change will help keep our servicemembers  and all Americans safe from toxic chemicals.  [[Page H4566]]    In addition to supporting our military personnel, this legislation  supports American innovation through a 32 percent increase in defense- wide research, development, testing, and evaluation. It also ensures  that our HBCUs and other minority institutions are more able to  contribute to DOD research and development.   Finally, this bill continues our commitment to supporting our Afghan  allies by authorizing $500 million for the Department of Defense to  support the relocation of at-risk Afghans.   The continuing resolution included in this rule also supports efforts  to evacuate our allies from Afghanistan. Afghans arriving to the U.S.  or awaiting processing overseas need medical care, food, housing, and  other assistance. This funding will ensure the government agencies  involved in the resettlement process have the capacity necessary to  help our Afghan allies build new lives in safety in the United States.   In addition, the continuing resolution ensures that our government  remains funded, raises the debt ceiling, and provides relief to areas  devastated by Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters.   Democrat or Republican, we are all Americans. We all benefit when our  democracy and economy are healthy, and we all suffer when our country  is in crisis.   Every Member in this body was elected to represent our fellow  Americans. It would be a dishonor to the trust they bestowed upon us if  we let the government shut down or allow the country to default on the  full faith and credit of the United States.   This CR will provide much-needed relief to communities devastated by  recent hurricanes and other disasters like the California wildfires.   Thousands of homes have been destroyed, and many Americans still have  limited access to fresh water and electricity. Additional delays in  relief could be the difference between life and death.   Lastly, this rule includes the Women's Health Protection Act, which  safeguards reproductive freedom for people across this country.   Roe v. Wade has been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. With  this bill, the House is stepping in following the Supreme Court's  failure to uphold decades of American jurisprudence.   This bill affirms what our Constitution and international human  rights bodies have long upheld: that access to reproductive care is  central to health and equality. A woman living in Texas should have the  same access to care as a woman living in California.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Military.com article  entitled ``Defense Bills Would Provide New Food Allowance for Low- Income Military Families.''                     [From Military.com, July 27, 2021]  Defense Bills Would Provide New Food Allowance for Low-Income Military                                  Families                             (By Patricia Kime)         A House panel is weighing a $770 billion defense policy       bill that includes a provision to give lower-income military       families a basic needs allowance--a stipend that advocacy       groups say would relieve stress and ``food insecurity'' among       U.S. troops.        The draft of the House's 2022 National Defense       Authorization Act released Tuesday contains a provision       similar to the Senate's proposal that would provide service       members additional money for food and other basics if their       household incomes do not exceed 130% of the federal poverty       level--which in 2021 meant $21,960 for a family of three,       $26,500 for a family of four, and slightly higher for even       larger families.        This is the third time the proposal has been incorporated       into the House defense policy bill; unlike previous years, it       also has been included in the 2022 Senate defense bill,       increasing the likelihood that it will pass later this year.        For an E-4 with several years in the military, a spouse and       two children, the stipend could equate to roughly $250 extra       a month.        Advocates say the provision is needed as junior military       service members face the stresses of supporting families in       areas where spouse employment is low or child-care expenses       make it difficult to pay monthly bills.        ``When I got to the [Defense Department], I started talking       about food insecurity, and I really did get a look that said       to me, `We really don't think we have a problem,' '' Patty       Barron, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Military       Community and Family Policy, said at an event on military and       veterans food insecurity Tuesday.        The data is mixed on the extent of food insecurity among       military families. This year, the Defense Department's       Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation found that an       estimated 880 to 4,690 U.S. service members use the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a rate of       between .08% and .42% of troops. Civilian usage of SNAP, also       known as food stamps, is 9.6%.        Critics note, however, that the report pulled data from       only two months in 2019, and the data does not include       numbers from 40% of states, including several with large       military populations such as California, Hawaii and Virginia.        ``The reason we thought we didn't have a problem is, we       were looking at the low SNAP numbers, and we believe we are       compensating our people well, and if not, they will promote       out of it and get those pay raises to solve the problem,''       Barron added.  [[Page H4568]]         ``The department is much more aware of the issue now, and       it is one of Secretary [Lloyd] Austin's biggest priorities,''       Barron said during the discussion hosted by the Center For       Strategic and International Studies.        A survey released in May found that nearly 33% of more than       5,600 respondents at an unidentified Army installation were       considered marginally food insecure, meaning they faced food       hardship or had difficulties ensuring that their food budget       stretched through the end of the month.        And according to a report from the organization MAZON: A       Jewish Response to Hunger, one in eight military families       experiences food insecurity compared with one in 10 in the       U.S. civilian population.        ``The mental health of our service members is key to their       long-term connection to the military and the well-being of       their families, and given that we find service members'       mental health is associated with food insecurity, addressing       food insecurity may be one way to address [mental health       issues],'' said Matthew Rabbitt, an economist with the USDA       Economic Research Service, during the CSIS event.        The House Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee will       consider its portion of the 2022 National Defense       Authorization Act on Wednesday. The bill is expected to be       debated by the full committee on Sept. 1 and must be       reconciled with the Senate's version before it can become       law.        The proposed legislation provides for a 2.7% pay raise for       military personnel in 2022 and a number of other benefits,       including an increase in parental leave for service members       and designated caregivers as well as foster parents,       expansion of the department's in-home, child-care pilot       program and the establishment of an advisory council to       support the services' Exceptional Family Member Programs.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable that members of our armed services  and their families are going hungry. I have heard about this in my home  State of North Carolina, where there are food banks associated with  military bases.   I am grateful that this 2022 NDAA will provide servicemembers  additional money for food and other basic needs. No one in America  should go hungry, especially those serving our country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2022 NDAA authorizes funding for  cybersecurity investments in people, programs, and technology. It  directs the executive branch to establish a cyber-threat information  collaboration environment which will facilitate the transmission,  sharing, and analysis of cyber-threat information, which is so crucial,  particularly at this time.   This legislation implements key recommendations of the National  Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence by authorizing funding  for key AI-related initiatives, including investments in the workforce,  emerging technologies research, and support for our small business  contractors.   Additionally, the legislation authorizes funding to support  biological threat reduction programs, requires a publicly available  report on threats regarding weapons of mass destruction by China and  Russia, and directs a report on biosecurity efforts across the  Department of Defense, all needed and crucial investments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight an amendment that is sponsored by  several of our colleagues that will be in the NDAA and that we will  hear more about this evening and tomorrow. It deals with PFAS, forever  chemicals. We have debated issues about PFAS on this floor, but  unfortunately members of our armed services sometimes end up being  human guinea pigs for these PFAS.   This amendment will deal with many of these concerns. It directs the  Secretary of Defense to provide DOD medical providers with mandatory  training with respect to the potential health effects of PFAS. We have  seen this in North Carolina, particularly at Fort Bragg.   It requires the EPA to obtain analytical reference standards for  PFAS, for the development of protocols and methodologies and  enforcement activities.   It clarifies the scope of PFAS data reporting from the 2020 NDAA.   It amends title III, section 318 to clarify that DOD must comply with  safe incineration of PFAS as enacted in section 330 of the NDAA of  fiscal year 2020.   It requires the report on DOD progress to comply with EPA safe PFAS  disposal guidelines, and it requires that this report be submitted one  year after enactment of the act, and it includes that they report to  the Committee on Armed Services.                                time  1700    It requires the report to include the actions the DOD has taken to  comply with that section. It defines the scope of prohibition to ensure  that PFAS materials sent to third-parties for disposal are also covered  by the provisions.   It expresses the sense of Congress that the Air Force has  contaminated real property with PFOS and PFOA chemicals, and it should  use existing authority to acquire property and provide relocation  assistance.   It requires a report detailing contamination sites and acquisition  and relocation status.   It requires a national primary drinking water regulation for PFAS,  and clarifies congressional intent by requiring manufacturers to  disclose all PFAS discharges over 100 pounds.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to point out some additional benefits  of this NDAA in dealing with global challenges.   H.R. 4350 invests in tools to combat the unprecedented challenge of a  global pandemic, racial inequities, and a deepening climate emergency.   The NDAA authorizes funding for national defense and prioritizes  programs and policies to confront the growing threat of China and  Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, there are additional wonderful amendments  dealing with cybersecurity that are in the NDAA.   We will hear again about another cybersecurity training pilot program  for the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans and members of the  Armed Forces transitioning from service to civilian life. It creates a  registered apprenticeship program at the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency focused on cybersecurity and  infrastructure security. Both programs will be established in  coordination with the Department of Defense.   We know that we do not have enough people in civilian life with this  cybersecurity training as we face these threats like we saw in my home  State of North Carolina with the Colonial Pipeline.   Having this transition from DOD to civilian life and having  supportive apprenticeship programs will go a long way to fighting  cybersecurity.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 101  faith-based religious and civil rights organizations expressing their  support for H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act.                                                      June 16, 2021.      Hon. Dick Durbin,      Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Blumenthal,      Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on The           Constitution, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Ted Cruz,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,           Subcommittee on The Constitution, Washington, DC.     101 Faith-Based, Religious, & Civil Rights Organizations Express               Support for the Women's Health Protection Act         Dear Senators Durbin, Grassley, Blumenthal, Cruz, and       Committee Members: As faith-based, religious, and civil       rights organizations that share a commitment to religious       freedom and the separation of religion and government, we       write to express our strong and unequivocal support for S       1975, the Women's Health Protection Act.        We affirm our nation's founding principle of religious       liberty, which is integrally bound to reproductive freedom.       Religious liberty includes the right to follow one's own       faith or moral code in making critical, personal reproductive       health decisions, without political interference. While we       respect the right of every individual, including our       lawmakers, to hold their own personal and religious beliefs,       our country's Constitution demands that no one impose a       single religious viewpoint on all through civil law or       regulation. The Women's Health Protection Act is essential       legislation that embodies these shared ideals.        The Women's Health Protection Act is urgently needed. The       nearly 500 abortion bans and restrictions enacted since 2011       have severely reduced or eliminated abortion access  [[Page H4572]]       in large swaths of the country and fall hardest on those who       already face barriers to accessing health care--including       women; Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC); those       working to make ends meet; members of the LGBTQI+ community;       immigrants; young people; those living in rural communities;       and people with disabilities. The Women's Health Protection       Act is an important bill that would enact protections on the       federal level to safeguard access to high-quality care and to       secure constitutional rights by protecting patients and       providers from political or religious interference.        Rather than face onerous barriers due to their economic       status, employment status, or zip code, this bill would       ensure that each person can make a decision about abortion       led by their own circumstances, faith, or beliefs. It would       also protect the religious liberty of individual health care       providers seeking to administer quality care to their       patients and enable providers to deliver abortion services       free from burdensome restrictions designed to impede access       rather than improve patient health.        We believe in compassion, justice, and dignity for all,       compelling us to speak out for social justice and the right       of every person to access comprehensive, affordable, and       equitable reproductive health care. A compassionate nation       ensures equal access to quality, timely health abortion care       for everyone, an essential factor to social and economic       participation, reproductive and moral autonomy, and the right       to determine our own lives. In contrast, laws that limit the       availability of abortion disrespect human dignity, erode       constitutional rights, exact far-reaching health and economic       consequences, and ignore the moral agency of physicians       seeking to provide compassionate care.        Furthermore, laws that eliminate options for some based on       their geographic location are profoundly unjust, pushing care       out of reach for the most marginalized among us. We cannot       remain idle as state laws transform our country into a map of       ``haves and have-nots'' with regard to access to reproductive       health services. We call on Congress to pass Women's Health       Protection Act to protect access to abortion and to help us       build a society where all can participate equally and thrive       in our communities with dignity.        Every day, we support equal, fair, and comprehensive access       to health care and respect for personal decision-making. We       support the Women's Health Protection Act as a means to this       end and urge you and your colleagues to do the same. The       117th Congress must act in solidarity with people and       communities fighting for racial, economic, and reproductive       justice and commit to protecting the right of every person to       make their own decisions about their bodies, free from       discrimination and political interference. It is the right       thing to do.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Nurses United, dated September 21 expressing their resounding  support for H.R. 3755.   The letter states: ``On behalf of the 175,000 registered nurses  represented by the National Nurses United, we write to you today to  endorse the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021 sponsored by  Representative Chu. We strongly urge you to vote `yes' on this critical  piece of legislation when it is brought to the floor of the House of  Representatives.''                                         National Nurses United,                                                 September 21, 2021.        Dear Representative: National Nurses United supports the       right of all women and people who can get pregnant to full       and equal healthcare services, including reproductive and       family planning health services as a fundamental human right.       On behalf of the 175,000 registered nurses represented by       National Nurses United (NNU), we write to you today to       endorse the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021 (HR 3755)       sponsored by Representative Judy Chu. We strongly urge you to       vote yes on this critical piece of legislation when it is       brought to a vote on the floor of the House of       Representatives.        The Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA) establishes a       statutory right for health professionals to provide abortion       care without any medically unnecessary restrictions or       limitations that impede access to abortion. With increasing       attacks on reproductive rights, it is critical that Congress       swiftly takes steps to protect access to abortion and       reproductive health care.        Nurses, the majority of whom are women, play an essential       role in the delivery of reproductive health services for       millions of patients every day, and we have a duty to       advocate for the health and safety of our patients. Without       access to abortion services, patients who are pregnant may be       at risk of illness and death due to pregnancy, or may be at       risk of avoidable complications from unsafe and illegal       abortion practices. Further, access to quality reproductive       healthcare allows people to make decisions for themselves on       whether and when to have children, an essential component of       equality that enables full participation in our society.       Nurses know that unless we bring down the barriers to care,       people will go without the necessary healthcare they deserve.        The decision to have an abortion is a decision that should       be made between a person and their healthcare providers--it       is not a decision that politicians have any right to be       engaged in. Patients have the right to seek abortion care       with the counsel of a trusted healthcare provider, regardless       of where they live, and it is critical that Congress protects       that right.        We urge you to stand with nurses and vote yes on HR 3755 to       protect the right of all people to access abortion care and       reproductive health services.            Sincerely,      Bonnie Castillo, RN,        Executive Director, National Nurses United.      Deborah Burger, RN,  [[Page H4573]]         President, National Nurses United.      Zenei Cortez, RN,        President, National Nurses United.      Jean Ross, RN,        President, National Nurses United.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 20  medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, and the American  Medical Women's Association, to name a few, expressing their support  for H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act.                                                      June 14, 2021.      Hon. Richard Blumenthal,      U.S Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Judy Chu,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Blumenthal and Representative Chu: On behalf       of the undersigned medical organizations, representing       physicians dedicated to advancing the health of our patients,       thank you for introducing the Women's Health Protection Act       (S. 1975/H.R. 3755). The purpose of your legislation--to       protect the patient-physician relationship and preserve the       ability of physicians to provide evidence-based care to their       patients----is critically important.        Federal, state, and local lawmakers have long played an       important role in our health care system. The myriad policies       aimed at addressing the ongoing COVID-19 public health       emergency provide a prime example of legislators acting to       improve the health of their constituents. However, physician       leaders have long raised concerns, including in a New England       Journal of Medicine commentary nearly a decade ago, about the       alarming increase in legislators ``overstepping the proper       limits of their role in the health care of Americans to       dictate the nature and content of patients' interactions with       their physicians.'' This overreach has taken many forms,       including creating unnecessary obstacles for patients trying       to access medically appropriate care, forcing physicians to       practice outside the bounds of evidence-based medicine, and       criminalizing physicians for providing compassionate and       evidence-based care. The communities most impacted by these       barriers are those already experiencing grave inequities in       the health care system. The Women's Health Protection Act       would address an area of medicine systematically targeted       with government overregulation--reproductive health care--by       prohibiting these inappropriate restrictions and restoring       the ability of patients to receive comprehensive care free       from legislative intrusion.        Thank you again for sponsoring this important legislation       to prevent legislative interference in the practice of       medicine and protect the patient-physician relationship.            Sincerely,        American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists;       American Academy of Family Physicians; American Academy of       Pediatrics; American College of Physicians; American       Gynecological & Obstetrical Society (AGOS); American Medical       Women's Association (AMWA); American Psychiatric Association;       American Society for Reproductive Medicine; Council of       University Chairs of Obstetrics and Gynecology (CUCOG);       Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology       (IDSOG).

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 16  attorneys general expressing their support for H.R. 3755, the Women's  Health Protection Act.                                                 State of New York,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                                      June 16, 2021.      Hon. Dick Durbin,      Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Blumenthal,      Chair, Senate Committee on the Constitution,      Washington, DC.       Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Ted Cruz,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,           Subcommittee on the Constitution, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairs and Ranking Members of the Committee and       Subcommittee: As the Supreme Court has consistently       recognized, ``[t]he ability of women to participate equally       in the economic and social life of the Nation has been       facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive       lives.'' Accordingly, laws that impose an undue burden on a       woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy are       unconstitutional. Nonetheless, many states across the country       have enacted laws in the name of promoting women's health       that do not, in fact, advance women's health or safety but       are instead designed to restrict access to abortion services.       These include laws requiring physicians have admitting       privileges at hospitals and setting arbitrary requirements at       women's health clinics for the size of procedure rooms and       corridors. As the Attorneys General of our respective states,       we write in support of the Women's Health Protection Act,       which would protect the constitutional right to abortion by       prohibiting medically unnecessary restrictions that       specifically target abortion providers and undermine the       availability of abortion services.        The Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA) targets onerous       state laws that have been adopted in a concerted strategy to       restrict access to abortion. In Whole Woman's Health v.       Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292 (2016), the Supreme Court ruled       that a Texas law that required abortion providers to maintain       admitting privileges at a local hospital failed to advance       women's health and posed an undue burden on women seeking an       abortion. Last year, a coalition of 22 attorneys general       helped to win another victory in June Medical Services v.       Gee, 140 S. Ct. 2103 (2020), in which the Supreme Court held       that a similar law in Louisiana was unconstitutional. Rather       than waiting for medically unnecessary restrictions to       continue to be challenged in the courts--a process that can       often take years--Congress should pass the WHPA to ensure       that such restrictions are not imposed in the first place.       Medically unnecessary restrictions targeting abortion       providers actually disserve women's health and safety and       pose challenges for states that aim to provide a full range       of reproductive health services, including abortion services.        Often, strict requirements imposed on abortion providers       are presented as measures to protect and advance women's       health. Yet evidence shows that these restrictions instead       lead to worse health outcomes for women. One recent study in       Texas found that the maternal mortality rate in the state       doubled between 2010 and 2012, a period in which access to       women's health care services, including abortion services,       had become more difficult to obtain. Women who find       themselves too far from an abortion provider may have to       delay obtaining an abortion, which can. lead to health risks       and add to the cost of the procedure. Alternatively, some       women may resort to ``black market'' or self-induced       abortions, which can be extremely dangerous and lead to       serious injury or even death. And women who are forced to       carry a pregnancy to term after being denied abortion       services are four times more likely to develop potentially       life-threatening health conditions and are substantially more       likely to experience physical violence from abusive partners       or family members. These statistics illustrate the very real       cost to women throughout the United States from burdensome       laws that restrict the availability of safe and legal       abortion care. The widely known negative effects of laws       targeting abortion providers undermines any argument that       such laws are intended to promote women's health.        At the same time, the consequences of these laws are       already evident across the country. Research from 2017 found       that thirty-eight percent of women between the ages of 15 to       44 live in counties without an abortion clinic. Between 2014       and 2017, twenty-five abortion clinics shuttered in the South       and the Midwest. As of June 2019, six states have only a       single abortion clinic remaining. As providers close due to       the impact of medically unnecessary restrictions, women are       likely to be forced to travel farther and make greater       sacrifices to get access to services. Unfortunately, these       burdens often fall disproportionately on lower-income women       who cannot afford to travel, take time off work, or find       childcare in order to get to the nearest provider.        As Attorneys General, we are committed to ensuring that       each state satisfies its constitutional obligation to protect       the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy within its       borders. Among other things, we are deeply concerned about       protecting the constitutional rights of our residents who may       need medical care while present as students, workers, or       visitors in states with drastically restricted abortion       access. In addition, a substantial reduction in the       availability of abortion services in some states can cause       women to seek medical care in other states, thereby straining       their health care systems. Indeed, history shows that many       women will cross state lines, if they have the means to do       so, when abortions are unavailable in the states where they       live. For example, in the nearly three years between New York       State's liberalization of its abortion laws in 1970 and 1973       when the United States Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade ruled       that the right to choose was constitutionally protected,       close to 350,000 women came to New York from other states       where abortions were entirely or largely unavailable.In the       wake of recent abortion restrictions, some states, including       several of our own, have experienced a substantial influx of       out-of-state patients seeking abortions as a result of       reduced access in their home states.        Our states stand ready and willing to provide reproductive       care services to those who need them. However, a significant       and sudden increase in patients seeking abortions, especially       as a consequence of laws that do not advance women's health       and decrease available services, runs the risk of straining       the health care systems of less restrictive states. This in       turn can impair the availability of care and affect the       reproductive  [[Page H4574]]       choices of both residents and non-residents alike in those       states. Our states aim to continue providing a wide range of       reproductive health care services, including abortion       services, but our ability to do so could be substantially       burdened by the responsibility of ensuring that all women in       need of abortions are able to safely obtain one. The WHPA       would address this problem by safeguarding access to abortion       services in all states.        We support the passage of the WHPA given how it will help       to restore and facilitate access to abortion services       throughout the United States, upholding this critical       constitutional right. We look forward to working with you and       your committees as you consider this legislation. Please let       us know how we may be of assistance during this process.            Sincerely,          Letitia James, New York Attorney General; Rob Bonta,             California Attorney General; Philip Weiser, Colorado             Attorney General; William Tong, Connecticut Attorney             General; Kathleen Jennings, Delaware Attorney General;             Karl A.

Herring,             Virginia Attorney General; Bob Ferguson, Washington             State Attorney General.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Following the withdrawal from Afghanistan, we have a solemn duty to  provide for our servicemembers and to keep our promise to our Afghan  allies. The fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act will do  both.   This NDAA will also invest in our Nation's defense by promoting  cutting-edge research and development, much of which happens at our  institutions of higher education, such as those in North Carolina's  Research Triangle.   We also must pass the continuing resolution in order to support our  Afghan allies, provide relief to regions recovering from Hurricane Ida  and other natural disasters, suspend the debt limit, and keep our  government funded.   Finally, we must pass the Women's Health Protection Act to enable  women across the country to access reproductive healthcare, including  abortion care.   I want to highlight a discrepancy between the rhetoric and policies  of opponents of reproductive freedom, particularly those from States  like mine, including Texas. These opponents claim to be pro-life, to be  working to protect families and babies, but almost always, these are  the same people who oppose Medicaid expansion, universal childcare, and  the expansion of the child tax credit.   In the United States today, babies that do not get prenatal care are  five times more likely to die than babies that do get prenatal care.  Prenatal care is one of the many critical forms of healthcare that  Medicaid covers.   Medicaid also provides postpartum care coverage to new mothers, and  the American Rescue Plan gave States the option to extend that coverage  from 60 days to 12 months. Postpartum care is key to protecting new  mothers from a variety of serious conditions that can develop after  birth. Similarly, universal childcare and the child tax credit are  investments in babies and in families.   Today, in America, supporting children and families means supporting  Medicaid expansion, affordable childcare, tax benefits for families-- all of which are included in the Build Back Better Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.  [[Page H4575]]    The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 667    At the end of the resolution, add the following;         Sec. 11. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 4828) to secure the international borders of the       United States, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Homeland Security; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 12. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4828.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
