 Mr. Speaker, Saturday marks the end of  Immigrant Heritage Month, an annual tradition dedicated to celebrating  the contributions immigrants have made to communities all across the  country.   Our Nation was founded by immigrants. The very existence of our  entire democracy, of this institution, is the result of compromise and  consensus by the descendants of immigrants, and today our Nation  continues to owe a great debt of gratitude to the contributions of more  recent arrivals who are an essential part of daily life, our economy,  and our society.   I had hoped we would be able to close out this celebration with the  news that, for the first time in a long time, Congress had come  together to fix our broken, inefficient, unfair immigration system.  Instead, a bipartisan majority decided to double down on the status  quo: a porous border, uncertainty for the victims of a broken  immigration system, and continued division between Americans over the  issue of immigration.   Despite this setback, I am hopeful that, working with any colleague  that is willing to do so in this House, I and other Members can find a  solution to this broken immigration system and, in doing so, help heal  our country's politics.                            ____________________
