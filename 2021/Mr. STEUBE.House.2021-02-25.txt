 Mr. Speaker, unlike most speeches you will hear on this  floor today, I am going to start with the truth.   Deuteronomy 22:5 states: A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a  man wear women's clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who  does this.   Now, this verse isn't concerned about clothing styles but with people  determining their own sexual identities. It is not clothing or personal  style that offends God but, rather, the use of one's appearance to act  out or take on a sexual identity different from the one biologically  assigned by God at birth. In his wisdom, God intentionally made each  individual uniquely either male or female.                                time  1500    When men or women claim to be able to choose their own sexual  identity, they are making a statement that God did not know what he was  doing when he created them. I am going to quote directly from Dr. Tony  Evans' commentary Bible on this passage of Scripture: ``Men and women  equally share in bearing the image of God, but he has designed them to  be distinct from and complementary toward one another. The gender  confusion that exists in our culture today is a clear rejection of  God's good design. Whenever a nation's laws no longer reflect the  standards of God, that nation is in rebellion against  [[Page H655]]  him and will inevitably bear the consequences.''   Mr. Speaker, I am going to read that line again. ``Whenever a  nation's laws no longer reflect the standards of God, that nation is in  rebellion against him and will inevitably bear the consequences.'' I  think we are seeing the consequences of rejecting God here in our  country today, and this bill speaks directly against what is laid out  in Scripture.   Our government, through this bill, is going to redefine what a woman  is and what a man is. It can be anyone who identifies in that gender at  any time. You are going to singlehandedly end women's sports and all  the gains for women's rights contained in Title IX that was passed in  this body since 1972. Singlehandedly destroying women's sports in the  name of equality, how ironic.   If biological men compete in women's sports, then it is no longer  women's sports at all. We might as well just have one sports team per  event, and women, transgender women, men, transgender men can all  compete against each other. How is that for equality?   If biological differences didn't matter, we would never have created  and funded separate teams for men and women. We know that science  supports the idea that there are performance differences between  biological men and women in competitive sports, and it is just common  sense to the vast majority of Americans, just not common sense to this  Democratic majority.   In Connecticut, three high school female track runners have had to  file a lawsuit because their Title IX protections were violated by  biological male athletes competing against them. They had no choice but  to file suit after they were forced to compete against biological male  athletes, and after those biological male athletes brought home 15  women's State championship titles. I could stand up here and give you  example after example of this happening throughout our country in all  sports categories, but I don't have near the time.   Mr. Speaker, if you want to protect women's sports, then vote against  this bill.
