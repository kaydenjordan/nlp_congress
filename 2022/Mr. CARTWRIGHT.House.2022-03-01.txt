 Mr. Speaker, I could not be prouder that the Honoring  our PACT Act includes my bill, the Camp Lejeune Justice Act, and let me  tell you why I wrote this bill. Between 1953 and 1987, two generations  of marines and marine families and employees at Camp Lejeune were  poisoned by the water at Camp Lejeune. Poisoned by water that by  today's standards in health, 240 to 3,400 times the level of acceptable  toxins was in that water. This was water that the marines drank. It was  in the mess halls. It was water they showered with. It was water that  they drank out from the water buffaloes and filled their canteens from  while on exercise. This is water that was poisoned, and it not only  poisoned the water of marines but also the marine families and the  employees at Camp Lejeune.   Mr. Speaker, when marines volunteer for Marine duty, they know they  are up for something dangerous. They know that the Marines pride  themselves on being the first to fight. They know they are going to be  in harm's way at some point, but when they went to Camp Lejeune for  combat training, they didn't realize what their real enemy was going to  be. It was going to be leukemia, bladder cancer, kidney cancer,  aplastic anemia, liver cancer, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma, Parkinson's disease. Not only the marines, but their families  were subject to this from the water.   I would like to thank the people who helped put together this bill,    David Price, Greg Murphy, the Reverend William Barber, the veterans  service organizations, 151 Republicans and Democrats who came together  on this bill.   Folks, at long last, all of these great marines, these great  Americans will get a shot at justice. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the PQ,  ``yes'' on the rule, and let's vote ``yes'' on the Honoring our PACT  Act and the Camp Lejeune Justice Act.                                time  1315
