 Mr. Speaker, well, here we are again. The CDC just  announced that we are going through the most difficult time in U.S.  public health history. Why are we here again?   Two weeks ago, I asked that this body not leave, and we stay until we  finish up the process of a COVID package. Today, we are back here  again, still not having done that, and now Christmas is approaching. We  will probably be leaving here next week, hopefully, with a package. But  right now, that still is an unknown.   I asked before August the same thing, that we not go back for August  break until we identify a package and get it done in a bipartisan way,  working toward protecting the American people, protecting families of  America, protecting American businesses.   Since then, we now have a projection by one of the top groups that  have projected deaths, and they are saying 350,000 deaths just after  Christmas.   On December 1, 2,760 people died; on December 2, 3,157. Those  projections are identified as increasing because of the amount of  people hospitalized and the percentages historically that have been  indicated.   I ask Leader McConnell to please reconsider his statements. First, he  had indicated that we were going to be able to address this issue just  after the election. Politics should not be playing a role in this  process.   Now it is, when the new decision comes out by the bipartisan group in  the Senate, he says he rejects it, and that maybe after the first of  the year we will get to it.   How many Americans have to die before we get serious about this? How  many of our fellow citizens have to die, our friends, our neighbors? I  don't know if there are any family members who have died, but they are  in danger, I can guarantee.   Our hospitals, our doctors are pleading day after day after day, do  something about this. Please do something about this. We are  overwhelmed. We can find beds for the doctors to be able to treat our  citizens. What we cannot do is find doctors and nurses and technicians  that are working 7 days a week, 16-hour days, going back to their  families, going to bed, and coming back again.   I do not understand it at all. If we are concerned about the economy,  let's be concerned about the economy. The more deaths, the worse our  economy will suffer.   Homelessness, food instability, increasing mental health issues,  education, increasing domestic violence, crime, this is going to  continue to get worse unless we address the COVID issue now, not later,  but now.   Our leadership has been attempting to address this issue for some  time. There is only one stumbling block and that is over in the Senate.   I don't care if you agree with what has been proposed or not. Sit  down at the damn table and talk about it. If you have to be there 20  hours a day, sit down and talk about it.   You wouldn't do this in your normal life in business. I have never  done that in my normal life in business. When we have something moving  forward, we work at it, time and time and time again; and we have to do  that now, with COVID. Not later, now.                      Urgent Needs of Tribal Communities     Mr. Speaker, I also want to talk a little bit about  Arizona's First Congressional District and our country, on the need to  extend the Tribal deadline from December 31 for another year to make  sure they have the opportunity to use the funds that were given to  them.   There is an assumption that you can, over a 6-month period, put  millions of dollars out there and get something done right away. I know  that; I am a former project manager. I know to build a building it  takes 2 to 3 years to get the planning done and get the work done.   And here, the CARES Act clearly indicated a need for COVID relief for  the Tribal Nations, not just because they have not been able to address  the issue, but they need to address the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I say one more time, let's get this COVID thing done.                            ____________________
