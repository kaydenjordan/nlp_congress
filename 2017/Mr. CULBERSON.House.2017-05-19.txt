National Police Week is an opportunity for all  Americans to recognize and express our deep appreciation for those law  enforcement officers and first responders for their selfless service.   I want to take a moment to honor those who have lost their lives in  the line of duty.   In Harris County, Texas, we recognize and remember the lives of Chief  Clint Greenwood and Deputy Darren Goforth, who worked tirelessly to  keep Houston safe. Both of these men served their communities and  families honorably, and we are so grateful for their sacrifice.   As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Subcommittee, it is and will continue to be one of my  top priorities to ensure that our law enforcement officers have the  resources they need to protect our communities and to protect  themselves. We must always honor and protect those who protect us.   I express a deep thanks to the people of Texas and America, to all  our uniformed officers, for their dedicated service to our Nation.                            ____________________
