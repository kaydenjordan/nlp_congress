 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  millions of law-abiding citizens who are under attack because they own  a firearm. Right now, their rights are under attack from the Biden  administration.   This week, it was reported that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives is now in possession of nearly one billion  records detailing the firearm purchases of American citizens. This is a  gross overstep of the ATF's power. No government agency should be  spying on Americans.   Right now, crime is on the rise in cities throughout America. This  certainly is not the time to attempt to intimidate law-abiding  citizens. It is not the time to infringe on their constitutional right  to carry a gun. It is their right to defend themselves, their right to  protect their family and their communities.   It is time for the Biden administration to explain this menacing and  unconstitutional action.   Madam Speaker, the law-abiding people of America are awaiting an  answer.                            ____________________
