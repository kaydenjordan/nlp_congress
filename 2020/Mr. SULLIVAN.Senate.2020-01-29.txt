 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Lankford for the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Sullivan and Lankford to the counsel for  the President:         There has been conflicting testimony about how long the       Senate might be tied up in obtaining additional evidence. At       the beginning of this trial, the minority leader offered 11       amendments to obtain additional evidence in the form of       documents and depositions from several federal agencies. If       the Senate had adopted all 11 of these amendments, how long       do you think this impeachment trial would take?    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, it  would take a long time. It would take a long time just to get through  those motions.   But there have been 17 witnesses. We are talking about, now,  additional witnesses that the managers have put forward and that  Democratic Leader Schumer has discussed. He has discussed four  witnesses in particular, as if this body--if it were to grant  witnesses--would say: Yes, you get those four witnesses. And the White  House and the President's counsel get what?
