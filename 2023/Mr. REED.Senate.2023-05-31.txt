 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 769 and  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration on S. Res.  206, 223, and 226; that the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration  of the following  [[Page S1825]]  Senate resolutions: S. Res. 206, Veterans Get Outside Day; S. Res. 223,  National Public Works Week; S. Res. 226, Kids to Parks Day; and S. Res.  229, National Brain Tumor Awareness Month.   There being no objection, the committee was discharged from the  relevant resolutions, and the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed to,  the preambles be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Madam President, I rise and join my colleague Senator  Warren to discuss the unprecedented political holds the Senator from  Alabama has placed on 221 general and flag officers. This hold is now  into its fourth month, and it is beginning to have serious impacts on  military personnel and their families. Commanders who are supposed to  retire or move on to a new assignment cannot do so because there is no  one to replace them. Commanders who are set to take new assignments  remain in limbo. Family members don't know when they are going to move.  Children don't know what new school they will attend or when. Thousands  of lives are being disrupted, all because the Senator from Alabama has  chosen to block merit-based, nonpolitical military promotions over a  policy he does not like.   (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)   I would like to address a few of the assertions raised by the Senator  from Alabama that he has used to justify his unprecedented and damaging  hold on military promotions.   First, on the matter of the Hyde Amendment and the prohibitions on  Federal funding for abortions, the Senator says the Department of  Defense does not have the authority to provide travel benefits and  grant leave for reproductive health care not covered by TRICARE. He is  in error.   Let's provide some clarity on terms. The so-called Hyde Amendment  does not apply to the Department of Defense. Instead, the Department  has its own statute that restricts the use of Department of Defense  funding ``to perform abortions'' and restricts the use of Department of  Defense medical facilities ``to perform an abortion,'' except when the  life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest.   No reasonable interpretation of the policy can conclude that it  authorizes the Department of Defense to pay for the performance of  abortions unless under those conditions I mentioned--the life of the  mother is in danger or in cases of rape or incest. Those costs for such  abortions that are not covered under DOD will continue to be borne, as  they are today, by servicemembers and dependents out of pocket. That  does not change.   The Department's policy is legal and rooted in longstanding  Department of Justice interpretation of the Hyde Amendment and similar  restrictions. In fact, the Department of Defense General Counsel  requested the Justice Department's views on its policy last fall. The  Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued a lengthy and  informative slip opinion concluding that ``10 United States Code  Section 1093 does not bar the Department from using appropriated funds  to pay for servicemembers and their dependents to travel to obtain  abortions that the Department cannot fund directly.''   The opinion, which I encourage all my colleagues to read, traces the  legislative history of the Hyde Amendment, similar Hyde-like  restrictions, and the specific restriction applicable to the Department  codified in section 1093.   Mr. President, I ask that an excerpt of the October 2022 Justice  Department slip opinion considering the Department of Defense policy be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record as follows:                               (Slip Opinion)  Authority of the Department of Defense To Use Appropriations for Travel           by Service Members and Dependents To Obtain Abortions         The Department of Defense may lawfully expend funds to pay       for service members and their dependents to travel to obtain       abortions that DoD cannot itself perform due to statutory       restrictions. DoD may lawfully expend funds to pay for such       travel pursuant to both its express statutory authorities       and, independently, the necessary expense doctrine.                             (October 3, 2022)       Memorandum Opinions for General Counsel Department of Defense         You have asked whether the Department of Defense (``DoD'')       may lawfully expend funds to pay for service members and       their dependents to travel to obtain abortions that DoD       itself cannot perform due to statutory restrictions. We       conclude that DoD may lawfully expend funds for this purpose       under its express statutory authorities and, independently,       under the necessary expense doctrine.                                      i.         By statute, ``[f]unds available to the Department of       Defense may not be used to perform abortions except where the       life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were       carried to term or in a case in which the pregnancy is the       result of an act of rape or incest,'' 10 U.S.C. 1093(a), and       ``[n]o medical treatment facility or other facility of the       Department of Defense may be used to perform an abortion       except where the life of the mother would be endangered if       the fetus were carried to term or in a case in which the       pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest,'' id.       1093(b ). By its express terms, 10 U.S.C. 1093(a) applies       only to funds used to ``perform abortions.'' As we have       previously concluded in assessing identical language       restricting the Peace Corps' use of its appropriations, the       plain text is dispositive here. See Peace Corps Employment       Policies for Pregnant Volunteers, 5 Op. O.L.C. 350, 357       (1981). This language ``does not prohibit the use of funds to       pay expenses, such as a per diem or travel expenses, that are       incidental to the abortion.'' Id.        This conclusion is confirmed by section 1093's legislative       history. When Congress originally enacted the provision in       1984, it prohibited DoD only from using funds ``to perform       abortions except where the life of the mother would be       endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'' Pub. L. No.       98-525, 1401(e)(5), 98 Stat. 2492, 2617-18 (1984). DoD       subsequently adopted a policy of prohibiting non-covered       abortions from being performed at any DoD facility even when       privately funded--a policy that President Clinton then       directed DoD to reverse, stating that it went ``beyond . . .       the requirements of the statute.'' Memorandum on Abortions in       Military Hospitals, 1 Pub. Papers of Pres. William J. Clinton       11, 11 (Jan. 22, 1993). In 1996, Congress responded to       President Clinton's directive by amending 10 U.S.C. 1093 to       make clear that, in addition to the prohibition on using       funds to ``perform abortions,'' ``[n]o medical treatment       facility or other facility of the Department of Defense may       be used to perform an abortion except where the life of the       mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term       or in a case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act       of rape or incest.'' 10 U.S.C. 1093(b). It is notable that       the amendment was targeted narrowly to address the specific       issue of DoD's use of its medical treatment facilities,       rather than reaching the same result via a broader       prohibition on expenditures indirectly related to the       provision of abortions.        The limited scope of the 1996 amendment is especia11y       significant because when Congress has wanted to restrict       abortion-related expenditures beyond those for the procedure       itself, Congress has done so. For example, in 1988--prior to       amending 10 U.S.C. 1093--Congress had attached a restriction       to Department of Justice (``DOJ'') funds prohibiting the use       of those funds ``to require any person to perform, or       facilitate in any way the performance of, any abortion.''       Pub. L. No 100-459, tit. II, 206, 102 Stat. 2186, 2201 (1988)       ( emphasis added); see also, e.g., Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-103, div. E,       726(d), 136 Stat. 49, 131 (``CAA 2022'') (referring to       funding for ``abortion or abortion related services''       (emphasis added)). This DOJ restriction is also in the       current appropriation. See CAA 2022, div. B, 203. That       Congress chose not to include such capacious language in the       1996 amendment confirms that it did not intend for the       prohibition to sweep so widely.        Other DOJ appropriation restrictions provide further       evidence that Congress did not intend DoD's prohibition on       the use of funds to perform abortions to reach ancillary       expenses, such as travel costs. In addition to the provision       noted above, section 202 of the current appropriation       contains a general prohibition against using the appropriated  [[Page S1826]]       funds ``to pay for an abortion.'' Id., div. B, 202. Section       204 then contains a clarification that the prohibition on       requiring any person to perform or facilitate an abortion       does not ``remove the obligation of the Director of the       Bureau of Prisons to provide escort services necessary for a       female inmate'' to obtain an abortion ``outside the Federal       facility.'' Id., div. B, 204. Importantly, this language in       section 204 does not also create an exception to the general       funding restriction in section 202, but rather only clarifies       that nothing in section 203 ``remove[s] the obligation'' of       the agency to provide transportation services. Id. Section       204 therefore is premised on an understanding that section       202's general prohibition on ``pay[ing] for an abortion''       does not affect the agency's ability to provide such escort       services, showing that when Congress prohibits funds from       being used ``to pay for an abortion,'' it does not intend       that prohibition to reach transportation expenses.        Comparing 10 U.S.C. 1093 to the text and history of the       longstanding funding restriction known as the Hyde Amendment       is similarly instructive. The Hyde Amendment restricts       expenditures by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human       Services, and Education by providing that no covered funds       ``shall be expended for any abortion'' or ``for health       benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion,''       except ``if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or       incest; or . . . in the case where a woman suffers from a       physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness,       including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or       arising from the pregnancy itself that would, as certified by       a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an       abortion is performed.'' CAA 2022, div. H, 506-507. In       previous advice, we concluded that the Hyde Amendment would       not bar the use of appropriated funds to provide       transportation for women seeking abortions. See Memorandum       for Samuel Bagenstos, General Counsel, Department of Health       and Human Services, from Christopher H. Schroeder, Assistant       Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Application of       the Hyde Amendment to the Provision of Transportation for       Women Seeking Abortions (Sept. 27, 2022). In reaching that       conclusion, we noted, among other considerations, that       earlier versions of the Hyde Amendment only applied to funds       ``for any abortion,'' and that in 1997 Congress added       language to reach funds ``for health benefits coverage that       includes coverage of abortion.'' Departments of Labor, Health       and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies       Appropriations Act, 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-78, 509(a)-(b), 111       Stat. 1467, 1516 (1997); see Application of the Hyde       Amendment to Federal Student-Aid Programs, 45 Op. O.L.C. __,       at *3 (Jan. 16, 2021); H.R. Rep. No. 105-390, at 119 (1997)       (Conf. Rep.); see also 143 Cong. Rec. 17,448 (1997)       (statement of Sen. Ashcroft). In the context of health       insurance, the funds are paid to reimburse the provider or       the insured for, and thus effectively pay for, the abortion       procedure itself. As a result, payment for health insurance       that covers abortions is more closely connected to the actual       provision of abortion than transportation to and from the       procedure. Thus, the fact that Congress revised the Hyde       Amendment to specify that it applies to payments for health       benefits coverage supports the view that the prohibition on       expending funds ``for any abortion'' is limited to the direct       provision of abortions and would not apply to transportation.       More generally, the amendment suggests that when Congress has       wanted to clearly encompass certain expenditures beyond the       direct provision of the procedure, Congress has amended       abortion-related funding restrictions to do so.        For these reasons, 10 U.S.C. 1093 does not prohibit the use       of funds for expenses that are indirect or ancillary to the       performance of abortion. We therefore conclude that 10 U.S.C.       1093 does not bar DoD from using appropriated funds to pay       for service members and their dependents to travel to obtain       abortions that DoD cannot fund directly.     The Justice Department's opinion on the Defense  Department's policy is not new and is not partisan. In fact, it relies  on decades of executive branch interpretation of the Hyde Amendment  through administrations of both parties.   In 1981, for example, the Justice Department considered what it  described as identical language restricting the Peace Corps' use of  Federal funds to ``perform abortions.'' In that opinion, President  Reagan's Justice Department concluded that the language ``does not  prohibit the use of funds to pay expenses, such as a per diem or travel  expenses, that are incidental to the abortion.'' That opinion was  authored by Ted Olson, then the Assistant Attorney General and the  future Solicitor General of the United States under President George W.  Bush.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt of the 1981  Justice Department opinion on the Peace Corps' policy be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          Peace Corps Employment Policies for Pregnant Volunteers         The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) would prohibit the       Peace Corps from implementing an across-the-board policy of       terminating or reassigning volunteers solely because they       become pregnant while assigned overseas, or because they have       an abortion. A decision to terminate a pregnant volunteer       must be based on a case-by-case assessment of the volunteer's       ability to function effectively in her assignment while       pregnant or after delivery of the child.        Under the PDA, the fact that a volunteer who has been       terminated because of pregnancy chooses to have an abortion       cannot he considered in a decision on her reapplication for       service.        Even though a specific restriction in the Peace Corps'       appropriation prohibits the use of its funds to perform       abortions, so that the Peace Corps may not pay for the cost       of an abortion for one of its volunteers, the PDA would       require the Peace Corps to continue to pay travel and per       diem expenses to volunteers evacuated to have an abortion, as       long as it provides such compensation to other volunteers       evacuated for comparable medical conditions. The Peace Corps       must also allow volunteers to draw upon their accumulated       readjustment allowance to pay for an abortion, if similar       access is allowed for other medical expenses.                            (November 20, 1981)          Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, Peace Corps         This responds to your request for this Office's views on       several questions about the Peace Corps' policies on hiring       and reinstatement of volunteers who become pregnant while       overseas and of pregnant volunteers who elect to have an       abortion, and on reimbursement of travel and per diem       expenses to volunteers evacuated to the United States for the       purpose of obtaining an abortion. We conclude that the       Pregnancy Discrimination Act would prohibit the Peace Corps       from implementing any across-the-board policy of terminating       volunteers who become pregnant while overseas or pregnant       volunteers who elect to have abortions, but that in some       limited circumstances termination or reassignment may be       appropriate, on an ad hoc basis, because of the unique       demands and constraints of Peace Corps service. We do not       believe, however, that the Peace Corps may consider the fact       that a volunteer who had been terminated because of pregnancy       subsequently elected to have an abortion in reviewing that       individual's application for reinstatement. With respect to       the funding of abortion-related expenses, we conclude that       the Peace Corps is not barred from using appropriated funds       to pay travel costs and a per diem to volunteers who are       evacuated for the purpose of obtaining an abortion, and, in       fact, that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires the       Peace Corps to continue paying those costs, so long as travel       and per diem expenses are paid to volunteers evacuated for       other comparable medical disabilities.                                I. Background         Current Peace Corps policy provides for an ad hoc       determination whether volunteers who become pregnant or       pregnant volunteers who elect to have an abortion will be       allowed to remain in their assigned countries. In determining       whether a pregnant volunteer (including her spouse) should be       allowed to remain in service, the Country Director looks at a       variety of factors, including health hazards to the mother       and child, the ability of the parents to support the child,       and the prospects for continued effectiveness by the parents.       A pregnant volunteer who elects to have an abortion may be       separated, or returned to duty if the Country Director       determines she will be able to serve effectively under the       circumstances. Pregnant volunteers, volunteers with dependent       children, and volunteers who have had abortions while in       service do serve in the Peace Corps, although individuals who       are pregnant or who have dependent children are not       encouraged to become volunteers. Volunteers who choose to       have an abortion are generally evacuated to the United States       for the procedure. The Peace Corps pays travel expenses and a       per diem to those volunteers who have an abortion, as it does       for volunteers evacuated for other medical or surgical       treatment. Because of a prohibition in the Peace Corps'       current appropriations authority against the use of       appropriated funds to pay for abortions except where the life       of the woman would be endangered or in cases of reported rape       or incest, the Peace Corps does not now pay the costs of the       abortion procedure itself. Volunteers may, however, draw upon       accumulated readjustment allowance funds to pay for abortion       procedures.        You have asked us to address the following questions:        1. Can the Peace Corps terminate any volunteer who becomes       pregnant while a volunteer because of pregnancy? If so, could       such a policy be limited to single volunteers?                        III. Reimbursement or Expenses         You have also asked whether the Peace Corps must, or indeed       can, consistent with the PDA and current restrictions on the       use of appropriated funds, continue to pay travel costs and a       per diem for volunteers who obtain an abortion while in       service. The Peace Corps now pays those costs under a general       policy providing for evacuation to the United States of       volunteers who require ``elective (necessary but not       emergency) surgery of any consequence.'' Until the beginning       of FY 1979, the Peace Corps also paid for the costs of the       abortion procedure itself. In 1978, Congress included       language in the Peace Corps' appropriations legislation       limiting the use of  [[Page S1827]]       appropriated funds for abortions. We understand that the       currently effective language is contained in Pub. L. No. 96-      536, Sec. 109, 94 Stat. 3166, 3170 (1980), and prohibits the       use of funds ``to perform abortions except where the life of       the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to       term; or except for such medical procedures necessary for       victims of [reported] rape or incest . . . or for medical       procedures necessary for the termination of an ectopic       pregnancy.''        On its face, this restriction covers only payments made       ``to perform abortions''; it does not prohibit the use of       funds to pay expenses, such as a per diem or travel expenses,       that are incidental to the abortion. We believe that the       plain language of the appropriations restriction is       dispositive, and does not require the Peace Corps to cease       payment of incidental expenses other than the costs of the       abortion itself.        This does not, however, dispose of the question whether the       Peace Corps, in its discretion, may cease payment of travel       and per diem expenses for volunteers who elect to have       abortions. The statutory authority for payment of those       expenses vests broad discretion in the President or his       delegated representative to authorize ``such health care    The Justice Department has likewise considered and  concluded that the Hyde Amendment does not prevent the Bureau of  Prisons from providing transportation services for inmates to seek  abortion care outside the prison system, noting that the Bureau has  ``long provided'' such benefits. This authority to provide  transportation benefits dates at least to the 1996 version of Bureau  regulations and continues uninterrupted to the present day.   So, again, this assertion that the Department's policy contravenes  some long-held principle is wrong and contrary to fact.   Second, on the matter of travel authorities, the Defense Department  has broad statutory authority to provide travel and transportation  benefits to servicemembers and dependents and empowers the Secretary of  Defense to define those parameters by regulation. As the Justice  Department noted, 37 United States Code, section 452, authorizes the  Secretary to provide ``actual and necessary expenses of travel and  transportation, for, or in connection with . . . any travel as  authorized or ordered by the administering Secretary.''   Further, the Justice Department aptly noted that 37 United States  Code, sections 452 and 453, authorize travel benefits for  servicemembers and dependents in connection with ``unusual, hardship,  or emergency circumstances'' and leaves the definition of those terms  and other implementing guidance to the Secretary.   I remind my colleagues again that never before in our history has a  fundamental healthcare right been denied to servicemembers by a single  decision on a single day by the Supreme Court. No matter what side of  the abortion debate you are on, you cannot deny that what many women  considered to be a fundamental, constitutionally protected right for 50  years was eliminated by the stroke of a pen and that those who depend  on these rights now find themselves assigned to locations, through no  choice of their own, where these services are no longer available in  any meaningful way. In my view, this meets any definition of ``unusual,  hardship, or emergency circumstances.''   The Defense Department's policy is a result, as I just suggested, of  the Dobbs decision which places extraordinary hardships on servicewomen  and dependents, resulting in military personnel no longer being treated  equitably at every military base. The Department of Defense's policy  seeks to provide a level playing field so that a woman's access to  healthcare is not based on her assignment and such access is consistent  throughout the force. It seeks further to ensure that these issues do  not become determinant in a woman's decision to join the military or  remain in the military.   The U.S. Government has provided transportation and other incidental  benefits and support relative to healthcare not covered by government  programs, including abortion, to certain populations for decades.  Servicemembers and their dependents are, I believe, uniquely affected  by the Dobbs decision and deserve at least that same level of support.   Lastly, the Senator from Alabama has stated that these officers whose  promotions he is holding will receive backpay. That is simply not true.  The Department of Defense confirmed for the Armed Services Committee  this week that there is no backpay mechanism for these officers. Their  date of rank is the date of their appointment, which for general and  flag officers can only occur after Senate confirmation. There will be  no backpay.   I want to state again what I stated before. It is deeply detrimental  to our national security and harmful to the well-being of military  families to delay the promotions of senior military leaders for  political purposes or any purpose, really, unrelated to an officer's  qualifications. It is contrary to the practice and traditions of the  Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate. It does a great  disservice to the men and women in uniform and their families.   I would ask that the Senator from Alabama release his holds  immediately before more damage is done.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I just want to reiterate what Senator Warren  pointed out: This policy is not illegal. It has been fully justified by  the Department of Justice and by interpretations of many different  agencies.   In fact, one of the excruciating ironies here is that Senator  Tuberville is denying promotions to general officers because he will  not allow female members of the military to have some of the same  protections that Federal prisoners have. If that is not absurd, I don't  know what is.   Also, I have had the opportunity--really, the privilege--to serve in  and command a paratrooper company. I have a lot of friends who have  made careers in the U.S. military. When you get to the level of a  colonel who is about to be voted brigadier general, it is a great  honor. You have worked your whole life for it, and you very much want  to do that, but you have family responsibilities, and you have other  responsibilities. I can pretty much assure you that most people who are  qualified to be a brigadier general in the Army are being courted  assiduously by companies to work for several hundred thousand dollars a  year.   The longer this goes on, the more demands of the family, the more the  uncertainty, the more the frustration, we will lose these talented  people at a moment in our history when we need the leadership to assist  our allies and also to confront a very serious threat across the Indo- Pacific region at a time when the practice of warfare is changing  second by second with technology.   When you have the proponents of AI warning us this week that AI could  be the catastrophic destruction of our species, well, guess where that  is going to be first manifested--in the military domain, I believe.  That requires leaders of character, intelligence, compassion, and  dedication to democracy. Those leaders now are questioning whether they  can continue because of an attempt to suggest that this is not legal,  which is wrong, and, ironically, again, to take away healthcare support  for women who serve in the military that we extend to Federal prisoners  in this country.   I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, first, anyone who suggests that the  Secretary of Defense does not have a role--in fact, a responsibility-- to shape policy in the Department of Defense--it is nonsense, and I  would suspect that the person has never served in the military forces  of the United States.   This is a policy that the Secretary of Defense is not only legally  entitled to promulgate, but is, I think, compelled to clarify the  position of the Department of Defense when it comes to this Dobbs  decision and its effect on the military.   Now, the gentleman from Utah did not hear my opening remarks. I did  not refer to judicial decisions; I was referring to opinions--very  valid opinions--of the Department of Justice, dating back to 1981.   Section 1093, which he cites, is the most significant provision of  the law.  [[Page S1832]]  What it does, it prevents funding to perform abortions and restricts  the use of Department of Defense medical facilities to perform an  abortion except when the life of the mother is in danger or in the case  of rape or incest. I might suggest that I think my colleagues over  there wouldn't even recognize that part of the law, but that is part of  the law. There is no discussion of other aspects--i.e., providing  transportation--and I pointed out Federal prisons provide  transportation for female inmates requesting an abortion.   These are policy decisions that are reserved to the Secretary of  Defense by statute, the same types of decisions he has to make every  day. What are the physical standards for the troops in the U.S.  military? Is that an act of Congress? No. I don't think anyone here  would reasonably argue that we are the experts who should decide that  and we know better than the Secretary of Defense.   There are a whole bevy of reasons, but section 1093 is the key  statute, and it prevents Department funding being used for the  performance of non-covered abortions. It makes no comment whatsoever in  terms of any other aspects of incidental expenses.   The Department's policy is legal, as I pointed out. It is rooted in  the longstanding Department of Justice interpretations of both the Hyde  amendment and similar restrictions.   In fact, the Department of Defense General Counsel requested the  Justice Department's views on the policy last fall because they wanted  to be sure they were right before they went ahead, and they issued a  lengthy and informative slip opinion, which is part of the record.   And they concluded that 10 United States Code section 1093, which my  colleague from Utah continually refers to, does not prevent the  Department from using appropriated funds to pay for servicemembers and  their dependents to travel to obtain abortions that the Department  cannot fund directly because of section 1093.   So this is not illegal. And what is contemptuous, I think, is not  this debate over this policy. That is what we would do. It is ignoring  years and years and years of respecting the promotion of military  officers by the Department of Defense based on merit, based on their  abilities, not their politics; and, for the first time, using military  officers as tokens in a political game of trying to change things that  they don't like, even though these policies are absolutely legal and  have been confirmed by the Department of Justice and provide, I think,  benefits that we provide to Federal prisoners. I would hate to see our  soldiers--our female soldiers, particularly--treated any less  appropriately than Federal prisoners.   So this argument is a lot of ``sturm und drang.'' I think that is the  German pronunciation for it.   The policy is legal. On one other point--a sort of simple-minded  point--if it is not legal, why hasn't it been challenged in court?  Because it is legal.   Now, you can disagree with the policy, and many of my colleagues do.  In fact, many of our colleagues have submitted legislation, and that  legislation will be considered at some point. But no one has risen to  the point of invoking this block of military promotions. It affects the  military. It affects families. It affects our readiness. It affects our  recruitment, if people look far enough down the road. And every day it  continues, it does more and more damage. It is a cumulative effect. And  I very, very strongly object to the continued decapitation of our  military.   Let's carry this forward for 6 months or a year. We don't have a  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I think we will because I think  a majority of my colleagues will realize how important it is to have  that. But it won't be done in an efficient, coordinated way. It will be  objected to. It will be argued about.   The Commandant of the Marine Corps--no, we have to put this  gentleman, General Smith, through the ringer. The Chief of Staff of the  Army, the same thing.   We are in a situation with a tremendous pressure globally, assisting  the Ukrainians in their battle; particularly, our new peer competition  with China, trying to assimilate the technology that is changing the  battlefield literally every second.   And now we are spending time arguing about what is within the legal  authority of the Secretary of Defense and doing it by taking military  officers and making them political tokens that you trade for something.  I personally resent such treatment of professional officers in our  military.
