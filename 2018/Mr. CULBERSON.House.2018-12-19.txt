 Mr. Speaker, the Founders entrusted the power of the  purse to the Congress because it is the most effective and powerful  check and balance in our Constitution. It is vitally important that  this Congress work to pass these appropriations bills in their full  detail. We cannot continue to operate under a continuing resolution,  which just allows the executive branch to run unchecked.   These bills have been carefully negotiated. These bills allow the  public to see how our hard-earned tax dollars are being spent. These  bills enable the Congress to have some real authority over the  executive branch.   In the 18 years it has been my privilege to represent the people of  west Houston, and to chair a subcommittee on appropriations, I was able  to work together with my colleagues in putting together the largest  hurricane recovery package in the history of the country, working  together to make sure that our laws are enforced and that the  Department of Justice is following the law, enforcing the law, and  securing the border.   These things can be done through the power of the purse, through the  responsibility we have as Members of Congress, as appropriators. It is  essential we pass these appropriations bills and do so in a bipartisan  way.   I have always worked closely with my colleagues throughout the State  of Texas and throughout the country, regardless of party, because we  are doing it for the good of the country. As Mr. Crowley said in his  remarks and you can detect by the response in the House, we all work  together arm-in-arm as patriots. Let's pass these appropriations bills  in detail when we come back here in the next year when the CR runs out  in February.                            ____________________
