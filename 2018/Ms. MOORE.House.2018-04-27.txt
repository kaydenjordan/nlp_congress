 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of a  phenomenal woman, Vel Phillips, who hails from my hometown, Milwaukee,  Wisconsin.   Vel Phillips passed away this month at the age of 95, but not before  she led a phenomenal life. She was the first of so many things: the  first African American and the first woman to become an alderman in the  city of Milwaukee; the first African American to graduate from the  University of Wisconsin-Madison; the first African-American judge in  Milwaukee County; the first and only African American to win election  statewide.   Members may have heard of Father James Groppi, who led 200 days of  marches for open housing. That was in support of Vel Phillips' open  housing ordinance in the city of Milwaukee on the Common Council, where  it was defeated, repeatedly, 18-1. That led to the signature of open  housing legislation nationwide.   She was the first Black person to serve on either the DNC or RNC.   I hope the House will join me in honoring the great life of Vel  Phillips                            ____________________
