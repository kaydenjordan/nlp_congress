 Mr. Speaker, last week, I met with a group of my  constituents to discuss their experiences with the Affordable Care Act.   Here is what I heard: My deductible went from $2,500 to $6,000, so it  wasn't even worth it.   The first year wasn't too bad until I found out I needed a knee  replacement, said a constituent who found out her surgery wouldn't be  covered because her physician was excluded from her plan's network.   A professor who saw his hours cut after passage of ObamaCare and lost  his insurance because it didn't comply with the law's mandates said: I  had to get a second job and sometimes a third job, and it made it very  difficult.   A local small business owner saw premiums on his group plan increase  by as much as $2,500 a month for family coverage and $975 a month for  single employee coverage.   There were skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles,  restricted access to physicians, and loss of coverage.   Mr. Speaker, these are real stories from real people in my district  who want relief from the Affordable Care Act.   We are working to save patients from this disastrous law and to build  a better healthcare system that lowers costs, expands access, and  empowers patients.                            ____________________
