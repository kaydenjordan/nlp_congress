 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3099 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, the IRS financial institution reporting  requirement forces financial institutions to turn over detailed bank  account information to the IRS based on vague and flexible criteria,  such as a $600-threshold, and account inflows and outflows would be  covered--this all to be determined by the IRS.   Think about that. It subjects every law-abiding American who has a  bank account or a credit union account in which they transact more than  $600 worth of transactions to have that information monitored and  reported to the IRS.   This is an outrageous violation of the privacy of American citizens,  and we should reject it.   The community banks and credit unions support this amendment, and I  thank the ICBA, CUNA, the ABA, and the NAFCU for their support, as well  as the Americans for Tax Reform and the Center for a Free Economy.   My amendment prevents the undue monitoring and reporting of sensitive  financial information on law-abiding Americans.    Mr. President, this is one of the biggest violations of  the privacy of American citizens to come to the floor of the Senate in  a long time.   This amendment would require reporting of--and I quote--``large''  financial account balances to the IRS. So now, instead of $600, they  are going to say that whatever the IRS says is large is what they will  require every single American, whether they are an individual, a small  business, or a corporation owner. Everyone is going to be subject to  reporting on whatever the IRS says is ``large.''   And this comes after another proposal that is coming down the pike to  double or triple the funding to the IRS, so they can monitor the  financial transactions of American citizens.   This amendment should be rejected.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3365
