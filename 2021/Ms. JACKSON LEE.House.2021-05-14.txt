 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Virginia for his kindness.   This has to pass today if we have any sense of fairness not only to  women, but to our children.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would establish that private-sector  employers with more than 15 employees, and public-sector employers must  make reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, job applicants,  and individuals with known limitations related to pregnancy,  childbirth, or related medical conditions.   Pregnant workers and individuals with known limitations related to  pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions cannot be denied  employment.   The Supreme Court decision, just recently, in 2015, that allowed  pregnant workers to bring reasonable accommodation discrimination  claims is not enough because pregnant workers are still being denied  accommodations, because the Young decision set an unreasonably high  standard for proving discrimination.   This is not discrimination. I have never seen a religious  organization that wants to deny anyone any opportunity.   This is a fair assessment. I know it personally because I was denied  a job because I was nursing. A job was taken away from me. When I was  pregnant and was about to give birth, there was no definition of  pregnancy leave for my position. At that time I was a lawyer,  practicing law in a large firm, and it was, at best, two weeks and get  back.   So I understand that this is essential for those workers in working  conditions where they do not have the power to be protected, that they  are doing heavy lifting, that they have physically demanding jobs, that  they are the sole provider of their family.   This is important. Black and Latino women particularly suffer,  minority women, particularly a burden.   Three in ten pregnant workers are employed in four of the occupations  that make up the backbone of our communities. We must have this bill.   I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the disabled  community, mental health community, United Spinal Association, and  others.                                                       May 11, 2021.      Re Support for Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, H.R. 1065.       Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx: As co-chairs       of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Rights       Task Force, we write in strong support of the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act, H.R. 1065. CCD is the largest coalition       of national organizations working together to advocate for       federal public policy that ensures the self-determination,       independence, empowerment, integration and inclusion of       children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of       society.        The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)'s mandate that       covered employers make reasonable accommodations to ensure       equal opportunity for applicants and employees with       disabilities has been tremendously important in helping       people with disabilities secure and maintain employment.       While the ADA does not cover pregnancy itself as a       disability, in light of the ADA Amendments Act, which lowered       the standard for demonstrating a disability from what the       courts had previously applied, many pregnant workers who       experience pregnancy-related complications should be covered       as people with disabilities and entitled to reasonable       accommodations under the ADA. Yet many courts have continued       to interpret the ADA's coverage narrowly, and in practice,       large numbers of pregnant workers are not offered reasonable       accommodations. Furthermore, a clear pregnancy accommodation       standard will help prevent pregnancy-related complications       before they arise. Such accommodations should be provided to       pregnant workers so that they can remain in the workforce and       not lose their employment simply because they experience       pregnancy-related limitations.        The accommodation requirement of H.R. 1065 is limited, as       is the ADA's accommodation requirement, to those       accommodations  [[Page H2328]]       that are reasonable and would not impose an undue hardship.       That standard takes into account the needs of employers while       also ensuring that pregnant workers can stay on the job with       reasonable accommodations. This protection is critical not       only for pregnant workers but for our national economy.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is particularly important       to people with disabilities. Many people with disabilities       who did not require accommodations before becoming pregnant       experience new complications due to how pregnancy impacts       their disabilities, and need accommodations once they become       pregnant. These workers are sometimes told that they are not       entitled to accommodations because the employer views the       need for accommodation as related to pregnancy rather than to       the worker's underlying disability.        We thank the Committee for moving the bill forward and urge       all members of the House of Representatives to vote for the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and oppose any motion to       recommit.            Sincerely,      Jennifer Mathis,        Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.      Stephen Lieberman,        United Spinal Association.      Allison Nichol,        Epilepsy Foundation.

Co-chairs, CCD Rights Task Force.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  representing organizations from Black Mamas Matter Alliance, to March  of Dimes, to 1,000 Days to Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.                                                       May 11, 2021.      Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.         Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations       dedicated to assuring quality maternal, infant, and child       health and well-being, improving pregnancy and birth       outcomes, and closing racial disparities in maternal health       enthusiastically support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       (H.R. 1065). Modeled after the Americans with Disabilities       Act, the bill would require employers to provide reasonable,       temporary workplace accommodations to pregnant workers as       long as the accommodation does not impose an undue hardship       on the employer. This bill is critically important because no       one should have to choose between having a healthy pregnancy       and a paycheck.        Congress must do all it can to end the prejudice pregnant       workers, especially Black pregnant workers and workers of       color, continue to face in the workplace. This includes       making sure when pregnant workers voice a need for reasonable       accommodations that those needs are met rather than penalized       and that the workplace is an environment where pregnant       workers do not fear asking for the accommodations they need       to maintain their health.        Three-quarters of women will be pregnant and employed at       some point in their lives.) (Most pregnant workers can expect       a routine pregnancy and healthy birth. However, health care       professionals have consistently recommended that some       pregnant individuals make adjustments in their work       activities to sustain a healthy pregnancy and prevent adverse       pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth or miscarriage.       These medically necessary workplace accommodations can       include allowing additional bathroom breaks, opportunities to       stay hydrated, lifting restrictions, or access to a chair or       stool to decrease time spent standing.        Unfortunately, too many pregnant workers, particularly       pregnant people of color, face barriers to incorporating even       these small changes to their workdays. For example, Black       women experience maternal mortality rates three to four times       higher than white women, with Indigenous women similarly       experiencing disproportionately high rates. The circumstances       surrounding these alarming statistics can often be attributed       to a lack of access to care, including due to inflexible       workplaces, and deep biases in racial understanding. Various       social determinants such as health, education, and economic       status drastically influence the outcomes of pregnancy for       Black women leading to severe pregnancy-related       complications. As the Black Mamas Matter Alliance has pointed       out ``Health is determined in part by our access to social       and economic opportunities, the resources and supports that       are available in the places where we live, and the safety of       our workplaces . . . however, disparities in these conditions       of daily life give some people better opportunities to be       healthy than others.'' Black pregnant workers along with       Latinx and immigrant women are disproportionately likely to       work in physically demanding jobs that may lead to workers       needing modest accommodations to ensure a healthy pregnancy.       Too often, however, those requests are refused or ignored,       forcing pregnant workers of color to disproportionately       contend with unsafe working conditions.        Furthermore, Black mothers have among the highest labor       force participation rates in the country and 80 percent of       Black mothers are their family's primary breadwinner. Yet,       historically, Black women have been exploited in the       workplace, and that exploitation continues to this day.       Though Black women only comprise 14.3 percent of the       population, nearly thirty percent of pregnancy discrimination       complaints are filed by Black women. This is because of the       multiple forms of discrimination Black workers and other       workers of color too often face in the workplace. As scholar       Nina Banks has noted, ``The legacy of black women's       employment in industries that lack worker protections has       continued today since black women are concentrated in low-      paying, inflexible service occupations . . .'' Black women in       low wage jobs working during pregnancy face little support       from employers when safeguards do not address pregnancy       related accommodations. Faced with the threat of termination,       loss of health insurance, or other benefits, Black pregnant       people are often forced to keep working which can compromise       their health and the health of their pregnancy.        Workplace accommodations help safeguard a healthy pregnancy       or prevent harm to a higher-risk pregnancy. Across the       country, pregnant workers continue to be denied simple, no-      cost or lowcost, temporary adjustments in their work settings       or activities and instead risk being fired or forced to take       unpaid leave to preserve the health of their pregnancy.        This impossible choice forces many pregnant workers to       continue working without accommodations, putting women and       their pregnancies at risk of long-lasting and severe health       consequences. When pregnant workers must continue working       without accommodations, they risk miscarriage, excessive       bleeding, and other devastating health consequences. Black       women have the highest incidence of preterm birth and yet we       know that workplace accommodations such as reducing heavy       lifting, bending, or excessive standing can help prevent       preterm birth, the leading cause of infant mortality in this       country.        Black women also experience higher rates of preeclampsia,       which is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. We       are still learning about how to prevent this dangerous       medical condition, yet we know that simply allowing workers       to take bathroom breaks can prevent urinary tract infections       which are ``strongly associated with preeclampsia. Similarly,       ensuring pregnant workers can drink a sufficient amount of       water can also help pregnant workers maintain their blood       pressure which is critically important since hypertensive       disorders (high blood pressure) are also a leading cause of       maternal morbidity and mortality. By putting a national       pregnancy accommodation standard in place, the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act has the potential to improve some of the       most serious health consequences Black pregnant people       experience. Furthermore, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       will help remove one of the many barriers Black pregnant       people face at work by ensuring they are afforded immediate       relief under the law, and not thrown into financial dire       straits for needing pregnancy accommodations.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a measured approach to       a serious problem. As organizations dedicated to maternal       health and closing racial disparities in pregnancy and birth       outcomes, we understand the importance of reasonable       workplace accommodations to ensure that pregnant persons can       continue to provide for their families and have safe and       healthy pregnancies. We collectively urge swift passage of       the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the YWCA dealing with 200 local organizations in 45 States.                                                        YWCA USA,                                       Washington, DC, May 11, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of YWCA USA, a network of       over 200 local associations  [[Page H2329]]       in 45 states and the District of Columbia, I write today to       urge you to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R.       1065). As the economy continues to struggle under the weight       of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting women       and marginalized communities, there is no better time to take       action to improve the economic security of women and families       and strengthen our economy. I urge you to pass H.R. 1065       without delay.        For over 160 years, YWCA has been on a mission to eliminate       racism, empower women, and promote peace, justice, freedom,       and dignity for all. From our earliest days providing skills       and housing support to women entering the workforce in the       1850s, YWCA has been at the forefront of the most pressing       social movements--from voting rights to civil rights, from       affordable housing to pay equity, from violence prevention to       health care reform. Today, we serve over 2 million women,       girls and family members of all ages and backgrounds in more       than 1,200 communities each year.        Informed by our extensive history, the expertise of our       nationwide network, and our collective commitment to       advocating for the equity of women and families, we believe       that no one should have to choose between their livelihoods       and their health, family, or safety. Yet far too many women       and families, including a disproportionate number of women       and families of color, must make this choice every day. This       has become more clear as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic       become more transparent. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic       has fallen heavily on women and women of color. Women are       especially likely to be essential workers, but they are also       bearing the brunt of job losses, while shouldering increased       caregiving responsibilities that have pushed millions out of       the workforce entirely, resulting in an economic       ``Shesession''. Black women, Latinas, and other women of       color are especially likely to be on the front lines of the       crisis, risking their lives in jobs in health care, child       care, and grocery stores, all while being paid less than       their male counterparts. Pregnant employees are no exception       to this situation and often forced out of work or forced to       risk their health due to unclear laws around pregnancy       accommodations, particularly during the pandemic.        The bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 1065)       takes critical steps to promote healthy pregnancies and       support the economic security of pregnancy workers. Today,       women are a primary source of financial support for many       families and bear significant caretaking responsibilities at       home. At least half of all households in the U.S. with       children under the age of 18 have either a single mother who       heads a household or a married mother who provides at least       40 percent of a family's earnings. Additionally, more than       four in five Black mothers (81.1%), 67.1% of Native American       mothers, and 52.5% of Latina mothers are breadwinners. As       demographics shifts and a higher number of women take their       place in the workforce, a higher number of pregnant workers       than ever before are working later into their pregnancies,       often in physically demanding jobs without worker       accommodations. As a result, too many pregnant workers are       pushed out into unpaid leave or out of work altogether,       threatening their families' economic security just when they       need the income the most. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations       to pregnant workers who need them, such as avoiding heavy       lifting, taking more frequent bathroom breaks, sitting on a       stool instead of standing during a shift, or carrying a water       bottle. States, localities, and businesses that have begun to       adopt policies similar to those identified in the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act have reported reduced lawsuits and       greater employee morale. Providing reasonable accommodations       for pregnant women will benefit both the employer and       employees.        No one should have to choose between their paycheck and a       healthy pregnancy--an issue only to be exacerbated by the       pandemic--and it's time Congress took action to protect       pregnant workers. If passed, this bill would take critical       steps towards strengthening women's economic security,       particularly at a time when the country continues to recover       from the COVID-19 pandemic. At this pivotal moment, Congress       must take aggressive action to address the economic       disparities disproportionately affecting women and women of       color. We urge you to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       (H.R 1065) today.        Thank you for your time and consideration. Please contact       Pam Yuen, YWCA USA Director of Government Relations, if you       have any questions.            Sincerely,                                                     Elisha Rhodes,                             Interim CEO & Chief Operating Officer.     Mr. Speaker, women are in the workplace. They are  the backbone of this economy. We need to pass this legislation and pass  it now.   I thank Mr. Scott and Mr. Nadler for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary, Homeland Security,  and Budget Committees, the Democratic Working Women Task Force, the  Founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, and as  cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act (PWFA), which would ensure that pregnant workers can  continue to do their jobs and support their families by requiring  employers to make workplace adjustments for those workers who need them  due to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, like  breastfeeding.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would establish that private sector  employers with more than 15 employees and public sector employers must  make reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, job applicants,  and individuals with known limitations related to pregnancy,  childbirth, or related medical conditions.   Similar to the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers are not  required to make an accommodation if it imposes an undue hardship on an  employer's business.   Pregnant workers and individuals with known limitations related to  pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions cannot be denied  employment opportunities, retaliated against for requesting a  reasonable accommodation, or forced to take paid or unpaid leave if  another reasonable accommodation is available.   Workers denied a reasonable accommodation under the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act will have the same rights and remedies as those  established under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including  recovery of lost pay, compensatory damages, and reasonable attorneys'  fees.   While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) and the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA) provide some protections for pregnant workers,  there is currently no federal law that explicitly and affirmatively  guarantees all pregnant workers the right to a reasonable accommodation  so they can continue working without jeopardizing their pregnancy.   The Supreme Court's landmark decision in Young v. United Parcel  Service, 575 U.S. --, No. 12-1226, 135 S.Ct. 1338; 191 L. Ed. 2d 279  (2015) allowed pregnant workers to bring reasonable accommodation  discrimination claims under the PDA.   But pregnant workers are still being denied accommodations because  the Young decision set an unreasonably high standard for proving  discrimination, requiring workers to prove that their employers  accommodated non-pregnant workers with similar limitations.   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, there are no similar conditions to  pregnancy.   As a result, in two-thirds of cases after Young, courts ruled against  pregnant workers who were seeking accommodations under the PDA.   Providing accommodations ensures that women can work safely while  pregnant instead of getting pushed out of work at a time when they may  need their income the most.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is especially important considering  that many pregnant workers hold physically demanding or hazardous jobs,  and thus may be especially likely to need reasonable accommodations at  some point during their pregnancy.   Mr. Speaker, research shows that pregnant workers are likely to hold  jobs that involve standing and making continuous movements, which can  raise specific challenges during pregnancy.   Such physically demanding work--including jobs that require prolonged  standing, long work hours, irregular work schedules, heavy lifting, or  high physical activity--carries an increased risk of pre-term delivery  and low birth weight.   Twenty-one (20.9) percent of pregnant workers are employed in low- wage jobs, which are particularly likely to be physically demanding.   Pregnant black and Latina women are disproportionately represented in  low-wage jobs, which means as a result, these workers are especially  likely to stand, walk or run continuously during work, and therefore  may be more likely to need an accommodation at some point during  pregnancy to continue to work safely.   Three in ten pregnant workers are employed in four of the occupations  that make up the backbone of our communities: elementary school  teachers, nurses, and home health aides.   Employers can accommodate pregnant workers because pregnant women  make up a small share of the workforce, even in the occupations where  they are most likely to work, which means that only a very small share  of an employer's workforce is likely to require pregnancy  accommodations in any given year since less than two percent of all  workers in the United States are pregnant each year.   Not all pregnant workers require any form of accommodation at work,  so only a fraction of that small fraction will need accommodations.   For example, pregnant women are most likely to work as elementary and  middle school teachers but only three percent (3.2 percent) of all  elementary and middle school teachers are pregnant women.   But workers employed in four of the ten most common occupations for  pregnant workers--retail salesperson; waiter or waitress;  [[Page H2330]]  nursing, psychiatric and home health aide; and cashier--who report  continuously standing on the job would particularly benefit from this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, prolonged standing at work has been shown to more than  triple the odds of pregnant women taking leave during pregnancy or  becoming unemployed.   Another four of the ten most common occupations for pregnant  workers--waiter or waitress; nursing, psychiatric and home health aide;  cashier; and secretaries and administrative assistants--involve making  repetitive motions continuously on the job which have been shown to  increase the likelihood of pregnant women taking sick leave.   Pregnant workers in low-wage jobs are particularly in need of this  legislation granting them the clear legal right to receive  accommodations because, in addition to the physically demanding nature  of their jobs, they often face inflexible workplace cultures that make  it difficult to informally address pregnancy-related needs.   For instance, workplace flexibility--such as the ability to alter  start and end times or take time off for a doctor's appointment--is  extremely limited for workers in low-wage jobs.   Over 40 percent of full-time workers in low-wage jobs report that  their employers do not permit them to decide when to take breaks;  between two-thirds and three-quarters of full-time workers in low-wage  jobs report that they are unable to choose their start and quit times;  and roughly half report having very little or no control over the  scheduling of hours more generally.   The second most common occupation for pregnant Latinas--maids and  housekeeping cleaners--is especially physically demanding because,  according to the data, 80 percent of maids and housekeeping cleaners  stood continuously, 38 percent were exposed to disease daily, and 70  percent walked or ran continuously on the job.   Occupations that have seen the most growth among pregnant women in  the past decade expose many workers to disease or infection daily;  depending on the disease, this can pose particular challenges to some  pregnant workers at some points during pregnancy.   When pregnant workers are exposed to some diseases, they face  particular risks; pregnant women with rubella are at risk for  miscarriage or stillbirth and their developing fetuses are at risk for  severe birth defects.   Mr. Speaker, no one should have to choose between a paycheck and a  healthy pregnancy, which is why they should have clear rights to  reasonable accommodations on the job to ensure they are not forced off  the job at the moment they can least afford it.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 1065, the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.    Madam Speaker, it is good to be an American because  as I stand here today during National Police Week, I can truly say that  across America, we honor the police officer who holds a child's hand.  We honor the police officer who comes to an emergency situation.   I honor the police officers who, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,  were on the front lines without testing or vaccination, helping many  others. I know, Madam Speaker, because they helped me. They helped me  with my testing sites. Now, they help me with my vaccination sites.   I want to remind them they will be helping me tomorrow, and that is  Saturday the 15th, when we are at Key Middle School and Heights High  School, vaccinating children 12 to 15 years old with the Pfizer  vaccination, from 2 to 5 at Key Middle School and 10 to 1 at Heights  High School.   We mourn those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. That is  because we are Americans, and we stand united in that effort. There can  be no divide. We know who we believe in and what we believe in. We  thank them so very much, and we also believe in the liberties of all  people.                            ____________________
