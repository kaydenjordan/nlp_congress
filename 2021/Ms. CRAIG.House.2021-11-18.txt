 Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better Act follows through  on our commitment to expand access to and lower the cost of healthcare  for Americans across this country and back home in Minnesota.   Included in this bill are the most far-reaching and impactful  prescription drug reforms to pass this Congress in my lifetime. Not  only will Medicare have the power to negotiate the prices of critical  drugs for America's seniors, we are installing annual caps for Medicare  recipients, capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month.   We have designed a package that would lower out-of-pocket healthcare  costs for hardworking Americans by strengthening the ACA, extending the  premium tax credits for millions of families nationwide.    This is our chance to make good on our promise to deliver a real,  immediate impact that will lower the cost of healthcare to make it more  affordable, more accessible for every person across this country.   I, for one, could not be more proud, and I encourage my colleagues to  get this done.
