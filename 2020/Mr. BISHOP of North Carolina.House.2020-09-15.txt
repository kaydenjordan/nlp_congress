 Mr. Speaker, we all want to create the  maximum amount of opportunity for our children, regardless of their  background. That is why it is unfortunate  [[Page H4406]]  that this legislation fails to fix the most tragic inequity in our  education system: the absence of choice.   The right to a high-quality education is fundamental to the promise  of America, and no child should be denied that right because of income  or background. Thankfully, President Trump and Republicans in Congress  are working to provide that opportunity to all families.   I am proud to have introduced the CHOICE Act, which creates  opportunity grants that families can use for private school tuition,  microschools, learning pods, and homeschooling costs.   My bill ensures that all families--not just those with the means or  those lucky enough to live in a wealthy school district--have access to  the best possible education for their child. Giving families this  choice is the only way to furnish equal access to the American Dream.  Republicans are ready to take this step. If Democrats join us, we can  make it a reality.                                time  1400
