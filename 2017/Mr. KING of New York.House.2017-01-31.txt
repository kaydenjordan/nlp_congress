(c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after       the item relating to section 103 the following new item:  ``Sec. 104. Insider Threat Program.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation. Recent  high-profile cases of government employees leaking classified  information have caused drastic damage to U.S. national security and  diplomacy. The names Snowden and Manning are now synonymous with the  term ``insider threat.'' Unfortunately, Snowden, Manning, and others  were able to conduct their traitorous work undetected because the  government had at one time vetted and granted them access to secure  facilities and information systems.   In response to these cases, it is vital that Congress ensure Federal  agencies have the tools to detect and disrupt future insider threat  situations before damage is done. H.R. 666, in contrast to its unholy  numbering, has the important and respectable goal of authorizing and  expanding insider threat detection and mitigation efforts at the  Department of Homeland Security.  [[Page H776]]    DHS has over 115,000 employees with access to classified information  and many more with access to law enforcement sensitive data.  Unauthorized disclosures of classified information, whether deliberate  or unwitting, represent a significant threat to national security. The  very nature of modern communication systems, as well as DHS' important  information-sharing role with State and local partners, adds complexity  to the challenge and requires thoughtful programs to educate employees  and enhance DHS-wide detection capabilities.   The bill directs DHS to develop a strategy for the Department to  identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats and  requires DHS to ensure that personnel understand what workplace  behavior may be indicative of a potential insider threat and how their  activity on DHS networks will be monitored. The bill codifies a  comprehensive insider threat program at DHS that can be implemented  through the Department and its component agencies and, most  importantly, reinforces the importance of preventing future insider  attacks.   I want to thank Homeland Security Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member  Thompson, and Congressmen Dan Donovan and Lou Barletta for working with  me to bring this bill to the floor.   The same bill passed the House floor in November 2015 by voice vote.  Unfortunately, last-minute scheduling issues with the Senate prevented  the bill from reaching the President's desk. I am pleased that the  House is willing to take up this measure so quickly in the new Congress  so we can move it through the process. I look forward to working with  the Senate to move this measure forward.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can establish a  comprehensive, transparent, DHS-wide insider threat program. I urge  support for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me thank the ranking member for his  support and for his kind words, and let me fully agree with him on the  outstanding job General Taylor did during his time at DHS and  throughout his career in public service.   Mr. Speaker, on a daily basis, adversaries are targeting DHS and  other Federal agencies seeking to acquire sensitive information. U.S.  citizens with trusted access to government facilities and electronic  networks have been responsible for some of the most damaging attacks to  the U.S. Government.   This bill provides the framework for DHS to implement an insider  threat program that identifies and disrupts malicious insiders who seek  to do the Department and its employees harm. It also seeks to protect  the Department's workforce by conducting a transparent process to  reinforce cyber hygiene, data security, and an awareness of malicious  activity through a robust training program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 697) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  improve the management and administration of the security clearance  processes throughout the Department of Homeland Security, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 697, the Department of  Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act, and I  commend the gentleman from Mississippi for sponsoring it.   A security clearance is a privilege granted to individuals who have  pledged to protect the American people from threats domestically and  abroad. DHS has approximately 115,000 employees with varying access to  classified materials. One important element of H.R. 697 is the  requirement for the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct an  inventory of the Department's positions that require security  clearances and assess what positions may be duplicative or are no  longer necessary. It is just good government to ensure that individuals  still have a need to know.   In 2013, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called  the number of individuals with clearances ``too high.'' In a memo to  government agencies, Director Clapper expressed his concern with the  growing number of individuals with access to classified information,  particularly TS and SCI clearances.   Security clearances are costly to investigate, adjudicate, and  maintain. This bill would ensure that DHS conducts a thorough  accounting of its workforce needs and reduces the number of positions  if determined appropriate. The bill also includes requirements for  additional transparency on how security clearances are adjudicated,  including when there are reasons to suspend or deny a security  clearance.   H.R. 697, introduced by Ranking Member Thompson, is an example of the  accounting that each Federal department should be conducting today and  will lead to a more effective and lean Department of Homeland Security  in the future.   The bill is identical to the version the House passed last Congress  by voice vote. I urge support for the gentleman's bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank the gentleman  and commend him for his leadership on this issue.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 697, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 642) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  enhance the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and  the National Network of Fusion Centers, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 642         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 642, the Fusion Center  Enhancement Act of 2017, introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania,  my good friend, Congressman Lou Barletta.   The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, is focused on improving the  partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and the  National Network of Fusion Centers. The bill amends section 210A of the  Homeland Security Act to clarify and enhance partnership between DHS  and fusion centers.   As the United States is facing the highest threat environment since  9/11, it is vital that State and local agencies are receiving realtime  threat information and have access to Federal intelligence and support.  This was a key lesson learned from the 9/11 terror attacks, and,  unfortunately, reinforced after the 2012 Boston Marathon bombing. DHS  has a legal mandate to assist fusion centers in this effort, and H.R.  642 helps move the ball forward.   The threat of lone wolves inspired by ISIS and other radical Islamist  terrorist groups are not deteriorating, and it is critical that there  are strong partnerships between the Federal Government and State and  local law enforcement agencies. This bill will help the Department and  the national network maintain and improve their current partnership.   This bill passed the House last Congress by voice vote, and I am  pleased the House is willing to move it again this year.   I want to thank Congressman Barletta for leading the committee's  efforts in developing this responsible and commonsense legislation.  Congressman Barletta's background as a businessman, city councilman,  mayor, and Congressman has left him with a strong commitment to public  safety and security.                                time  1445    It has been a pleasure to work with Lou on the Homeland Security  Committee, where he was a vocal advocate for information sharing. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that the partnership  between DHS and the national network is strong and agile to protect the  United States against the ever-changing terrorism threat.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 642, the       Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017. This legislation       includes  [[Page H780]]       matters that I believe fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of       the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 642, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on       our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the       bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your interest in H.R.       642, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017.'' I       appreciate your cooperation in allowing this legislation to       move expeditiously before the House of Representatives. I       understand that the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure, to the extent it may have a jurisdictional       claim, will not seek a sequential referral on the bill; and       therefore, there has been no formal determination as to its       jurisdiction by the Parliamentarian. We appreciate your       cooperation in this matter.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that the absence of a decision on this bill at       this time does not prejudice any claim the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure may have held or may have       on similar legislation in the future.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Barletta), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall).     Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support of the  gentleman's bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 642 in order to  bolster the information sharing environment within the Department of  Homeland Security and between the Department and State and local  stakeholders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
