 Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise  today with my colleagues who have helped organize this, particularly my  colleague Congressman Rutherford, to pay tribute to the servicemembers  who tragically perished on December 5 during a training exercise off  the coast of Japan:   Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Herrmann of New Bern, North Carolina;   Major James M. Brophy of Staatsburg, New York;   Captain Jahmar Resilard of Miramar, Florida, who was raised in my  district and whose mother I have spoken with;   Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores of Surprise, Arizona;   Corporal Daniel Baker of Tremont, Illinois; and,   Corporal William Ross of Hendersonville, Tennessee.   These decorated marines served our Nation with distinction. Listing  their achievements does little to pay adequate tribute to their  bravery, courage, and dedication to our country.   On behalf of my colleagues, I express our heartfelt condolences to  the families of these honorable servicemembers, their friends, and  their colleagues in the United States Marine Corps. Our Nation grieves  with you, and we pray that you find comfort during these extremely  difficult times.   Mr. Speaker, I request that the House of Representatives observe a  moment of silence in memory of these American heroes.                            ____________________
