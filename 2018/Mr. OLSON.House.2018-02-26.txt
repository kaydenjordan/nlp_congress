 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, my friend from Michigan  (Mr. Mitchell), and his cohost, Mrs. Walters of California, for this  first Special Order of the Tax Reform Truth Squad.   We are thrilled that Texans have the first chance to speak on such an  important issue. Texans love to brag about Texas, and that is what we  will do tonight. That is what I will do.   I want to brag about two stories from home and two faces from home.  The first face is Justin Mannino. He runs the Houston Shoe Hospital in  my hometown of Sugar Land, Texas. It is right there at the corner of  Williams Trace and State Highway 6. For 10 years, I have taken my boots  to be shined at that store.   I have talked to Justin about what the Tax Code and the cuts will do  for his business. He said:         It is simple. More money in my pocket means I will pay off       all my credit cards and all our debt.    But most importantly, Justin met his bride in Mexico. They were  married there. With all this new money he has because of our tax cuts,  he plans to take his two kids to the same church where they were  married to baptize them in the Lord, Jesus Christ. That is priceless.  That has happened because of these tax cuts.   A second story and face that comes to mind is a dear friend, Andres  Novoa. He is the owner of a Fort Bend County icon, La Cocina Mexican  Restaurant, right there off of Highway 357.   He told me that the biggest benefit to his business is that he can  pay his employees more--more money in their pockets. He can expand his  business. He can get new equipment. He said the last 4 years of high  taxes and the exploding regulations have caused a small retraction in  his business. He is now in full expansion mode. He is giving his  employees more pay and has plans right now to buy more equipment.   And there is more.   Andres is the heart and soul of an annual fundraiser for seniors'  Meals on Wheels in Fort Bend County. Every Cinco de Mayo, when Mexico  celebrates their independence from France, he has a fundraiser at La  Cocina. Last year, he raised over $60,000. With more money in his  pocket, he thinks he can have a bigger party and maybe raise $100,000,  or maybe purchase a new van to deliver food.   This is a picture of Andres. He is smiling because he was talking  with us about those amazing tax cuts. He is just one more picture.   I invite America to check out Justin's and Andres' story at my  website, my Facebook page, or on Twitter. Hear their voices. See them  speak. Learn what they have learned.   I will close with a request from Justin and Andres. They want me to  say thank you to President Donald Trump and thank you to every Member  of Congress who voted for this bill.   This bill is not about crumbs. This bill is about real money in real  people's pockets. I invite everyone to come down to Houston, Texas, in  Sugar Land, and get your boots shined at Houston Shoe Hospital. If you  have some time, add another belt buckle, because you will get filled up  at Andres' restaurant, La Cocina.
