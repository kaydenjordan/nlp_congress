 Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, later this afternoon, the Senate will  hold its fourth cloture vote on a package of important foreign policy  legislation that was introduced back on January 4. For weeks, Senate  Democrats have effectively filibustered this legislation and blocked it  from moving forward.   At first, my colleague the Democratic leader said his party was  simply opposed to considering any other business during the partial  government shutdown, but then just a few days later, he actually sought  to move ahead with a foreign policy vote of his own. In other words,  though Senate Democrats were filibustering this pro-Israel legislation  with the thin excuse that they didn't want to take up any other  business, it turns out it was just the pro-Israel legislation that was  actually off-limits.   While Senate Democrats were filibustering this legislation, by the  way, the Democratic House had no problem considering one component of  it, which it passed by voice vote.   So I remain curious as to the real reason why the Democrats insisted  on filibustering these critical bills. Maybe we will get a better  explanation this week, assuming Democrats finally drop the filibuster  and allow this body to get back to work. This is an important piece of  legislation. It comes at an urgent time.   For the past 8 years, the world has seen a despotic regime wage  brutal war upon its own people. The conflict in Syria has taken more  than 400,000 lives and driven more than 5.6 million civilians to flee  the country, straining the capacity of nations in the region, as well  as Europe, to deal with the refugee and humanitarian fallout. Bashar  al-Assad and his cronies have paved the way for the persistent terror  of the Islamic State and invited the chaotic influence of foreign  powers, especially Iran and Russia.   Of course, this is a region that already contends with persistent-- persistent--instability, including Iran's meddling, financial support  for terror, and explicit threats against Israel, but the legislation at  hand addresses these challenges actually head-on. It tells our ally  Israel that our commitment to its security is ironclad. It tells our  partners in Jordan that we have their backs as they grapple with the  flow of refugees and other ongoing effects of the Syrian crisis. It  makes a crystal clear statement to the Syrian regime and those who abet  it: Your brutality needs to end.   Here is how the legislation accomplishes all that: It makes sure the  United States walks the walk when it comes to supporting Israel by  authorizing military assistance, loan guarantees, and teamwork on  missile defense.   Another bipartisan provision would preserve communities' rights to  combat the destructive BDS movement by ensuring that States and local  governments can choose not to funnel taxpayer dollars to companies that  push anti-Israel boycotts.   With respect to Jordan, the bill before us reauthorizes legislation  to deepen our cooperation with this key regional partner, which has  faced grave challenges from the chaos that continues to unfold in its  neighbor to its north.   With respect to Syria, this legislation includes the bipartisan  Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. As I mentioned earlier, this  passed the House on a voice vote just last week.  [[Page S688]]    It would create new pathways to hold accountable the individuals and  institutions that have tortured and murdered countless Syrian civilians  over the course of the civil war. It would ensure that unless the  Syrian regime shifts course and ends its brutality, the nation's major  industries and financial institutions would pay a heavy price due to  American sanctions.   So if it weren't obvious, these are critically important issues, and  none of them have been put on pause because the Democrats' political  strategy has blocked this body from taking action.   Due to the Democrats' filibuster, Israel, Jordan, and the innocent  people of Syria have already had to wait 24 days for the Senate to  proceed to these largely noncontroversial and widely supported  bipartisan bills.   I hope our colleagues across the aisle don't keep them waiting much  longer.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for more than 30 years, the men and  women of Paducah, KY, have prospered with the leadership of my friend,  Bob Leeper, in city, State, and finally county government. There are  few individuals more appreciated for their public service in western  Kentucky. At the end of last year, Bob completed his term as McCracken  County judge-executive, and I would like to take a moment to offer my  gratitude and reflect on his many years of service.   There is a common expression identifying two types of people who are  elected to office: show horses and work horses. The first kind thrives  when driving home a point in front of the camera or in making a bold  headline. On the other hand, a work horse will forgo acclaim in favor  of accomplishment and reject praise for progress. Without a doubt, Bob  has spent his career as a work horse. His achievements will leave a  lasting impact on the area and our Commonwealth.   To say the least, Bob cared little for party labels. As a matter of  fact, during his distinguished career, Bob hit the political  ``trifecta'' of sorts, having been elected by his constituents as a  registered Democrat, then a Republican, and lastly as an Independent.   In his first elected office as Paducah city commissioner, Bob also  served as mayor pro tem and quickly earned his colleagues' respect.  From there, Bob won a seat in the Kentucky State Senate. In Frankfort,  Bob set himself apart as a constructive leader and a problemsolver. His  reputation for handling complex issues with fairness garnered the  appreciation of his fellow senators on both sides of the aisle.   Reelected five times, Bob served for 24 years in Kentucky's  legislature including as the chair of the senate appropriations and  revenue committee. His work from this important post displayed his  integrity, skill, and his characteristic nature as a work horse.   Bob chose to leave the Senate in 2014, but that didn't end his career  of public service. The same year, he was elected as the McCracken  County judge-executive, the top job in county government. In that role,  Bob had the opportunity to continue serving his community and making  positive impacts on the lives of his neighbors. Among his proudest  accomplishments, he includes a number of infrastructure improvements at  the courthouse, jail, road department, and in the local parks. I  enjoyed partnering with him on behalf of workers at Paducah's U.S.  Department of Energy site.   For his decades of service in Kentucky, the current members of the  Paducah City Commission wanted to express their gratitude to Bob at his  retirement with a lasting testament to his work. The commission  unanimously voted to name a footbridge in his honor in Paducah. When  completed, the Bob Leeper Bridge will connect the city and county's  trail systems, a fitting tribute to a man who spent his career working  to benefit his community.   As he enters his retirement from public service, Bob plans to return  to his first calling: treating patients at his chiropractic clinic. He  also will spend more time volunteering, playing tennis, and relaxing  with his beloved wife Gina. It is my privilege to join so many in  McCracken County to thank Bob for his three decades of committed vision  and leadership. I ask my Senate colleagues to help me congratulate  Judge-Executive Bob Leeper on this milestone and to extend best wishes  in his retirement.   Mr. President, the Paducah Sun recently published an editorial  expressing appreciation to Bob. I ask unanimous consent that the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Paducah Sun, Jan. 17, 2019]   Sincere Appreciation: Words of Thanks for Longtime Elected Leader Bob                                   Leeper                          (By the Editorial Board)         The inspirational quote was painted on Bob Leeper's office       wall at the McCracken County Courthouse in 2015, shortly       after he took over as county judge-executive.        ``Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,'' the       quote from author Marianne Williamson reads. ``Our deepest       fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.''        The motivational words stayed on that wall all four years,       serving as daily affirmation.        ``It's a reminder that we all have purpose and sometimes       it's bigger than we even realized and we kind of have to       accept that place that we are in life, and sometimes it's       important you take a stand,'' Leeper said.        A case could be made Leeper's life purpose, or at least one       of them, was serving his native Paducah and McCracken County,       which he did in his quiet, transparent and dignified way for       more than half his life across three offices.        Leeper, 60, served 31 years total--three as a Paducah city       commissioner, 24 as a state senator, and a sole four-year       term as judge executive.        He did not run for reelection, and turned over the county's       top leadership post to current judge-exec Craig Clymer       earlier this month.        Leeper, a chiropractor by trade, is now enjoying his       ``political retirement,'' spending his time treating patients       at his clinic, volunteering in the community, and enjoying       one of his favorite hobbies--playing tennis.        He doubts very seriously his name will ever appear on       another ballot, which is sure to be a healthy change for him       but an unfortunate one for the local community.        ``Today, I'd say no, I don't think that's going to       happen,'' he said of someday running again for office. ``I       learned from four years ago that you never say absolutely no,       but I don't have any vision of anything right now.''        Now is the time for us, and we hope area residents, to       thank Leeper for all his hard work on the public's behalf at       the local and state levels. He served us honestly and       admirably, often eschewing publicity or attention, and with       his constituents' best interests in mind.        Frankly, leaders who put their communities first are rare       these days, and Leeper's presence and influence will be       greatly missed.  [[Page S697]]         No one could have blamed Leeper if he's chosen to call it a       career back in 2014, when he left the Kentucky General       Assembly. However, he stepped up to lead McCracken County,       returning much needed stability to an office that had seen       turbulence during the previous administration.        ``It was an opportunity for us to use some of the contacts       I'd made in Frankfort and make things better for the       community I grew up in,'' he said. ``It was difficult at       times, but we made some positive changes.''        His proudest accomplishments as judge-executive, he told       The Sun this week, were largely centered on infrastructure at       the courthouse, jail, road department, and parks. They       weren't glamorous, didn't beg for bold headlines or TV spots,       but they needed doing.        Leeper's next words are true to his laid-back personality:        ``Sometimes you don't get to cut ribbons and that's OK with       me,'' he said. ``I was proud this court took that same       attitude and we were able to do things that needed to be       done, even the kind that you don't cut ribbons on.''        ``We did it all without raising taxes and I think the       county is in a better place from Judge Clymer and the new       court.''        Join us in congratulating Leeper on a distinguished       successful career. Through his leadership, we have a great       example for future leaders to emulate.                            ____________________
