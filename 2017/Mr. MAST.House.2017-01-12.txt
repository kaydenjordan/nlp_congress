 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins) for including me in this Special Order tonight and for  yielding to me and for becoming a friend of mine.  [[Page H457]]    Mr. Speaker, it is with tremendous honor and humility that I rise to  represent the hardworking values of the 18th Congressional District of  Florida, with communities like Palm Beach Gardens, home of the PGA  tour; Stuart, Florida, home to the U.S. Sailing Academy; Port St.  Lucie, the spring training home of the New York Mets; and Fort Pierce,  Florida, the home of the only Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in the entire  country. It is an amazing place for anyone to go to.   Before I go any further, I do want to--and I know I am joined by the  rest of my freshmen colleagues, and probably the entire body, when I  say that our thoughts and our prayers have been with our new colleague,  Mr. Rutherford from the Fourth District of Florida, the sheriff as I  call him. He is a friend and a patriot. I know that we are all praying  for his speedy recovery.   As I talk to people in my community, there is one issue that keeps  them up at night more than any other issue, and that issue is the water  quality in our area, or rather, the lack thereof. I can tell you, it is  nonnegotiable. It is a nonnegotiable priority for me, that we allow the  water in our community, water that used to be so blue that it looked  like something out of a postcard, to once again become clean for this  generation and for future generations.    When I was studying at Harvard, I studied the environment. I did very  specific work in watershed infrastructure. I can tell you, it doesn't  take an academic to know that these waterways are irreplaceable  treasures. They are central to the economy and the quality of life in  our region. It is why most people I know make our 18th District home,  why they call it some place that they want to live for the rest of  their life. It is the water and it is the weather. To tell you the  truth, if you take the water away, the weather isn't always that  comfortable.   Right now there is water being discharged from the center of our  State, Lake Okeechobee into the Treasure Coast of Florida, destroying  our community, putting our people out of business, killing sea life,  and making people sick. What makes our community so beautiful is  literally being robbed from us, and this cannot continue. Our lagoon  and our estuaries have to be restored. I will work endlessly to  strengthen the partnership between our local, State, and Federal  agencies to upgrade that infrastructure; not just talk about it, but  actually get it done because this is life or death for the community  that I represent.                                time  1830    Mr. Speaker, if I sound heated over this, it is because I am heated  over this. When I look back at history and see that the Panama Canal  took less than a decade to build once the United States Government got  involved, that the Hoover Dam was built and open in 5 years, as far as  I can tell, construction technology has only improved since the 1930s,  but the infrastructure restoration surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the  Florida Everglades is taking decades. It is an absolute embarrassment  that the water infrastructure projects in Florida are taking so long  and at such a great social and economic cost to communities like my  own. We can't afford to wait any longer, and this will be my top  priority.   Another issue that I hear about constantly is from people in our  community talking about the role America's weak foreign policy over the  last 8 years has played in destabilizing the Middle East and making our  country and communities--places like Fort Pierce, where the terrorist  who attacked the Orlando nightclub lived, where he worshipped--making  our country less safe.   As a Member of Congress, I will work every day to provide the men and  women of our armed services with the tools and the flexibility that  they need to do their job and to come home alive.   When I was serving in the Army, I had the honor to work alongside the  best men and women that I have ever known. I worked as a bomb  technician in our highest level of military special operations; and  under the cover of darkness in Afghanistan, our job was to kill or  capture the most menacing targets each and every night that we could  find.   I witnessed firsthand the extremists that want to literally destroy  our way of life. My scars and the scars of my fellow veterans and  peers, they should be a continual reminder of the enemy that we are  fighting and why the work that we are doing is so important.   For me, on September 19, 2010, I found my last explosive device, and  it wasn't that much different from so many others that have claimed the  lives of friends of mine. It was homemade explosives encapsulated in  pieces of glass--nails, ball bearings, shrapnel that was meant to  detonate whenever it was stepped on.   Mr. Speaker, the people that put that bomb there, that manufactured  that device, who have killed or wounded our bravest men and women,  their goal is to wipe our country and our allies off the face of this  Earth, to bring that same war to our hometowns as they have done in so  many places already, places like New York and Boston and Chattanooga,  San Bernardino, Fort Hood, and Orlando.   Eight years of failed international leadership has created a vacuum  of power that is being filled by ISIS and other terrorist groups. ISIS  right now has more money, more land, more resources than al Qaeda did  at 9/11.   Sitting back and waiting for peace, that is not a strategy.  Containment, that is not a strategy. We need an aggressive strategy to  root out extremists, eliminate any safe haven to prevent future attacks  on the United States of America.   I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am as well aware as anybody that  defeating those who come against us out of a hatred, it comes at a  cost. Friends of mine--too many friends of mine--have lost three or  four limbs, have been blinded, have been covered on their entire body  with burns, have had massive head trauma or some combination of all of  the above injuries.   Sadly, I am also aware of how often the VA fails these men and women,  and I can tell you that it is not an option. We have to do better. We  owe our veterans better than the care that they are getting right now.   Improving care for our veterans, it starts with reforming the  Department of Veterans Affairs. I strongly believe that the best way to  do this is to give veterans the flexibility to choose anytime, anywhere  medical care. The increased competition will force the Department of  Veterans Affairs to provide a higher quality of care to our servicemen  and -women.   Beyond this, we have to eliminate the corruption and the incompetence  at the Department of Veterans Affairs to reduce the claims backlog  currently plaguing the VA hospitals across the country. These pending  claims make it nearly impossible for the men and women who fought in  places like Iwo Jima, the Chosin Reservoir, Saigon, Mogadishu,  Kandahar, Mosul, and any other places to live their life, as they have  to wait years for a decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Fixing these problems will ensure that the future generations of  servicemen and -women are not burdened with the same challenges that  today's veterans are facing.   In addition to physical health care, we have to do more to help  veterans with mental health care. There is a stat that is thrown around  all too often that there are more than 20 veterans a day who take their  own life. I have known some of them. I could tell you how that is an  unacceptable rate that far exceeds the average of the civilian  population. But the fact is, to lose just one veteran from suicide is  completely unacceptable.   This is very personal to me. I have seen firsthand the impact that  war can have on soldiers returning home, all of whom daily work through  the trauma of having friends whom they are forced to remember who  didn't come home with them.   Not a week goes by where I don't get a call from someone who wants to  talk about the fact that they want to step in front of a bus or go to  sleep in their garage with the car running and never wake up. Often  this call comes after a traumatizing experience that they have just had  at the Department of Veterans Affairs.   We need to be there for one another, and we need to be there for our  veterans. I think often about something that President Kennedy once  said. He said:   [[Page H458]]              The cost of freedom has always been high, but Americans       have always been willing to pay that price.    Our veterans, they do pay that price. They make tremendous personal  sacrifices. But just because they are always going to be there and they  are always willing to make these sacrifices for our freedom, that  doesn't mean that we can take their service for granted, which  is exactly what is happening every single time one of our veterans is  failed.    I am committed to doing all that I can to increase mental health  resources for our veterans and doing anything, whether that is  legislatively or personally, to reduce veteran suicide rates.   But we also have to do more to assist returning veterans in finding  jobs and starting new careers once they do exit the military. I know  that the men and women that I served with were among the most talented  and hardworking men and women that I have ever met in this entire  world.   Veterans know what it is like to work in high-pressure situations, to  be held to a standard of excellence. They know the stress of loading  their body down with hundreds of pounds of equipment and trekking that  across long distances, working together as a team. They know what it  takes to go out there and get the job done, no matter what challenge is  placed in front of them. And they know what it is to not just risk the  bottom line, but to actually go out there and put their own life on the  line.   Veterans are among the most qualified employees for any position. But  veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, they face an  unemployment rate that is substantially higher than the national  average. I am committed to working with local businesses and community  leaders to discuss ways to reverse this troubling trend, as well as  supporting legislation that will help our veterans use the very unique  skills and talents that they have developed for the rest of their life.   Mr. Speaker, following my service in the U.S. Army, I made a very  conscious choice to volunteer with the Israeli Defense Forces because  our countries share common ideals of freedom and democracy and mutual  respect for all people, something that I know firsthand is not common  in most of the Middle East.   During my time in Israel, I served alongside soldiers driven by love  for their fellow man rather than by hatred for their neighbors. I  learned with each family that I got to know just how much each family  truly desires peace with every neighbor of Israel, regardless of their  religion or their history with those countries. The same cannot be said  of Israel's enemies.   For the United States, the choice is very clear: we either stand with  a historic friend and ally who shares our values, or we cave to groups  like the Palestinians or countries like Iran who represent everything  that the United States is not.   I have found that the most important time to stand for what is right  is when it is the most difficult time to stand for what is right. This  moment in history is no different. We have to be proud of who we are,  and we have to stand with those who stand with us and stand against any  terrorist regime who seeks to threaten even one of us.   Mr. Speaker, the last thing that I want to say tonight is simply that  it is a tremendous honor to have the opportunity to serve the people of  Florida's 18th Congressional District. I know very well that the office  that I occupy, it doesn't truly belong to me. It belongs to those  people. And the simple fact is that the status quo has not been good  enough for them. Families across the country, they are hurting, and I  know that we have a lot of work to do.   I have laid out a number of priorities to help the 18th District and  to strengthen our country, but I also know this: the problems  Washington, D.C. is facing, they cannot just be fixed with bills and  laws.   One of the most important lessons that I ever learned in the  military, that I ever learned in combat, was that inspiration matters.  Military leaders that I had who displayed courage and valor and  selflessness, they drew the exact same thing out of every single  soldier that surrounded them. And that is my goal as I am here in the  Halls of Congress, every day, that I work to, above all, inspire each  peer that I have here, Republican and Democrat, to have courage and to  make sure that their sense of duty is to America above anything else,  and to make sure that we serve selflessly and, every day that we are  given the honor to serve here, to make this country and our communities  that much better.   Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as you can tell, the passion  that this class brings is no more better exemplified than by our friend  from Florida (Mr. Mast).   We now go back north. All over this election, it was an election  heard clear all over the country, from the north to the south, to the  areas in between, from Georgia to California. We have new voices, fresh  voices here, ones who come from business, who made their life helping  others find the workforce skills, the development.   That is what my friend, Mr. Mitchell, from Michigan's 10th  Congressional District, Paul Mitchell has done. He has made that a  process in his life, one that he wants to lead, and he wants to lead by  helping others. There is no greater satisfaction than to watch somebody  else that you have helped succeed, and he understands that. So he  brings that desire to us tonight.   He comes from the wonderful State of Michigan. He is a Spartan,  Michigan State University. As he comes along tonight, we look forward  to what Paul Mitchell from Michigan's 10th Congressional District is  going to bring to us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).
