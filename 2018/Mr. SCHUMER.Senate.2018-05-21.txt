 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Friday morning there was yet another  shooting in a school in America. Another community was torn apart by  senseless violence. It was another week when parents must bury their  children. We are still learning the tragic details of what happened in  Santa Fe, but the basic reality in America remains unchanged: Far too  many people are dying from gun violence.   What we need now more than ever is real, substantive debate on gun  violence in America--a real debate about universal background checks, a  real debate about protective orders, and a real  [[Page S2784]]  debate on regulating assault weapons, which are often the weapon of  choice in the most deadly mass shootings.   In the wake of Parkland, it looked like President Trump would finally  get religion on this issue. He promised a serious debate on gun  violence, but as soon as the NRA and their special interest cronies  closed ranks around him, he backed off. That seems to be the pattern of  this administration. The President says something one day, and then  some powerful interest says: Don't do it, and he backs right off. That  is not the kind of strength he wishes to show, and he sure hasn't shown  it on this issue.   After this most recent tragedy in Santa Fe, we have heard no new  calls for commonsense gun safety from the White House, but this Chamber  can still act. I implore my friends across the aisle to take up this  debate. We owe it to the people of Santa Fe, TX, to the people of  Parkland, FL, and to every other community that lives at the mercy of  the gaping loopholes in our gun laws.
