 Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump promised  American voters he would drain the swamp of special interests in  Washington. Instead, he is swimming in it.   He has filled his administration with billionaires, Wall Street  operatives, special interest lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants who  are drafting policies for the very industries they came from, and he  refuses to release the White House visitor log so we have no idea what  special interest lobbyists he is meeting with.   Trump has refused to release his tax returns or divest his business  interests.   Can you believe the State Department posted a blog advertising his  exclusive Mar-a-Lago resort? Since becoming President, he increased the  fees for that resort from $100,000 to $200,000.   He has both close allies, Cabinet appointees, and other appointees  with questionable ties to Putin and Russia.   His swamp is getting bigger and bigger.                            ____________________
