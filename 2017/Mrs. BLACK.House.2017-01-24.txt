 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule  to provide consideration of H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act. This bill is,  quite literally, the least we can do for American taxpayers and our  voiceless unborn.   Frankly, the fact that we are even here discussing this, and that  there is opposition to this bill at all, really does break my heart,  and it speaks to the depths of the entanglement with the big abortion  industry that exist in some corners of this Chamber. Because, at the  end of the day, you know what this bill really is about? The right to  choose.   We hear our friends across the aisle use the phrase a lot. But what  about the other right to choose, the right of the taxpayer to choose  not to pay for the practice that violates everything that they believe?  That is what we are here to protect.   The American people support this policy, with 6 in 10 surveyed saying  that taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund abortions. And these  are both pro-life and pro-choice.   So today, Madam Speaker, I am asking my colleagues across the aisle  to honor the will of their constituents. I am asking them to remember  the good old Democratic rallying cry of safe, legal, and rare abortion.  Obviously, abortion is not rare today when over 330,000 abortions are  performed in 1 year.   If my colleagues still believe these words, they will join us in  supporting this modest solution to keep unsuspecting taxpayers off of  the hook for this practice. And if they can't vote for this bill then  there is truly not a single limit on abortion that they will accept,  and that is a sad commentary on the state of politics.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just clarify for the Record that there is no Federal funding  for abortion. All you have to do is read the Hyde amendment, which has  been in effect for 40 years. I don't support it, but that is the law of  the land.   The majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal. So if you  want to talk about polls, the overwhelming number of Americans believe  that abortions should be safe and legal.   I also would like to say that while my colleagues are working  overtime to try to defund organizations like Planned Parenthood, it is  because of Planned Parenthood, the counseling that is provided, and the  reproductive services that are provided at their clinics, and  contraception, that the number of abortions have decreased in this  country.   Madam Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous  question. And if we do, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to  bring up legislation, which I am happy to be a cosponsor of, along with  Ms. Eshoo, that would require sitting Presidents and Presidential  nominees to disclose their last 3 years of tax returns.                                time  1300                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind all persons in the  gallery that they are here as guests of the House and that any  manifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings is in violation  of the rules of the House.   The gentleman may continue.   Mr. McGOVERN. Despite the long tradition of Presidents and  Presidential nominees of disclosing their tax returns, Donald Trump has  refused to release his, and his spokesperson recently said that he has  no intention of doing so. The American people expect and deserve  transparency, which this legislation would ensure.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, between his refusal to release his tax  returns and all these business conflicts of interest, this Presidency  is on a collision course with corruption.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support our effort here.   To discuss our proposal, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).
