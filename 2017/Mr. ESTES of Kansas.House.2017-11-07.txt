 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3441, the Save Local Business Act.   Too often, under the previous administration, radical policy shifts  were taken by unelected bureaucrats and activist judges, which harmed  our society. An example of this was in 2015, when the National Labor  Relations Board decided to unilaterally change a longstanding  definition of what constitutes an employer-employee relationship. That  changed the definition of a joint employer from an employer that has  ``actual, direct, or immediate'' control over the terms and conditions  of employment to someone who has ``potential'' or ``indirect'' control.  It should be obvious to you who your employer is. It is the one who  hired you and who signs your paycheck.   As Chairwoman Foxx said in a recent op-ed: ``When you have a hammer,  everything looks like a nail.'' That is so true for so many in  Washington.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill because it defines  joint employer in a commonsense way in order to do away with the  current, convoluted status. This bill will also prevent future  overreach from bureaucrats, and allows businessowners to manage their  own businesses.
