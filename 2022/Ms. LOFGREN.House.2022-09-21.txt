 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 44) authorizing  the use of the rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony to present the  statue of Harry S. Truman from the people of Missouri, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on House Administration be discharged from further  consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 82, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1372, I call  up the bill (H.R. 8873) to amend title 3, United States Code, to reform  the process for the counting of electoral votes, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 8873 into the Record.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8873, the  Presidential Election Reform Act.   This bipartisan bill is a product of over 2 years of work, first on  the Committee on House Administration and subsequently on the January  6th Select Committee.   Working in partnership with Representative Liz Cheney, we have had  extensive consultation with bipartisan law professors, former judges,  and other experts. We have engaged in a fulsome, thoughtful,  nonpartisan process, and where Ms. Cheney and I didn't always agree, we  compromised, in the great tradition of the legislative process.   I thank my friend, colleague, and the vice chair of the January 6th  Committee, Liz Cheney. Her partnership, leadership, intelligence, and,  frankly, her courage have been invaluable to the select committee's  work and to the development of this bill.   I want to be very clear: In revising the Electoral Count Act and  related laws, that in no way condones the actions of the ex-President  and his allies. Indeed, Dr. John Eastman openly admitted that his plan  violated the Electoral Count Act. President Trump was told the same.   But this bill will make it harder to convince people that they have  the right to overthrow the election. Here are a few things the bill  does.   First, this bill reaffirms that the Vice President's authority at the  electoral count is ministerial. The Vice President's authority has  always been ministerial and always will be ministerial, but as we saw  in 2020, former President Trump and his allies sought to unlawfully  exploit the ECA to suggest otherwise.   The bill will also enact new electoral counting rules for Congress.  Previously, just a few Members of each House were able to derail the  proceedings with frivolous objections. That will no longer be the case.   Under this bill, no objection will be heard unless one-third of each  House supports it, and the only objections that will be permitted are  those that are rooted in the Constitution itself, a narrow set of  issues.   The bill also prevents State and local election subversion. For  example, Governors will be required to submit their State's lawful  certificate of appointment, and Federal courts will be empowered to  force them to do so if they refuse.   Ultimately, this bill is about protecting the will of the American  voters, which is a principle that is beyond partisanship. The bottom  line is this: If you want to object to the vote, you better have your  colleagues and the Constitution on your side. Don't try to overturn our  democracy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on January 6, the President had whipped  up a mob, told them that the Vice President could overturn the  election, and a majority of the Republicans in this House voted to  reject the decision made by American voters as reflected in the  electoral college for no reason whatsoever, other than sham fraud  claims.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney), the vice chair of the January 6th Select Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, the January 6th Committee has as its  obligation to recommend legislative changes that would make the country  safer. We have done that.    I will say that the partisan split in the House Administration  Committee has always been six majority, three minority. On the select  committee, it is not that far off, seven majority, two minority.   We have worked together, and I hear Mr. Davis' concern that he didn't  participate. It wasn't me. It was Leader McCarthy that withdrew his  name. Had his name been left in, he would have been a member of the  committee, and he would have been able to participate in the obligation  our committee has undertaken.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), our majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, just a quick correction. Right now and in the 2020  election, we had States that said, gosh, there is fraud. It was  completely bogus, but they tried to monkey with the system. This bill  prevents that.   It defines a major natural disaster as any natural catastrophe,  including hurricane, tornado, historically significant widespread  snowstorm, historically significant widespread flooding, historically  significant destructive fire, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, or  volcanic eruption that prevents a large sector of a State from voting  enough that it could impact the election.   Then it limits how long you could accommodate that disaster. The  decision isn't made by partisans. It is Federal judges who would make  that determination.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Aguilar), an esteemed member of the January 6 Select Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, just a correction. What I actually said  in the Rules Committee is I hope we pass this bill. The Senate will  pass a bill. They are doing a markup in the Rules Committee next week.  If they are different, there is generally a conference committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), the vice chair of the January  6th Select Committee.    Madam Speaker, we are prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I think it is important to talk about the January 6th Select  Committee. Since its creation more than a year ago, the select  committee has given substantial attention to the issues related to the  Electoral Count Act and its need for reform.   Let's recall that in addition to finding out all the facts of the  events leading up to January 6, the select committee is tasked with  recommending changes in the law or in procedures that will prevent such  an occurrence in the future.   The select committee has devoted multiple public hearings, over more  than 4\1/2\ hours, to issues related to the Electoral Count Act and the  former President's efforts to overturn the election on January 6.   During these hearings, the committee heard from at least four  witnesses regarding the electoral college votes and other issues  related to the act.   Importantly, conservative judge, Michael Luttig, who is a legal  expert and served in the Reagan administration and was appointed by  President H.W. Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the  Fourth Circuit, testified  [[Page H8046]]  before the select committee that the Electoral Count Act, `` . . . is  not only a work in progress for the country, but at this moment in  history an important work in progress that needs to take place.''   He testified with reference to the Electoral Count Act that, `` . . .  Donald Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present  danger to American democracy.''   Now, why is that?   Because even though the presiding officer of the Senate, the Vice  President, has never had more than a ministerial role to play in the  counting of the votes, the former President told people that he could  change the outcome. He said so in his speech. He said so in tweets. He  threatened the Vice President. And we saw that that armed mob that came  here to attack us believed what the former President said.   In fact, they read allowed the tweets as he delivered them, and how  Mike Pence had disappointed him.   Madam Speaker, Judge Luttig said this about the bill that Ms. Cheney  and I have introduced: ``Had this bill, the Presidential Election  Reform Act, been the law during the 2020 Presidential election, there  never would have been the fateful January 6 that the country witnessed  and experienced that day.''   He also went on to say this bill is masterfully drafted. Now, why  would he say that?   Well, it is. But we also sought his considered judgment and expertise  as we crafted this bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record his remarks on this:         This week, Congresswoman Liz Cheney and Congresswoman Zoe       Lofgren introduced a bipartisan bill in the House to reform       the Electoral Count Act of 1887. This bill represents a       comprehensive and compelling Rule of Law overhaul of the       anachronistic ECA.        Had this bill, the Presidential Election Reform Act, been       the law during the 2020 Presidential election, there never       would have been the fateful January 6 that the country       witnessed and experienced that day.        Indeed, had this bill been the law before the 1876       presidential election, which was the impetus for the current       Electoral Count Act, the country never would have experienced       the election upheaval of that quadrennial presidential       election.        The Cheney-Lofgren bill is masterfully drafted so as to       require the state governors to transmit to Congress only what       are defined by the bill as the `conclusive' electoral votes       for the presidency representing the popular vote of the       states, a transmittal that will only occur after any and all       disputes over those votes have been resolved by the state and       federal courts.        Then, during the Joint Session, Congress will be allowed       only a few, very narrow grounds to object to these       `conclusive' votes, all of which grounds are related to the       technical constitutional qualifications of the electors or       their electoral votes.        Thirty percent of each, the Senate and the House, must       concur in an objection in order for it to be put before the       two Chambers of Congress for resolution and decision. An       objection must be agreed upon by fifty percent of both       chambers in order for it to be sustained.        With the Cheney-Lofgren bipartisan bill scheduled to be       voted on in the House tomorrow, it now appears that there is       not only bipartisan, but also bicameral, support for the       desperately-needed reform of the ECA.        I urge the Senate and the House to quickly conference and       resolve their differences in a law that will ensure there       will never again be another January 6 in America.    Madam Speaker, this is a bill that has been well received across the  political spectrum.   Now, we have got a Wall Street Journal report saying: ``The good news  is that the House now has a bill to update the 1887 Electoral Count  Act. . . . '' They go on to say, ``There's no excuse for Congress's  delay in fixing this invitation to political trouble.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the Wall  Street Journal and an article from the Washington Post.               [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 20, 2022]       Liz Cheney's Electoral Count Act Bill to Stop a Jan. 6 Repeat                          (By the Editorial Board)         The good news is that the House now has a bill to update       the 1887 Electoral Count Act, the antiquated law implicated       in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Even better, the legislation       unveiled this week by Republican Liz Cheney and Democrat Zoe       Lofgren reads like it's an improvement, in some respects, of       the Senate version.        The House plan says the Vice President's role when Congress       tallies the Electoral College ``is ministerial.'' The VP       can't on his own ``order any delay in counting.'' This       responds to President Trump's claim in 2020 that Mike Pence       could seize control of the joint session. Mr. Trump's legal       argument relied on a lack of clarity in the 12th Amendment,       which can't be fixed by statute. Still, it would be helpful       to have Mr. Trump's theory contradicted by the law and       Congress's explicit procedure.        The House bill says Electoral College certificates ``shall       be accepted as conclusive'' if submitted by a state's       Governor, unless a court orders otherwise. If a rogue       Governor refuses to certify the real winner, federal courts       could ``direct another official of the State'' to complete       the job. A three-judge panel would preside, with appeal to       the Supreme Court. The date for electors to vote would be       pushed to Dec. 23, providing more room for challenges to play       out.        Where the House bill might be an improvement is in making       it harder for partisans in Congress who want to get C-Span-      famous to lodge phony Electoral College objections. Only a       specified set of complaints would be heard, such as if a       state sends too many electors; if electors vote on the wrong       day or are ineligible; or if the presidential or vice       presidential candidate is ineligible. No whining on the House       floor that somebody had a funny feeling about the vote totals       in west southeastern Pennsylvania.        The Senate bill offers similar finality to the Governor's       certificate. Yet it would continue to permit Congress to       object vaguely that an elector's vote wasn't ``regularly       given.'' That's the same phrase Congress has abused for       years, and in 2020 an alarming 147 House and Senate       Republicans objected. An ideal reform would stop this       grandstanding. Hence, the House bill's idea to enumerate       specific grounds for legitimate objections.        Ms. Cheney and Ms. Lofgren also propose to lift the       threshold for objections. Under the current Electoral Count       Act, a single Senator working with a single Representative       can force Congress to debate their wild claims. The Senate       bill would require signatures from a fifth of each chamber.       The House bill raises that to a third. How about they keep       going and compromise at two fifths? More is better, but       requiring 33 Senators is better than needing only Sen. Josh       Hawley or Rep. Jim Clyburn.        The best approach remains for lawmakers to get out of this       objection business and leave such disputes to the courts. The       House bill retains a purported authority to reject Electoral       College votes if Congress decides that the incoming President       is constitutionally ineligible. But isn't 14 days before       Inauguration Day a little late for that, folks? Imagine if       President Trump wins a landslide in 2024 and then Democrats       move to invalidate his electors, saying that Mr. Trump led an       ``insurrection'' as defined under the 14th Amendment.        Perhaps it's unrealistic to expect lawmakers to give up the       power they arrogated in 1887, but the madness of Jan. 6,       2021, should have made a convincing case. It's asking for       trouble to enshrine any political process for overturning the       will of the voters two weeks before the transfer of power is       scheduled to take place. Last time it was voting machines in       Michigan, and before that it was Russian interference, and       before that it was voting machines in Ohio . . . but it's       always something for Congress's partisans.        Nevertheless, a bill to make that prospect less likely goes       in the right direction, especially if it cuts off the       microphone for the sour grapes and conspiracy theories that       marred the counting after 2000, 2004, 2016 and 2020.        This reform should have been the top priority for Congress       and the Jan. 6 committee from the beginning, but their       priority has been replaying the riot rather than trying to       prevent the next one. Let's hope it isn't too late in this       Congress to get this done at last.                                   ____                  [From the Washington Post, Sept. 20, 2022]      Opinion a New and Improved Version of Electoral Count Act Reform                            (By Jennifer Rubin)         The compromise proposal that Senate negotiators cobbled       together earlier this year to reform the 1887 Electoral Count       Act was a good start to prevent a repeat of the 2020 coup       attempt. But the bill was far from perfect, as testimony       before the Senate Rules Committee highlighted.        Fortunately, two members of the House select committee       investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, Reps. Liz Cheney (R-      Wyo.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) put forth their own improved       version on Monday, as described in an opinion piece for the       Wall Street Journal.        Their proposal makes a number of key changes to the law,       which stipulates the certification of electoral votes. For       example:        It confirms that the vice president has only a ceremonial       role.        It specifies that members of Congress can only object to       electoral votes if they concern ``the explicit constitutional       requirements for candidate and elector eligibility and the       12th Amendment's explicit requirements for elector       balloting.'' Interestingly, the proposal makes clear that one       objection might be that the candidate is ineligible under       Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars from federal       office anyone who ``engaged in insurrection or rebellion       against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies       thereof.'' In other words, it would serve as a trip wire for       challenging former president Donald Trump on the basis that       he instigated an ``insurrection.''        It raises the threshold for Congress to vote on an       objection from one lawmaker in each chamber to one-third of       each chamber.  [[Page H8047]]         The proposal also avoids some of the confusing language       included in the Senate proposal regarding state       certification. The House version is a helpful and precise       description of the correct process:        Governors must transmit lawful election results to       Congress; if they fail to fulfill that duty, or another       official prevents the lawful results from being transmitted,       candidates for the presidency should be able to sue in       federal court to ensure that Congress receives the state's       lawful certificate. These suits would occur before Congress       counts electoral votes, and should ensure, in all cases where       one candidate has the majority of electoral votes, that       Congress's proceeding on Jan. 6 is purely ministerial.     Madam Speaker, I was very happy to get that support from  the organization, from The Wall Street Journal, but we also got kudos  from Cato, that well-known conservative institution, that they say this  bill is actually more conservative and originalist as compared to other  measures.   It is not every day that the Center for American Progress and the  Cato Institute see it the same way. But they do in this case. Both  organizations, right to left, agree that this is an appropriate step to  take and that it will help make our country safer.   Madam Speaker, I would address a couple other issues before closing.   First, it is unfortunate that my friend, Mr. Davis, has said  something that is clearly inaccurate. In the bill itself it defines  what is a disaster. It is not somebody saying, gosh, there's COVID. It  is a tightly defined set of catastrophes that will be decided by a  Federal three-judge panel and will be limited just in time and scope so  that people could have their votes cast and counted.   I also want to address something I think is very unfortunate, the  suggestion that somehow I had a role in trying to overturn the election  in Iowa. Nothing could be further from the truth.   The Federal Contested Election Act says this:         A candidate challenging an election, is required within 30       days after the result of their election, to file with the       clerk and serve upon the contestee written notice of the       intention to contest an election.    Once that is done, it is assigned to the House administration  committee. It wasn't my idea. That is what our rule says. And there is  a process that has to be undertaken.   Now, we didn't finish that process because the contestee withdrew,  which was her right, and frankly, I was glad that the matter was  terminated. But that is just what the law requires.   Madam Speaker, I would make a final comment about the objections  under this proposed law. It is true that Members of both sides of the  aisle have randomly objected to certification of the electoral college.  I think, honestly, that is unfortunate. But we never saw a majority of  one party vote to overturn the election as we did on January 6 of 2020.   What this bill would do would be to make sure you could never have  those kinds of objections in the future. We did some research. We  believe that under our bill, not a single objection in the last 100  years would have been allowed under this bill. The last example was a  disagreement in 1873 about whether a candidate who passed away after  the election still qualified as a person for Article II purposes. That  would be covered under the limited set.   But this would put an end to using frivolous challenges to the  electoral count. And that is another good reason why we should pass  this bill today.   Madam Speaker, 234 years ago, the authors of The Federalist Papers  asked this: ``Who are to be the electors of the Federal  Representatives? Not the rich, more than the poor; not the learned,  more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of distinguished names,  more than the humble sons of obscurity. . . . The electors are to be  the great body of the people of the United States.''   That is the message that resonates to this day. This bill will ensure  that the voice of the American people is the final word on the future  of our Republic.   All told, the reforms in this bill confine Congress to its true  narrow role in Presidential elections under the 12th Amendment.   I hope and trust that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would  join us in this critical effort to protect American democracy and to  ensure, in President Lincoln's words at Gettysburg, ``that government  of the people, by the people,'' and ``for the people'' long endures.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
