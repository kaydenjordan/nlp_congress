 Mr. Speaker, I will address an issue that will not  affect us until the second half of this century, an issue that I first  addressed 23 years ago; the first year of this century.   It is the issue of engineered intelligence. The race that the  engineers don't know that they are in. A race between the bioengineers  and DNA and the computer engineers and artificial intelligence, AI, to  create a new level of intelligence on this planet; in effect, to  develop our successor species.   AI will have dramatic effects in the short-term. It will have  benefits because it is a powerful tool. It will be used by evil men and  women because it is a powerful tool.   They will use it to accomplish their goals, and sometimes they will  make mistakes. They will invade privacy. They will deny loans to people  who should get them for wrongful reasons.   These are issues that we have faced in the last hundred years wherein  this or that technology has invaded our privacy or discriminated  against people in this or that financial transaction.   My focus is the second half of this century when we will face issues  far beyond that.   As to artificial intelligence, Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak and others  have asked for a 6-month delay, but we will not see a 6-month delay in  our research.   Frankly, a 6-month delay wouldn't accomplish much because the issues  surrounding AI are intractable, and we have squandered at least 23  years in failing to deal with them. Another 6 months will do us little  good.   I commend the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and I don't  commend Kevin McCarthy all that often,  [[Page H2113]]  for bringing the entire House together 2 days ago to focus on the  artificial intelligence issue and to hear from Professors Torralba and  Madry of MIT.   The professors showed us that AI clearly has met the Turing Test. The  Turing Test was set forward by Professor Turing many, many decades ago.   Professor Turing was the subject of the Imitation Game, one of the  most brilliant computer professors we have ever had, that the western  world has ever had.   That test was that you would have a text chat with a computer and not  be able to tell whether you were talking to a human or to a computer.   At that point, computers would have reached human levels of  intelligence. Well, we have clearly gotten to that level. We call it  ChatGPT. Chat is right in the name.   Today's computers cheat on the Turing Test. It is no longer a valid  test because today's computers have something Professor Turing from the  1940s and 1950s could not have imagined, and that is the internet.   They are able to mimic a human response just by looking at every  other human response to a similar statement or question by looking at  the entire internet.   As the MIT professors pointed out, it is kind of like a parrot; able  to say something that under some circumstances might be the right  response without understanding the words.   AI will not, therefore, probably be intelligent the way I would view  it for decades. We will need a new test, not the Turing Test.   For now, AI is a tool. It is a great tool, as was writing and fire  and jet travel and the internet. We will be able to deal with that  tool.   The second half of this century will see an AI that is intelligent,  that has--or might very well see this. It may very well be self-aware,  aware that it exists and that it exists on a planet that can be  affected things outside of its own existence.   AI may have volition; will. It may have ambition, the desire to  survive, perhaps the desire to propagate, and in any case, the desire  to affect the world so as to achieve its own survival. AI is a powerful  tool.   China is not going to stop developing it for the next 6 months.  American corporations see big profits. They are not going to stop  developing it.   The private sector isn't going to spend much of its money making sure  that AI is trustworthy. They are going to try to make sure that AI is  profitable.   We need to be concerned about an AI that is self-aware and ambitious.  Such an AI will have risks that are beyond the apocalypse to the human  race.   Therefore, I propose that 10 percent of all the money we spend on AI  research be used to prevent and monitor for self-awareness, volition,  and ambition. Perhaps also to monitor for AI's awareness that we are  monitoring it for those purposes.   If someone, some futurist is describing what the second half of this  century will look like, and they paint a picture that seems to be a  science fiction movie, they might be wrong. They might be right.   If a futurist paints a picture of the future that doesn't look like a  science fiction movie, you know they are wrong. Our children will be  living in a science fiction movie; we just don't know which one.   Let us not build Skynet. If you remember the Terminator movies, you  will remember that Skynet destroyed most of the human race just seconds  before it thought correctly that it was going to be unplugged.   Terminator was a great movie to watch, a terrible movie to live in,  and I don't know if we can count on Sarah Connor.   There are two advantages that the human race has in preventing self- aware and ambitious AI. First, we are designing the AI, and we may  understand what we are doing while we are doing it. We might.   Second, the machines are inherently, from our experience, not  volitional, not ambitious. Go to the largest computer and say to the  computer, I am planning to unplug you, break you up, and sell you for  parts, and that computer will help you calculate how much money you can  get for the parts.   Now let's look at genetic engineering, bioengineering. While the  largest computer seems fine with being unplugged, the smallest insect  does not.   Try stepping on a cockroach and see whether it is okay with being  unplugged. The DNA, which didn't care whether it survived, didn't care  to propagate, didn't, and isn't with us.   We may see genetic engineers, DNA engineers, start with human DNA and  create a 1,000-pound mammal with a 100-pound brain that is going to  beat your kids on the law school admissions test. That mammal, like  every other mammal, will probably have a survival instinct.   Today's big headlines are about ChatGPT and artificial intelligence.  Last year's big headline was about CRISPR, a new technology for the DNA  engineers to use, and those headlines may turn out to be more  important.   It will be hard to limit genetic engineering because initially, it  will help deal with human tragedy. We will use genetic engineering to  help cure disease.   Genetic engineering will help the impaired human, will help to  decrease disease or syndromes. First, we will see us create the non- impaired human, the repaired human, and only then will we go forward to  the transhuman.                                time  1215    There is a second issue, kind of something off to the side, and that  is some world leaders--and I am looking at you Kim Jong-un--will seek  to create submissive or subservient humans genetically.   Third, also off to the side, there are animal rights advocates who  have argued that animals have reached a point where they deserve  constitutional rights. Well, when genetic engineers create a pet dog or  a working dog with near human intelligence, those animal rights  advocates may have a point.   Let us return to the great race to create transhuman intelligence  that is self-aware and ambitious. We need rules regarding genetic  engineering that make it plain that while it is okay to seek to prevent  intellectual disability, it is not okay to use genetic engineering to  create intelligence beyond that of the average human.   Of course, we need to prevent the use of genetic engineering to  create animals of greater intelligence than that animal species or  humans of impaired will or impaired intelligence.   We do know one thing: Intelligence is the most powerful thing on the  planet. It is intelligence that gave us fire. It is intelligence that  gave us nuclear fusion. It is intelligence that gives us an unending  supply of cat videos on our phone.   The last time a new level of intelligence arose on this planet it was  when our ancestors said hello to a Neanderthal. It didn't work out for  the Neanderthal.   There is a race between the computer engineers and AI and the  bioengineers and DNA to develop the next level of intelligence, perhaps  to create our successor species.   Will the next dominant species on this planet be carbon-based or  silicon-based, the product of genetic engineering or the product of  computer engineering?   Artificial intelligence is in the lead, creating an incredible level  of intelligence that is useful to us now and is progressing at the  speed of computing. Genetic engineering starts with the raw material  that has a survival instinct and ambition.   I don't know who will win this race. I am old-fashioned. I am rooting  for team human, which may not even be in the race.                          Recent Events in Pakistan     Mr. Speaker, I would like to address recent events in  Pakistan. In evaluating those events, some would say that America  should root for whichever political leader styles themselves as more  pro-American and has been easier for us to deal with on this or that  bilateral issue.   I would say--and I think the State Department agrees--that what comes  first is our dedication to democracy and the rule of law. Imran Khan  was difficult for us to deal with; Prime Minister Sharif is somewhat  easier. The question is democracy and the rule of law.   The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ruled that there should be  provincial elections in Punjab and later on in another province. That  is the rule of law.  [[Page H2114]]  I believe that supreme court has ruled that its initial ruling is final  and unappealable, and the supreme court has ordered that the funds be  released as are necessary to hold those provincial elections.   America stands not with this policy or that policy or a government  that will agree with us on this issue or that issue. America stands for  democracy and the rule of law. America also stands for human rights and  the right of free speech and the right to express one's opinions. I, of  course, have been concerned about some of the terrible disappearances,  some of the abuses of human rights, some of the substantial evidence of  torture.   We need human rights and democracy in Pakistan. We need the rule of  law. America stands not with its short-term bilateral concerns but with  our dedication to democracy and human rights.   Most important of all, Pakistan has national elections set forth in  October, and nothing is more important for Pakistan than that those  elections be timely, legitimate, fair, and that whoever wins the  elections be allowed to govern.                           War in Ethiopia, Tigray     Mr. Speaker, I will turn my attention to an issue that  too many in Washington didn't pay attention to, as over 600,000 people  died, and now some are not paying attention to the theory that the  problem is over. I speak of northern Ethiopia, Tigray.   While the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement was signed in November,  the Tigrayan people continue to face ethnic violence and  discrimination. Earlier this month, the AP reported that Amhara forces  have renewed their campaign of ethnic cleansing against Tigrayan  civilians and have uprooted roughly 47,000 Tigrayans from areas in  southern Tigray just since March. The Amhara forces are carrying out  this campaign of ethnic cleansing through forced evictions, harassment,  and murder.   Throughout all history, ethnic cleansing and genocide have gone  together. This is not a standalone event, but rather, follows a  horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing of Tigrayan civilians by Amhara  regional forces that began in the year 2020.   Last year, Secretary Blinken publicly recognized that ``Members of  the Amhara forces also committed the crime against humanity of  deportation or forcible transfer and committed ethnic cleansing in  western Tigray,'' in addition to ``war crimes'' and ``crimes against  humanity, including murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence and  persecution.'' This is on top of the involvement of Eritrean forces in  Tigray. Eritrea is a separate country. It has no business having its  troops anywhere in Ethiopia.   The determination made by our State Department on what is happening  in Tigray follows extensive reporting by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty  International in April of 2022, which documented: `` . . . Ethiopian  federal forces, systematically expelled several hundred thousand  Tigrayan civilians from their homes using threats, unlawful killings,  sexual violence, mass arbitrary detention, pillage, forcible transfer,  and the denial of humanitarian assistance.''   We have many things going on in the world. I know that most of our  foreign policy or a very large chunk of it is focused on events in  Eastern Europe and Ukraine, but Washington cannot turn away from this  issue, nor can we assume that the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement  solves the problem.    The people of Tigray deserve our attention and the engagement of the  United States and the entire international community. Our leaders in  Washington need to focus on what has been the most deadly event of the  last several years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).               Celebrating the 100th Anniversary of Texas Tech     Mr. Speaker, seeing no one else who wishes me to yield  them time, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
