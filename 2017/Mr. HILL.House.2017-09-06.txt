 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Georgia Mjartan of  Little Rock. She is the executive director of Our House and is stepping  down after 12 years.  [[Page H6660]]    During her 12 years at Our House, Georgia was named ``Nonprofit  Executive of the Year'' in 2011 and Our House was named ``Nonprofit  Organization of the Year'' in 2015.   Under her leadership, Our House has seen extraordinary growth and  plays an important role in our community, serving those who find  themselves homeless or near homeless, while providing life skills,  resources, and services to overcome their situation.   Our House empowers residents to succeed in the workforce, in school,  and in life through hard work, smart choices, and community  involvement. Our House will continue to thrive.   Georgia is a pillar of the community. She is a loving wife, mom,  foster and adoptive parent of three beautiful children. I am proud to  call her friend, and I wish her the best of luck as she relocates from  Arkansas to South Carolina.                            ____________________
