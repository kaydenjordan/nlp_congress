 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this amendment--I think it  is in the wrong direction--and to support the underlying bill.   The bill, I think, strikes a balance. Americans cherish and strongly  want us to protect their privacy. We all agree on that, and I think  this bill threads the needle. The underlying bill protects our Fourth  Amendment through the FISA process through this improved effort.   We know we live in a dangerous world. Terrorism is a constant threat  that we all clearly understand. When we take our oath of office, we  swear to protect and defend our Nation from all enemies, foreign and  domestic. I believe this underlying bill does that with increased  transparency.   Clearly, it is not perfect. We never vote on any perfect legislation.  But this is an improved piece of legislation. The amendment is an  overreach in the wrong direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill.
