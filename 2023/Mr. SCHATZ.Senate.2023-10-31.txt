 Mr. President, this is a personal attack on a public  servant, and it should be rejected.   To be clear, Ann Carlson is legally authorized to serve as the Acting  Administrator of NHTSA under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But what  this amendment would do is set an alarming precedent in the Senate  that, if you have a political or policy disagreement with a particular  administration policy, you can take the public servant who is in charge  of implementing it and take their salary hostage.   And if the issue is that she hasn't been confirmed by the Senate,  let's remember that in the last administration we had two different  Acting Administrators working for months without being Senate  confirmed, and it is no surprise that the ranking member of the  Commerce Committee didn't object to them because he agreed with their  policy.   It is fine for you to disagree with fuel efficiency incentives. It is  fine for you to never want to move on from the internal combustion  engine and to oppose the electric vehicle revolution. That is fine.  What is not OK is the U.S. Senate coming in and defunding a position of  an Administrator with whom you disagree.   And I want you all to think about this, Republicans. I want you all  to think about this, Democrats. There will be times, as Claire  McCaskill used to say, that ``the door swings both ways in  Washington.'' So let's think very carefully about whether we want to  set a precedent where the U.S. Senate defunds public servants with whom  we disagree.   This amendment should be rejected.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1296
