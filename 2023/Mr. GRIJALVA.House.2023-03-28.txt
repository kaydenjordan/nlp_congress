 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, today I rise in urgent opposition to the Republicans' H.R.  1.   Last week, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change issued its final report. Their message couldn't be clearer. We  have a lot to do and very little time to do it before the ticking  climate bomb we are living in goes off.   I want to emphasize that their message wasn't one of complete  despair. There is hope. The hope hinges on two major conditions.   One, we must stop burning fossil fuels, the number one cause of  climate change. And two, we must transform our energy system to a  cleaner and more sustainable one now.  [[Page H1487]]    H.R. 1, the bill before us today, which has earned the fitting title  of polluters over people act, will actively and aggressively take us  backwards on both those accounts.   Looking more like a nearly 200-page love letter to polluting  industries than a serious legislative effort, the polluters over people  act is a laundry list of gifts and giveaways to polluting industries.   Let's look at what it does for Big Oil. For example, last year  companies shattered profit records across the board by price gouging  working Americans at the pump while also hoarding thousands of unused  leases on our public lands and waters.   Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for this abuse, the polluters  over people act lowers royalty rates, repeals interest fees, reinstates  noncompetitive leasing, and forces Federal agencies to hold rock-bottom  lease sales all but assuring that last year's profit records will soon  be broken again.   Never to be outdone, the mining industry gets its fair share of gifts  in H.R. 1, as well. Mining companies, many of which are foreign-owned,  already enjoy a free-for-all on our public lands. They make a mockery  of Tribal consultation, destroy sacred and special places, ruin the  landscape, and leave behind a toxic mess that pollutes our water and  hurts our health--all without paying a cent to the American people--not  one red cent is paid in royalties.   Now included in this package is that they can use the public land for  anything they want, including dumping of toxic mineral waste.   There is more, but suffice it to say, with all these handouts, it  comes as no surprise that the Congressional Budget Office just reported  last week that H.R. 1 will actually increase the Federal deficit.   Staying true to its name, the polluters over people act also fast- tracks dirty energy projects by gutting our bedrock environmental and  public health laws; namely, the National Environmental Policy Act, or  NEPA.   This is not in a new so-called permitting reform solution they have  come up with to address our energy needs. This is the same ideological  attack I have seen Republicans in the Natural Resources Committee  launch on NEPA year after year after year.   For anyone who is being lured into thinking there are opportunities  for negotiations on this bill--do not be naive. This performative  permitting reform is not a bipartisan solution, not even a starting  point for one.   This is just another decades-old request from polluters to make their  operations cheaper and easier, while making Americans' lives harder and  more costly.   It is not a serious solution to any of our energy goals. Even former  President George W. Bush's head of permitting efforts has said that  this bill will be ``of no statistically significant consequence.''   In fact, the polluters over people act has none of the real  permitting solutions that can speed up the build-out of the clean  energy infrastructure that we all need.   One of those solutions would be increasing funding for Federal  permitting offices, which is exactly what Democrats did when they  secured more than $1 billion in last year's historic Inflation  Reduction Act. Even Republicans' own witness at a hearing called that  money ``wonderful.'' No more funding is in H.R. 1.   Another solution for speeding up clean energy development is  reforming the planning and cost allocation process for electrical  transmission lines that can carry renewable energy from different  sources across the country. But, no, you are not going to see that in  H.R. 1 either.   Of course, any real permitting reform solutions would make sure to  protect and empower the communities that have been disproportionately  hurt by dirty energy and other polluters for decades--and that are now  being hit the hardest by climate change as well.   As you can probably guess, H.R. 1 doesn't just fail to protect these  communities, it silences them further, laying them bare to even more  devastation, harm, and exploitation.   The polluters over people act isn't just an embarrassment of riches  for polluting industries, it is an embarrassment to our communities, to  our climate goals, and to this legislative body.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we heard the term NIMBY thrown around to  describe opposition to this bill. This NIMBY term, not in my backyard,  is used to describe local residents, oftentimes very wealthy residents,  who oppose development in their neighborhoods, but unfortunately  support development of it elsewhere.   This NIMBY term is being used by some to try to discredit opposition  to this bill. In reality, the groundswell of opposition of this bill  comes from places that look like places behind me, not Martha's  Vineyard--places like Cancer Alley along the Gulf Coast, and many other  environmental justice communities across the country that millions upon  millions of American call home.   Make no mistake, the greatest consequences from pollution giveaways  in  [[Page H1488]]  H.R. 1 will fall on places like the ones in this photograph that are  already overburdened by industries' pollution.   Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Mr. Chairman, let me remind my colleagues that this  bill provides more handouts to foreign mining companies with terrible  environmental and human rights records.   For example, Rio Tinto, a foreign-owned mining company, is preparing  for a new copper mine in Arizona at a sacred site, Oak Flat. In 2020,  the company knowingly and needlessly demolished a 46,000-year-old  sacred Australian aboriginal site, an irreplaceable cultural artifact,  to expand an iron mine.   This bill rolls out the welcome mat for even more mining by foreign- controlled companies with records of human rights violations, cultural  desecration, and pollution.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Levin), who is a valued member of our committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is too bad that my Republican colleagues continue to point to  Chinese and Russian practices to try to lower the bar for environmental  and community protections in our own country. The United States should  lead, and we shouldn't set our standards by China or Russia.   The American people want their protections, they want clean energy,  and they want the process that allows the American people to know and  to participate. This bill does none of that.   Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Casten).    Madam Chair, just a reminder. H.R. 1, the polluters  over people act, repeals the $4.5 billion home electrification rebate  program designed to lower energy bills for all American families.   Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Ocasio-Cortez.)    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Landsman).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   When we were in the majority, Democrats, we passed H.R. 1. What was  that about? It was not about elections. It was about our democracy. It  was about protecting that democracy. After January 6, that became  urgent.   Now, some might want to deny that--that was just a walk in the park,  people taking a stroll. We were here. We knew what was going on, and  the American people knew what was going on.   The issue of patriotism has been brought up. It is patriotic for us  to oppose polluters over people. It is patriotic because we care and  feel that the public health of the American people needs to be  protected, that we have to deal with climate and the crisis that we are  confronting.   To question the patriotism of those instincts is wrong, and we will  continue to represent the American people on their most urgent needs.  The future and their destinies shouldn't be turned over to Big Oil and  Big Gas and the mining industry, for them to determine that future.  They have to have a role, and our statutes and the protections that are  in our laws need to be part of that role.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Tlaib).    Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), my good friend.    Madam Chair, the Republicans claim that they will do  more to reduce emissions with this legislation than Democrats have  done. I remind everyone that this legislation, the House Republican  H.R. 1, has no emission reduction targets and the push is to increase  fossil fuel production, which is the highest source that contributes to  the climate crisis that we are facing now.   Madam Chair, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Dingell), a member of the Committee on Natural Resources.    Madam Chair, if you believe in climate change and the  climate crisis, vote ``no'' on this legislation. If you believe that  regardless of ideology, if you believe that climate change is real and  must be dealt with, vote ``no'' on this legislation because it does  nothing to deal with that real threat in front of us.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Crockett).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Mullin).  [[Page H1504]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lieu).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Chair, I thank my Democrat colleagues for their comments, both  from the Committee on Natural Resources members and other colleagues  that came forth to speak against the polluters over people act, H.R. 1.   Republican Members have produced an extreme piece of legislation. As  I listened to the rationale today, there were four or five things that  were repeated over and over again. It is an extreme piece and a high  cost to pay for a speakership, but nevertheless, the rationale today  was, as I heard it, patriotism. If you vote ``no'' for H.R. 1, you  don't believe in America and you are not a patriot; you support China,  Russia, Venezuela, OPEC, and communism. Unfortunately, that is a  desperate lie and unnecessary in this debate.   The other rationale I heard: Let the polluters drive energy policy,  production, and the safeguards that the American people need. That was  one of the rationales.   The other one that struck me is collateral damage. Tribes, poor  people, 40 million Americans, communities of color, once again, they  get thrown under the bus to satisfy the greed of polluters.   The issues of environmental justice are almost eliminated and  downplayed in this whole discussion. That is 40 million people. That is  collateral damage that cannot be tolerated and should not be.   You ignore climate change. You blame other nations and ask Americans  to accept a lower bar for themselves and give up the opportunity, as we  always have, to historically lead in this world of ours.   This act is about taxpayer subsidies to a powerful and rich polluter  industry that doesn't need the support. It dismantles fundamental  public health, clean air, clean water, NEPA, environmental protections,  and judicial review.   We need to remember that this act, H.R. 1, polluters over people,  deals with a very consequential issue, and that is the consequential  issue of life. H.R. 1 is dangerous to life. The real true act of  patriotism, I remind my colleagues, is our responsibility and our oath  to protect lives, to extend the future, to deal with fairness and the  public's right to know and the public to have a voice in their future.  H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, undoes all of that.   Do we want to go back to the good old days when the rivers were  burning, we were clear-cutting forests, when it was all right to admit  wrongdoing and not have any consequences?   Those are not the good old days that people want to go back to.   If we are going to deal with the climate challenge and the climate  action that is needed in this crisis, H.R. 1 needs to be defeated. It  is the right thing to do, it is the American thing to do, and it is the  patriotic thing to do.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 1 is dangerous and needs to be defeated. I urge a  ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
