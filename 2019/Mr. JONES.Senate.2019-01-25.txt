 Mr. President, today is a bittersweet day. I am assuming  we are going to vote along with this deal--as I am--to reopen this  government, to end the 35-day-old hostage crisis, and that truly is the  best way to describe it.   It is a bittersweet day. It is sweet because our dedicated and  committed Federal workers and contractors will be going back to work.  It is bitter because, as I think everyone in this body who has spoken  today has said, it should never have happened. I believe we have an  obligation to those folks to do a better job, to make it even sweeter.   Last week, Congress passed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act  of 2019, which would require that all impacted Federal employees  receive compensation for wages lost during the government shutdown--35  days' worth of government wages paid back.   While that is an important step, the shutdown has forced many of our  Federal workers to incur additional costs associated with loans, late  bill payments, and other effects of their missing paychecks--paychecks  they depended on for their daily living.   That is why today, along with Senators Baldwin, Cardin, Hirono, Van  Hollen, Kaine, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Warner, and Wyden, I have introduced  the Back Pay Fairness Act. If the Federal Government can charge you  interest for being late on your taxes, then we should be paying  interest to those employees from whom we have borrowed hard-earned  dollars over the last 35 days. That is only fair.   I am requesting in this bill that all interest be paid to the Federal  workers whose paychecks were withheld. The more than 5,500 Federal  workers in Alabama did not ask for this shutdown and should not be  punished for it. It is only fair that the government pay them back with  interest for putting them out of work indefinitely or forcing them to  work without pay.   Federal law often recognizes the importance of timely payments when  it benefits the Federal Government. When it is the government's money,  we demand that people pay on time. For example, if you don't pay your  taxes on time, you can count on a notice letter from the Internal  Revenue Service--at least when they are open--demanding that you pay  interest, interest for the lateness of your payments. It doesn't matter  when it is. If you go past a certain date, they tack on a penalty on  top of that--not just interest.   Well, when the Federal Government owes its Federal workers money, it  is only reasonable, responsible, and fair that interest accrues as  well. The interest rate in this legislation would be equivalent to the  rate that Federal Agencies must pay vendors when they are late. The  rate, known as the Treasury prompt payment rate, is currently 3.625  percent.   Again, it is only fair. As David Cox, the American Federation of  Government Employees' National President said:         Federal workers are experiencing serious financial hardship       from the shutdown. When it ends, employees will not only have       to pay more than a month's worth of overdue bills, they will       also have to pay late fees and penalties, overdraft fees and       interest charges.    The AFGE supports the Back Pay Fairness Act with interest. Again, it  is only the right thing to do.   This shutdown, which has lasted for 35 days, could have been avoided.  The deal we got today is going to reopen the government through  February 15, and it will go to a conference. We are going to do what  the Presiding Officer said to do the other day: Do what we do. I heard  his remarks a few minutes ago, and I absolutely agree with them.   This government functions best when this body does what the Founders  of the Constitution said we should do: Go to regular order; go to  conference.   As Senator Bennet said on the floor yesterday, our Founders  contemplated the fact that we are going to have disagreements. That is  why we have 100 people here. That is why there are 435. That is why  there are nine members of the Supreme Court. We are going to have  disagreements, but we don't have to shut down the government over those  disagreements, especially when they are political disagreements and not  truly substantive disagreements.   This shutdown has had many costs, some that we will never be able to  quantify. Some of the losses from the President's misguided shutdown we  just can't put a cost on, and it is unfortunate that a while back, back  in December, the President of the United States said that he wanted to  shut down this government; he would own this shutdown.   It is unfortunate that we had 35 days for which he really didn't take  that responsibility, and he still didn't do it today. But the fact is,  he could have avoided it.   We have more than a million contractors. Senator Warner and others  were talking about the contractors that have millions of dollars--tens  of millions of dollars--of contracts with the Federal Government, many  of those in my State of Alabama.   I was in Huntsville, AL, today for the groundbreaking of a Blue  Origin plant that is going to build the engines for some of the new,  manned spacecraft that the United States will send into orbit. At a  time when we were shutting down the U.S. Government, China was putting  a spacecraft on the dark side of the Moon. We should be so embarrassed  about that. NASA is such an important part of Alabama and our history  in this country for what we can accomplish and for what we can do that  is good--the leaders in the country--and while we were shut down and  those poor NASA employees laid off and the contractors dealing with  NASA, China--China--was jumping ahead.   Well, I was so proud today when we started and we broke ground,  because we are going to reclaim that right. We are going to get this  government open, and we are going to reclaim America's role in space  and technology and the human imagination that will take us beyond our  borders here, beyond where we are.   I visited a number of folks in Huntsville this past weekend and heard  firsthand their stories of families, and it was heartbreaking. Members  of our Coast Guard missed paychecks. For the first time in our Nation's  history,  [[Page S678]]  members of our Armed Forces were not paid due to a government shutdown.  The Coast Guard has boats next to the Navy in places all around the  world. The Coast Guard defends this country just like the Army, the  Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Merchant Marines; yet they didn't  get paid. They also do other work. They do wonderful work in disaster  relief. They do wonderful work around the country in rescue operations.   Members of the Coast Guard missed their paychecks, and I talked to  members of the Coast Guard to hear their stories about how their men  and women were suffering. We should be ashamed of that.   It is not just the Coast Guard. Yesterday I took five dozen doughnuts  to the TSA workers at the airport in Birmingham. You would have thought  it was Christmas, they were so happy. In airports yesterday and today,  those TSA agents say: Thank you for doing what you can do. We are here.  We are working. That is why they deserve not only their paychecks, but  they deserve it with interest.    The S&P estimated the economic cost of this shutdown was $7.1  billion. We have been arguing over 5.7, and it has already cost this  country 7.1. Bloomberg said businesses with contractors tied to the  Federal Government would lose a cumulative $200 million a day. The  chamber of commerce says small government contractors have lost more  than $2.3 billion in revenue so far. The administration has admitted  economic growth this quarter will likely be zero because of the  shutdown.   Payments to farmers hurt by the President's tariffs were delayed  because the Department of Agriculture was closed. Now think about that.  Farmers in Alabama and elsewhere got a double whammy. They got hurt  because of the tariffs and the fact that China started retaliating and  dried up their markets, and soybean farmers couldn't send their crops  anywhere. So the President, in something I supported, even though it  was a bandaid, decided they would give these farmers $12 billion in  relief. Farmers don't like bailouts. These are hard-working,  conservative folks who don't like bailouts. They don't want handouts;  they wanted their markets back. Then, with this shutdown, half of that  money couldn't be disbursed. At a time when those farmers were trying  to get their loans in order and were trying to get ready for spring  planting, they couldn't get any money from the Department of  Agriculture. That is shameful. That is shameful.   The tariff exclusion request for businesses has not been processed,  all the while our Commerce Secretary was saying he just couldn't  understand why people had to go to food banks. He should be ashamed. We  should all be ashamed that a representative of the U.S. Government  would say such a thing, when it was the administration that caused the  shutdown.   When the economy slows and there is less money to spend in our  communities, hiring slows or stops and wages can decline, leaving our  communities even more vulnerable. That is something that hasn't been  talked about enough here; that is, in the last 35 days, the security of  the United States, not just on the southern border but the entire  United States has been at risk because of this government shutdown-- cyber security threats from Russia, China, North Korea, you name it.  While we may have a crisis on the border--and there are many who might  dispute that it is a crisis on our southern border as opposed to chaos.  Everyone understands there is chaos. Everyone understands our border is  not as secure as it should be. There are things we can do to secure  that border, and they should be done to secure that border.   Everybody--there is no one in this body who says they are for open  borders. Last year, when the President nominated an individual who used  to work with Customs and Border Patrol to be head of ICE, I asked him,  in his entire career, has he ever heard of anyone who was in the public  sector who was for open borders. He said: No, sir. It was an important  question because we hear so much, and we see so many allegations coming  from the other side that we are all for open borders. That is not true.  We want to make sure we have secure borders.   Let me tell you something, folks. I also want to have a heart. I want  to make sure the United States is the moral leader of the world. There  are people coming across, and they are fleeing violence, destruction,  and their families are being put in danger in their home countries. We  at least can try to figure out a way to help them; that we don't gas  children on the border; that we don't separate families and put little  children in jail; and that we don't charge people $11 for a tube of  toothpaste in what amounts to a private prison; that we at least can  recognize that we have an element of humanity about us; that when  people flee and seek refuge in the United States of America, they do so  for a reason. It is because we don't have to make this America great  again. We are great. That is why they are coming here, to get away. We  have to make sure we understand and recognize that.   What I want to see is that good-faith effort. What I have said from  the very beginning is, that good faith the President talked about  today, I want to make sure--I wanted to open this government in  December. We are doing today essentially what this body did on December  19--35 days ago, 37 days ago.   We voted unanimously to keep this government open and let people talk  about the border security; let folks talk about whether we have a  threat of a national security emergency. That is what we do, as Senator  Alexander said on the floor earlier. I agree with him, and I agree with  Senator Murkowski and Senator Warner and all those who spoke before me  whom I heard.   Senator Alexander said that two things went wrong in December; one,  we should never have a shutdown as an option. Our Federal workers  should never be held hostage. Yes, people have said this is a hostage  crisis because that is what it was. Those poor workers have been held  hostage, and now we have a threat again. If we don't do something in 3  weeks, they will do it again. The sad thing is, unlike a hostage crisis  that you might see on television on the news or on television in TV  shows, it is the same hostages every time. Every time this government  shuts down, it is the same hostages who are taken, and we cannot let  that happen.    Senator Alexander said the other thing that we didn't do is we didn't  do what we were supposed to do. We didn't have that regular order. We  saw all of the political fights play out on TV between this side or the  other side, and we didn't get back to what this body does best, why I  came to this body, why I am so proud to be a part of this body, why I  am so proud to be here with Senator Patrick Leahy, who was in the U.S.  Senate when I was just a staffer for Senator Heflin. We need to be  doing those things for the American people and for the people in my  State. That is what we need to be doing.   As I listened to the President today, I appreciated the fact that he  is signing this bill that I think will pass both Houses. I feel  confident it will. As I listened to him today, I am thinking to myself:  Mr. President, you talk about good faith, and you want people to have  good-faith dialogue. They will in this body, but good faith is a two- way street--a two-way street. It is not just one side or the other, but  it is a two-way street. I worry sometimes that the President of the  United States doesn't always do that.   We saw last year, when we had a bill for $25 billion that he decided  he didn't like, after he initially said it was one of the areas he  wanted to do. We saw it in December, when this body came to the floor  and passed unanimously a measure to keep the government open, that I  know would not have come to this floor by Senator McConnell had the  President not indicated he would sign it and changed in 24 hours. So  good faith, Mr. President, is a two-way street.   I am willing to do that. I have always said that. I heard a lot of  people on both sides of this aisle who are ready, willing, and able to  try to do the things we need to do to secure our borders, but we have  to have good faith coming out of the administration as well.   We have to make sure the administration takes care of those families  who are trying to get away; that we will look to maybe try to provide  some help to those countries so they can stem the tide of that violence  and try to do some things to move these asylum seekers along and not  just build  [[Page S679]]  walls to stop them. Let's be humanitarians as well as security agents.  We can do that. That is not inconsistent with the American way. That is  not inconsistent at all.   I appreciate the time on the floor today. I urge all my colleagues to  vote for this compromise to open this government back up. Importantly,  I urge my colleagues and in the House--let's not give these Federal  workers just their backpay, as we passed before, let's do what is  right. If we mean what we say about how we appreciate our Federal  workers, if we mean what we say when we call and say how patriotic they  are, let's do to them what the government would do otherwise. Let's  give them the interest on these 35 days of backpay. Then we will truly  fulfill our obligations as best we can.   Importantly, let's not let this happen again. For God's sake, do our  duty. Let's not let this happen again in 3 weeks and go through this  process once more. Let's get to work. Let's knuckle down. Let's secure  the borders, but let's also let this crisis within our borders that has  been created over the last 35 days end forever. Let that crisis go away  and never come back.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
