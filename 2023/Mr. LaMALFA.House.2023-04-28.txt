 Mr. Speaker, today, over 187 million Americans use  natural gas, as well as another approximately 50 million who use  propane, because it is affordable and available right here in North  America. Over half the country uses this product.   Over 45 million stoves and ovens, 61 million water heaters, and 73  million space heaters use natural gas across the country, which  provides consistent, reliable energy for heating and cooking, et  cetera.   Our Nation is the largest consumer of natural gas and one of the  largest producers of natural gas due to the miracle of hydraulic  fracturing. It has become an integral and reliable part of our energy  arsenal over the decades.   Yet, States like California--and now the Biden administration--can't  seem to admit the unreliable alternatives that they are trying to force  upon all of us are not the be-all and end-all. They can't seem to admit  that these technologies have not advanced to the point where they can  rely on solar or wind, a tiny part of our grid, for all of our needs.    Democrats are content to source foreign energy to fill in the gaps  where their green energy falls way short. Republicans and other  commonsense Americans know we need an all-of-the-above energy approach  to fill our energy needs.  [[Page H2106]]    Natural gas, oil, hydropower, geothermal, nuclear, and biomass are  all important parts of the grid, not just windmills, not just solar  panels. We need all of the above.                            ____________________
