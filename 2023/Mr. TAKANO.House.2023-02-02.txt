 Mr. Speaker, this resolution is not about socialism. It  is about political cynicism.   No one in this Chamber would defend the atrocities committed by  murderous Communist ideologues such as Mao Zedong or Fidel Castro, but  that is not what this resolution is about. This resolution is about  conflating some of our most cherished social safety net programs with  so-called socialism.   With this resolution, Republicans demonize Social Security, on which  more than 46 million retirees rely today. Republicans demonize  Medicare, which has saved the lives of countless Americans. Republicans  demonize many other Federal programs, including benefits offered to our  Nation's veterans.   Harry Truman was right when he said that: ``Socialism is a scare word  that [Republicans] have hurled at every advance the people have made in  the last 20 years.''   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.                                time  1015
