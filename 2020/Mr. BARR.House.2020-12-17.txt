 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express concern with a trend  that could harm our financial system, crush jobs, and have lasting  negative impacts on American competitiveness and economic  exceptionalism.   Many on the other side of the aisle are calling for financial  regulators to inject climate risk scenarios into bank supervision, and  a new administration will likely prioritize weaponizing financial  regulation to achieve unrelated climate goals.   Radical climate activists are incapable of passing the Green New Deal  through Congress because most Americans understand it will destroy  jobs, increase energy costs, and destabilize our economy at a time of  immense fragility and volatility, so they will undoubtedly turn to  financial regulation and supervision as a backdoor to implement their  climate agenda.   Earlier this year, a group of Democrat Senators put these ideas to  paper in a partisan report, calling on all Federal financial regulators  to infuse ill-defined climate scenarios into their supervision of banks  and to discourage financial firms from lending to industries that  ``amplify climate risk,'' such as coal or oil and natural gas. Lost on  [[Page H7241]]  these Senators is the impact that this would have on American jobs and  cost of living amid a pandemic or the fact that financial supervision  should rely on risk-based metrics rather than pie-in-the-sky  sustainability goals.   This week, the Federal Reserve announced that it joined the Network  for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of central banks intent  on weaving climate risk into bank supervision. To those of us closely  tracking this issue, the decision by the Fed raises many red flags.   I take no issue with the Fed participating in multilateral  deliberative bodies. My concern comes from some of the ideas being  discussed by other members of the NGFS and whether the Fed plans to  import them.   The NGFS has made a series of recommendations that are particularly  troubling. First, it suggests supervisors elevate their regulated  entities based on sustainability metrics in their portfolios.  Unfortunately, there is no clear definition of what ``sustainability''  means, but you can bet that the climate activists will push it all the  way to the brink.   We do not need European regulators to tell our banks how sustainable  their portfolios should be. Portfolio strength should be measured  objectively, based on credit risk, not on poorly defined sustainability  goals.   Second, the NGFS urges regulators to integrate climate risks into  financial stability monitoring. Unfortunately, climate stress scenarios  are plagued with methodological challenges. Material impacts from  changing weather patterns occur over the course of decades; whereas,  current stress tests look at a period of nine quarters. It would be  difficult for a bank to accurately forecast stresses over that length  of time, and regulators can't account for a bank's dynamic operational  and risk management practices over that period.   Further, there is a lack of historical data on the relationship  between changing weather patterns and financial stress, and the  available data may have gaps or a disqualifying level of subjectivity.                                time  1330    Last week, I led a group of 47 House Republicans in a letter to  Federal Reserve Chairman Powell and Vice Chair Quarles requesting that  they proceed cautiously in their deliberations on whether to  incorporate climate change scenarios into financial stress tests. The  letter highlights many of the methodological challenges I just raised  and encourages them to consider the negative impact this would have on  U.S. industry and American jobs.   As we mentioned in our letter, it is important that the Fed commit to  not accepting any international climate standards that are not  appropriately tailored to the U.S. financial system or that would  adversely impact U.S. competitiveness. We expect U.S. regulators to  make similar commitments when adopting other international standards,  such as the Basel Accords and insurance standards from the  International Association of Insurance Supervisors. This should be no  different.   Mr. Speaker, this effort to pressure financial regulators to inject  climate scenarios into bank stress tests is not about predicting  financial stress. It is about causing financial stress, causing  financial stress for an entire segment of the U.S. economy: the energy  sector.   Far from promoting financial stability, this dangerous movement,  right at a time of a global pandemic, to politicize access to capital  would undermine economic stability by denying American families and  businesses access to affordable and reliable energy.   Mr. Speaker, I call on the Federal Reserve to keep this in mind, to  keep in mind the millions of jobs that are on the line, as Congress  exercises oversight over the Federal Reserve's mandate to maximize  employment.                            ____________________
