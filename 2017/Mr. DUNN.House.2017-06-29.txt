 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3003, the No  Sanctuary for Criminals Act.   Congress has a responsibility to protect the rule of law in our  country and to provide for the safety of our citizens. The American  people overwhelmingly oppose sanctuary cities and believe that we  should be doing more to enforce our Federal immigration laws.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act clarifies the authority of the  Department of Homeland Security to order the detainment of illegal  immigrants arrested for crimes until they can be processed for  deportation.   It also cuts off certain Federal grants to cities and States that  violate Federal immigration law. It is simple: If you don't comply with  the Federal immigration law, you are not eligible for certain Federal  grants.   It is time for us to enforce our immigration laws.   National attention was brought to the consequences of the sanctuary  city policies by the death of Kate Steinle, who was killed by an  illegal immigrant who had previously been convicted of seven felonies  and deported five times. If the city of San Francisco had worked with  the Federal Government to enforce the Federal immigration law instead  of releasing this criminal, Kate Steinle would be alive today.   Our current system of laws failed Kate and all those who have died at  the hands of convicted felons in this country illegally. The people who  I am honored to represent do not understand why some American cities  get to flout the law and not cooperate with Federal officials. This  legislation makes it clear that they don't, that sanctuary cities are  illegal. By holding these jurisdictions accountable and stopping  sanctuary cities, we will make Americans of every background safer on  our streets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
