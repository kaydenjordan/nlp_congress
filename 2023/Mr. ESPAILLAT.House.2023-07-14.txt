 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the birthday of  Jackie Rowe Adams.   This week, our communities, northern Manhattan and Harlem, celebrate  Jackie, who is a powerhouse in northern Manhattan and Harlem.   Jackie is not only a union leader but Jackie is also a community  advocate. After tragically losing two of her sons to gun violence,  Jackie cofounded Harlem Mothers S.A.V.E., an organization dedicated to  ending gun violence in our community, for which Jackie has worked  tirelessly. She continues to be a force of change for our community,  particularly advocating for young people.   Let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker, her voice is the window to  her soul. She has a tremendous soprano voice, and everybody enjoys her  singing in the community.   We wish Jackie a happy birthday, and we look forward to hearing her  singing in the community.                            ____________________
