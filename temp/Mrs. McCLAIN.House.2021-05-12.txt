 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to be the voice for  business owners in my district, who, again, have been kicked while they  are down.   This majority and President Biden insist people need more  unemployment benefits. They don't. There is a record number of open  jobs, more than 8 million, of which only 266,000 of those jobs have  been filled. That means that this administration is incentivizing  people not to work.   For President Biden to suggest that we need to spend another $4  trillion on the backs of our children and grandchildren to get back to  work is insane.   The jobs are there. The incentives to take the jobs are not.   This nationwide problem is impacting Michiganders. In fact, the  biggest issue that I hear from business owners in my district is not  about COVID or mask mandates or vaccines. They need workers.   I am calling on the Speaker to actually go out into her district and  learn what businesses actually need. They don't need more money. They  don't need more stimulus. They need more employees.                            ____________________
