 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, The Washington  Times correctly reported on the front page about the NATO conference  that ``President Trump's bare-knuckles diplomacy paid off.''   ``Mr. Trump declared that the U.S. remained committed to the military  alliance.''   The Brussels Declaration of July 11 itself confirmed: ``We will share  fairly the responsibilities of defending each other. Real progress has  been made across NATO. . . . But even if we have turned a corner, we  need to do more, and there will be further progress.''   Today, I am grateful to welcome a delegation from Bulgaria as a  valued NATO ally. Chairperson of the Foreign Policy Committee, Dzhema  Grozdanova of the National Assembly, who also is chair of the  Friendship group Bulgaria-USA, is leading a delegation of assembly  members to Washington, coordinated by Ambassador Tihomir Stoytchev. It  is inspiring to see young Bulgarians and Americans training together at  the base at Novo Selo to establish peace through strength.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
