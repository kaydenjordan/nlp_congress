 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1404) to strengthen the United States response to Russian  interference by providing transparency on the corruption of Russian  President Vladimir Putin, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1404         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Vladimir Putin Transparency       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According an Intelligence Community Assessment dated       January 6, 2017, ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered       an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the US democratic process . . . Moscow's influence campaign       followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert       intelligence operations--such as cyber activity--with overt       efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media,       third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or       `trolls.' ''.        (2) According to the Washington Post, official, public       reports from the Russian government put Putin's average       annual income between 2011 and 2016 at approximately       $112,000. But outside experts nevertheless have alleged that       Putin's true net worth is in the billions--suggesting his       extensive corruption and connection to money laundering and       other activities undertaken order to enrich Putin unjustly       and to hide his true financial condition from the public.       SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT EXPOSING THE CORRUPTION OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the United States should do more to expose the corruption of       Vladimir Putin, whose ill-gotten wealth is perhaps the most       powerful global symbol of his dishonesty and his persistent       efforts to undermine the rule of law and democracy in the       Russian Federation.        (b) Assessment.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Director of National       Intelligence, in coordination with the Secretary of Treasury       and the Secretary of State, shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees an assessment, based on all sources       of intelligence, on the net worth and financial and other       assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his family       members, legitimate as well as illegitimate, including--        (1) the estimated net worth of Vladimir Putin and his       family members;        (2) a description of their legitimately and illegitimately       obtained assets, including all real, personal and       intellectual property,  [[Page H2663]]       bank or investment or similar accounts, and any other       financial or business interests or holdings, including those       outside of Russia;        (3) the details of the legitimately and illegitimately       obtained assets, including real, personal and intellectual       property, bank or investment or similar accounts, and any       other financial or business interests or holdings, including       those outside of Russia, that are owned or controlled by,       accessible to, or otherwise maintained for the benefit of       Vladimir Putin, including their nature, location, manner of       acquisition, value, and publicly named owner (if other than       Vladimir Putin);        (4) the methods used by Vladimir Putin or others acting at       his direction, with his knowledge, or for his benefit, to       conceal Putin's interest in his accounts, holdings, or other       assets, including the establishment of ``front'' or shell       companies and the use of intermediaries; and        (5) an identification of the most significant senior       Russian political figures, oligarchs, and any other persons       who have engaged in activity intended to conceal the true       financial condition of Vladimir Putin.        (c) Form.--The assessment required under subsection (b)       shall be submitted either--        (1) in unclassified form to the extent consistent with the       protection of intelligence sources and methods, and may       include a classified annex; or        (2) simultaneously as both an unclassified version and a       classified version.        (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on       Foreign Relations, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and       Urban Affairs, and the Committee on Finance of the Senate;       and        (2) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,       Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Financial       Services, and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of       Representatives.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, every American has the right to a secure democracy  where their voice matters. As Members of Congress, our national  security must be a top priority. We must investigate and expose  Russia's financial networks and cut off any illegal funding that  supports criminal attacks against the United States of America. This  bipartisan legislation is a crucial first step to ensure that the  rights of the American people matter more than dark and corrupt Russian  money.   It has been said that money talks, but it is our job to keep it from  speaking over the American people. Last week the House of  Representatives passed H.R. 1, historic reforms to get big money out of  politics. But we haven't done nearly enough to prevent foreign powers  and foreign money from attacking our democracy.   Russia, the country that once had the ability to provide a decent  life for its people, has chosen to strip their wealth as they watch  their wealth disappear overseas into hidden accounts. These corrupt  oligarchs are a cautionary tale on how working people can be cheated if  left unchecked. These corrupt bands of individuals, led by Vladimir  Putin, have mounted a massive asymmetric attack against the United  States.   America has the greatest military in the world, but the Russians have  figured out that if they have any chance at victory, they must fight us  another way: undermine our elections, spread fear and unrest, and sow  discord through racism and other divisive tactics.   What they don't understand, Madam Speaker, is that we take pride in  our democracy. We may have policy differences, and we might have policy  disagreements, sometimes quite strongly, but we all know that our  democratic form of government, a government of the people, by the  people, and for the people is our greatest strength and weapon against  any foe. We do believe in this country that every voice matters.   Foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. elections, but  multiple Kremlin-connected Americans have funneled millions of dollars  into political action, wielding massive influence in our democracy, and  Vladimir Putin is the king of this corrupt money.   Putin's protests are generally delivered with a smirk and accusations  of fake news, but his discomfort with revealing his assets is clearly  simmering below the surface. It is telling that after Ms. Stefanik and  I introduced this legislation, we were both attacked by Russian state  media.   What is Putin afraid of?   Perhaps the former KGB operative is well-aware of the poor long-term  prospects for gangsters and autocrats who are unmasked before their  impoverished countrymen, or he fears uncovering his shadowy networks  that prop up dictators and human rights abusers around the world in his  quest to subvert world order. Likely, he and his cronies are desperate  to obscure their billions in an attempt to shield themselves from  sanctions.   But, Madam Speaker, no matter the root of his fear, our obligation is  to shine a light on his illicit networks. It is time that we hold him  accountable. This legislation will expose the corrupt finances being  used to fund attacks against our democracy.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I call upon the words of our 35th  President: ``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill,  that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,  support any friend, oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and  the success of liberty.''   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2019.      Hon. Adam Schiff,      Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1404, the       ``Vladimir Putin Transparency Act.'' As a result of your       having consulted with the Committee on Financial Services       concerning provisions in the bill that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction, I agree to forgo action on the bill so that it       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. The Committee       on Financial Services takes this action with our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1404       at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this or similar legislation moves forward. Our       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and request       your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 1404 and       would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this       matter be included in the Congressional Record.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2019.      Hon. Adam Schiff,      Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on Foreign Affairs has now had an opportunity to review H.R.       1404, the ``Vladimir Putin Transparency Act,'' which falls       within our shared Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate that you       have consulted with us on this legislation. The Foreign       Affairs Committee has no objection to considering this bill       on the House floor. To expedite that consideration, the       Foreign Affairs Committee is willing to waive referral, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the legislation or its subject       matter.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Foreign Affairs Committee       reserves the right to request an appropriate number of       conferees to address any concerns with this bill or related       provisions that may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperation spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                 Eliot L. Engel,                                                           Chairman,                                House Committee on Foreign Affairs.  [[Page H2664]]                                          ____          Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House of             Representatives,                                                     March 8, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Engel: I write in reply       to your letters regarding H.R. 1404, the Vladimir Putin       Transparency Act. I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committees on Financial Services and       Foreign Affairs; and that your Committees will not take up       H.R. 1404 formally. I further agree that your Committees'       inaction regarding the bill will not waive any future       jurisdictional claims over matters addressed in H.R. 1404       which fall within your Committees' jurisdiction under Rule X       of the Rules of Procedure for the House of Representatives       for the 116th Congress.        At your request, I lastly will ensure that our exchange of       letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with both of you as the measure moves       through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Adam B. Schiff,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 1404 will shine a light  on Vladimir Putin's financial networks that have stripped the Russian  Federation of its resources and left the Russian people in poverty. It  will also empower Congress, the intelligence community, and our allies  to crack down on cross-border corruption.   I want to thank my colleague on the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence, Representative Stefanik, for joining me in this important  legislation.   Additionally, I want to thank the hardworking staff on both sides of  the aisle on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the  Foreign Affairs Committee for their input on this critical legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
