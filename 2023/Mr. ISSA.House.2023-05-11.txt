 Mr. Speaker, when I received my current district in  redistricting, I was pleased that it was a border district, all along  the Mexican border from the Tijuana area all the way through the rest  of the county.   It isn't a border area today. There is no border. If there is no  border with Mexico, then there is no border with America.   Every day, people pass through. Some are found. Some are not found.  Some are stopped for a period of time, but few are turned away. They  are not turned away because we simply have a policy of letting everyone  in.   I also represent a major agricultural district with ranching and  farming, and guess what? With all those millions of people who this  administration has deliberately allowed to come in without having been  invited, without prescreening, without an application, we still have a  shortage because of the policies of simply catch and release with  parole.   I will tell you what else my district is dealing with. We are dealing  with enough fentanyl seized last year--117,000 pounds. If divided  equally, it would kill every person in America in one dose.   Just last week, the California Highway Patrol seized $21 million  worth of fentanyl well into the United States on its way to L.A. That  would be enough fentanyl to kill every San Diegan. That is what we are  dealing with because we have no border.   My Democrat friends, Mr. Speaker, will tell you about how it is not  good, that it is not good enough, that we need to have comprehensive  reform.   Like you, Mr. Speaker, I have pushed for comprehensive reform, but  comprehensive reform is not simply to normalize what is going on.  Comprehensive reform has to be a balance of enforcement and fair  immigration rules.
