 Mr. Chairman, my, my, my. If you want to  talk about protecting speech from government interference, let's talk  about my home State of Florida because nowhere in this country is free  speech more endangered than in the Sunshine State.   Florida: Where Republicans are erasing Black history and gender  studies from our schools; where Republicans are threatening teachers  and librarians with jail time--jail time--if they put books on their  shelves that celebrate the likes of Rosa Parks or Roberto Clemente;  Florida, where Republicans have made it illegal--illegal--for  businesses to promote a culture of diversity, inclusion or respect;  Florida, where progressive thinkers are being fired from colleges, and  rightwing donors are being appointed to their boards.   It is Florida where Republicans actually punished Disney World  because Disney World opposed the State's homophobic legislation. It is  the great State of Florida where free speech is only free if you agree  with our governor.   If you want to talk about protecting free speech from government  interference, let's talk about Florida.
