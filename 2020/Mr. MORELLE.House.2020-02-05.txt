 Madam Speaker, it pains me to stand before you today and  recognize Gun Violence Survivors Week. As a Nation, we grieve for all  the lives lost senselessly and all those who must live in the wake of  these acts of horror.   This week alone, we have seen another school devastated by gun  violence, another community uncertain how to move forward.   Our country is faced with a growing epidemic, and it is our  responsibility as lawmakers to take action to protect our communities.  [[Page H775]]    That is why I am proud to have joined Senator Elizabeth Warren,  Congressman Hank Johnson, and a group of colleagues to introduce the  Gun Violence Prevention and Community Safety Act.   This bold reform includes my bill to strengthen gun shop regulations  and prevent the theft of legal firearms. Over 30 percent of guns used  in a crime are identified as stolen, and every one we keep out of the  hands of the wrong people is a step closer to a safer reality for our  Nation. The time to act is now.                            ____________________
