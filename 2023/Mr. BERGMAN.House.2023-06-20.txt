 Mr. Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for getting  involved in this relevant and timely bill.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3672 to name the Department of  Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Indian River,  Michigan, as the ``Pfc. Justin T. Paton Department of Veterans Affairs  Clinic.''   It is an honor for me to lead this legislation to rename the VA care  facility in the hometown and the final resting place of a young man who  embodied the ethic of service above self as he gave his last full  measure of devotion for our Nation.   Justin Paton was born and raised in northern Michigan and graduated  from Inland Lakes High School in the year 2000. Feeling called to  serve, he enlisted in the Army in 2005 and was deployed to Iraq on  October 31, 2006. There, he was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division,  Delta Company and was named one of the unit leaders.   In February 2007, at the age of 24, he was killed in action in Iraq  when his patrol came under intense sniper fire north of Baghdad.   Private First Class Paton was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart  and Bronze Star for his sacrifice and heroism.   He is interred in the Ohioville Cemetery, just down the road from the  Indian River VA clinic opening later this year that I am confident will  bear his name.   Naming the Indian River CBOC is one small way to honor Justin and his  family's sacrifice. His legacy is beyond deserving of the designation  that we are seeking today.   I sincerely thank Pfc. Paton's family for all of their support. I  thank the local leaders in Indian River and Tuscarora Township, who  have been key in our efforts; the Michigan veterans service  organizations for backing this bill; and the entirety of my Michigan  delegation colleagues, who have come together in a bipartisan manner to  cosponsor this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3672.
