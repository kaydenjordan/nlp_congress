Within 30 days of the receipt of the notice,       the Secretary shall review and approve the proposed certain       undertakings if consistent with the Programmatic Agreement.        (c) Definition of Certain Undertakings.--As used in this       section, the term ``certain undertakings'' means those       activities that take place on, within, or under a historical       crossing and--        (1) will last less than 1 month and will have limited       physical impact on the surface of the historical crossing;        (2) have been implemented by an adjacent landowner or other       adjacent landowners in the past; or        (3) is the subject of a categorical exclusion under the       National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et       seq.).

Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   May 10, 1869, is one of the most significant dates that we have in  American history because that is the date when a congressionally  mandated provision to try to unite the two oceans on this continent  Nation together actually came into being.   The final spike that was put into this effort that was originated by  Congress and, actually, oddly enough, Congress had to get them to stop  going at different directions and come together at one point, took  place in Promontory Summit in my State of Utah, in my district, about  30 miles from where I live.   This is a prominent symbol of the most significant achievement we had  in the 19th century. It is, for transportation, as significant as  landing a man on the moon would be for the 20th century.   Having the rail system go in there meant that some of my ancestors  who had to walk every step across the plains, taking months to get to  Utah, could now do it in 7 days on the new train that was going through  there.   This is one of those things that has the support of the National Park  Service, which wants to make sure that some of the less visual parks  are given the quality attention they deserve, to make them something  that is important for the future history of this country.   So it is not just going to be a park. This is going to be a historic  park, and it is going to be part of a transcontinental railroad network  that will take all sorts of other activities that deal with  transportation within the area, allow them to make them more public,  and allow people to spend several days visiting different areas.   It is also important since, ironically, within a few miles of this  location is also the site where most of the motors that were made for  outer space travel were also built at the same time.   This can also become a hub of truly educational value about  transportation in both the 19th century as well as the 20th century. It  can also be an opportunity to tell the story of the literally thousands  of immigrants who helped build the system going both ways in both  directions. And it establishes a process so that challenges that have  been longstanding with neighboring landowners can be resolved in an  easy and simple way not only now but also going into the future.                                time  1600    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill which will  make the Golden Spike a national historical park in time for the 150th  birthday which will be May 10, 2019.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I invite all of you out next May 10  to a celebration at this site. It will be a party you will not forget.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues' adoption, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 805) to authorize the conveyance of and remove the  reversionary interest of the United States in certain lands in the City  of Tulare, California.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 805         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tulare Youth Recreation and       Women's History Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The City of Tulare requires clear title to two Parcels       of land within the City's business corridor.        (2) The Parcels are part of a right-of-way granted to the       Railroad by the Federal Government by the Act dated July 27,       1866.        (3) The Parcels, which are currently under lease to the       City, are currently occupied by an outdoor recreation       facility for youth and a historic women's club.        (4) The City desires to improve and restore these       facilities but cannot absent clear title to the Parcels.        (5) The United States retained a reversionary interest in       the Parcels conveyed to the Railroad in 1866 and has not       exercised this authority.        (6) The Union Pacific Railroad desires to sell the Parcels       to the City.        (7) Public Law 105-195 conveyed the reversionary interest       to all surrounding Parcels in 1998, which were conveyed by       the Union Pacific Railroad to the City.       SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF CONVEYANCE AND REMOVAL OF                     REVERSIONARY INTEREST.         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) City.--The term ``City'' means the City of Tulare,       California.        (2) Map.--The term ``Map'' means the map entitled ``Tulare       Railroad Parcels Proposed to be Acquired'', dated April 30,       2015.        (3) Parcels.--The term ``Parcels'' means the land       identified as ``Tulare Railroad Proposed Parcels'' on the       Map.        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (5) Railroad.--The term ``Railroad'' means the Union       Pacific Railroad.        (b) Reversionary Interest Extinguished.--        (1) In general.--To promote recreational opportunities for       youth and commemorate women's history in the City, the United       States authorizes the conveyance of and relinquishes its       reversionary interest in the Parcels retained under the Act       of July 27, 1866 (14 Stat. 292, chapter 278).        (2) Required documentation.--The relinquishment of the       reversionary interest under paragraph (1) shall be executed       by the Secretary in an instrument that--        (A) is suitable for recording in the records of Tulare       County, California; and        (B) references this Act and any prior instruments relating       to the United States interest in the Parcels.        (3) Costs.--Any costs associated with the required       documentation under paragraph (2) shall be paid by the City.        (4) Condition.--The relinquishment of the reversionary       interest under paragraph (1) shall be effective on the date       that the Railroad conveys the Parcels to the City.        (c) Map on File.--The Map shall be kept on file and       available for public inspection in the appropriate offices of       the Bureau of Land Management.        (d) Preservation of Existing Rights of Access.--Nothing in       this Act shall impair any existing rights of access in favor       of the public or any owner of adjacent lands over, under or       across the Parcels.        (e) Surface Entry.--The Parcels shall be subject to the       same conditions as those parcels affected by Public Law 105-      195 regarding rights of surface entry.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is not a significant bill. We are talking about a couple of  acres of property that used to be owned by the Federal Government that  had no purpose and use for it. So they gave it up. But instead,  Congress decided to include a reversionary clause with this stuff so  that if they ever wanted to do something different with these 2 acres  of property, they would have to come crawling back to us to ask for our  permission to do it, which is silly.   It is ridiculous that we have to go through this process time, after  time, after time. The Federal Government didn't need this land  originally. They still don't need it, but they still have that  particular clause attached to it.   This land needs to be given over to the city who uses it so they can  make improvements on facilities that have been used since the 1800s.  And that we  [[Page H5594]]  have to go through an actual law to do this, is a silly practice that  we maintain here in Congress. It should not be done. This is a perfect  example of why the reversionary clause is no longer needed.   If you really care about people, put a clause in there that says that  if they want to change the practice, it has to be for the public  interest and the public good. That would be logical. But what we have  to do now is illogical in doing this particular bill. It needs to be  done. It has to be done for the people who live there and for these  properties, but it is silly that we have to go through this process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 857) to provide for conservation and enhanced recreation  activities in the California Desert Conservation Area, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 857         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``California       Off-Road Recreation and Conservation Act''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cook), whose bill we are  discussing, and who actually came up with the process of involving his  community to do this kind of transfer the right way.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record background material for this  particular bill.   Background and Need for H.R. 857, the California Off-Road Recreation                            and Conservation Act         President Clinton signed into law the California Desert       Protection Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-433), which       established the Mojave National Preserve, the Death Valley       National Park and Joshua Tree National Park. It also created       over 7 million acres of wilderness in the California desert,       which stretches across millions of acres of the southeastern       corner of the State. Since then, there have been numerous       legislative efforts to apply additional federal land       protections in this area, including the designation of       additional wilderness, national monuments, and expansion of       existing National Parks. In the 114th Congress, Senator       Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced S. 414, the California       Desert Conservation and Recreation Act of 2015, a bill that       amends and updates the California Desert Protection Act of       1994 and reflects similar bills introduced in previous       Congresses. S. 414 would have created two new national       monuments, designated approximately 349,000 acres as       wilderness, and expanded Death Valley National Park, Joshua       Tree National Park and the Mojave National Preserve.        Rather than pursue the legislative process, Senator       Feinstein asked the Obama Administration in August 2015 to       use its authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906 (54       U.S.C. 320301 et seq.) to unilaterally designate three       national monuments in the California desert--the Mojave       Trails National Monument, Sand to Snow National Monument, and       Castle Mountains National Monument--without Congressional       approval. The following October, Senator Feinstein, the       Department of the Interior, and Department of Agriculture       hosted one public meeting on the prospect of designating       these areas as national monuments, as well as other       management priorities for the California desert area.        In response to concerns raised regarding this monument       strategy, Congressman Paul Cook worked with local communities       and stakeholders to craft alternative legislation which       attempted to balance the environmental protection of the       desert's landscapes with recreational and other multiple-use       activities that have occurred in the region for decades. The       result was H.R. 3668, the California Minerals, Off-Road       Recreation, and Conservation Act. It was the subject of a       Federal Lands Subcommittee hearing on December 9, 2015, but       no further legislative action was taken in the 114th       Congress. On February 12, 2016, President Obama designated       three new national monuments encompassing nearly 1.75 million       acres in the Southern California desert.        H.R. 857 seeks to balance many of the environmental and       recreationalist concerns that have remained in the wake of       the Obama designations. The bill creates the first system of       Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) recreation in the nation by setting       aside nearly 150,000 acres across six areas to enhance and       protect OHV activity. The bill also releases approximately       121,000 acres of Wilderness Study Areas, allowing for broader       management of such lands. Additionally, as part of a       compromise between OHV and environmental groups, H.R. 857       designates approximately 330,000 acres of new wilderness,       creates a new National Scenic Area, and establishes 77 miles       of new Wild and Scenic Rivers. Much of the wilderness       designated under the bill is contained within a National Park       or a Wilderness Study Area.        The following groups support this legislation: Advocates       for Access to Public Lands; Alabama Hills Stewardship Group;       American Motorcyclist Association; American Sand Association;       Americans for Responsible Recreational Access; The City of       Bishop, CA; Bishop Area Chamber of Commerce and Visitors       Bureau; Blue Ribbon Coalition, Inc.; California Wilderness       Coalition; Eastern Sierra 4X4 Club; Friends of the Inyo; Inyo       County Board of Supervisors; Inyo County Superintendent of       Schools; Lone Pine Chamber of Commerce; Lone Pine Paiute-      Shoshone Reservation; Motorcycle Industry Council; National       Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council; Pew Charitable       Trusts; Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association; San       Bernardino County; Specialty Equipment Market Association;       Specialty Vehicle Institute of America.               selected section-by-section analysis as reported         Sec. 2. California Off-Road Recreation and Conservation.        Designates approximately 330,000 acres of wilderness in the       California desert, 88,000 acres of which is primarily within       Joshua Tree National Park and 180,000 acres of which is       currently a Wilderness Study Area. This section also releases       approximately 121,000 acres of Wilderness Study Areas back       into multiple use, and ensures that ``cherry-stemmed'' roads       within wilderness remain open to motorized access.        Adds approximately 40,000 acres to the National Park       System. Approximately 35,000 acres of land would be added to       Death Valley National Park, 25 acres would be added to Mojave       National Preserve, and approximately 4,500 acres would be       added to Joshua Tree National Park.        Designates six existing administrative off-highway vehicle       areas as ``National Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Areas,''       creating the first system of national OHV Recreation Areas in       the nation. These include Dumont Dunes, El Mirage, Rasor,       Spangler Hills, Stoddard Valley, and Johnson Valley (a total       of more than 150,000 acres dedicated to OHV recreation), and       designates an additional 51,980 acres of previously disturbed       land for study and potential inclusion into the System.        Designates 18,610 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM)       land as the ``Alabama Hills National Scenic Area'' and       includes the area in the National Landscape Conservation       System.        Takes 132 acres of federal land into trust for the Lone       Pine Paiute-Shoshone Tribe and prohibits gaming on the land.        Ensures access to areas designated under the Act by tribes       for traditional cultural and religious purposes, including       the ability of a tribe to request the Secretary of the       Interior to temporarily close any designated area to protect       the privacy of traditional cultural and religious activities       by members of a tribe or Indian religious community.        Requires the development and implementation of a tribal       cultural resources management plan to identify, protect, and       conserve  [[Page H5603]]       cultural resources of Indian tribes associated with the Xam       Kwatchan Trail network.        Establishes a California-Nevada Desert Tortoise Relocation       Center with the aid of private partners and directs the       Secretary of the Interior to study wildlife corridors and       species migration in the California desert.        Sec. 3. Visitor Center.        Authorizes the National Park Service to acquire up to five       acres of land for a Joshua Tree National Park Visitor Center.        Sec. 4. California State School Land.        Allows BLM revenue from surplus land exchange and disposal       to fund the purchase of California State school trust land.        Sec. 5. Designation of Wild and Scenic Rivers.        Designates 77 miles of new wild, scenic, and recreational       rivers under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271       et seq.). The designations affect the Amargosa River,       Surprise Canyon Creek, Deep Creek, and the Whitewater River.        Sec. 6. Conforming Amendments.        Makes conforming amendments and prevents the creation of       buffer zones around new wilderness areas.     Mr. Speaker, let me just say very quickly here  that what Representative Cook has done is taking an important issue and  doing it the right way, by collaboration and outreach with local people  who live in those areas on what they want to do with the public land.   Public land does not necessarily only mean Federal land. Public land  can also be State, it can be county, and it can be all sorts of  entities' land, but the value of that land, whether it is Federal or  State or county or municipality, is does it help the people of that  particular area.   What Mr. Cook has done in this particular piece of legislation is  talk to them and find a way in which the land can actually be used to  help people. So, yes, he released some wilderness study areas that were  designated as unsuitable for a wilderness designation but then created  three times that number of acreage in new wilderness designations as  well as new wild and scenic river designations.   Most importantly, because land is needed for recreational purposes,  he puts protections for people who are using this land--OHV users,  especially--that ensure these areas will not be closed administratively  and that that kind of recreation opportunity will not be taken away on  a whim.   So what he has done is worked very hard with local people to find  local people's needs and desires for their local land and provided them  an opportunity that will provide not only economic benefits for a few,  but also recreational benefits for many, as well as creating new  wilderness designations at the same time and wild and scenic  designations at the same time.   This is a win-win for everyone involved. I commend him for his hard  work in actually coming up with this particular process. This is the  way land designation should be used.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this  bill. I have no more speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3392) to provide for stability of title to certain land  in the State of Louisiana, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), who is the sponsor of  this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This particular bill is not the first time we have talked about this  on the floor. It is long overdue. In fact, it is about 100 years long  overdue, with only a handful of homeowners having their title for which  they have bought, sold, and lived for decades questioning whether they  actually have the title to it or not.   It is unfair, and it was wrong. It was wrong for BLM, and it is right  for Congress to step in and try and solve this problem to bring some  finality and certainty to an issue that never should have been an issue  in the very first place. This harms the status quo and harms people.   That is not our position, and that is not what we should be doing. So  I appreciate the minority working with us on this particular bill very  well because it is an extremely important one to try and finally solve  this particular issue so we don't come back again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for this  particular bill that is solving a problem that should never have been  there in his particular district, for his efforts on it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1791) to establish the Mountains to Sound Greenway  National Heritage Area in the State of Washington, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1791         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert), who is the sponsor of  this piece of legislation, who is establishing a heritage area, and who  is doing it the right way.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is often the situation where heritage areas that were  originally established to try to allow local people to have some  mechanism in which they can get together to actually advertise their  particular area are usually for tourism interests or historical  preservation interests. It kind of devolved, unfortunately, through  time, to an issue in which people simply found a way of using the  Federal Government as the deep pocket to keep getting more money all  the time back to those particular areas, even though it was supposed to  be a one-time situation. Then we found that other heritage areas found  a way in which special interest groups got control of these areas and  were starting to dictate to local government entities.   Each of those problems that have been a significant problem in other  heritage areas was eliminated by Mr. Reichert in his particular piece  of legislation. That is why I said he did it the right way, with the  right instincts, with the right purposes, the right illustration,  especially with the emphasis on protecting private property rights and  Native American rights.   So this is one of the few heritage areas that I am happy to support,  because it is organized the proper way to solve problems, not just try  to find a cheap and easy way to get more money back into the area. So  he is commended for his integrity and the way he has orchestrated that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4257) to maximize land management efficiencies, promote  land conservation, generate education funding, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4257         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Conservation and       Education Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) at statehood, Congress granted each of the western       States land to be held in trust by the States and used for       the support of public schools and other public institutions;        (2) since the statehood land grants, Congress and the       executive branch have created multiple Federal conservation       areas on Federal land within the western States, including       National Parks, National Monuments, national conservation       areas, national grassland, components of the National       Wilderness Preservation System, wilderness study areas, and       national wildlife refuges;        (3) since statehood land grant land owned by the western       States are typically scattered across the public land,       creation of Federal conservation areas often include State       land grant parcels with substantially different management       mandates, making land and resource management more difficult,       expensive, and controversial for both Federal land managers       and the western States; and        (4) allowing the western States to relinquish State trust       land within Federal conservation areas and to select       replacement land from the public land within the respective       western States, would--        (A) enhance management of Federal conservation areas by       allowing unified management of those areas; and        (B) increase revenue from the statehood land grants for the       support of public schools and other worthy public purposes.

(d) Road Rights-of-Ways.--        (1) In general.--If land conveyed under this Act is subject       to a road lease, road right-of-way, road easement, or other       valid existing right in effect on the date of the conveyance,       the Secretary (or the Secretary of Agriculture for land       located within the National Forest System) and the western       State shall allow the lease, right-of-way, easement, or other       valid existing right to continue for the remainder of the       term of the lease, right-of-way, easement, or other valid       existing right, subject to the applicable terms and       conditions of the lease, right-of-way, easement, or other       valid existing right.        (2) Renewal.--On expiration of any road lease, road right-      of-way, road easement, or other valid existing right       described in paragraph (1), the party that has jurisdiction       over the land on the date of expiration may elect to renew       the  [[Page H5610]]       lease, right-of-way, easement, or other valid existing right       if permitted under applicable law.        (e) Protection of Indian Rights.--        (1) Treaty rights.--Nothing in this Act alters or       diminishes the treaty rights of any Indian tribe.        (2) Land held in trust.--Nothing in this Act affects--        (A) land held in trust by the Secretary for any Indian       tribe; or        (B) any individual Indian allotment.        (3) Effect.--Nothing in this Act alters, diminishes, or       enlarges the application of--        (A) division A of subtitle III of title 54, United States       Code (formerly known as the ``National Historic Preservation       Act'' (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.));        (B) the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation       Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);        (C) Public Law 95-341 (commonly known as the ``American       Indian Religious Freedom Act'') (42 U.S.C. 1996);        (D) chapter 3125 of title 54, United States Code; or        (E) the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16       U.S.C. 470aa et seq.).       SEC. 10. EFFECT.         Nothing in this Act repeals or limits, expressly or by       implication, any authority in existence on the date of       enactment of this Act for the selection or exchange of land.       SEC. 11. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.         (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the provisions       of this Act shall cease to be effective with regard to any       State land grant parcel located within an eligible area for       which an application has not been filed by the date that is       20 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (b) New Eligible Areas.--If the application described in       subsection (a) is for a State land grant parcel that is       located within an eligible area established after the date of       enactment of this Act, the provisions of this Act shall       remain effective for 20 years after the date on which the new       eligible area is established.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record additional  background that is necessary for this particular bill.  Background and Need for H.R. 4257, Advancing Conservation and Education                                    Act         The Advancing Conservation and Education (ACE) Act is based       on existing provisions in western State enabling acts       allowing States to select replacement lands in lieu of State       school grants that were not completed by the United States.        Congress granted most of the western States land to be held       in trust by the States and used to support public education       and other public purposes. Many of these State trust lands       parcels are in a ``checkerboard'' pattern inside federal       areas managed for conservation, such as national parks and       monuments, national wildlife refuges, wilderness study areas,       and areas of critical environmental concern. The       intermingling of land ownership creates significant problems       for both federal land managers and the States, since the       latter are required to manage State trust lands to provide       revenue for public education. Through its land use planning       process, the Bureau of Land Management        (BLM) identifies lands that are difficult or uneconomic to       manage, such as ``checkerboard'' areas.        H.R. 4257 will help meet the goal of rationalizing land       ownership in the west by creating an additional authority for       the United States to acquire State lands in federal       conservation areas, and compensating the States with equal-      value replacement federal lands within the State. The current       process where interested parties bring land exchanges to       Congress on a case-by-case basis is time-consuming and       cumbersome, and existing administrative land exchange       authorities are equally challenging.        The bipartisan proposal expands existing authority (43       U.S.C. 851-852), that allows western States to select federal       lands ``in lieu'' of lands lost to the States when original       statehood land grants were not completed. It would allow       States with lands located in federal conservation areas to       deed back those lands to the United States, and select       replacement lands of equivalent value from the unappropriated       federal public lands within that State. Many of the       provisions of the proposal incorporate existing BLM       administrative provisions for in-lieu selections, including       land valuation, and compliance with BLM land use plans. It       would not replace the land exchange process, but rather       provide an alternative mechanism for State-federal land       transfers.        Further, H.R. 4257 also directs the Department of the       Interior to create a process for the relinquishment of the       parcels and sets forth requirements regarding hazardous       materials on land conveyed, water rights, grazing permits,       road rights-of ways, and other valid existing rights.        The Western States Land Commissioners Association (WSLCA),       a bipartisan organization of 21 State agencies responsible       for managing more than 500 million acres of public and school       trust land, has proposed a legislative solution to provide a       mechanism for the United States to acquire lands owned by the       western States and located inside federal conservation areas,       while fairly compensating the States for those lands by       granting them the right to select replacement lands of       equivalent value from the public domain. The WSLCA proposal       has had substantial  [[Page H5611]]       input from western States and the conservation community.       Previous iterations of the proposed bill have also been       supported by conservations groups such as the Wilderness       Society. H.R. 4257 is based on this proposal.        H.R. 4257 would provide a useful tool for federal and State       land managers to make their respective landholdings more       rational, for the benefit of both sound land management and       public education funding.        A companion bill, S. 2078, has been introduced in the       Senate. The policy provisions set forth in H.R. 4257 have       enjoyed bipartisan support in the House and Senate in the       114th and 113th sessions..                 MAJOR PROVISIONS SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS         Sec. 4. Relinquishment of State Land Grant Parcels and       Selection of Replacement Land.        Expands existing authority for western States to relinquish       State trust lands wholly or primarily within eligible federal       areas managed for conservation.        Clarifies that land conveyed under this authority remains       subject to valid existing rights.        Stipulates that relinquished lands shall be managed by the       land agency responsible for the conservation area that the       land is being added to.        Requires western States' authority to use this alternative       authority in priority areas before applying to relinquish       State land in other eligible areas. However, the Secretary of       the Interior can waive this requirement if it is determined       that the relinquishment of parcels located in the priority       areas is impractical or infeasible.        Further waives the priority requirement if an application       for relinquishment is limited to a single eligible area, and       it is further determined that substantial progress is being       made by the State to relinquish priority parcels. This       exemption can only occur once every five years.        Sec. 5. Process.        Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish a       process within 540 days for western States to request       relinquishment of eligible State parcels and to select       federal land in exchange.        Requires the land exchanges to be concurrent.        Requires public notice and an opportunity to comment on       proposed conveyances between the western State and the United       States.        Requires the land exchanges to be done in accordance with       the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321       et seq.) and other applicable laws.        Permits the Secretary to enter into agreements with any of       the western States to facilitate processing of applications       and conveyance of land.        Requires the Secretary to issue a final determination on an       application within 3 years after submission.        Prohibits the Secretary from accepting an application for       the selection of federal land if it is determined that the       selection is not reasonably compact and consolidated, if it       will create significant management conflicts, if it will       adversely affect federal use or a recreation site, or if the       selection is not in the public interest.        Requires consultation with the head of the appropriate       federal land agency before approving any conveyance of       federal land.        Requires consultation with any Indian tribe affected by the       land conveyance, including any tribe which notifies the       Secretary that there is traditional cultural property located       within the federal land proposed for conveyance to the       western State.        Stipulates the costs of conveyance shall be shared equally       by the Secretary and the western State.        Sec. 6. Mineral Land.        Permits western States to select federal land that is       mineral in character.        Excludes mineral land that only includes a portion of a       mineral lease or permit, land that is part of the federal       mineral estate (unless the United States does not own the       associated surface estate), or land that is part of federal       surface estate (unless the United States does not own the       associated mineral estate).        Clarifies that nothing in this Act shall affect existing       mining claims.        Sec. 7. Construction with Other Laws.        Requires the Secretary to consider the equities of the       western States and interest of the public in the application       of this Act.        Sec. 8. Valuation.        Requires the overall value of the State trust parcels and       the federal land conveyed to be equal, and if not equal to be       equalized by a payment of funds.        Sec. 9. Miscellaneous.        Requires the Secretary and the western State make available       for review any record relating to hazardous materials on the       land to be conveyed.        Allows State or federal water rights to be included in the       conveyance of land.        Clarifies that nothing in this Act creates an implied or       expressed federal reserved water right, affects a valid       existing water right, or affects the use of water conveyance       infrastructure.        Stipulates that existing grazing rights must be honored for       the remainder of the term of lease, permit, or contract.       After this duration, the party who has jurisdiction over the       land may elect to renew the lease, permit or contract.        Clarifies that nothing in this Act prevents the Secretary       or State from cancelling or modifying a grazing permit, lease       or contract if the land is sold, conveyed, transferred or       leased for nongrazing purposes.        Restricts cancellation of grazing permits except to the       extent reasonably necessary to accommodate surface operations       in support of mineral development.        Stipulates that existing road lease, road right-of-way,       road easement, or other valid existing right must be honored       for the remainder of the term of lease, permit, or contract.       After this duration, the party who has jurisdiction over the       land may elect to renew the lease, permit or contract.        Clarifies that nothing in this Act alters or diminishes the       treaty rights of any Indian tribe.        Sec. 10 Effect.        Nothing in this Act repeals or limits, expressly or by       implication, any authority in existence on the date of       enactment of this Act for the selection or exchange of land.        Sec. 11. Termination of Authority.        The authority provided by this Act will expire 20 years       after enactment.     Mr. Speaker, let me also say that, as a former  teacher and a future teacher, I appreciate Mr. Stewart actually working  on this piece of legislation that goes to help education in the State  of Utah. No one else is doing that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4528) to make technical amendments to certain marine  fish conservation statutes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4528         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. BILLFISH CONSERVATION ACT OF 2012.         Section 4(c)(1) of the Billfish Conservation Act of 2012       (16 U.S.C. 1827a(c)(1)) is amended by inserting ``and       retained'' after ``landed''.       SEC. 2. SHARK CONSERVATION ACT OF 2010.         The Act entitled ``An Act to amend the High Seas Driftnet       Fishing Moratorium Protection Act and the Magnuson-Stevens       Fishery Conservation and Management Act to improve the       conservation of sharks'', approved January 4, 2011 (Public       Law 111-348; 124 Stat. 3668), is amended--        (1) by striking section 104 and inserting the following:       ``SEC. 104. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         ``Nothing in this title or the amendments made by this       title shall be construed as affecting, altering, or       diminishing in any way the authority of the Secretary of       Commerce to establish such conservation and management       measures as the Secretary considers necessary and appropriate       under sections 302(a)(3) and 304(g) of the Magnuson-Stevens       Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C.       1852(a)(3), 1854(g)).''; and        (2) in section 1, by striking the item relating to section       104 and inserting the following:  ``Sec. 104. Rule of construction.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today, we are considering an amendment to the Billfish Conservation  Act that was passed in 2012. Unfortunately, when it was passed, there  was a loophole in the bill. What this bill today does is close that  loophole, preserving the original congressional intent, while also  preserving traditional markups in Hawaii, as well as in our Pacific  territories. It is supported by everybody and their third cousin.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a 2-page letter of support from  a broad coalition of sportsmen's groups, manufacturing associations,  and conservation groups, plus a full list of the supporting  organizations for this bill.                                                  December 19, 2017.      The Hon. Rob Bishop      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: we       strongly urge the House Natural Resources Committee to       immediately consider and pass out of committee S. 396, a bill       to make a technical amendment to the Billfish Conservation       Act of 2012 (P. L. 112-183). The Senate passed S. 396 by       unanimous consent on October 2, 2017, receiving no objections       or holds during the process to hotline and clear the bill.       Considering such bipartisan support in the Senate for this       important conservation legislation for Pacific billfish, it       is our sincere request that the House Natural Resources       Committee clear this bill as soon as possible and have the       bill move out of the House under suspension.        S. 396 provides a technical amendment to the Billfish       Conservation Act (BCA) to clarify a slight ambiguity related       to the treatment of covered Pacific billfish under the law.       The BCA was passed by both the House and Senate with broad       bipartisan support on October 5, 2012. The legislation was a       rare event in Congress where Members on both sides of the       aisle saw the wisdom of passing a bill that would put in       place a critical prohibition on the sale of billfish in the       continental U.S. The law was intended to put similar       prohibitions on the sale of Pacific billfish as those for       Atlantic billfish, effectively eliminating an estimated       30,000 billfish being imported to the U.S. each year from the       Pacific.        However, over five years since passage of the BCA, the       National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) failed to issue       regulations to properly implement the law. Failure by NMFS to       issue regulations to implement the BCA is effectively       undermining the conservation goals of the law and creating       uncertainty, where there should be none, on whether Pacific       billfish can be sold in the continental U.S. The House       passage of S. 396 would eliminate this ambiguity.        The legislative history in both the House and Senate is       extremely clear that the BCA was written to allow       traditional, cultural fishing and markets for billfish in       Hawaii and the Pacific Insular Area, but otherwise eliminated       the market for billfish in the remainder of the U.S. House       passage of S. 396 would make this absolutely clear and would       immediately put into force the critical conservation       requirements of the BCA.        The Billfish Conservation Act of 2012 was a great       conservation win for saltwater anglers. We request you pass       S. 396 out of committee to further solidify this victory for       preserving Pacific billfish.
