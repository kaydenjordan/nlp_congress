 Madam Speaker, I thank the Representative from  Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Today, we are here to consider House Resolution 1464, providing for  the consideration of the Speak Out Act, among other provisions.   Let me be clear: House Republicans agree that victims of sexual  harassment and assault deserve justice. Unfortunately, due to the fact  that this bill is poorly drafted and questionable findings from the  Senate bill remain that were specifically stripped out of the House  version during Judiciary markup, there are still several legitimate  concerns surrounding the unintended consequences of H.R. 8227, the  Speak Out Act.   We must maintain respect for the victims and their privacy. Making  settlements less valuable to defendants by making confidentiality  provisions unenforceable could leave victims worse off.   This bill may force victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment  to take their claims to court in a public process, but some victims may  be reluctant to speak out in any form if they know that their stories  will be public.   Furthermore, removing the benefit of confidentiality may remove the  incentives that defendants have to settle and give them more reason to  fight harder in court, which may not be in the plaintiff's best  interest.   The bill is also worded in a way that may also apply to certain post- dispute nondisclosure and non-disparagement clauses, broadly making  both predispute and post-dispute nondisclosure and non-disparagement  clauses unenforceable and may affect existing settlements.   This begs the question: What is the point of drawing up a contract if  Congress will eventually step in after the fact and invalidate it? What  is more, this bill would effectively impose a new regulatory floor that  comes from the top down, overtaking the role of the State. Republicans  do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach, especially in this  case, where it may do more harm than good for these victims.   This legislation should remind us all to think carefully about  federalism and when Congress should enact Federal regulatory floors.   States have traditionally decided how to regulate contract clauses,  and some have already passed laws to regulate these specific clauses  relating to sexual harassment and assault.   The bill even uses State and Tribal laws to define terms within it,  but this bill should supersede those State decisions in some cases.   Though I believe this bill is well-intentioned, it would be a mistake  to rush to pass it as is, where significant concerns need to be  addressed.   Madam Speaker, it is for those reasons I oppose this rule and ask  Members to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as I said in my opening remarks, the  bill under consideration by this rule is well-intentioned but flawed.  It deserves additional time to thoughtfully consider legitimate  concerns. House Republicans are committed to ensuring victims of sexual  violence receive the justice they are entitled to, but that does not  mean the flaws outlined should be ignored.   Madam Speaker, again, I oppose the rule, and I encourage Members to  do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
