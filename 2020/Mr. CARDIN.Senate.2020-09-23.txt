 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his  longstanding leadership in the U.S. Senate on addressing the concerns  of climate change. He has been there every week, every day, leading us  to take action to prevent the horrors of climate change.   We have made some progress but not enough under his leadership. We  have to do more, as he points out, and what he just told our  colleagues. But I just really want to thank the Senator--as I look at  the wildfires in the West, I look at the frequency of the hurricanes,  when I look at the receding shorelines in Maryland, as I look at our  efforts on the Chesapeake Bay--and recognize that if we don't do what  we need to do, what science tells us we could do on carbon emissions,  we are doing this at our own peril.   It is not just America. It is the global communities. It is our  leadership globally. Senator Whitehouse and I traveled with other  Members of the Senate to the climate meetings, and we made progress. We  have to get back to it. I just want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his  leadership.                                 Coronavirus    Mr. President, on Sunday, the Washington National Cathedral marked  the 200,000 American lives lost to COVID-19 by tolling the Bourdon Bell  200 times--once for every 1,000 lives lost. Nearly 113,000 people have  died since May 15, when the House of Representatives passed a  comprehensive COVID-19 relief package known as the Heroes Act.   As of September 20, the 7-day moving average for new infections was  over 41,000. The 7-day moving average for new deaths was almost 800.  Put another way, from a fatality standpoint, we have the equivalent of  the 9/11 terrorist attack every 4 days. The United States, which has  4.3 percent of the world's population, accounts for 21.1 percent of the  COVID-19 deaths worldwide.   When President Trump delivered his Inaugural Address in January 2017,  he stated:         This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.       We are one nation. . . . We share one heart, one home, and       one glorious destiny. . . . So to all Americans in every city       near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain,       from ocean to ocean, hear these words--you will never be       ignored again.    Fast forward to last week when President Trump--referring to the  total U.S. fatalities--said:         If you take the blue states out, we're at a level that I       don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at       a very low level.    Of course, talking about COVID infection.  [[Page S5813]]    President Trump has said many appalling things. Dividing America  during a pandemic into so-called blue and red States and devaluing the  lives of Americans from blue States may be one of the most appalling  things so far.   As former Secretary of Homeland Security and Republican Governor of  Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, remarked, ``It's so unworthy of a president.  It's beyond despicable. It's soulless. It's almost unspeakable in the  middle of the pandemic to try to divide the country on a political  basis when COVID-19 is really bipartisan.''   Not only was President Trump's statement appalling, beyond  despicable, and soulless, it belies the fact that COVID-19 does not  care about State boundaries or any other boundaries. The States that  President Trump lost in the 2016 election currently account for about  12,000 more COVID deaths than the States that he won. But the 11 States  with the highest number of COVID-19 cases per million residents are all  States that he won, and 14 of the 19 States with caseloads above the  national average are States that he won. So the grim gap is closing,  but it really should not matter because we are the United States of  America. I wish President Trump could understand that.   Speaker Pelosi has stated that she intends to keep the House in  session until Congress passes another comprehensive COVID-19 relief  package. And I agree with the Speaker.   The Senate may adjourn as soon as it passes the fiscal year 2020  continuing resolution to keep the Federal Government open. I fear this  would be a grave mistake and an abdication of our duty. The Senate  should take up the Heroes Act. The so-called skinny amendments Senators  Johnson and McConnell brought to the floor over the past few weeks were  so woefully inadequate they failed the fundamental test of serving as  the beginning block for a bipartisan compromise. Even President Trump  indicated the Senate Republicans need to do more.   I would like to take the next few minutes to outline some of the  things we need do to respond appropriately to the twin health and  economic crises our Nation faces.   Remember when President Trump promised that the novel coronavirus  would magically disappear as the weather got warmer? Well, that did not  happen, and now summer has turned to autumn; the weather is starting to  get cold again; and the flu season is approaching.   The next COVID-19 supplemental package should include provisions that  increase the Federal Matching Assistance Payment, FMAP, and maintain  Medicaid payments and permanently expand telehealth flexibilities that  have increased healthcare access to patients around the country and  address health disparities that COVID-19 pandemic has worsened.   The Urban Institute estimates 12 million additional Americans will  turn to Medicaid for access to affordable healthcare amid the pandemic.  In my State, more than 45,000 Marylanders are newly enrolled in  Medicaid. At the same time, State revenues are plummeting, leaving  States facing budget deficits that could amount to $555 billion through  2022.   If unaddressed, these budget shortfalls will lead States to making  dramatic cuts to Medicaid, just as they did during the past economic  downturns, at a time when those newly and previously enrolled need  healthcare the most. The National Governors Association has called on  Congress to further raise the FMAP and maintain access to essential  Medicaid benefits.   Another important policy that will increase access to healthcare  services during the COVID-19 pandemic is permanently extending  telehealth permissions and privileges implemented under the CARES Act.  Specifically, Congress should permanently remove regulatory barriers so  that patients in rural, underserved, and urban areas can use telehealth  to see their primary care providers, mental health counselors, and  chronic disease management teams. Reimbursement for these services  should adequately reflect the care delivered and allow patients to use  their homes to receive these services. Telehealth increases access to  care in areas with workforce shortages and for individuals who live far  away from healthcare facilities, have limited mobility or  transportation, or have other barriers to accessing care   This is a bipartisan proposal to expand telehealth. It makes abundant  sense. We have done it. Now let's make it permanent. That helps rural  America; that helps people who have a hard time with transportation to  get to where they need to be; it is more efficient; and it is safer.  Let's make sure that is done before we leave.   At a time when many are unable to visit their health provider in  person, we must depend on telehealth to deliver high-quality healthcare  to millions of Americans around the country.   We have seen how COVID-19 has disproportionately affected communities  of color, highlighting how the United States fails to extend critical  resources, support, and healthcare access to these communities.  According to the data from the CDC, communities of color experience  higher rates of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 than White  people do. Black Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives are five  times more likely to be hospitalized than White people are.   African-American Marylanders account for 30 percent of our State's  population but 41 percent of its COVID fatalities. Marylanders of Latin  American descent account for 17 percent of the State's population but  21 percent of its cases.   This is why the next supplemental package must focus on and contain  policies that address health disparities that have been worsened by the  COVID-19 pandemic.   I have authored two bills focused on addressing health disparities:  One, the REACH Act, with Senator Scott of South Carolina; and, two, the  COVID-19 Health Disparities Action Act with Senator Menendez. Both  bills create targeted grant programs that would help community-based  organizations and local health departments provide culturally  appropriate outreach, education, and health services to Black, Latino,  indigenous, and our communities of color. Both bills are important  steps to rectifying the ills of systemic racism from going forward.   Communities of color have longstanding and tragically appropriate  mistrust with the medical community, for good reason, sadly. Our  government deliberately misled Black patients and research participants  during the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Today, physicians still undertreat  or underdiagnose pain in patients of color. The REACH Act and the  COVID-19 Health Disparities Action Act should be included in the next  COVID-19 supplemental to help promote trust within the communities of  color for future COVID-19 responses, as we look beyond the pandemic.   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our State and local  governments have faced significant financial challenges to meet  declining revenues, as well as emergency costs related to COVID-19. It  is well beyond time we listen to those on the ground dealing with the  COVID-19 pandemic and provide them the resources they need.   What does this mean for communities back home? For our  municipalities, it is funding for first responders and community  services. For our counties, it is funding for schools. For our States,  it is funding for public health.   The revenue losses our State, county, and local governments face are  dramatic, and they threaten to cause deep, lasting cuts to public  safety, education, public health, and other critical essential services  that will adversely affect far beyond the public health battle against  COVID-19.   Our Governors have issued a bipartisan plea. Governor Cuomo of New  York, a Democrat, and Governor Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, who are  the chair and previous chair of the National Governors Association,  respectively, joined with all of our Nation's Governors--all--in April  to say they need help from the Federal Government.   They need help to maintain critical missions of public safety, public  health, and public education with at least $500 billion for our States  and additional funding for local governments beyond what we already  provided under the CARES Act.   The Heroes Act, which has passed the House, provides $875 billion for  our State and local governments. Of that amount, $500 billion goes to  meet the State's needs, and $375 billion goes to meet local government  needs, with one-half to the counties and one-half to  [[Page S5814]]  municipalities. This funding goes directly to counties and local  governments of all sizes to support their urgent needs. The funding is  meant to address urgent COVID-19 response activities, and State and  local governments may also use it to replace lost revenue to avoid  making draconian cuts to essential services.   That would go a long way to meeting the needs of our local first  responders, our police, our firefighters, our sanitation workers, and  our educators.   The Senate Republicans' HEALS Act, in its most recent iteration,  provides no new funding to help State and local governments; rather,  they merely extend the deadline for use using CARES moneys. That is not  adequate. We must do more.   This is too little, too late. Our State and local communities in  Maryland have already allocated funding for programs that support  renters, small businesses, and support frontline workers who face  increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. Those dollars are spoken for.   I urge my colleagues to recognize the lasting harm the failure to  support our State and local governments will cause and support the  NGA's bipartisan request to provide additional funding to State and  local governments.   If we learned anything when the school year ended so abruptly this  past spring, it is a greater appreciation for our educators and the  work they provide for our students in the classroom. It is so difficult  to duplicate the interaction between educators and students, yet our  colleagues across the aisle appear to be unwilling to provide our local  school systems with the resources they need to allow school systems to  educate students safely this fall.   Our local school leaders are making incredibly difficult decisions  while facing political pressures from the Trump administration to  ignore public health recommendations from Federal, State, and local  officials; legitimate concerns from educators on the safety of  returning to the classroom; and questions from parents who need answers  on how to continue their child's education while meeting their own work  responsibilities.   With dwindling State and local government revenues because of COVID- 19, the school leaders have already started to face budget crunches  even as schools' financial needs have increased things like cleaning  supplies now necessary to meet CDC public health guidance, educational  technology, and trainings for educators to meet the new demands of  online education.   Without additional Federal resources, we fail to provide our local  school leaders with the tools necessary to strike the balance between  maintaining the highest quality level of education for our children  while protecting student and educator health.   The Heroes Act provides $100 billion for a State-level Fiscal  Stabilization Fund for education, with $90 billion for States to  support their public institutions of education. In Maryland, this would  provide nearly $900 million for our local school districts for meeting  the needs of growing numbers of low-income students and our children  with special needs; retaining educators vital to the education of our  children; and ensuring that schools have resources to improve the  virtual learning environment that frustrated so many students, parents,  and educators last spring.   This funding would rightly support the decisions of local school and  public health officials on how schools may reopen in the fall, whether  virtual or in-person or hybrid. It does not attempt to coerce school  districts into reopening their classroom doors in an unsafe manner as  the only way to receive critically necessary Federal funds.   The Federal Government should provide local leaders with adequate  resources to support well-informed and reasoned public health decisions  rather than dangerously mandating school reopenings. In addition, the  Federal Government needs to take the leadership in eliminating the  digital divide. Access to reliable internet service should be available  to every household in America.   The best action Congress can take to help small businesses is to  provide State and local governments, health providers, and first  responders with the resources they need to protect our communities from  COVID-19, as I mentioned a moment ago. I am proud to be the ranking  Democrat on the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. I have  worked very closely with Senator Rubio on proposals. First, we have to  get this COVID-19 under control. Only after it is safe for small  businesses to resume full operations and safe for parents to send their  children to school will our economy truly begin to recover.   Getting the virus under control is especially important for small  businesses in the food services, hospitality, live events, travel and  tourism sectors. Businesses in those sectors are especially reliant on  large gatherings in order to make a profit.   Restaurants, for example, have been able to make up for lost indoor  dining capacity by increasing their outdoor dining capacity, which will  become increasingly difficult in many parts of the country as the  weather gets colder and more inclement.   Similarly, communities that rely on tourism revenues generated during  the winter months, such as Deep Creek Lake in my home State of  Maryland, are likely to experience decreased cashflow this year due to  the pandemic. Employers on the Eastern Shore missed their prime summer  months. Congress cannot leave small businesses and the communities that  rely on them out in the cold.   In addition to getting the pandemic under control, Congress must  build on the lessons learned during past economic downturns. The most  important lesson is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to  rescue the economy during a crisis. To help the most employers we can,  Congress must preserve the multiple support tools in the toolkit.   There is already bipartisan consensus that we must provide small  businesses with a second Paycheck Protection Program loan. More than 3  months ago, Senators Coons, Shaheen, and I introduced legislation to  create the Prioritized Paycheck Protection Program, which would provide  vulnerable small businesses experiencing significant losses due to  COVID-19 with a second capital infusion. Our proposal--P4--would allow  small businesses that have 100 or fewer employees to receive a second  PPP loan if they can demonstrate a loss of revenue of 50 percent or  more due to the pandemic. The bill would also reserve $25 billion for  small businesses with 10 or fewer employees and extend the deadline to  apply for an initial PPP loan through the end of this year.   There is also bipartisan agreement on the need to improve the  Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, EIDL. I support Senator Rosen's  and Senator Warren's efforts to shore up the EIDL Program so that more  small businesses have access to the long-term, low-interest rate loans  the program makes available. With their maximum loan amount of $2  million and repayment terms as long as 30 years, EIDLs provide small  businesses with flexibility, capital that they can use to retool their  businesses to respond to COVID-19   There is also bipartisan agreement on the need to expand the employee  retention tax credit, which is a provision from legislation I  introduced with Senator Wyden that was included in the CARES Act. The  House acted on this bipartisan agreement. The Heroes Act makes  substantial enhancements to this program so that it could benefit close  to 60 million workers and over 6 million businesses.   If the Senate fails to act now--before adjourning--to support small  businesses by getting this pandemic under control and providing capital  to our small businesses, our communities will pay a heavy price for  that inaction, as many more small businesses will close their doors,  and I am afraid they will do it permanently.   Studies have shown that maintaining the employer-employee  relationship is key to a swift, robust recovery. With tens of millions  of Americans relying on unemployment benefits and permanent job losses  on the rise, it is critical that we do all we can to keep workers  connected to their jobs and prevent further layoffs. I am disappointed  that, despite bipartisan agreement on several of the measures needed to  support American small businesses struggling to survive COVID-19, the  response to the pandemic has turned into a partisan fight.   For the sake of our communities and small businesses, I urge my  Republican  [[Page S5815]]  colleagues and President Trump to accept Speaker Pelosi and Senator  Schumer's offer to meet Democrats in the middle so we can pass a  bipartisan bill that helps our communities get COVID under control and  begin the recovery process.   The Heroes Act also extends the weekly $600 emergency Federal  unemployment payment. This special benefit lapsed in July. President  Trump's program to provide $300 a week in emergency benefits through  FEMA is a weak half measure, and Congress must do more. These extra 6  weeks will expire very shortly, and it comes out of the FEMA funds,  which are desperately needed as we know how many emergencies are  occurring throughout our country with the wildfires and the hurricanes.   The full benefits the Heroes Act provides would strengthen the  critical safety net for the record number of Americans who are  unemployed as America faces its most serious economic challenge since  the Great Depression.   By way of example in Maryland, we are seeing first-time claims for  unemployment benefits at a rate of about 13,000 a week, peaking in  early May, with nearly 110,000 new weekly claims filed. We have seen  the total number of filings since March exceed 1.5 million. These are  numbers that cry out for us to extend the unemployment benefits. We  really need to do that, and we need to do that before we leave.   These are some, but not all, of the issues we must address  immediately and for a sustained period. Former President Harry Truman  had a sign on his desk in the Oval Office that said: ``The buck stops  here.'' ``Passing the buck'' means something entirely different to  President Trump. On March 13, 2020, as we began to grasp the magnitude  and impacts of the coronavirus, President Trump said: ``I don't take  responsibility at all.'' That may be the most honest and accurate thing  he has said since he has become President. We have ample evidence to  take him seriously. Therefore, it is up to Congress to provide the  leadership and relief Americans desperately need.   The House has done its part in passing the Heroes Act. It is now time  for the Senate to act.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I thank the 30 million small  businesses in America for their contributions to our economy during  this year's National Small Business Week, which began on Sunday,  September 20 and ends on Saturday, September 26. National Small  Business Week is the time of year when we come together to celebrate  our Nation's small businesses for their role in moving our economy  forward by boosting local economies, improving industries through  innovation, and employing nearly half of our country's workforce.   Taking time to recognize our Nation's small businesses is especially  important this year due to the many ways--big and small--that our small  businesses have stepped up to help our communities get through the  pandemic.   In my home State of Maryland, I have seen distilleries use their  facilities to make hand sanitizer when supplies were low; I have seen  lacrosse equipment manufacturers produce face shields and masks for  doctors and first responders; and I have heard stories about the many  small government contractors that are helping Federal agencies address  COVID-19. Today I am proud to recognize the founder of one of those  small government contractors, Dr. Anton Bizzell, who has been named  Maryland Small Business Person of the Year by the Small Business  Administration.   Dr. Bizzell's company, the Bizzell Group, is an 8(a) certified small  business that specializes in strategy and technology and works at the  forefront of public health issues. Most recently, the Bizzell Group has  been helping the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keep our  communities aware of the latest information regarding the COVID-19  pandemic.   After more than 25 years of experience in health services, policy,  and management, Dr. Bizzell founded the Bizzell Group in 2010 to  provide data-driven and innovative solutions to clients in an effort to  build healthy, secure, and connected communities. In the years since,  the company has grown to include nearly 100 employees with four offices  in Lanham, Rockville, Atlanta, GA, and the Democratic Republic of the  Congo.   Dr. Bizzell has said, ``Business is most successful when done with  integrity, excellence, and heart, and success is when your end result  makes the world a better place.'' His philosophy is clearly at work at  the Bizzell Group.   Dr. Bizzell and the Bizzell Group are a shining example of the vital  role small businesses and entrepreneurs play in our communities. In  addition to the more than 100 jobs created by the Bizzell Group, Dr.  Bizzell serves on the Maryland Board for the March of Dimes, and he is  president of the Delta Lambda Chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha  Fraternity.   I congratulate Dr. Bizzell for being named Maryland's Small Business  Person of the Year, and I thank him and his colleagues at the Bizzell  Group for their efforts to keep our communities informed about COVID-19  during this unprecedented public health crisis. I am proud to represent  them in the U.S. Senate.   Now more than ever, these contributions to our economy and  communities deserve to be recognized. Dr. Bizzel and the many small  business owners like him in communities across the nation are why I  will continue to fight for Congress to pass another economic relief  bill that meets the needs of our communities and small businesses. So  many of our Nation's small businesses have stepped up for us, and  Congress must once again do the same for them.                            ____________________
