 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and Mr. Woodall,  whose words prompted me to want to come speak, because I served on the  Rules Committee when we were in the majority a number of years ago.  Louise was our leader, and she ran that thing with an iron fist.  Excellent woman, articulate, powerful, in her tiny little frame. She  was somebody who made us stay on task.   We worked a lot of hours on that committee, as I am sure my friend  from the Rules Committee would agree, and she was indefatigable. The  number of hours that the Rules Committee would meet, and she would make  sure we were on task--and a great sense of humor, focused, and smart.   This is really a nice honor that the committee is bringing in her  name and in Bob's name. He would be at the committee almost as much as  Louise, and they were a great team. I just want to add my word of  thanks for this honor for the Slaughters.
