 Mr. President, I am pleased to urge all of my  colleagues to give a strong bipartisan voice vote in support of the  amendment by the Senator from Georgia. The current budget process does  not produce a meaningful budget, does not control the debt or the  deficit, and does not contribute to bipartisanship or compromise. What  it does produce is a meaningless, partisan vote-arama. If you believe  we can do better than a vote-arama, if you believe we can have an  improved and meaningful budget process, voice vote aye.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.   The amendment (No. 1167) was agreed to.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
