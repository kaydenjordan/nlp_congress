 Madam President, for weeks, I have continuously said I  wouldn't let the Senate become a theater for show votes and messaging  stunts from either side. We would only vote on plans that stood an  actual chance of being signed by the President and, thus, obviously  becoming law.   So I was glad to hear today the President's announcement that he and  our Democratic colleagues have reached an agreement that will  immediately reopen the government while providing the room to negotiate  a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Further,  negotiations on DHS will be prioritized over the consideration of any  other funding bill. With cooperation, we can pass legislation opening  the government, and we can send the DHS appropriations bill to a  conference today with the House.   I am glad the closed portions of the Federal Government will reopen  and get back online. I am glad the dedicated men and women of the Coast  Guard, law enforcement, the TSA, and all of the other Federal employees  will not have to go longer without pay for their work and will receive  their backpay. I know the pain this episode has caused for many  Kentuckians and for people all over our country. They deserve this  resolution.   In going forward, I hope our Democratic friends will stay true to the  commitment they have stated constantly over the past weeks that once  the government was reopened, they would be perfectly willing to  negotiate in good faith on full-year government funding that would  include a significant investment in urgently needed border security  measures, including physical barriers.   After all, the only way Federal workers are going to have stability  and certainty beyond the next 3 weeks and the only way our border is  going to have real security is if the Democrats will stop playing  partisan games and get serious about negotiating with the President on  a long-term compromise.   The days ahead will tell us whether our Democratic colleagues are  actually serious about securing our Nation--whether they actually mean  what they say. The President has called on the Senate to act on these  proposals, and now that there has been an agreement between the  Democrats and the White House, we can make that happen.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, it is my sad duty today to pay tribute  to a fallen Kentucky hero, Louisville Metro Police Department Detective  Deidre Mengedoht. Dee Dee, as her friends called her, was tragically  killed in the line of duty on Christmas Eve. Her family and our  community are left to mourn this painful loss and to recognize her  incredible service to Louisville.   A graduate of Eastern High School and the University of Louisville,  Detective Mengedoht chose to dedicate her life to the service of her  community. In 2011, she joined the LMPD's training academy. Since the  day she took her oath, Detective Mengedoht proved herself worthy of the  trust placed in her. With real love for the community under her  protection, she worked as a beat officer before earning the rank of  detective.   For 7 and a half years, Detective Mengedoht served the department and  the people of Louisville. She quickly gained the respect of her  colleagues, who recognized a passion for law enforcement and for  community engagement. According to those who had the privilege to know  her, Detective Mengedoht displayed the attributes of a true public  servant. Police Chief Steve Conrad said she ``would fight tirelessly to  seek justice for victims whose cases she was investigating.'' In her  important work for the city of Louisville, Detective Mengedoht would  always give more of herself than was asked.   While families throughout Kentucky and the Nation celebrated  Christmas Eve, Detective Mengedoht was at her post, protecting the  community. That afternoon, she conducted a traffic stop, a routine  procedure for any member of law enforcement. Tragedy struck without  warning as a semi-truck hit her police cruiser. Detective Mengedoht was  killed at the scene,   The heartbreaking incident left the community shaken. The LMPD lost a  critical member of its force, and Detective Mengedoht's family-- especially her 9-year-old son, Preston, will never be the same. Almost  immediately, expressions of condolences and support poured into the  city. Downtown, the city hall clock shone with a blue light, in honor  of the incredible sacrifice our men and women of law enforcement  undertake each and every day to protect the public. The Louisville  Metro Police Foundation also established a fund in Detective  Mengedoht's name to support her family.   At a funeral service filled with tributes to her character, bravery,  and integrity, the Kentucky State Police volunteered to take over the  shifts of her colleagues so they could attend. More than 3,000 law  enforcement officers traveled from around the Commonwealth and the  Nation to join the LMPD in saluting Detective Mengedoht. Even in the  rain, hundreds of Kentuckians lined the streets to pay their respects.   To Detective Mengedoht's family, including her brothers and sisters  at the LMPD and her parents, her sister, and Preston, I would like to  extend my sincere condolences. Her sacrifice bestows great honor onto  all those who wear the LMPD uniform. During this difficult time, Elaine  and I hope that the memories of Detective Mengedoht's life and her  selfless service can provide much-needed comfort. It is my privilege to  remember Detective Deidre Mengedoht's exemplary service to the people  of Louisville, and I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring  this Kentucky hero.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H.J.
