 Madam Speaker, I have been reminded during these first  days of the 118th Congress of the importance and significance of an  open U.S. Capitol.   I have had a number of guests from my district here with us this past  week as the people's House has finally been reopened to the public.  Yesterday I had Bode Brewer and his family with here with me, the  excitement, awe, and inspiration that I saw in this young man's eyes in  viewing this Capitol, as well as the opportunity he had to meet so many  of my colleagues who play such a significant role in this House, was  truly profound.   Today I am visited by my constituent, Cadet Aidan Carr, whom I  nominated to United States Military Academy West Point and who is in  his third year at the Academy. Not only does Aidan have a clear sense  of honor being here with us, but he is carrying himself with a great  sense of respect, patriotism, and sense of duty for the commitment he  has made to protect this country and this institution.   So as we begin the 118th Congress, I hope we all are reminded of the  responsibility we have in this House to serve the American people in  the greatest country on Earth.                            ____________________
