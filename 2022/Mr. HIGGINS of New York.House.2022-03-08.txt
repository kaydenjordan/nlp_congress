 Mr. Speaker, this week, the House will  consider a bill to provide both humanitarian and military aid to the  people of Ukraine.   We must fortify President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people from an  unprovoked attack on an independent country. We must also protect  ourselves.   Putin has weaponized oil and natural gas export profits, profits that  he stole from the Russian people, parking oil profits throughout the  world in oligarchs.   Right now, the United States imports 22 million barrels of Russian  oil every single month. This is 60 percent of the money that Putin used  to leverage his invasion, and it must stop.   Our country needs long-term energy independence.   There are 211 lithium-ion battery plants in the world. Mr. Speaker,  156 are in China, and just 12 are here in the United States. We need to  get tough on China, but we need to get tougher on ourselves about  China.   Everyone will benefit from an America that is producing electric  vehicles and one that is truly energy independent. It is time to get  serious about this. American jobs and national security are on the  line.                            ____________________
