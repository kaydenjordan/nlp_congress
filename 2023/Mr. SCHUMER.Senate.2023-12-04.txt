 Madam President, last week, America lost a towering  figure of the 20th century: former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day  O'Connor.   Through her life, her work, and her legacy, Justice O'Connor forever  changed the nature of the Supreme Court. She was the first woman to  ever hold the solemn title of ``Justice.''   And with every case she oversaw and every opinion she authored,  Justice O'Connor carried out her historic role with integrity and  distinction. She moved our country forward in so many ways: protecting  women's rights, protecting clean air, protecting voting rights, and  fighting discrimination.   I can't help but reflect on her calm and steady presence on the  Court, even in the most tumultuous of times and in the most divisive of  cases. That presence was so needed during her tenure, and she will be  sorely missed.   Our thoughts are with Justice O'Connor's family and loved ones.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 317.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 30,  H.R. 815.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, December 4, be waived.    Mr. President, to explain to the Senators and our  colleagues what we have just done, a few moments ago, I filed cloture  on a motion to proceed on a shell bill for a national security  supplemental.   The step I am taking tonight will ensure the process for the  supplemental moves forward and that, hopefully, disagreements on  immigration do not prevent us from doing what we must do to protect  America's security.   I urge every single Senator to think where we are at this moment in  history. America's national security is on the line around the world-- in Europe, in the Middle East, and in the Indo-Pacific. Autocrats and  dictators are waging war against democracy, against our values, against  our way of life. That is why passing this supplemental is so important.  It could determine the trajectory of democracy for years to come. We  are at a moment in history.   Tonight, I would like to announce that the administration has invited  President Zelenskyy to address Senators via secure video as part of our  classified briefing tomorrow so we can hear directly from him precisely  what is at stake in this vote. I ask that all Senators--all Senators-- attend this important briefing.   In the coming days, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and  support moving forward on the supplemental package. We can't ever put a  price on defending democracy in its hour of need, because if Ukraine  falls, Putin will keep on going. Autocrats around the world will be  emboldened. Democracy, this grand and noble experiment, will enter an  era of decline. History will render harsh judgment on those who abandon  democracy.   I urge all Senators to work with us to move forward on a national  security supplemental.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of S. 2087 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Lummis substitute  amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to; the bill,  as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 483, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  10 a.m. on Tuesday, December 5; that following the prayer and pledge,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  to resume consideration of the AliKhan nomination; further, that the  cloture motions filed during Thursday's session ripen at 11:30 a.m. and  that the Senate recess following the cloture vote on the AliKhan  nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings;  finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:46 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, December 5, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
