 Madam Speaker, it is gratifying to see that Congress is  becoming serious about restoring our authority over matters of war and  peace. Our oversight responsibilities don't end when the news cycle  changes. I hope that the outcome of this vote today will be another  bipartisan rejection of war with Iran.   But let's be honest. We know that the eventual outcome will be a  Presidential veto. We have been through this already with the Yemen War  Powers Resolution when we passed it last year.   But despite the inevitable veto, it is critically important that we  are here today voting to insist on our constitutional power. Our  Founders understood that these decisions are too important to rest in  the hands of one person.   The decision to assassinate General Soleimani was a reckless and  badly considered decision that made Americans less safe, and it opened  the door to a series of escalating retaliations that makes the world  less safe.   But my vote today is not just about this particular strike or  preventing a particular war. My colleagues on the other side of the  aisle were eager to claim these authorities when there was a Democratic  President in the Oval Office. Had I been in office then, I would have  joined them in demanding congressional authorization for wars in Libya  and Syria. It should not depend on what political power is in the White  House.   We should be consistent in our principles. In my view, this means  maintaining the momentum of this vote and our previous vote to repeal  the 2002 AUMF. It means finally taking up Barbara Lee's bill to repeal  the 2001 AUMF as well.   Madam Speaker, I support this resolution.
