 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  that ensures that States and other eligible entities under the  Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022 can utilize  funds for behavioral health purposes.   These past 2 years have had a devastating effect on the physical and  mental health of people across the Nation, especially those who live in  poverty or in under-resourced areas.   In my district, we have seen hospitals shuttered, families suffer,  and young people facing unprecedented mental health challenges.   By adding explicit language on behavioral health to this bill, we  underscore the heightened need for increased resources to reach those  that are underserved and most at risk.   Thankfully, recipients like my home State of Pennsylvania are already  receiving funding through this grant program to alleviate the causes of  poverty and provide opportunities for employment.   But the community services block grant program must emphasize that in  order for States to truly attack the root causes of poverty, they must  address the rising rate of mental illness and substance abuse  disorders.   Just yesterday, the CDC announced that there were more than 100,000  drug overdoses in 2021, a record high, and a 15 percent increase from  2020. This data shows that something must change.   We all know that for people to participate meaningfully in the  workforce and to achieve self-sufficiency, they need the tools, first  and foremost, to address their physical, mental, and behavioral health.   As a prior businessowner, I understand the importance of this  firsthand, because America thrives when our workers thrive.   Community services block grants have been successful in supporting  those who are most underserved across our communities for decades.   Let's, please, build on this mission and ensure that the program  meets the needs of our diverse 21st century communities and workers.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.
