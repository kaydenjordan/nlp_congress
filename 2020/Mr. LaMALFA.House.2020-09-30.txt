 Madam Speaker, the China Task Force uncovered  reprehensible behavior from the Chinese Communist Party, and it is time  that we hold them accountable.   This body has taken action to condemn the gross state-sponsored  oppression of the Uyghurs and stood strongly in support of freedom and  democracy in Hong Kong.   However, the COVID-19 pandemic spotlighted for the American people  the growing threat the Chinese Communist Party poses.   From the beginning, the CCP has covered up vital medical information,  allowing what could have been a local outbreak in Wuhan to turn into  the global pandemic that decimated our economy, killed almost a million  people worldwide, and weakened the American resolve.   Madam Speaker, I commend the China Task Force for their hard work  making realistic policy recommendations to help the U.S. stand strong  in the face of the growing threat in China.                            ____________________
