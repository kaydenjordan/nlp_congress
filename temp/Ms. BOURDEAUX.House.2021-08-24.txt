 Madam Speaker, Georgia was one of the first States in  the country to pass a voter suppression bill after the 2020 general  election, but S.B. 202 is just our State's latest attempt to  disenfranchise minority communities.   Georgia has a long history of undermining the right to vote, from the  Jim Crow era to recent tactics like voter roll purges and exact match  policies.   It is time for Congress to fix what the Supreme Court broke in their  2013 ruling, which effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act.   When I came to Congress, I vowed to support the John R. Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act, and I am proud to keep that commitment today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4 and protect the  sacred right to vote.
