 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today, the House of Representatives will again vote to approve  legislation that reforms and modernizes the Electronic Communications  Privacy Act or ECPA. Last year, identical legislation passed with  unanimous bipartisan support by a vote of 419-0.   Reforming ECPA has been a top priority for me as chairman of the  Judiciary Committee. I have worked with Members of Congress, advocacy  groups, and law enforcement agencies for years on many complicated  nuances involved in updating this law.   The resulting bill is a carefully negotiated agreement to update the  procedures governing government access to stored communications content  and records.   Thirty years ago, when personal computing was still in its infancy  and few of us had ever heard of something called the world wide web,  Congress enacted ECPA to establish procedures that strike a fair  balance between the privacy expectations of American citizens and the  legitimate needs of law enforcement agencies.   In 1986, mail was sent through the U.S. Postal Service, a search  engine was called a library, and clouds were found only in the sky. In  1986, computer storage was finite and expensive. It was unheard of that  a commercial product would allow users to send and receive electronic  communications around the globe for free and store those communications  for years with a third-party provider.   So much has changed in the last three decades. The technology  explosion of the last three decades has  [[Page H991]]  placed a great deal of information on the internet, in our emails, and  on the cloud. Today, commercial providers, businesses, schools, and  governments of all shapes and sizes provide email and cloud computing  services to customers, students, and employees.                                time  1745    The Email Privacy Act establishes for the first time in Federal  statute a uniform warrant requirement for stored communication content  in criminal investigations, regardless of the type of service provided,  the age of an email, or whether the email has been opened.   The bill preserves the authority for law enforcement agents to serve  the warrant on the provider because, as with any other third-party  custodian, the information sought is stored with them. However, the  bill acknowledges that providers may give notice to their customers  when in receipt of a warrant, court order, or subpoena, unless the  provider is court-ordered to delay such notification.   The bill continues current practice that delineates which remote  computing service providers, or cloud providers, are subject to the  warrant requirement for content in a criminal investigation.   ECPA has traditionally imposed heightened legal process and  procedures to obtain information for which the customer has a  reasonable expectation of privacy, namely, emails, texts, photos,  videos, and documents stored in the cloud. H.R. 387 preserves this  treatment by maintaining in the statute limiting language regarding  remote computing services.   Contrary to practice 30 years ago, today, vast amounts of private,  sensitive information are transmitted and stored electronically. But  this information may also contain evidence of a crime, and law  enforcement agencies are increasingly dependent upon stored  communications content and records in their investigations.   To facilitate timely disclosure of evidence to law enforcement, the  bill authorizes a court to require a date for return of service of the  warrant. In the absence of such a requirement, H.R. 387 requires email  and cloud providers to promptly respond to warrants for communications  content.   Current law makes no distinction between content disclosed to the  public, like an advertisement on a website, versus content disclosed  only to one or a handful of persons, like an email or text message. The  result is that law enforcement could be required to obtain a warrant  even for publicly disclosed content. The bill clarifies that commercial  public content can be obtained with process other than a warrant.   Lastly, H.R. 387 clarifies that nothing in the law limits Congress'  authority to compel a third-party provider to disclose content in  furtherance of its investigative and oversight responsibilities.   Thirty years ago, the extent to which people communicated  electronically was much more limited. Today, however, the ubiquity of  electronic communications requires Congress to ensure that legitimate  expectations of privacy are protected, while respecting the needs of  law enforcement. I am confident that this bill strikes the necessary  balance and does so in a way that continues to promote the development  and use of new technologies and services that reflect how people  communicate with one another today and in the future.   I would like to thank Congressman Yoder and Congressman Polis for  introducing the underlying legislation.   It is my hope that today the House will once again approve this  legislation that embodies the principles of the Fourth Amendment and  reaffirms our commitment to protecting the privacy interests of the  American people without unduly sacrificing public safety. I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this  good legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.
