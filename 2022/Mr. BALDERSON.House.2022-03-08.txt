 Madam Speaker, I thank my neighbor in Pennsylvania for  hosting this Special Order this evening.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of restoring  American energy independence to combat skyrocketing prices at the pump,  which just yesterday soared past all-time highs.   Last month, President Biden pledged to use every tool at our disposal  to limit the effects of rising gas prices on American consumers and  bolster energy supplies to our European allies.   Sadly, this commitment and the actions of this administration remain  grossly misaligned.   Examples of these destructive decisions include: canceling the  Keystone XL pipeline; halting new leases on Federal lands;  greenlighting Russia's Nord Stream 2 project, while weakening our  energy infrastructure here at home; begging OPEC to boost output and  tapping into our Nation's emergency stockpile, all while refusing to  take steps to boost domestic production; and proposing new punitive  taxes and fees on producers.   Recently, the administration signaled its desire to increase imports  from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to offset the ban on Russian energy.  Stopping the flow of energy from one authoritarian regime while opening  the door to others does not strengthen America's energy security.   We must recommit the United States to energy independence. We must  end the war against America's energy producers. And we must protect our  energy infrastructure.   I join my colleagues in calling on the Biden administration to  reverse course on the failed policies that are driving up costs for  consumers, weakening America's energy security, and empowering our  adversaries.
