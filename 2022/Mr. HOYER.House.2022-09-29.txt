 Mr. Speaker, I would indicate to Chair Lofgren that  perhaps we can yield to the ranking member because he would like to  yield me 1 minute, I am sure.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I was the sponsor  of HAVA. Republicans were in charge, and I worked very closely with my  friend Bob Ney on HAVA. It was legislation that was called by The  Washington Post as the greatest reform legislation in 25 years since  the civil rights bill. That may have been some hyperbole, but it was a  good bill.   This bill corrects, essentially, a fault that we made in terms of its  inclusiveness. The bill before us concerns two critical objectives that  have been central to my work here in the House.   The first is ensuring that those with disabilities have equal access  to the same opportunities as their fellow Americans. On July 26, we  celebrated the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act signed by  President George H.W. Bush, a very bipartisan piece of legislation that  has made a historical difference.   The second is ensuring that all eligible voters in America have  access to the ballot box and can make their voices heard in our  democracy. That is, after all what our democracy is about.   The PAVA Program Inclusion Act helps accomplish both of those goals,  and that is why I am proud to bring it to the floor today.   Specifically, this bill would improve access to the ballot for  Americans with disabilities who live in the Northern Mariana Islands-- clearly, we want those included--and our Native American Tribal lands  in the Four Corners region of the southwest, which we also expected we  had done.   This bill expands key programs first laid out in the Help America  Vote Act, also known as HAVA, that provided funding to regional  protection and advocacy systems to assist people with disabilities in  the voting process.   Although HAVA intended to provide funding for this important purpose  to all protection and advocacy systems across the country, a technical  oversight, as has been mentioned, led to the exclusion of these two  regions. Today's legislation would correct that error and help us  realize HAVA's original vision.   I was proud to serve as the principal House sponsor, as I said, of  HAVA back in 2002 along with Bob Ney, who was the Republican chair of  the House Administration Committee and a very good friend of mine. We  are prepared to celebrate its 20th anniversary later this month. I am  glad to see that the groundbreaking law continues to evolve and be  strengthened by Congress.   HAVA was based on the principle that the integrity of our democracy  depends on the accessibility and accuracy of our electoral system. I  brought together a bipartisan coalition to enact that legislation in  order to establish a number of commonsense policies that make voting  easier and more secure, from reliable voting equipment to expanded  provisional ballot access, HAVA and the bipartisan Election Assistance  Commission--which I strongly support, and I am glad to see that we are  investing in--make our Federal participation more broad and more  effective.   Today's bill reminds us, however, that HAVA must continue to adapt to  new needs and challenges. I very much appreciate the efforts of Chair  Zoe Lofgren, the gentlewoman from California, who has worked so hard on  voting rights issues as head of the House Administration Committee, and  I thank the ranking member Mr. Davis, as well. I thank Senator Lujan,  our former House colleague, for authoring this bill and advancing it  through the Senate.   We must do everything in our power to ensure that people with  disabilities, especially those from historically marginalized groups  such as Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, can participate equally  and fully in our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I ask all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

Combating the Persecution of Religious Groups in China Act                                 H.R. 4821         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combating the Persecution of       Religious Groups in China Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) According to the Department of State's International       Religious Freedom (IRF) report estimates, Buddhists comprise       18.2 percent of the country's total population, Christians,       5.1 percent, Muslims, 1.8 percent, followers of folk       religions, 21.9 percent, and atheists or unaffiliated       persons, 52.2 percent, with Hindus, Jews, and Taoists       comprising less than one percent.        (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)       recognizes five official religions, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam,       Protestantism, and Catholicism (according to the State       Department's IRF report) and only religious groups belonging       to one of the five sanctioned ``patriotic religious       associations'' representing these religions are permitted to       register with the government and hold worship service,       excluding all other faiths and denying the ability to worship       without being registered with the government.        (3) The activities of state-sanctioned religious       organizations are regulated by the Chinese Communist Party,       which manages all aspects of religious life.        (4) The Chinese Communist Party is actively seeking to       control, govern, and manipulate all aspects of faith through       the ``Sinicization of Religion'', a process intended to shape       religious traditions and doctrines so they conform with the       objectives of the Chinese Communist Party.        (5) On February 1, 2018, the PRC Government implemented new       religious regulations that imposed restrictions on Chinese       contacts with overseas religious organizations, required       government approval for religious schools, websites, and any       online religious service, and effectively banned unauthorized       religious gatherings and teachings.        (6) There are numerous reports that authorities forced       closures of Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, and Taoist houses       of worship and destroyed public displays of religious symbols       throughout the country.        (7) Authorities arrested and detained religious leaders       trying to hold services online.        (8) There are credible reports of Chinese authorities       raiding house churches and other places of religious worship,       removing and confiscating religious paraphernalia, installing       surveillance cameras on religious property, pressuring       congregations to sing songs of the Chinese Communist Party       and display the national flag during worship, forcing       churches to replace images of Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary       with pictures of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and banning       children and students from attending religious services.        (9) It has been reported that the PRC is rewriting and will       issue a version of the Bible with the ``correct       understanding'' of the text according to the Chinese       Communist Party. Authorities continued to restrict the       printing and distribution of the Bible, Quran, and other       religious literature, and penalized publishing and copying       businesses that handled religious materials.        (10) According to the Department of State's IRF reports,       the PRC Government has imprisoned thousands of individuals of       all faiths for practicing their religious beliefs and often       labels them as ``cults''.        (11) The Political Prisoner Database maintained by the       human rights NGO Dui Hua Foundation counted 3,492 individuals       imprisoned for ``organizing or using a `cult' to undermine       implementation of the law.'' Prisoners include--        (A) the 11th Panchen Lama, Gedun Choekyi Nyima, who has       been held captive along with his parents since May 17, 1995;        (B) Pastor Zhang Shaojie, a Three-Self church pastor from       Nanle County in central Henan was sentenced in July 2014 to       12 years in prison for ``gathering a crowd to disrupt the       public order'';        (C) Pastor John Cao, a United States permanent resident       from Greensboro, North Carolina, who was sentenced for 7       years in prison in March 2018 under contrived charges of       organizing illegal border crossings; and        (D) Pastor Wang Yi of the Early Rain Covenant Church who       was arrested and sentenced to 9 years in prison for       ``inciting to subvert state power'' and ``illegal business       operations''.        (12) Authorities continue to detain Falun Gong       practitioners and subject them to harsh and inhumane       treatment.        (13) Since 1999, the Department of State has designated the       PRC as a country of particular concern under the       International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.        (14) The National Security Strategy of the United States,       issued in 2017, 2015, 2006, 2002, 1999, 1998, and 1997,       committed the United States to promoting international       religious freedom to advance the security, economic, and       other national interests of the United States.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         (a) Holding PRC Officials Responsible for Religious Freedom       Abuses Targeting Chinese Christians or Other Religious       Minorities.--It is the policy of the United States to       consider senior officials of the Government of the People's       Republic of China (PRC) who are responsible for or have       directly carried out, at any time, persecution of Christians       or other religious minorities in the PRC to have committed--        (1) a gross violation of internationally recognized human       rights for purposes of imposing sanctions with respect to       such officials under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 2656 note); and        (2) a particularly severe violation of religious freedom       for purposes of applying section 212(a)(2)(G) of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)) with       respect to such officials.        (b) Department of State Programming to Promote Religious       Freedom in the People's Republic of China.--The Ambassador-      at-Large for International Religious Freedom should support       efforts to protect and promote international religious       freedom in the PRC and for programs to protect Christians and       other religious minorities in the PRC.        (c) Designation of the People's Republic of China as a       Country of Particular Concern.--It is the policy of the       United States to continue to designate the PRC as a ``country       of particular concern'', as long as the PRC continues to       engage in systematic and egregious religious freedom       violations, as defined by the International Religious Freedom       Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292).       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the United States should       promote religious freedom in the PRC by--        (1) strengthening religious freedom diplomacy on behalf of       Christians and other religious minorities facing restrictions       in the PRC;        (2) raising cases relating to religious or political       prisoners at the highest levels with PRC officials because       experience demonstrates that consistently raising prisoner       cases can result in improved treatment, reduced sentences, or       in some cases, release from custody, detention, or       imprisonment;        (3) encouraging Members of Congress to ``adopt'' a prisoner       of conscience in the PRC  [[Page H8282]]       through the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission's ``Defending       Freedom Project'', raise the case with PRC officials, and       work publicly for their release;        (4) calling on the PRC Government to unconditionally       release religious and political prisoners or, at the very       least, ensure that detainees are treated humanely with access       to family, the lawyer of their choice, independent medical       care, and the ability to practice their faith while in       detention;        (5) encouraging the global faith community to speak in       solidarity with the persecuted religious groups in the PRC;       and        (6) hosting, once every two years, the Ministerial to       Advance Religious Freedom organized by the Department of       State in order to bring together leaders from around the       world to discuss the challenges facing religious freedom,       identify means to address religious persecution and       discrimination worldwide, and promote great respect for and       preservation of religious liberty.

(3) The Federal Government, across multiple presidential       administrations and Congresses, has continued to support the       ability of agencies to move to the cloud, including through--        (A) President Barack Obama's ``Cloud First Strategy'';        (B) President Donald Trump's ``Cloud Smart Strategy'';        (C) the prioritization of cloud security in Executive Order       14028 (86 Fed. Reg. 26633; relating to improving the nation's       cybersecurity), which was issued by President Joe Biden; and        (D) more than a decade of appropriations and authorization       legislation that provides agencies with relevant authorities       and appropriations to modernize on-premises information       technology systems and more readily adopt cloud computing       products and services.        (4) Since it was created in 2011, the Federal Risk and       Authorization Management Program (referred to in this section       as ``FedRAMP'') at the General Services Administration has       made steady and sustained improvements in supporting the       secure authorization and reuse of cloud computing products       and services within the Federal Government, including by       reducing the costs and burdens on both agencies and cloud       companies to quickly and securely enter the Federal market.        (5) According to data from the General Services       Administration, as of the end of fiscal year 2021, there were       239 cloud providers with FedRAMP authorizations, and those       authorizations had been reused more than 2,700 times across       various agencies.        (6) Providing a legislative framework for FedRAMP and new       authorities to the General Services Administration, the       Office of Management and Budget, and Federal agencies will--        (A) improve the speed at which new cloud computing products       and services can be securely authorized;        (B) enhance the ability of agencies to effectively evaluate       FedRAMP authorized providers for reuse;        (C) reduce the costs and burdens to cloud providers seeking       a FedRAMP authorization; and        (D) provide for more robust transparency and dialogue       between industry and the Federal Government to drive stronger       adoption of secure cloud capabilities, create jobs, and       reduce wasteful legacy information technology.
