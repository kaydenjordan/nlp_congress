 Mr. Speaker, the United States has adopted an aggressive,  proactive approach of gathering intelligence on our enemies and  removing those individuals who seek to cause us harm in order to save  American lives.   President Trump did just that. On January 3, our military, acting  under the direction of our Commander in Chief, killed Iranian General  Soleimani to protect the lives of Americans and to end his reign of  terror in the Middle East.   The actions of our President and our military have damaged Iran's  ability to sow unrest in the Middle East, and we have no doubt saved  countless lives by removing a terrorist who intended to harm our  Nation.   We must continue to support our troops serving abroad, and we must  remain vigilant in our fight against terror and our ongoing efforts to  bring lasting peace to the Middle East.                            ____________________
