 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.   President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is  unjustified and, I believe, dangerous. It abdicates U.S. leadership on  climate action and puts the health and safety of our communities at  great risk. It also jeopardizes our national and economic security.   We can't live in the past. China, the EU, and others are moving  towards a low-carbon economy, building solar panels, wind turbines, and  cornering the market on renewable industries.   We can and should be a leader in that transition so that our  industries, our workers, and our communities benefit from the new  opportunities created.   The United States has always been at the forefront in the creation of  new technologies and new jobs; but, rather than leading right now,  President Trump and his administration are simply sticking their heads  in the sand, acting like this is the 19th century.   We have to be future oriented, not live in the past, or we will  simply be left behind.   The President is actually making the climate crisis worse. The Trump  administration gutted regulations to control methane pollution from the  oil and gas sector, rolled back stronger fuel efficiency standards for  vehicles, and illegally blocked improved appliance efficiency  standards.   These actions led to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions last year.   Now, back in my district, I want you to understand, this is not a  partisan issue. Everyone sees the harm climate change is doing to our  shoreline, our oceans, and the health and well-being of our residents.   States and local governments are taking action on climate change.  They are concerned about the health of their constituents, asthmatics  who are negatively impacted by dirty air, cancers that are aggravated  by increased toxicity.   I have a lot of Republican mayors and county and State legislators,  and I don't know one of those Republican mayors or elected officials  who thinks that the Federal Government should withdraw from climate  action.   It is the cost of inaction that is really painful. We have all seen  them. In 2017, the United States experienced 16 natural disasters with  costs totaling $360 billion. Superstorm Sandy hit my district very  hard.   But I want to say that we still have time to avoid a deeper climate  crisis, while strengthening and modernizing our economy at the same  time, and H.R. 9 is an important step in that regard.   So--please--I call on my colleagues, I beg my colleagues, let's take  this opportunity to prevent the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement  and, at the same time, call upon this administration to come up with  ways of achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee,    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), another member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko), who is the chairman of our Environment and  Climate Change Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, can I inquire about how much time remains  on both sides?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).                                time  1615     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I have listened to my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle, particularly the last two speakers, and it just seems that  they are trying to invent something that doesn't exist.   They talk about jobs. They talk about innovation. They talk about the  freedom to let people do what they want, but what is really happening  here is the Trump administration is actually trying to force the old  ways, saying, well, okay, maybe coal is not as competitive as it used  to be, but we will find a way to make it competitive. We will find a  way to say that fossil fuels have a future where they can be used even  more so.   Government policy has to lead innovation. That is what it is all  about. What we are seeing is that our competitors like China, for  example, realize that renewables are the future. They realize that the  fossil fuels and continued use of coal, for example, are actually  polluting the environment, so they are taking the lead and they are  creating innovative technologies, and they are creating the jobs that  go along with it.   A few years ago, if I can use my home State of New Jersey, when  Governor Christie was first elected, a Republican Governor in New  Jersey, he started out by saying that he was going to have wind  turbines built in New Jersey. He was going to have us manufacture solar  panels. He was going to have us be the renewable center for the  country. Then, very quickly after that, when he decided to run for  President, he dropped all that and actually pulled out of RGGI, our  regional agreement.   And what happens? The other States or the other countries, they start  developing these new technologies, and they then corner the market on  things like wind turbines or solar panels. More and more of those are  being manufactured in China and then shipped over here. So we lose the  competitive edge that we would have had through innovation that is  essentially driven by good government policy. Then what happens is we  lose the jobs and our economy falls behind.   You know, the same thing is true with climate disasters. My district  was more impacted by Superstorm Sandy than any other district in the  country. What happens? You know, we lose jobs. Our tourism economy was  destroyed in the summer because there was so much damage and  destruction. People lost their jobs; they had to look elsewhere; their  income was reduced.    So this notion that somehow if you do nothing or if you withdraw from  international agreements because of your fear of the future, that this  is going to help you, help your economy, help your jobs, it is not  true. It is, in fact, just the opposite.   I don't want our country to fall behind. I don't want us to look  towards 19th century solutions while other countries are looking  towards 21st century innovations. We can't be like an ostrich where we  just put our head in the sand and we assume that everything is going to  be the same in the future. That is simply not the case.   I don't care whether it is the European Union. I don't care whether  it is Japan, China, or India. They understand where the future is. They  understand that these new technologies have to be fostered at the  Federal level, the same way they are being fostered at the State and  the local level.   So let us not kid ourselves and think that somehow actions in  Washington don't make a difference. They do. One of the purposes of  government is trying to find ways to innovate and create jobs for the  future and not rely on the past, and that is all we are saying.   So we have to send a message with H.R. 9: Withdrawal from the Paris  Agreement is not good for this country; it is not good for our jobs; it  is not good for our economy.   Please support this bill. Let us be on the right path again.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I just want to say, on behalf of the Energy  and Commerce Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, we support  this amendment. It is a good amendment.   Mr. Chair, I also want to thank Mr. Espaillat for working with the  committees to make changes to his amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I just want to say, on behalf of the  Energy and Commerce Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, that  we support this amendment. It is an excellent amendment.   I want to thank Ms. Kuster for working with the committees to make  some changes to her amendment.    Mr. Chair, I represent a coastal district, so the threat  of worsening sea level rise is especially important to me, so I am glad  my colleague from Florida offered this amendment.   It is a good amendment and speaking on behalf of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, we support its  adoption.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ms. Jackson Lee, I speak  in support of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself,  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congressman Moulton of Massachusetts,  and Congresswoman Hayes of Connecticut, and I express my appreciation  to them for their assistance and support.   This amendment improves the bill by adding a finding which emphasizes  the importance of international cooperation and multilateralism in  responding to the global challenges facing the international community.   Mr. Chair, the Paris climate accord was an example of the  international leadership commitment and resolve that defeated fascism,  created NATO, the European Union, the Marshall Plan, the World Bank,  the International Monetary Fund, and most importantly, preserved peace  and freedom for the last 75 years.   Collective international action is also needed to combat growing  international challenges such as terrorism, human trafficking, and  black-market sales of illegal weapons, drugs, and tobacco.   No one country can solve these problems on its own, and this  amendment emphasizes the importance of collective international action.   The landmark Paris climate accord was established to combat climate  change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments  needed for a sustainable, low-carbon future. This also brings all  Nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat  climate change and adapt to its effects with enhanced support to assist  developing countries to do so.   In these efforts, we promote the importance of continued  international cooperation that has sustained the global community  through epidemics, famines, and natural disasters.   Mr. Chairman, a collection of rational actors acting in a selfless  manner to achieve a rational result, such as this, requires leadership  and systematic reasoning. Without this type of collective action and  selfless resolve, we leave ourselves vulnerable to a tragedy of the  commons.   When countries act solely in their own best interests without regard  to combating international threats, everyone suffers. That is why a  great person and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton so  eloquently said, ``We are stronger together.''   The Jackson Lee-Moulton-Hayes amendment reflects this important  insight by Mrs. Clinton, and I urge support of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), who is a member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, we have heard this argument over and over again. The  Republicans said the same thing in the markup before the Energy and  Commerce Committee, but these Republican arguments are not going to  change the facts.   The fact is the Paris Agreement itself is not a treaty. It is an  agreement under an existing treaty, and that is the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change, that is UNFCCC, pronounced UNF  triple C, and that was signed by President George H.W. Bush and  approved by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate in 1992.   There is no requirement for the Senate to approve subsidiary  agreements around already approved treaties.   In fact, the vast majority of international agreements to which the  United States is a party are not treaties. According to the  Congressional Research Service, more than 90 percent of international  legal agreements which the United States supports are agreements that  do not require Senate ratification.   Now, President Obama did not have to submit the Paris Agreement to  the Senate for ratification for two reasons: first, because the  emissions targets are not legally binding; and, second, because the  legally binding commitments, which are almost entirely procedural,  generally either elaborate or repeat obligations under the UNFCCC.   It is also not true that an agreement with any legally binding  provisions must be ratified by the Senate. There are many ways in which  the United States can enter into international agreements with legally  binding commitments.   As I previously mentioned, the vast majority of international  agreements the United States enters into are not approved by the  Senate. Using examples of that, we have the U.S.-Canada Air Quality  Agreement, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Convention on  Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.   Arguments that the GOP are using, that the Paris Agreement needs to  be ratified are disingenuous. They are, frankly, trying to avoid  climate action at all costs. I really find it unfortunate that rather  than arguing on the merits, that they use these arguments about  ratification that are simply disingenuous.   For those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to join me in voting against it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to Mr. Gosar's amendment, which would gut the  heart of the bill, the section that prevents the President from  withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.   Now, the Paris Agreement sets a strong foundation for action that  will accelerate the shift to a clean energy economy and put us on the  path to a safer, healthier planet for generations to come. It is the  most ambitious climate change agreement in history and builds upon the  unprecedented participation of roughly 200 parties to the convention,  including India and China, something that my Republican colleagues have  wanted for many years.   It provides a framework for reducing U.S. carbon pollution, while  also growing our economy. More energy-efficient appliances, buildings,  and vehicles will result in lower energy costs for consumers, all while  lowering emissions of harmful air pollutants and keeping our  manufacturing industries competitive in this global transition towards  low carbon practices.   So, first and foremost, what H.R. 9 is doing is stopping President  Trump's reckless withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the very  agreement our country was instrumental in negotiating. But this move  has real diplomatic consequences, further diminishing  America's credibility around the world.    Let me be clear, the Paris Agreement will still stand with or without  the United States; but not meeting our commitments doesn't hurt the  Paris Agreement, it just hurts the United States diplomatically and  economically. Other countries, not to mention U.S. cities and States,  are still moving forward on climate action, making the Trump  administration only appear more isolated and irrelevant as the world  moves past us.   But beyond the diplomatic consequences around the world a decision to  withdraw from the Paris Agreement hurts Americans at home.   The U.S. is in the midst of a major transition to clean energy. As  consumers demand access to cleaner energy and cleaner air, prices for  renewables are falling across the board. With market forces  increasingly favoring renewables, dirty energy is no longer a smart  investment.   Ceding the leadership role on the global stage means losing economic  opportunities in a global clean energy economy, hurting American  workers and businesses. China, India and other countries will lead if  America does not.   Leaving the Paris Agreement is just another bad Trump deal for the  United States. H.R. 9 is trying to prevent this bad Trump deal from  becoming our reality. The Gosar amendment would all but guarantee that  the United States feels the full weight of the economic and diplomatic  consequences of abandoning our friends and allies.   This amendment ensures we lose the clean energy development race to  China or India.   This amendment locks the United States and the world into a future of  catastrophic warming that puts all of our lives and livelihoods at  risk.   I said this earlier when we spoke on the bill: We cannot look  backwards. We can't look back into the 19th century. We have to look  forward, with new innovation, with an economy that creates more jobs.   Don't let us fall behind the rest of the world and not lead on such  an important issue. It is a huge mistake. That is why we are saying in  H.R. 9, in this bill, that the President should not be allowed to  withdraw and should put together a plan that leads us forward toward a  clean economy and meeting the Paris goals.   So, I oppose the Gosar amendment. I urge my colleagues to join me in  voting against it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Let me explain. I am only claiming the time in  opposition. I actually support the gentleman's amendment.   In the interest of increasing transparency and public participation  in the development of the President's climate plan, I believe that Mr.  Bost's amendment actually is a good one.   Speaking on behalf of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the  Foreign Affairs Committee, we support its adoption and would accept the  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments,  and I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, I yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Madam Chair, I would inquire if the gentlewoman has any  additional speakers.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, how much time do I  have remaining?    Madam Chair, because I have the right to close, I  reserve the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, let me say, this is a good amendment, and speaking on  behalf of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Foreign Affairs  Committee, we support its adoption.   Madam Chair, I thank Miss Gonzalez-Colon for working with the  committees to make changes to her amendment. It has already been  mentioned by my colleague, Mr. Shimkus, that she was our gracious host  when we went to Puerto Rico and also to the Virgin Islands in the  aftermath of Hurricane Maria, where we saw the devastation of the  hurricane.   Of course, part of the reason why we as Democrats support the Paris  Agreement is that we are very concerned about these severe and more  severe weather conditions that are occurring because of climate change.   Madam Chair, this is a good amendment, and I would urge my colleagues  to support it. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Pappas) having assumed the chair, Ms. Norton, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 9) to  direct the President to develop a plan for the United States to meet  its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
