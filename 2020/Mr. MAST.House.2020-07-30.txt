 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of my colleague. I rise in  support of my colleague, Mr. Posey's amendment, specifically because  what is going on with Virgin Trains and Brightline, it affects my  community as well.   This project, it goes through some very dense communities with very  little room between it and the people who live there. Hundreds of the  crossings that we have that go through our community, nearly all of  them, are at grade, directly encountering the traffic that they travel  so close to. There are several schools in close proximity to the rail  tracks, often placing children in significant danger of this project.   This amendment, which I am very proud to cosponsor, would divert $2  million from the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan  program for a study on pedestrian safety related to this project--very  worthy cause.   This is a commonsense, public safety provision that will help to keep  children and people in our community safe.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.
