 Mr. President, this week, May 15-21, 2023, marks U.N.  Global Road Safety Week, with a focus this year on sustainable  transport. As governments look to tackle the issues of climate change,  some of the answers lie in making it easier for people to walk, cycle,  and use public transport as a way to navigate our cities, but in order  to do that, we need to prioritize making these options safer. I  recognize the tremendous contributions of our partner organizations in  this global effort, including the Association for Safe International  Road Travel ASIRT.   More than 1 million people die from road crashes every year, and tens  of millions are seriously injured. Road traffic crashes are leading  cause of death among young people between the ages of 15 and 29 and the  eighth among all people worldwide. It is time to draw attention to the  need for improved legislation, awareness, infrastructure, and  technology to save more families from the tragedy of losing a loved  one.   On this seventh anniversary of U.N. Global Road Safety Week, it is  critical to recommit to the goals of raising awareness about road  safety and the importance of taking steps to end these preventable  deaths. The World Health Organization, in collaboration with partners  including governments, NGOs, businesses, and individuals, organizes  periodic U.N. Global Safety Weeks. It was initiated in 2007 and, as of  2019, has become an annual event.   In September 2020, the U.N. General Assembly announced the ambitious  goal of halving road deaths within 10 years through the adoption of the  resolution ``Improving global road safety,'' proclaiming the Decade of  Action for Road Safety from 2021-2030. The Global Plan for the Decade  of Action provides a roadmap for achieving these goals through  improving the design of roads and vehicles, enhancing laws and  enforcement of road safety measures, and providing timely and  lifesaving emergency care for those injured. Using these policies can  help promote walking, cycling, and public transit. Additionally, the  U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 3.6 calls on governments and their  stakeholders, including NGOs and private citizens, to address the  personal, medical, and financial burdens associated with road traffic  deaths and injuries.   We must improve the safety of our roads for all who wish to use them,  be it for walking, cycling, or driving. As we continue to shift towards  more sustainable modes of transit, it is imperative that our laws  enable us to curb dangerous behaviors and keep people safe. It is our  responsibility to protect our citizens through designing road networks  with the most at-risk in mind, and doing the utmost to prevent untimely  death or injury due to crashes.                            ____________________
