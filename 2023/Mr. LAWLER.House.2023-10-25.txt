 Mr. Speaker, women, children, babies slaughtered. The  worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Israel has a right to  exist, a right to defend itself. We have Members in this body that do  not believe that. We have Members in this body that cannot muster the  courage or the strength to condemn the slaughtering of babies but have  the audacity to repeat a vile and disgusting lie that Israel bombed a  hospital.   They are not worthy of serving in this body, and the fact that we  have people that didn't even sign on to this resolution tells you  everything you need to know. If you cannot stand with Israel, our  greatest ally in the Middle East, a beacon of democracy and hope and  freedom, you do not belong in this body. Those Members should resign in  disgrace.
