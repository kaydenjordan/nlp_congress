 Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege and a  personal blessing to recognize my friend and today's guest chaplain,  Dr. Tom Leuther, and to welcome him to the United States House of  Representatives.   Dr. Leuther is the pastor and founder of the Family Worship Center,  alongside his wife, Vicki, in Columbia, Missouri. Together, they  minister hope to hundreds of families and provide a Christ-centered  education to children from kindergarten through eighth grade at the  Family Worship Center Academy, which they established in 1997.   Pastor Leuther has been a leader throughout his life, attaining his  Eagle Scout badge in 1973 and his doctorate of pastoral theology in  2010. He is well respected in the community and is a sought-after  speaker nationwide.   I have been blessed to get to know Dr. Leuther and Vicki over the  past several years. They are truly a special couple. I appreciate their  love of the  [[Page H3686]]  Lord, love of the families in their community, and love of our country.   I am thankful that Pastor Leuther could be with us today, and I know  that the Lord will bless us as a result of his prayer. May the Lord  continue to bless this caring leader and the entire congregation at the  Family Worship Center.                            ____________________
