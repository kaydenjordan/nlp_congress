 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill's purpose is to  award a Congressional Gold Medal to the United States Army Dustoff  crews of the Vietnam War, collectively, in recognition of their  extraordinary heroism and life-saving actions in Vietnam.                                  S. 2738         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Dustoff Crews of the Vietnam       War Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds that--        (1) a United States Army Dustoff crewman (pilot, crew       chief, and medic) is a helicopter crew member who served       honorably during the Vietnam War aboard helicopter air       ambulances, which were both non-division and division assets       under the radio call signs ``Dustoff'' and ``Medevac'';        (2) Dustoff crews performed aeromedical evacuation for       United States, Vietnamese, and allied forces in Southeast       Asia from May 1962 through March 1973;        (3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army       began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years       later, during the Korean War, these helicopter air ambulances       were responsible for transporting 17,700 United States       casualties;        (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air       ambulances, United States Army Dustoff crews pioneered the       concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and       transported almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese,       and other allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy       forces;        (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist       those injured on the battlefield;        (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dustoff crews were able to       operate the helicopters and land them on almost any terrain       in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which the       Dustoff crews could provide care to these patients while       transporting them to ready medical facilities;        (7) the vital work of the Dustoff crews required consistent       combat exposure and often proved to be the difference between       life and death for wounded personnel;        (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life-      saving system was cultivated and refined by United States       Army Dustoff crews during 11 years of intense conflict in and       above the jungles of Southeast Asia;        (9) innovative and resourceful Dustoff crews in Vietnam       were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter       medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and       revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously       unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an       operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour'';        (10) some Dustoff units in Vietnam operated so efficiently       that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical       facility on an average of 50 minutes from the receipt of the       mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in       Vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day Dustoff       crews;        (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dustoff       crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being       wounded or killed;        (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night,       and members of the Dustoff crews often found themselves       searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad       weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the       target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the       wounded, which caused Dustoff crews to suffer a rate of       aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other       types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam;        (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant       heroism displayed by Dustoff crews in Vietnam, over the span       of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40       soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644       missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours;        (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical       Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of       Honor, 1 Distinguished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals,       26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for       valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier's Medals, and 26       Purple Heart Medals;        (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a       daily basis and set the standard for all Dustoff crews in       Vietnam;        (16) 6 members of the 54th Medical Detachment are in the       Dustoff Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of       Fame, and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the       National Aviation Hall of Fame;        (17) Dustoff crew members are among the most highly       decorated soldiers in American military history;        (18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was the       Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter       Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam;        (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dustoff call sign into       history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard over       the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire       situations;        (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action as he       gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American       soldier and several Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied,       after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to       the ferocity of enemy fire, ``When I have your wounded.'';        (21) General William Westmoreland, Commander, Military       Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964-1968), singled out Major       Kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit''       and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in       combat;        (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland's successor       (1968-1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States       Army, highlighted the heroism of Dustoff crews, ``A special       word about the Dustoffs . . . Courage above and beyond the       call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily       thing, part of the way they lived. That's the great part, and       it meant so much to every last man who served there. Whether       he ever got hurt or not, he knew Dustoff was there.'';        (23) Dustoff crews possessed unique skills and traits that       made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in       Vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary       aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level       medical expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the       preservation of human life;        (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the       ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield       prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dustoff       crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was       instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and       morale;        (25) military families in the United States knew that their       loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care       in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dustoff       crews;        (26) the willingness of Dustoff crews to also risk their       lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably       positive impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified       the finest American ideals of compassion and humanity; and        (27) Dustoff crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every       State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic,       religious, and cultural backgrounds.
