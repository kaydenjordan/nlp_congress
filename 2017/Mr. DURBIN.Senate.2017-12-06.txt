 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 16 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act.  The idea behind the legislation was that if you were brought here to  America as a child by your parents, you are undocumented, you grew up  in this country, you don't have a serious criminal record, and you have  completed school, you deserve a chance to earn your way into legal  status into America. You had nothing to say about the decision of your  family to come here. You have grown up in this country. If you want to  be a part of our future, you should be given a chance. It was a pretty  basic idea. It has been debated for a long time.   President Barack Obama stepped up and said: Since we haven't passed  that law, I will create something called DACA, or Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals.   Under that Executive order, the people I just described can be  protected  [[Page S7876]]  from being deported for 2 years at a time. They have to go through a  criminal background check, they have to pay a $500 fee, and they get  the temporary ability to live in the United States without fear of  being deported and to work in this country.   Well, 780,000 young people came forward and signed up and went on  with their lives--going to school, getting jobs, becoming part of  America. DACA-eligible people joined our military. They weren't  American citizens, but 900 of them joined our military, willing to  sacrifice their lives in defense of a country which doesn't legally  recognize them as lawful immigrants. Some 20,000 of them became  teachers in schools all across the United States. Most of them are  students, who are working because they can't qualify for Federal  assistance to go to school, and there are some amazing stories.   So there they were kind of in limbo--half here, half not here-- uncertain about their future, but with the protection of that Executive  order. President Trump came in and said: It is over. As of September 5,  he ended this DACA protection--saying, prospectively, that the final  day for it is March 5, 2018--for 780,000 people. The President then  said to Congress: Now, do something. Pass a law. Take care of these  people.   Well, 3 months have passed and we have done nothing--nothing. In  fact, we have done little or nothing on the floor of the Senate for the  last several months. We haven't done this, and it is still unresolved  as to whether or not they are going to have a chance to be a part of  America's future or for young people like them to have a similar  chance--unresolved.   We have to do something about that and we have to do it soon because  every day 120 of these young people lose their protection under DACA.  That is almost 1,000 a week. So far, 10,000 of them have fallen out of  protection under DACA.   What does it mean under practical terms? First, it is the fear of  being deported. You are no longer protected. You are undocumented in  America. You can be deported: A knock on the door, and you are gone.   Do these young people know that? Of course they do. I see them every  weekend. I sit down with them. They are emotionally distraught over the  possibility of their lives ending as they know it--being deported to  countries they have never been to before, facing languages they don't  know.   Think about that possibility. You are 18 or 19 years old, and now you  are being deported back to Bolivia, where you have never been. You may  not speak Spanish very well, but now you are going to be tossed back  into Bolivia where you came from.   So now the question is this: What will we do about this? Will  Congress act or wait?   Some voices on the floor of the Senate have said: Well, let's try to  get around to this next year. Well, you certainly can't look at the  floor of the Senate today, or virtually any day, and say we are so  swamped with work we just can't take this up. Of course we can, and we  should.   I want to salute my Republican colleagues, a number of whom have  stepped up and said: Let's sit down and work this out once and for all.  These young people deserve a chance. Let's give them that chance. Their  stories are nothing short of inspiring.   This is Yuriana Aguilar. Yuriana Aguilar was 5 years old when her  family brought her here from Mexico. She grew up near Fresno, CA, where  she was quite a good student. She was in the top 1 percent of her high  school class and graduated as valedictorian. She was involved in a lot  of activities, was a member of the high school Junior ROTC Program,  volunteered at retirement homes, and, with a group called Tree Fresno,  planted trees in her community.   She first learned about her immigration status when she was a senior  in high school. She thought she was OK. She learned she was wrong. She  tried to apply for financial aid, and they said: You are not  documented. You are not legally in America. She came here at the age of  5, and she learned about it much later in life.   She didn't give up. She just said: This can't be the end of my story.  She was accepted at the University of California, Merced. She majored  in biological science, made the dean's list every semester, and was on  the chancellor's honor list.   She conducted research in marine biology, as well as in  atherosclerosis. Excuse me, Yuriana, if I messed that up; I am a  liberal arts lawyer. It looks like that. It is the question of the  buildup of fat, cholesterol, and other substances in arteries. She  continued her community service, volunteered for the Boys and Girls  Club, for a local hospital, and with the church's Sunday school  program.   After she graduated, she couldn't pursue her dream of becoming a  scientist because she was undocumented, but she didn't give up. She  said: This can't be it. So she volunteered at a research lab, where she  wasn't going to get paid but where she was able to continue studying  and learning.   Then, President Obama created DACA, the Executive order I referred  to, in 2012. Because of that, she was allowed to apply to the  University of California, Merced, for the Ph.D. program in quantitative  and systems biology. Her research focused on sudden cardiac death, the  leading cause of natural death in the United States.   Last year, Yuriana became the first undocumented person at the  University of California, Merced, to receive a Ph.D. Listen to what the  dean of the School of Natural Sciences said:         Yuriana's work is stunning, and it will have significant       impact on our knowledge of the workings of the heart at the       cellular level. The potential benefit of her research in       cardiac care is enormous.    She is now a postdoctoral fellow and instructor at Rush University  Medical Center in Chicago, a city I am honored to represent. I was just  with her last week. This is a picture of her in her lab.   She continues her research on heart health, thanks to DACA, but it is  coming to an end. President Trump has ended the program that allows her  to stay and study in the United States of America.   She is not going to give up, she says. She wants to bring her medical  knowledge and expertise back to the Central Valley in California, where  she grew up. During her childhood, she saw how people's financial  situations often determined their healthcare. She wants to establish a  research-based hospital to make sure that the same top quality  healthcare is available even for lower income families.   She sent me a letter. She told me about the day that DACA was  announced. She was in a research lab doing what she loves to do. She  had a human heart in her hand that was beating with an artificial valve  outside the body, and when she saw the news, she cried. She said: ``I'm  finally out of the shadows.''    So can she wait? Should she leave? Those are the basic questions we  face. Should we do something now? Should we roll up our sleeves,  Democrats and Republicans, and solve this problem? Should there be any  doubt that we want Yuriana to stay in the United States and continue  this amazing research?   Of course, we do. Here we are, trying to attract foreigners to come  study in the United States on the mere chance that they will turn out  to be as productive as this young lady with her Ph.D. is going to be.  She made it through American schools. She beat the odds when it came to  college and graduate degrees, without her having the help of government  loans. She is a pretty determined young woman. Her determination is not  only going to mean that she has an opportunity for a great life; it is  an opportunity to make the lives of so many of us better.   This is a simple issue of justice and fairness. That is what is at  the heart of it. People come to the floor and want to make this about  so many other issues in the immigration system. Can I tell you this?  Our immigration system is a mess. It is broken down. It has so many  problems. I know. I sat for 6 months and drew up a comprehensive  immigration bill with my fellow Republican and Democratic colleagues.  We passed it in the Senate, and the House wouldn't even consider it.  Our immigration system is broken.   Please do not put on Yuriana's shoulders the responsibility of fixing  every part of our immigration system. Give her the chance that she  needs to make America a better nation. Give her the justice that she  deserves through her hard work and determination. That is what this  comes down to. If we make  [[Page S7877]]  the Dream Act the law of the land, young people like Yuriana can prove  that they can work their way into legal status, work their way into  citizenship, and become valuable parts of America's future.   Please, to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's roll up  our sleeves and do what we were sent to do--solve problems, pass laws,  and make sure that we set the stage for America to be a better nation  in years to come.
