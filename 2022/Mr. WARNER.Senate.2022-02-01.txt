 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes.    Mr. President, I apologize to my good friend the Senator  from North Carolina for being a bit late. I have never seen him be this  timely and this brief in his comments.   But I wanted to take a moment to echo what I know he said about Chris  Joyner, who has served with enormous distinction for Senator Burr in  both his personal office and on the Intelligence Committee. I want to  particularly recognize Chris and my staff director, Mike Casey, who  managed to work together and, frankly, negotiate a peace treaty between  Senator Burr and me. When we started the Russia investigation, we had a  few bumps.   But, as I am sure Senator Burr has pointed out, Chris served with  enormous distinction in a very, very challenging time, putting together  an investigation that came with integrity, truthfulness, and  bipartisanship in a period--particularly under the previous  administration--where those milestones were not often highly regarded.   Chris has decided to move forward in his career, and I simply want to  join and echo Senator Burr's comments about his commitment and service  and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I appreciate the  courtesy of an extra couple of minutes.
