 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        At the end of division B (before the short title), insert       the following        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prevailing       wage requirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40,       United States Code (commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon       Act).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is the amendment that doesn't allow Federal funding to support  any project that enforces Davis-Bacon rules.   Davis-Bacon rules have--actually, it is the last remaining Jim Crow  law left on the books in America. It was established by a couple of  Republicans in New York back in about 1932 or 1933, when they realized  that of the few construction projects that were going on during the  Great Depression, there was an Alabama contractor that underbid the  local unions in New York to build a Federal building up in New York.   That contractor who came out of Alabama brought his labor out of  Alabama, African Americans out of Alabama. So they got together and  decided, let's pass a law to have a little trade protectionism between  Alabama and New York. We are going to control who is in the union, and  we will control the wages, and we will control the benefits.   I have been in the construction business, as of last Monday, for 42  years. We have paid Davis-Bacon wage scales most of those years, if not  all of those years, and King Construction understands what this does.   First, it inflates wages, and the inflation of wages is dictated by a  little board and committee that is supposed to be evaluating what is  described as prevailing wage. But it is not prevailing wage, it is  union scale, and it is a BOGSAT is what it is. BOGSAT, meaning a bunch  of guys sitting around a table deciding that they are having trouble  competing with the rest of the private sector, so they want to raise  the wages of their construction workers so that they can get the pick  of the cream of the crop of the construction workers to go to work for  them rather than their competitor or another industry.   That is how this has gone on for all of these years in the private  sector, the  [[Page H7040]]  Federal Government deciding what wages and what benefits should be  paid. And now we are seeing benefits that are being paid in the fringe  benefit category to people who have a health insurance program that is  funded by the taxpayers, premiums funded by the taxpayers under  ObamaCare.   So now, Davis-Bacon is even worse. It pays wages and it pays benefits  that are designed to pay for their health insurance benefits, and they  are doubling down on that and on the ObamaCare subsidy of their  premiums. And so these wages no longer reflect prevailing wage. They  haven't for a long time. They have long, and maybe always, been union  scale. The union sits at the table with a few contractors in the  BOGSAT, and they make the deal.   And I have a private contractor, a merit shop contractor, who has  worked with this for 42 years. I have seen the inefficiencies it has  created within our company, and competing companies as well.   And, yes, we like it when we can pay our labor the highest rates  known to man. It makes our employees happy. And if I can look at our  competition and we can sit down and say, you know what, we would like  to give each of our employees a $5 an hour raise or a $10 an hour  raise, and let's make sure that any other industry can't compete with  the wages we are paying, because, after all, it doesn't really come out  of our pocket as contractors. It comes out of the pockets of the  taxpayers, borrowed from the Chinese.   That is what is going on, and the wages increase is a 20 percent  increase on balance. So, for example, if you want to build five  bridges, repeal Davis-Bacon. If you want to build four bridges, stick  with the imposed Federal union scale, the legacy of Jim Crow. If you  want to build--let's just say a USDA building, the same formula  applies. You can build five buildings; you can build four. You can  build four stories, or you can build five, but we need to have  competition in this U.S. economy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the chairman of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the chairman of the subcommittee.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, and expending the  balance of it, I would point out that some of these wages that we are  looking at here, here are laborers in Indiana, a total of $34.63 an  hour. Here is an asbestos worker, $46.05 an hour.   There are more here in the records, and I don't think that these are  the kind of numbers that the gentleman is talking about. And I  constantly hear the script read to us from the other side but never a  response.   Mr. Chair, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:       *ERR08*  At the end of division B (before the short title),       insert the following:        Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used for a new hire who has not been verified through the       E-Verify program, except for an employee compensated under a       local compensation plan established under section 408 of the       Foreign Service Act of 1980.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that requires that new hires under  this appropriations bill are verified under E-Verify before they can go  to work. It ensures that those funds that are made available in this  appropriations bill will not be used for new hires unless they use the  E-verify program as a responsibility that the Federal Government  requires as a matter of law.   Current law requires the Federal Government to use E-Verify to  enhance enforcement of Federal immigration law in all hiring. However,  it has been brought to my attention that it isn't consistent across the  different departments. We need to ensure that it is. It is in response  to those concerns that I offer this amendment to require E-Verify.   I will just describe E-Verify.   Conditional to the hire, employers who have a prospective employee  may go onboard the Federal internet site, which is the E-Verify site,  and type in the valid information or perhaps the presented information  of the prospective employee that has been offered a job. Should they  clear E-Verify, you punch in what I just euphemistically call name,  rank, and serial number. It is a short piece of data that includes  birth date, name, and often birthplace. Then that goes into the  internet site. It comes back to you and lets you  [[Page H7043]]  know that you can legally hire the individual that is identified in  this data. That is E-Verify.   Hopefully, in this Congress, the Federal Government will pass and  make E-Verify mandatory for private sector employers. Hopefully, we  will do that in this Congress. But the Federal Government needs to, Mr.  Chairman, address this, and it needs to do so with our own employees.  That is what the King amendment does. It ensures that E-Verify is used  by our own employees.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. BISHOP Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Aderholt), chairman of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Aderholt), chairman of the subcommittee.    I would add for clarification, Mr. Chairman, that  the provision the gentleman referred to is section 408 of the Foreign  Service Act of 1980, which exempts those employees in foreign countries  that surely would not want them uncovered under E-Verify.   In response to the gentleman's objection, I have tried to fool E- Verify by punching data into it. The longest delay I could create was 6  seconds. So as far as undue burden is concerned, a 6-second wait in the  most extreme circumstances I don't think is extreme at all.   This is the right thing for the Federal Government to at least  exercise the laws that we pass and we want to impose upon the rest of  the country and upon ourselves.   So it is a clarification amendment, Mr. Chairman. I urge its  adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).   The amendment was agreed to.

Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) and the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Price) each will control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prevailing       wage requirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40,       United States Code (commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon       Act).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is an amendment, a Davis-Bacon amendment, and it will be brought  on each of the four segments of this appropriations bill that we are  considering here in the House this evening and perhaps tomorrow  morning, Mr. Chairman.   Just to make it clear, the text of the amendment is very simple. It  says, ``None of the funds made available by this act may be used to  implement, administer, or enforce the prevailing wage requirements in  subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code,'' and this  is commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon Act.   What the Davis-Bacon Act is, it is a statute that exists from about  1933, and its genesis is back during the Great Depression when there  was, let's say, labor protectionism brought about by the unions in New  York City. When a contractor from Alabama bid a Federal building  contract--and there were not many of them in those days--that Alabama  contractor was successful and he imported African-American labor out of  Alabama to do the work in the trade zone of the construction unions in  New York City. And so two Republicans, a Republican Senator and a  Republican Member of the House, got together and wrote the Davis-Bacon  Act, which is defined as prevailing wage.   In my 42 years in the construction business, which we just concluded  as of Labor Day, this past Labor Day, we have dealt with the Davis- Bacon Act quite a lot. Our math goes somewhere between an 8 and 35  percent increase in the cost of the projects. We use an average of 20  percent. I believe you will see some of those sophisticated studies go  to a 22 percent increase in prices.   So we are dealing with taxpayers' moneys here in a fiscal time when  we need to get to a balance. There never was a time we should be  wasting taxpayers' money. A prevailing wage, a real prevailing wage is  a merit shop wage, not a union scale imposed by a BOGSAT, which is a  bunch of guys sitting around a table deciding whether they want to give  raises to the different classifications within the labor force.   I have long opposed the Davis-Bacon wage scale. It messes up the  efficiency within our companies and makes us less efficient. This just  doesn't raise the cost and impose the union scale on the taxpayers, but  it erodes the efficiency that you can provide in a private sector  approach. And so after all of these years, I am pledged to see the day  when this is finally repealed.   I urge the adoption of this amendment which strikes the use of Davis- Bacon enforcement in the underlying appropriations, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment. Davis-Bacon is a pretty simple concept, and a fair one. It  requires that workers on a federally funded construction project be  paid no less than prevailing wages, the wages paid in the community for  similar work.   The Davis-Bacon Act ensures workers are paid decent wages, while  preventing unscrupulous contractors from undercutting competitors. In  doing this, Davis-Bacon helps protect workers and the Federal  Government.   Mr. Chairman, the House has taken numerous votes on this issue, and  on every vote, this body has maintained Davis-Bacon requirements.   Last year, we avoided including divisive language like this, and it  is my hope that we will stop attacking working people and their  organizations and defeat the amendment before us.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.                                time  2115     Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.                                time  2115     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that I hear the script read  every year that I bring the effort to repeal or undo Davis-Bacon, but I  don't really hear a lot of response to the fact that Davis-Bacon is a  Jim Crow law designed to keep minorities, particularly African  Americans, out of the construction trades, particularly in the unions.  The assertion that it is a prevailing wage doesn't hold up when you  live in this universe where I have for 42-plus years--and that is just  as an owner, and working out, I saw that also for other companies.   So when I see these rates and I talk to a contractor that is building  bridges in rural Missouri down there in the whoops and hollers, as we  say, and they are paying for an unskilled laborer who, for a number of  those hours, does lean on the shovel while he waits for other things to  get done, $23 an hour for wages, $22 an hour for fringe benefits, $45  an hour out of pocket for the contractor really just transferred to the  taxpayer. That is an example.   There is much of it that is here that goes in 46, 57, here is $51.60  an hour, Mr. Chairman. So, no, this is not prevailing wage.   There is no study that I have found in all the time I have dealt with  this that would demonstrate that prevailing wage is a merit shop earned  wage. Instead, it is set, as I said, by a bunch of guys sitting around  a table. It reflects almost always union scale.   Many of the merit shop contractors will not report their Davis-Bacon  prevailing wages because they know that just brings union organization  up against them. They want to avoid that, so they are not reporting  what they are actually paying in wages.   In many of the States that have adopted a mini Davis-Bacon for their  State or the States that are highly unionized, they press this thing to  the point where the difference between the merit shop wages and union  scale is very close together.  [[Page H7056]]    We have also double-breasted operations where you might have a  company that is Company A and Company B wrapped up, and one-half of the  company is union and the other half of the company isn't. That is to  comply with Federal regulations.   There is a gentleman who used to serve this Congress in  Massachusetts, who was famous for saying that the Federal Government  has no business intervening in between a relationship between two or  more consenting adults. I agree with that. An employee and an employer  should be able to decide what they want to make as their business  agreement. If I decide I want to pay someone $100 an hour or $1,000 or  $1 an hour, that should be up to me.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my  time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be  postponed.                 Amendment No. 52 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 52  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used in contravention of section 5309 of title 49, United       States Code.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am reading a headline that says that  experts say it could take Houston years to fully recover from Hurricane  Harvey.   This is not because my local leaders, mayors, county judges, and  Governors are not working as hard as they can, but it is the most  significant, singular, and devastating costly flood in the continental  United States history.   Certainly, we are praying that Hurricane Irma detours away from those  places that it has not yet hit. We certainly pray for Puerto Rico, the  U.S. Virgin Islands, the other Caribbean islands, and certainly our  friends in Florida and up the East Coast. But right now we have that  unlikely and unappreciated position of having the most devastating  flood.   So my amendment has to do with State and local funds being part of  designing their own reconstruction, their own projects, their own  capital projects. Specifically, my amendment says that none of the  funds made available by this act under the heading Federal Transit  Administration--Transit Formula Grants may be used in contravention of  section 5309 of title 49, United States Code.   The identical amendment was offered in the Jackson Lee amendment to  H.R. 2577 and received a positive voice vote.   In particular, this amendment affirms the importance to the Nation of  projects that create economic development, particularly in the  transportation area.   Pursuant to section 5309 of title 49, the Secretary of Transportation  may make grants under this section to State and local governments.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept this  amendment. If the gentlewoman is willing to yield back the balance of  her time, I am more than willing to accept her amendment. I want to  thank the gentlewoman for bringing it up.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. The chairman is very kind. Let me thank the chairman  and the ranking member of the subcommittee. If I might just take one  moment and I will conclude taking your gracious offer.   First, I would like to acknowledge that this amendment is supported  by the trade unions, the TTD. I thank them very much for their support.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the article about our  rebuilding.                 [From the Washington Post, Aug. 28, 2017]  Nation's Fourth-Largest City Struggles to Get Moving Again After Harvey     (By Ashley Halsey III, Michael Laris, Martine Powers and Luz Lazo)         Cleanup and flooding in Texas continue in wake of Hurricane       Harvey.        Under the threat of more rain and flooding this week, the       regional hub that is Houston faced the daunting prospect of       clearing mud-swept roadways, opening two of the nation's       busiest airports and resuming operations at the country's       second-busiest port.        Many streets remained impassable, with water more than       waist-high. Those highways not flooded too often led to       others that were. And officials said it was too soon to say       when the transit system would resume operations.        Houston is a city that for the past eight years led the       nation in growth, and although transit was considered to have       its place, the city's backbone is the oil industry, which       relies heavily on new highways to get around town. When the       city spread out into Harris County--which has 6.5 million       people to the city's 2 million--the connections were       roadways. The state maintains more than 1,200 miles of them,       including four interstates, three of which crisscross the       downtown area.        Even though the worst of the storm appeared to be over,       transportation officials continued to urge people to stay off       the roads. ``We're expecting more rain,'' Houston Fire Chief       Samuel Pena said.        ``The roads are dangerous. Stay off the roads.''        Once the water clears, it may take weeks or months before       roads are fully ready for travel, said Dave Newcomb, a senior       research engineer at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.       He said the primary concern will be local streets and       roadways, not the freeway system.  [[Page H7057]]         ``The freeways are probably going to be okay,'' Newcomb       said. ``They're built with lots of support underneath them.       They're built for heavy loads and adverse conditions.''        But local roads built on rain-saturated soil may be left in       a weakened state, he said, taking a month or two before they       stabilize. Bridges that had swift-moving floodwaters around       them must be checked for scouring around their supports, he       said.        The sheer scale of the immediate recovery is daunting.        ``It is really difficult because we're so spread out and       highway-dependent,'' said Kyle Shelton, director of strategic       partnerships at the Kinder Institute, an urban-research think       tank at Houston's Rice University. ``We just have so many       streets and so many roads and so much other infrastructure to       make sure is okay and bring back online. That's going to take       weeks and months.''        Houston's two big airports--George Bush Intercontinental       Airport and the William P. Hobby Airport--will begin to see       traffic on their runways even as the rest of the region       struggles to find its footing. Officials said Hobby will       remain closed until Wednesday; Bush until Thursday.        The magnitude of the backup to the national aviation system       caused when Houston shuts down was evident Monday: 772       flights had been set to depart from the two airports,       carrying close to 94,000 passengers. The two airports had a       record 1.9 million passengers pass through security last       month.        ``You may not even be heading to Houston and still run into       this,'' said Anne McDermott of Farecompare.com. She said that       late Sunday a flight to Dallas landed in Memphis because so       many--Houston-bound flights had been diverted to Dallas.       ``It's going to continue to be a fluid situation.''        The Houston Metro's bus system, three light-rail lines and       paratransit services were shut down Monday, with no word on       when they would resume service. In a statement, Metro       officials said they will monitor the situation to determine       when it would be safe to resume service.        If history is precedent, it may be a while before those       buses are back on the road. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005,       it took weeks to restore bus service in New Orleans--partly       because of the condition of flooded roadways, but also       because hundreds of buses were underwater after the storm.       With the city's bus fleet unusable, the Federal Emergency       Management Agency had to scramble to bring in more than a       thousand private coaches to help with evacuation efforts.        The Houston Metro tried to prevent a similar outcome for       this storm, parking more than 100 buses in the HOV lane on an       elevated section of Interstate 59.        ``This is a city that was built, in large part, in defiance       of nature,'' said Christof Spieler, an urban planner who is       on the board of Metro.        ``Basically, developers just treated this as a big empty       canvas and just spread out across it. We tend to sort of       ignore the natural underpinnings of the city. When this       amount of rain falls, suddenly that natural geography       reasserts itself.''        And in the long run, Houston--like the rest of the       country--has to wrestle with how to become more resilient in       an era when weather hazards are increasing. Over the past       three years, there have been three floods that have ``all       been labeled unprecedented,'' Shelton said. While freeways       and many local streets have major sections that are       underwater, many other areas are not submerged, depending on       their elevation and how much rain there was in that       particular place.        ``Houston is used to flooding. We're not used to anything       on the scale of what just happened,'' Spieler said.        Rapid development over the past two decades--and the       sprawling networks of accompanying roadways, subdivisions and       parking lots have left Houston especially susceptible to       major flooding, said Samuel Brody, a Texas A&M University       urban planning professor who leads the Center for Texas       Beaches and Shores.        Such surfaces leave little return path for floodwaters to       go into the ground or drainage channels.        ``You've got a smearing of pavement all over a flood-prone       region,'' he said. ``You're putting more impervious surfaces       over a large area that is dominated by flood-prone, low-lying       landscapes, so when it rains, there's all this impervious       surface. It increases the volume and velocity of water going       into the bayous which Houston uses as their primary drain       system.''        Between 1996 and 2011, as development boomed, the       percentage of impervious surfaces in Houston grew by 25       percent, Brody said, citing a report he led that examined the       effect of development on flood damage in the Gulf of Mexico       region. And although the extreme rainfall totals from Harvey       probably would have caused flooding no matter what, Brody       said the presence of pavement increases the amount of damage       on the ground.        The 25-mile-long complex of docks and warehouses that make       up the Port of Houston planned to remain closed Tuesday.        Kurt Nagle, chief executive of the American Association of       Port Authorities, said that early indications show there is       ``light to moderate'' infrastructure damage along the Houston       Ship Channel 150 business facilities that generate $617       billion in economic activity per year. At least three vessels       originally headed for Houston have been diverted to New       Orleans, and more may be detoured in coming days from Houston       and other affected ports in Galveston, Victoria, Beaumont,       Port Lavaca and others.        The continuing severe weather may have further effects on       the ports in the region, Nagle said. But even once things       clear up, significant work will need to be done before       shipping channels in the area can reopen. The Coast Guard       will need to perform surveys of the area to determine whether       buoys and navigation aids have been moved or lost, and the       Army Corps of Engineers will need to perform a channel       assessment to ensure that no debris is blocking the shipping       channels under the surface.        Benny Rousselle witnessed the ravages of water during       Katrina from his perch as president of Plaquemines Parish,       south of New Orleans. The priorities for leaders in Houston       are clear, for now: help those who are stranded.        ``The pressure is on the local elected officials to get       this community up and running as quick as possible, so they       can come home and help with the recovery,'' said Rousselle,       who is now on the parish council. ``But you cannot do that       until you have enough utilities and roadways cleared so they       can come in,'' Rousselle said.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to conclude by making this  point to Mr. Diaz-Balart, and it is that local entities should have the  right to direct funds where they believe they are most important,  particularly for transportation projects.   As they do so with Federal dollars, let me also add my support for  Davis-Bacon. It is, in essence, completely opposite with what was  represented. It is a civil rights bill for all people.   I ask my colleagues to join me in making sure the State and local  governments get Federal funds. And as we move forward to restore  Houston and Harris County and all of the Gulf region, this will be a  very important amendment to make sure that we can direct our own  destiny with Federal funds. The Secretary of Transportation has that  authority to give to us to be able to do so.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, let me thank Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart and Ranking  Member Price for their leadership on this important legislation and for  the opportunity to explain my amendment.   The Jackson Lee Amendment adds at the end of the bill the following  new section providing that:   Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act under the  heading ``Federal Transit Administration--Transit Formula Grants'' may  be used in contravention of section 5309 of title 49, United States  Code.   This amendment is identical to the Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R.  2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations  Act for FY2016 adopted by the House on June 8, 2016 by voice vote.   In particular, the Jackson Lee affirms the importance to the nation  of projects that create economic development, particularly in the  transportation area.   Pursuant to section 5309 of title 49, the Secretary of Transportation  may make grants under this section to State and local government the  authority to assist in financing capital projects, small startup  projects, including the acquisition of real property.   This section further supports capacity improvements, including double  tracking, and it specifically relates to work that deals with projects  on approved transportation plans.   That is key; section 5309 of title 49 grants to State and local  governments the authority to undertake capital projects, which means  that when local governments propose their projects, the Secretary has  the authority to go forward on them.   It is instructive to consider what some of the nation's leading  transportation and economic development organization have to say about  the importance and economic impact of investments in local light rail  capital projects.   It is well documented that nothing enhances the competitiveness of a  nation in this increasingly globalized economy, that investments in  transportation infrastructure capital projects.   Whether it is the seaways, dams, highways, or tollways, and whether  it involves other modes of transportation, transportation projects are  major engines driving the economy.   And it is important for the local community to be the drivers of  that.   Metropolitan regions will not be able to maintain its economic  vitality without the ability to create and preserve infrastructure that  supports the movement of people and goods throughout our country.   The Jackson Lee Amendment clearly speaks to the global aspect of the  Secretary of Transportation having the ability to work with our local  and State governments.   Houston is the fourth most populous city in the country; but unlike  other large cities, we  [[Page H7058]]  have struggled to have an effective mass transit system.   Over many decades Houston's mass transit policy was to build more  highways with more lanes to carry more drivers to and from work.   The city of Houston has changed course and is now pursuing Mass  transit options that include light rail.   This decision to invest in light rail was and is strongly supported  by Houstonians by their votes in a 2003 referendum and by their  increased usage of light rail service made possible in part by  transportation appropriations bills.   Specifically, Harris County voters passed a massive referendum  proposal that was to set the stage for transit for the next 20 years.   It included a first stage of four light rail lines, to be complete by  2012, and a master plan for a 65-mile system, to be complete by 2025.   An April 2014 report by the Houston METRO on weekly ridership states  that 44,267 used Houston's light rail service, which represented a  6,096 or 16% increase in ridership from April of the previous year.   This increase in light rail usage outpaced ridership of other forms  of mass transit in the city of Houston: metro bus had a 2.3% increase  over April 2013; metro bus-local had a 1.3% increase over April 2013;  and Metro bus-Park and ride had a 8.o% increase over April 2013.   In a story published February 5, 2013, the Houston Chronicle reported  on the congestion Houston drivers face under daily commute to and from  work.   According to the Chronicle article, in 2011 Houston commuters  continue to enjoy some of the worst traffic delays in the country, and  Houston area drivers wasted more than two days a year, on average, in  traffic congestion, costing them each $1,090 in lost time and fuel.   Today, those figures have increased to 3.5 days a year wasted in  traffic congestion, costing them each $1,850 in lost time and fuel.   To put it in simpler and starker terms: A driver in Houston could see  154 movies this year or purchase 21 tickets to a home Texans game with  the money wasted because of poorly maintained or traffic-clogged roads.   Expanded light rail is critical to Houston's plan to meet its  transportation and environmental challenges, ease its traffic  congestion, and improve its air quality.   Places most likely to see immediate benefit from light rail in  Houston are the 50,000 students that attend the University of Houston  and Texas Southern University.   Funds made available under this deal should be available to support  local government decisions of the Houston Metropolitan transit  Authority and the city of Houston to expand rail service.   When we put our minds to it, we can get things done.   In Houston, we built a port 50 miles from the ocean, created the  world's greatest medical center in the middle of open prairie, and  convinced the federal government to base its astronauts in a hurricane  zone 870 miles from the launch pad.   Each of those achievements shares a common element: elected officials  have advocated, built public support, and brought the agencies  together.   Members of Congress should respect the decisions of state and local  governments when it comes to deciding how they will spend funding made  available for public transportation under this appropriations bill.   I ask my colleagues to again support the Jackson Lee Amendment and  affirm the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to work with  local governments to develop local transit projects that will relieve  traffic congestion, efficiently move people and goods, create jobs and  maintain America's status as the leading economy in the world.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The amendment was agreed to.               Amendment No. 53 Offered by Ms. Herrera Beutler    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 53  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.   Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to enter into an agreement for the establishment or       collection of tolls on Interstate Route 5 or Interstate Route       205 in the State of Oregon or Washington.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.   Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, recently, the State of Oregon  passed a transportation package that included a provision to establish  tolls on the State line between Washington and Oregon. Since that time,  there has been a lot of concern in my district that tolls could be  established on the bridges on the Washington border, I-205 and I-5 on  the Washington side.   So far, that is not an unreasonable idea if those tolls are going to  be used on that stretch of roadway. But here is the kicker, Mr.  Chairman: my constituents do use those bridges overwhelmingly. Upwards  of 50,000 people a day commute into Portland to work. The problem is  that the proposal, this scheme, would be used to pay for projects well  south of Portland and a structure of roadways my constituents don't  overwhelmingly use. So they would be paying a toll, and that money  would be used elsewhere in the State for improvements. That is  fundamentally unjust, Mr. Chairman.   I am not opposing the concept of tolls, but that creates a real  problem in terms of how the money is used and I think would break faith  with really the American people. So I am opposing that. That is what my  amendment would do, is stop this practice in this area.   It is not that I oppose the concepts of a fee paid by the users of a  resource. Let me be clear about that. The issue is that that fee then  needs to be allocated towards the construction or the maintenance or  upkeep of that resource. There needs to be that nexus there.   Honestly, we have issues on those two bridges that need to be  addressed, and if those tolls were then diverted for use elsewhere,  then we are going to have some major problems.   So I am opposing this. My amendment would oppose this.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment. I understand the concern that has led to it about the  practice of tolling or the possibility of tolling on two adjacent  highways in two States.   But the same kind of reasoning that applied, I think, to Mr.  Thompson's amendment earlier would apply to this. This is not a  decision for us to make on the floor of the House tonight. This is  clearly a local matter. We don't have any business micromanaging it.  The States involved can have their own decisionmaking processes. They  have their own ways of consulting with one another for that matter.   Federal law has been pretty flexible on this for good reason. It has  been flexible about tolling, about the treatment of existing toll-free  roads for good reason. We have pressing infrastructure needs in this  country. We have great need for flexibility in the way we fund  infrastructure improvements.   I relayed earlier the kind of decision we made in North Carolina. It  was not particularly our first choice to have a toll road, but the  alternative was waiting 20 years, so we have a toll road. Others will  make other decisions. But it is not our place to preempt those  decisions, let alone in an appropriations bill.   Mr. Chairman, I do oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.   Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, to the speaker's point, I do  understand, but Interstate 5 and Interstate 205 are highways with  significant Federal interests. They are Federal highways. These are not  backwoods roads. These are not even State routes. These are Federal  highways. The I-5 corridor is over 13,050 miles with an average daily  traffic of 71,000 and a maximum of 300,000 vehicles. So it is a pretty  major Federal investment.   Here is the thing: levying tolls is one thing. That is something this  body does. I think user fees are fundamentally a fair concept, but we  need to apply them fairly. Any attempt to levy tolls on I-205 or I-5 at  the Washington  [[Page H7059]]  State line, the lion's share would be paid by Washington commuters to  pay for infrastructure improvements that these commuters then wouldn't  benefit from. This is where I feel like this is unfair in the extreme.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2130    Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following:         Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used for a new hire who has not been verified through the       E-Verify program.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.    Mr. Chairman, this is an E-Verify amendment. It was  offered in the previous segment of this appropriation bill as well.   What it does, it just simply reinstates and clarifies Federal law,  the requirement to use E-Verify in the forms of all Federal  contracting. Under this T-HUD bill, that is what would apply.   We have run into cases where there has been, let's say, concerns that  the Federal agencies are not uniformly and consistently abiding by  Federal law. This says that the funds will not be used for new hires,  unless they are verified through the E-Verify program.   The E-Verify program--we worked this now for quite a few years,  brought to us by Ken Calvert of California--even though in its early  days it hit a couple of bumps in the road, it has gotten better and  better. We use it, I have used it, it is efficient, and it is not time- consuming at all.   This reiterates Federal law. In fact, the Federal Acquisition  Regulation Act of 2009 reinforces and requires that compliance be there  for new hires, and  [[Page H7064]]  to use E-Verify on all new hires affected by this appropriations bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge this adoption, and I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this needless, divisive, and, indeed, provocative amendment.   President Bush, long ago, ordered Federal agencies to comply with E- Verify. That was in 2007. I have seen no indication that the Trump  administration intends to rescind this order.   This amendment, if it only applies to hiring at Federal agencies,  would do nothing, absolutely nothing. So why is it before us? What is  the purpose here tonight? Is it possibly a political purpose?   What the amendment does do, in fact, is to insert unnecessary  controversy into this bill. It does nothing to improve transportation,  and it does nothing to provide housing for vulnerable Americans.   The underlying bill, one would think, has enough challenges, as  written, without this gratuitous amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge defeat of this distraction, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in response to the gentleman's  comments, I am not at all convinced that it is needless. The reports  that I am getting are that E-Verify has not been adequately enforced,  especially at the contractor and subcontractor level.   This is Congress reminding those who consume Federal dollars and  Federal contracting under this T-HUD appropriations bill that they  shall comply with the law that was referenced by the gentleman. I don't  know why it would be divisive, if it is Federal law, and needless,  supposedly.   Let's go ahead and pass this and remind those that follow Federal law  and this debate won't happen next year.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, the E-Verify  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).   The amendment was agreed to.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR.

Stated for:    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division E (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prevailing       wage requirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40,       United States Code (commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon       Act).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.         Modification to Amendment No. 80 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa     Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to modify my  amendment with the modification at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.   The Clerk read as follows:         After the words ``this Act'' insert ``or Divisions A, C, D,       F, or G''    The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Iowa?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this eliminates the funding that would go to Davis- Bacon and enforcing Davis-Bacon, the Federal wage scale that advertises  prevailing wage but turns out to be union scale.   We debated this twice earlier this evening. The modification for the  edification of the people who might not have picked up on that rolls  this Davis-Bacon amendment together with the appropriations component  that we will debate tomorrow so there is clarification here on the  floor.   I have long been for the repeal of Davis-Bacon. I have made a  statement that the Federal Government doesn't have any business  dictating to an employer and an employee what they should be able to  agree to on wages.   We have been in the construction business for 42 years. We started on  our 43rd year this week. We have paid Davis-Bacon wages in most of  those years, if not all of those years, and it upsets the efficiency of  being able to manage the job, and it interferes with that relationship.   If it is going to be prevailing wages, then let the market decide  that. But the studies that we have out there, there is no study that I  know of that would show where there is an imposed Davis-Bacon wage  scale that it costs less money. It always costs the taxpayers more  money to do a particular project.   Our records of these years run between an 8 percent greater than it  [[Page H7083]]  would be if we had merit shop or as high as 35 percent greater than the  cost of the projects. We average it out to 20 percent. There are  studies out there that say a 22 percent increase.   So I describe it this way: if the Federal Government is going to  mandate union scale on construction projects, whether it be for  building a wall on the southern border or an interstate or a bridge, a  highway, a building, whatever it might be, you can decide whether you  want to borrow money from China to build 4 miles of road or 5, if you  want to build four bridges or five, or if you want to build four  buildings or five. That is what it comes down to in the end. We can  build five of everything instead of four if we just repeal Davis-Bacon.   So this scores well for us. The fiscally responsible people will come  down on the side of eliminating Davis-Bacon. This country would not  adopt such a policy if it happened today.   By the way, this is the last remaining Jim Crow law that I can find  in America. As so many things are being taken down left over from that  era, it is time we took down Davis-Bacon, too. So I would urge adoption  of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Earlier this evening, the same amendment was  soundly defeated twice on this floor, so I am not sure why there is a  need to go over the same worn ground again.   The Davis-Bacon Act is a longstanding law that ensures workers on  federally funded construction projects are reasonably paid, no less  than the wages paid for similar work in the local community. It is  simply a matter of fairness that we ensure that the Federal Government  pays fair wages for an honest day's work.   Mr. Chairman, I have heard the gentleman from Iowa suggest that  Davis-Bacon's history is linked to discrimination. But I believe he may  be misinformed in thinking that it was the cause and not the solution.   In 1927, a contractor who was employing African-American workers was  building a Veterans Bureau hospital. Congressman Bacon found that there  were very serious issues related to the pay of low wages and the  discrimination against the wages of migrant workers. He introduced  Davis-Bacon initially to help make sure that these construction workers  would be paid the prevailing wages in their community. As I said, these  workers happened to be African American.   I urge all of my Members to, once again, vote ``no'' on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Kilmer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chairman, in response, I have heard a piece of  history revisionism. Now is the first time I recall, in all these  debates that we have had, that the purpose of Davis-Bacon, which does  produce a result of union scales imposed by, as I said earlier this  evening--it is not prevailing wage.                                time  0100    Employers that are nonunion don't report wages to the Federal  Government because the union comes to organize their employees. So the  thing that is called prevailing wage is a distortion of the reality. We  know this.   I have been in this business 42 years. I talked to a contractor just  a week ago who was a bridge contractor. He has been operating in rural  Missouri. In just this past year's numbers, unskilled laborers cost him  $45 an hour. There is no way that you go down to Missouri and hire  somebody that is unskilled and you have to pay them $45 an hour. For  somebody that is going to look through the chart, I should tell you it  is about $23 an hour for labor and $22 for fringe benefits. The fringe  benefits are to pay for your health insurance and your retirement  program. But some of these employees are on our ObamaCare, with their  premiums paid by other money that we borrow from China.   It is foolish for a fiscally responsible nation, trying to get to  balance, to have a David-Bacon law in place. And I will pound on this  drum until we come to our senses on this.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, the House has already voted twice  against this amendment today, and I hope it will do so again.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 30 seconds remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I would just conclude that this is  the first time I have heard that Davis-Bacon was formed to protect  minority migrant workers that came out of Alabama to work in New York.  That seems to me to be Members of Congress representing the folks that  are not their constituents. That would be one of the rare times also.   So that is history revisionism. This is a Jim Crow law. It needs to  go. It needs to be ripped out of the code at every opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified,  offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman  from Iowa will be postponed.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 6, 2017, on page H7083, the following appeared: The  Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by      The online version has been corrected to read: The Acting CHAIR.  Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the  amendment, as modified, offered by    ========================= END NOTE =========================                 Amendment No. 81 Offered by Mr. Castro of Texas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 81  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order under the rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division E (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used for a new hire who has not been verified through the       E-Verify program.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.         Modification to Amendment No. 88 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa     Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to modify my  amendment by the modification at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.   The Clerk read as follows:    Modification to amendment No. 88 offered by Mr. King of Iowa:        After the words ``this Act'' insert ``or Divisions A, C, D,       or F''     =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 6, 2017, on page H7086, the following appeared: The  Clerk read as follows: After the words ``this Act'' insert ``or  Divisions A, C, D, or F''      The online version has been corrected to read: The Clerk read as  follows: Modification to amendment No. 88 offered by Mr. King of  Iowa: After the words ``this Act'' insert ``or Divisions A, C, D,  or F''    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Iowa?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her  consent to this unanimous consent request which will help expedite our  debate here on this long appropriations discussion that we are having.   This is the amendment that requires that E-Verify be used in all new  hires that are funded under this appropriation. And it is a well  established debate, I think, not only throughout the years of E-Verify,  but also throughout this evening.   It is all new hires, in conjunction with an offer of employment,  simply run their data through E-Verify. If it comes back from E-Verify  verifying that that information that is provided by the applicant  identifies an individual who can work legally in the United States,  that is the verification that the efficiency has gone way up into the  upper 90, 99 point something percentile.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, under the OMB directive from 2007,  all Federal agencies are already required to use the E-Verify system to  confirm the employment eligibility of new hires. Beyond Federal  employees, a 2008 executive order and a Federal acquisition regulation  already require that employees of Federal contractors also be verified  as eligible to work through E-Verify, so my opposition to this  amendment is primarily on the basis that it is unnecessary.   Given that the current administration has proposed making the use of  E-Verify mandatory for private sector hiring, it just doesn't seem  likely that it would somehow weaken the current requirement for the  Federal Government to use the system. This funding limitation simply is  not needed.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chairman, I would just reiterate that we are  getting reports that there are gaps in this enforcement and, spending  my life in a contracting business, I would remind the Members that we  have general contractors, we have first tier contractors,  [[Page H7087]]  we have second tier subcontractors, even third tier subcontractors, and  so we want to ensure that the enforcement is there of E-Verify. And I  want to thank everyone for their cooperation, and I urge the adoption  of my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified,  offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).   The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.                                time  0130
