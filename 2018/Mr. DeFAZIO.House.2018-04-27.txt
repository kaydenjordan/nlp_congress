 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I support the adoption of the amendments en bloc and  recommend them to my colleagues, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Obviously, the gentleman has had significant experience with these  problems in his part of the world that I think are somewhat unique, and  I can also understand we want to expedite the review of people's  claims. The major concerns we have are, one, that it appears, under the  wording, that there would be no timeframe. So 20, 30 years after a  disaster, someone could come in and file for arbitration. And secondly,  by lowering the cost to any project that is $100,000, we have no idea  what the scope of that would be or how many appeals that might  generate. But I think the general idea about using the Civilian Board  of Contract Appeals does have merit to expedite citizens' claims  against the government agency.  [[Page H3716]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   I will say to the gentleman that my staff tells me they did contact  his staff, they did express concerns. They said: Thank you for your  concerns. And then, next thing we knew, the amendments were filed. And  then she still said: We'd be happy to work with you. And we get no  response.   I think there may be kind of a staff issue going on here. Again, I  have some concerns about, particularly, the unlimited time to apply and  other details, perhaps.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, as I look at the drafting--and, again, my staff says they did  reach out to your staff--I am confused when you get to the 50 percent  part, whether it would have to be exactly 50 percent or otherwise. I  agree, and I think that it would be good to push for more flexibility.   For instance, I have a manufacturer of yurts in my district which are  used in many places around the world as temporary housing. The military  uses them, and others. I was approached by someone representing Airbnb  about vacant houses they had, vacation homes in Puerto Rico, that could  have been  [[Page H3717]]  used when they were saying there was absolutely no housing for any  emergency workers anywhere. And certainly there could be lower cost  alternatives.   I still remember when FEMA, I think it was under the Bush  administration, bought a bunch of trailers that couldn't be used  because they had some of that crappy Chinese formaldehyde-exuding  wallboard in them, and they were not habitable. We are still importing  that junk from China, by the way. So I agree they could be much more  flexible.   I think this amendment, again, as written, is problematic, but I  certainly agree with the intent of the amendment to look at other lower  cost alternatives. However, they should meet at least some minimal  standards for sanitary facilities and other things. So I, again, have  concerns about the drafting.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I look forward to working with the gentleman. Just on the issue of  the formaldehyde: we have laws and standards in this country still,  despite Mr. Pruitt, that regulate the amount of formaldehyde that can  be put into plywood. I have many people in my district who make plywood  without using formaldehyde glues, and the Chinese put in massive  amounts of formaldehyde glue, do not meet our standards, but we don't  enforce or prohibit the importation, though we are about to file a case  on that issue to prohibit them poisoning the American people. So that  is another subject for another day.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have to say, I have read the amendment,  and I can't quite follow it, my staff can't quite follow it, the  gentleman's staff couldn't quite explain it. The gentleman has  explained it in a way that this language may or may not reflect.   FEMA has said they don't understand it. They may well be doing  something regarding public facilities that is not following the intent  of the law, but again, I am not certain about this as the solution.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have in my district office something  called the ``casework staff.'' We do have disasters in Oregon,  particularly floods. And we have had instances, apparently like the one  that this legislation is trying to address, where we have gotten these  improper decisions reversed and my communities reimbursed, handled by  my casework staff.   Here, we are going to legislate. Now, apparently, there was a problem  in the gentleman's district. Too bad his casework staff didn't take  care of it. But the way this is written, here is the language:  ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, FEMA shall deem any  covered disaster assistance to have been properly procured, provided,  and utilized, and shall restore any funding of covered disaster  assistance previously provided but subsequently withdrawn or  deobligated.''   It isn't specific to the gentleman's problem. This would be any  community, anybody anywhere who might have legitimately misspent some  disaster assistance, gets it back. This is so global. We might as well  just not have a process to review disaster assistance and see whether  it was properly spent, because this says, if you have got it and you  spent it, that is all proper. I mean, it is deemed--deemed that every  expenditure is legitimate, even if the money was diverted somehow.  [[Page H3719]]    So, again, I am not certain who the other side is using for drafting  assistance, but I recommend leg counsel.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman pointed out, Essential  Air Service, to ensure that all Americans have access to something that  is critical to economic development and, basically, livability for many  smaller isolated communities, is paid for out of the trust fund. The  trust fund is composed of fees paid by the airlines, by passengers, and  by foreign airlines overflying the United States of America.   This doesn't add to the debt, unlike this tax bill we passed. I know  that the six largest banks in America saw a $4 billion windfall in tax  cuts in one-quarter. It is projected they will have a $20 billion  windfall by the end of the year.   We are going to borrow $20 billion to give to profitable banks,  including Wells Fargo, that just paid a $1 billion fine. Now they are  getting the money back because we gave them a tax break.   But he is concerned about the debt and the deficit, so we have got to  screw the small communities in America and take away their air service.  I think there are better ways to deal with our debt and deficit, and  this doesn't add to it because it is paid for out of the trust fund.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, there is a problem here, and the problem  actually is the Department of Transportation. They launched a new  carrier monitoring system known as CSA to make data available, but they  have yet to establish a test and apply that data.   So even though the data is available, the Republicans have adopted  amendments--other Republicans who are here today--that prohibit DOT  from finalizing a safety fitness determination rule. So there is data  out there, but there is no bright line test.   The best relief that we could provide would be to force DOT, in the  very near future, to issue a safety fitness ruling as soon as possible  and also raise the minimum insurance requirement--$750,000, it has been  that since 1980. It doesn't cover much in a truck accident.   We want to have people be able to get legal recourse and  compensation, but we also don't want to give the brokers an impossible  task, which is what they have now: How do they choose someone who meets  the safety fitness requirements that the administration has yet to  promulgate and Congress is preventing them from promulgating?   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and strongly  support the motion to recommit.   This is a historic bill, the FAA bill. I want to thank my staff:  Kathy Dedrick; Alex Burkett; Rachel Carr; Michael Tien; Luke Strimer;  Janet Erickson; David Napoliello; Helena Zyblikewycz; Auke Mahar- Piersma; Ward McCarragher, who has moved on; Alexa Old Crow; and Jamie  Harrell.   I want to congratulate the outgoing chair, Frank LoBiondo. It is his  last major bill in Congress, and Frank was great to work with. I hope  he has a great life after Congress.
