 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago this week, a group of astronauts  launched from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida,  embarking on a journey of discovery into unchartered territory.   July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong took one small step for man and one  giant leap for mankind on the surface of the Moon. Armstrong and fellow  astronaut Buzz Aldrin spent 2\1/2\ hours collecting samples and taking  photographs. Critically and importantly, they left behind an American  flag and some of the most famous footprints in history, sealing  America's place as the leader of the space renaissance in the  international space race.   Our journey to outer space was born out of a desire to discover, but  that wasn't the only reason we went to the Moon. We also went to the  Moon to compete with Russia, specifically regarding protecting our  Nation's security. That competition still exists today, but it is even  more serious now because of our economic and our military dependency on  space and because, in addition to Russia, we now have China explicitly  stating its intent to surpass America as the leader in space.    Russia and China have made it clear their intention is not just to  explore space, but to prepare themselves for conflict. Russia and China  both know that they will never be able to take us on tank to tank,  carrier to carrier, plane to plane, so they have decided in their  national security strategy to take us out in space if we ever have to  come to blows.   This is why I fully support the creation of the space force. This is  why space has now been declared a warfighting domain. And if we don't  prepare ourselves, our very way of life will be at significant risk.   Our banking, our financial institutions, our global logistics, our  telecommunications systems all depend on space. So the 21st century  space race is on, and America must lead, and this is why the push for  space resources and funding today is absolutely critical.  [[Page H5921]]    As a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, I see how national security and space  intersect every day. And as a Floridian, space is something that is  absolutely in my DNA.   It is from, of course, Florida's Kennedy Space Center that our  astronauts launched to the Moon, and I know that Florida will be a key  player when we go back to the Moon once more in 2024 and as NASA, the  U.S. military, and American industry work together to maintain American  leadership in space. In my district in northeast Florida, we are very  fortunate to have companies that once again will assemble the lunar  landers to help NASA get back to the Moon.   So looking back on this historic Moon landing 50 years later, I hope  we will all remember what an incredible moment this was for our  country. Our American values and American ingenuity have taken us to  new worlds not just on Earth, but beyond. It is an honor to celebrate  these accomplishments here today, and it is absolutely critical that we  continue exploring and we continue innovating.   But it is also equally critical that we fully understand that our  competitors seek to supplant our leadership role in space, and they are  not in line with our values. We cannot and will not allow that to  happen.                            ____________________
