 Mr. President, this Chamber has the responsibility to  debate tough issues that face our Nation. It has been devoid of such  tough debates now for a very long time, essentially failing to perform  its responsibilities to the American people under the vision of our  Constitution. I am more troubled at this moment about this failure than  any previous moment because, at this moment, the drums of war are  beating, and this Chamber stays silent.   At this moment, we have a bill before us to address security issues.  Yet we are being denied the chance to debate the most important  security issue of all--whether or not the United States goes to war.   The question before us in the amendment put forward by Tom Udall of  New Mexico and Tim Kaine of Virginia is this: Has there already been an  authorization by this body for the President to go to war against Iran?  Their amendment answers this question. It says with great clarity that  the answer is no. The President does not have authority to go to war.  The power to make that decision is vested with Congress, and no bending  and twisting and contorting of any previous authority can be used in  this situation. That is what their amendment says. It says: Mr.  President, if you want to go to war, you have to come to Congress to  get authority--authority voted on after the date of their amendment.   It is a fundamental question: Are we going to follow the Constitution  or not? When our Framers were working on the Constitution, many feared  that a President would become a King, and many feared that Kings take  countries to war to the benefit of their treasure and their power but  to the disadvantage of the people. But we are supposed to be a country  with a different vision--not government by and for a King or by and for  the powerful, but by and for the people.   They debated this at great length and decided with clarity and  authority that Presidents in the United States would not have that  power. Hamilton wrote about this in his Federalist Paper 69 in 1788:         The President is to be the commander-in-chief of the army       and navy. . . . In this respect his authority would be       nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain,       but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to       nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the       military and naval forces . . . while that of the British       king extends to the DECLARING of war.    This declares a huge difference between a kingship that can decide on  war, but here in America, it is the power vested in this body-- Congress.   At another point Hamilton wrote that the President of the United  States ``would be an officer elected by the people for FOUR years,''  again, describing the difference between a President and a King.  ``[T]he king of Britain is a perpetual and hereditary prince. . . . The  one would have a right to command the military and naval forces of the  nation''--the one being America, the other being the King of Britain-- ``possesses that of DECLARING war,'' very much emphasizing how  important this distinction is.   President Lincoln addressed this when he was in office:         Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation,       whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion and       you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems       it necessary for such purpose--and you allow him to make war       at pleasure. . . . If, today, he should choose to say he       thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British       from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him,       ``I see no probability of the British invading us,'' but he       will say to you, ``Be silent; I see it, if you don't.''    Then Lincoln brings to bear that our Constitution doesn't allow this.   The provision of the Constitution that gives the war-making power to  Congress was dictated, as I understand it, for the following reason:  that Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in  wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people  was the object. Our Convention understood this to be the most  oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and it resolved to so frame the  Constitution of the United States that no man should hold the power of  bringing this oppression upon us.   These were powerful words from President Lincoln in his describing  the Founders' vision to make sure that no one man, including the  President, holds the power to bring that oppression, the oppression of  war, upon us.   James Madison's notes of the debate of the Constitutional Convention  of 1787 revealed that when Pierce Butler, of South Carolina, urged the  President be given the power to initiate a war, the delegates  overwhelmingly rejected his proposal.   Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts, said that he never expected to hear  in a republic a motion to empower the Executive to declare war.   George Mason, of Virginia, remarked that he was ``against giving the  power of war to the Executive'' because the President ``is not safely  to be trusted with it.''   Leader after leader said this power must reside in Congress, not in  the President.   This list of the Founders' vision goes on and on, all to this  fundamental point: No one man--certainly not a President--is given the  power to declare war.   While we are here on the Defense Authorization Act, shouldn't we  debate this issue? We have a President who, regardless, claims he has  complete power to declare war. We have asked members of his Cabinet: Do  you respect the Constitution? Will you come to Congress and ask for  authority if you want to wage war against Iran? They have refused to  answer that question time and again.   So we demand here on this floor that we hold a debate on Tom Udall  and Tim Kaine's amendment that states, very clearly, we have not  authorized war. You cannot take any prior authorization and bend and  twist and contort it to somehow say Congress has provided you this  authority.   I expect, under debate, if we were here listening to each other, this  would  [[Page S4473]]  have broad, bipartisan support. All of us took an oath to the  Constitution. It does nothing but restate the fundamental principle  written into the Constitution.   The drumbeat of war against Iran has been steady--a continuous  demeaning of its every move. For sure, it does many things that bother  us a great deal. Yet it is more than just being concerned about its  current activities when I speak of the drumbeat of war; I am talking  about the fact that we exited an agreement that we made with Iran, the  JCPOA agreement, which had it dismantling all of its nuclear programs  in exchange for some loosening of economic restrictions. We exited it.  When we did that--when President Trump pulled us out of it, he did  exactly what the rightwing said, what the hard-liners in Iran said,  which was that America was not to be trusted, that America will not  stand by the agreement. President Trump showed Iran that it was right.   Then, in this tightening of the economic restrictions by us that has  ensued, we have made life difficult all across the spectrum of Iranian  civilians, and we have created more support for the rightwing, for the  hard-liners, for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in Iran--the folks who  are the least interested in negotiating with the United States of  America, the folks who are most interested in pursuing a nuclear  program. We have strengthened Iran, within its country, with this  action.   Then we deployed the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the  Persian Gulf. One of our carrier strike forces is immensely powerful.  It is able to rain down bombs on a vast number of cities in short order  with there being massive destruction that symbolizes and embodies that  power.   It is not just that. We deployed a B-52 squadron to the region, and  it has an immense, heavy lifting, bombing capability as well.   It is not just that. The Iranian economy, while it suffered under  quotas, still had some ability to sell some oil and therefore an  ability to alleviate some suffering within its country economically. We  cut off those waivers. Now they are really hard-pressed.    So we empowered the rightwing. We strengthened the citizens of Iran  to support the hard-liners, and the hard-liners then did something like  shoot down an American drone, and we came this close to going to war.   Our President's--President Trump's--inner Cabinet recommended our  bombing Iran in retaliation. It was at the last moment that President  Trump apparently recognized that Iran had shot down an unmanned drone  and that we were going to conduct a bombing campaign that might kill  150 people, but that would not have been proportional. His observation  was right. Yet where were his advisers when talking about  proportionality--his advisers who had been beating this drumbeat of  war, who had looked for a trigger, an opportunity to unleash the forces  that had been pre-positioned in the gulf by the United States of  America? Shouldn't we demand the President follow the Constitution?   We must debate this amendment--the Udall-Kaine amendment--on this  floor. Let people vote no or yes according to their opinions, but let  us listen to each other. Let us argue about one of the most important  issues a nation can ever argue about--the power to go to war.   I hope my colleagues here in the Senate will read the commentary by  the Founders and by those who came later. I was struck that Jefferson,  who was very involved in the structuring of the Constitution, talked  about putting a leash on the dogs of war by transferring the power from  the executive to the legislative. Yet he didn't just talk the talk; he  walked the walk. He wrote a message to Congress in 1805: ``Considering  that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with the power of  changing our condition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to  await their authority for using force.''   Jefferson talked the talk, and he walked the walk. Are we going to  walk the walk? Are we going to stand by and not even debate the issue?   Let us have the Senate be the Senate and put amendments before this  body on issues that are important to this Nation. We are on a bill  about the security of the Nation. There is no better time in the future  than now.   Are we to come together after war has been unleashed and then hold a  debate on whether it was authorized? Can we not send clarity now or at  least debate as to whether to send clarity now that, indeed, it is not  authorized and that the President must come to Congress, as  envisioned--as laid out in article I, section 8 of the Constitution?  Shouldn't we have that debate now, not after a conflict has started?  The answer is, yes, we should have the debate now.                            ____________________
