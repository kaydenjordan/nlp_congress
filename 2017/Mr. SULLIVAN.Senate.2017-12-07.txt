 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the disposition of the Balash nomination, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Executive Calendar No. 167, as under the previous  order.    Madam President, today I am gratified to be finally  debating and voting on the nomination of Joe Balash to be the U.S.  Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Lands and Minerals.   I have been coming to the floor, as have a lot of my colleagues,  making the case about how it has taken too long to get good people into  the Federal Government. I am sure I will have to give that speech maybe  a few more times--I hope not--to finally get people who want to serve,  who have been nominated by the President, to be confirmed by the  Senate, to move them. It doesn't help the American people that we just  delay well-qualified Americans who want to serve their country just for  the sake of delay. It is happening, but I am not going to focus on that  today.   I actually want to thank the Democratic Whip, Senator Durbin, who was  actually very helpful in trying to move this nomination, which has been  stalled on the Senate floor for many weeks now. Joe Balash was  nominated by the President in July. I appreciate the cooperative spirit  from my colleague from Illinois, and I thank him again for that.    This is a very important position in the U.S. Government. The  Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management entails  supervision and overseeing the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of  Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental  Enforcement, and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and  Enforcement. It is very important for the entire country. It is  particularly important for my State, the great State of Alaska, and for  so many others where Federal lands make up an enormous part of the  State.   Yesterday, my colleague and friend, Senator Lee from Utah, talked to  a number of us about how much Federal lands constitute different States  in terms of the overall percentage. A lot of Americans don't know this.  Usually, if you live on the east coast, you don't have Federal land as  a big part of your State, but in Alaska, it is 61 percent; Idaho, 61  percent; Utah, 63 percent; Nevada, almost 80 percent. These positions  in the Department of the Interior are enormously important.   This is a very important job, and I am glad to see we are finally  getting to vote on it because it is important to help manage resources  that we have in abundance but also protect the environment. We all love  our environment. Alaska has the most pristine, beautiful environment in  the world, and we know how to protect it. We also have enormous  opportunities for jobs in energy on public land. What is in all the  Federal statutes that Joe is going to be in charge of implementing is  that you can do both. You can do both. You can protect the environment  of this great Nation, and you can also utilize these incredible  resources that we have on public lands. In essence, that is what his  job is going to be all about.   I encourage my colleagues to look at Joe Balash's confirmation  hearing and his background because he is probably one of the most  qualified people to hold this job in the entire country--in the entire  country. Joe Balash comes from a long, distinguished career of public  service in Alaska. He was the commissioner of natural resources in  Alaska, and he was the deputy commissioner of natural resources in  Alaska, which manages one of the largest portfolios of land, water,  minerals, oil, gas, and timber of anyplace in the world--not just in  the country, in the world. Very few countries have more resources than  we do in Alaska, and for years, Joe Balash was in charge of managing  those. That makes him super well qualified for this job.   As DNR commissioner, he oversaw 100 million acres of uplands, State  land in Alaska--this is obviously bigger than most States in America;  40 to 60 million acres of submerged lands and tidelands; and resources  that included managing over half a million barrels of oil production a  day. Joe oversaw a workforce of over 1,100 people as the commissioner  of natural resources and a budget of $170 million a year.   Joe understands how to build consensus, how to navigate State and  Federal lands issues and interests, and, importantly, how to work to  responsibly develop our resources and grow our economy, while always  understanding that our lands sustain us and that stringent  environmental safeguards are absolutely necessary for all Americans.   Let me say one other thing about Joe Balash. You can look at the bio,  you can look at the experience, but you  [[Page S7907]]  also need to know the man. When I was the commissioner of the  department of natural resources, Joe Balash worked for me as my deputy,  and for the past almost 3 years, he has worked as my chief of staff  here in the Senate.   Perhaps more than any other issue--experience, a super hard worker-- he is a man of integrity, a man of character, and a man who cares  deeply about his country and wants the best for Americans and for  Alaskans.   I can't think of anyone more qualified--experience, character,  integrity, knows the issues, cares about the environment--so I am  strongly encouraging my colleagues to vote for Joe. He was voted out of  the Environment and Natural Resources Committee in September with the  support of every Senator in that committee, with the exception of one.  When the committee looked at his experience and background and they  heard about his integrity and character, there was enormous bipartisan  support for Joe. I am hoping we will see that here in a few minutes  when we come to vote.   I understand that one of my colleagues, unfortunately, is going to  come down to the floor soon and encourage a vote against Joe. I am  still not sure why. Maybe it is something related to a recusal issue  between State and Federal lands in Alaska. I will be interested to hear  what the recusal issue is.   Most recusal issues, by the way, as we look at confirmations in the  Senate, relate to people who have interests in the private sector, and  perhaps those private sector interests impact policy decisions. But  when you have someone who has worked on lands issues in a State, the  idea of being recused because you have expertise in policy from your  State job when you go into a Federal job, to me, seems, well,  outrageous. We will see what that argument is.   I do know that Joe Balash will follow the rules and regulations as  they relate to ethics and conflicts in a steadfast way because I know  who he is. So I again encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor  of this extremely well-qualified nominee who has the character,  knowledge, expertise, and experience for a very important job for the  country and someone who is going to do a great job for Secretary Zinke  and President Trump.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, every week I have been coming down to  the floor to talk a little bit about my great State, about the wonders  of its natural landscape--a land that everybody should see for  themselves--and we talk about special people. I know the Presiding  Officer looks at this as one of the favorite times in his long week. We  talk about the people who have made a difference in Alaska, our Alaskan  of the Week. It is one of the best things I get to do here as Alaska's  Senator because I get to talk about Alaska's beauty; the people who  make my State so special; the kind, generous people full of rugged  determination, full of patriotism, full of drive, full of life.   Living in the North in some of the most difficult terrain and extreme  conditions of the world breeds competition in the best ways possible.  It also sparks creativity all across the State. When creativity meets  competition, great things can happen.   You saw great things happen on the basketball court late last month  when University of Alaska Anchorage's women's basketball team, who are  our Alaskans of the Week, won the championship at the Great Alaska  Shootout in Anchorage, the seminal sports event of the year that for  four decades has corresponded with Thanksgiving weekend.   Let me talk for a few minutes about the Great Alaska Shootout. In the  late 1970s, a coach from the University of Alaska Anchorage's  basketball team had a vision to put the fledgeling UAA basketball  program on the map. How  [[Page S7924]]  would he do that? He would create a preseason college basketball  tournament, and he would make sure that participation in any tournament  outside the contiguous lower 48 States didn't count against the limits  for how many games a team was allowed to play. And so was born the  Great Alaska Shootout.   For the past 40 years, tens of thousands of Alaskans from all over  the State--and I would say Americans from all over the country--many  who had never been to a professional game or even a college game,  traveled to Anchorage to watch some of the best basketball in the  country. In Anchorage, people opened their homes to the teams from the  lower 48 to enjoy a home-cooked Thanksgiving dinner.   The teams and the players who came to Alaska over the last 40 years  are legion--Patrick Ewing, Glenn Robinson, Sam Perkins, Ray Allen,  Dwayne Wade, and Alaska's own Trajan Langdon, just to name a few. All  the great college basketball coaches at one time or another came to our  State--Coach K, Jim Valvano, Bobby Knight, Denny Crum, Roy Williams,  Tom Izzo, Pat Summitt, and so many others. As one reporter put it, ``It  was an annual Thanksgiving week staple for ESPN and it made Anchorage  the center of the college basketball world for one bright, shining  week.''   Time and again, the UAA Seawolves--both the men and women's teams-- Division 2 programs, who were up against some of the biggest Division 1  powerhouses in the country, showed the world what basketball in Alaska  looked like, and it looked strong.   The Great Alaska Shootout was a gift to the world, to America, and to  all of Alaska. Times have changed, and so have college basketball  tournaments. More choices are available. Other States have begun to  compete with Alaska. So this past Thanksgiving, sadly, was the  Shootout's last tournament. But, again, UAA's basketball teams made us  proud. All told, the men's teams won 39 games in 40 Shootouts. This  past Thanksgiving Day, the UAA women, which has become a Division 2  powerhouse under the leadership of Coach Ryan McCarthy, claimed the  women's championship in the final Shootout, beating the Division 1  University of Tulsa Golden Hurricanes 59 to 52 in a thriller. It was  their seventh title in tournament history.   Everyone involved--the businesses that sponsored the Shootout over  the years, the many avid fans who haven't missed a game, and all those  who played in the Great Alaska Shootout over four decades--is deserving  of recognition. But at this year's final Great Alaska Shootout, the UAA  women's team showed us all the true meaning of grit and determination.   So here is to the Seawolves, our Alaskans of the Week. Here is to the  history of the Great Alaska Shootout. It is a great day to be a  Seawolf. Thanks for all the great games, the great memories, and a  truly great Alaskan and American basketball tournament.   I yield the floor.
