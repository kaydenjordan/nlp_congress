 Mr. Chair, it is amazing to me now that some of  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are calling to see the  replacement before the repeal. What irony that is when--at that time  the Speaker--the leader of their party, said: let's pass this law so we  can see what is in it.   Well, the American people saw what is in it, and they don't like it.  It is broken. It needs to be fixed.   The American people deserve a stable transition to a patient-centered  healthcare system that gives them access to high-quality, affordable  health care.   It has got to be done thoughtfully and carefully as it will impact  millions--because I agree with my colleagues that it is going to impact  millions. But it is going to positively impact millions if we do it  right. And we will.   The only way to accomplish it in this current environment, the only  way to accomplish the repeal of ObamaCare, is through the budget  reconciliation process. And so this budget resolution that we are going  to be considering today is simply a requirement, the triggering  mechanism for the reconciliation process.   We are going to get to the fiscal year 2018 budget, a budget that  balances, a budget that puts us on a path of fiscal sustainability, but  this resolution essentially fires the starting pistol, Mr. Chairman,  for repeal of ObamaCare, which has failed the American people.   We will be addressing the spending levels for the future in the  fiscal year 2018 budget. This is something the American people have  demanded, and now Republicans are going to deliver on it.
