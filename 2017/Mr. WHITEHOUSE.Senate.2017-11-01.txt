 Mr. President, I come to the floor today for the  184th time to ask us to at least wake up to our duty as a Congress to  enact prudent policies to address the effects of climate change. The  Presiding Officer is well aware of what Alaska faces from ocean  acidification and ocean melting and sea level rise and all of that.   For the generations who will look back at this, I have tried in these  speeches to chronicle the political tricks and bullying that have put  Congress--the Congress of the United States--in tow to a massively  conflicted special interest, such that we are incapacitated on this  vital subject. The shamelessness of the fossil fuel industry and the  spinelessness of Congress under its sway will provide a long lesson in  modern-day corruption and political failure.   The Trump administration has been particularly loathsome, threatening  the emissions standards for cars and trucks, pressing for the Keystone  XL tar sands pipeline, disbanding science advisory committees, lifting  the moratorium on Federal coal leasing, trying to expand offshore  drilling, and open national marine monuments and sanctuaries to energy  companies. The Environmental Protection Agency is working to eliminate  rules on the leaking and flaring of methane and has rescinded  requirements for reporting methane emissions. The President has  announced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate  agreement.   One particular target of this corrupted administration is the Clean  Power Plan, the 2015 EPA rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from  American powerplants--a rule that many utilities and States supported.  But it is the industry's bottom-dwellers who have the President's ear,  and they want to undo even this flexible framework for meeting  emissions-reduction targets.   When EPA balanced the costs and benefits of the Clean Power Plan  originally, it offset things, like between $14 billion and $34 billion  in health benefits in the form of preventive illnesses and deaths,  against the costs of industry compliance.   The net benefits of the Clean Power Plan came out to between $26  billion and $45 billion every year.   So with its official proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, EPA  administrator and fossil fuel operative Scott Pruitt had to cook the  books to wipe out this public benefit. Here is how he did it. There  were two tricks. One derives from the fact that harms, injuries, and  losses caused by carbon pollution can take place many years after the  pollution is emitted. In financial matters, future costs and benefits  are balanced against present costs and benefits, using what is called a  discount rate. It is more valuable to receive $1 million now than $1  million 20 years from now. That is the theory.   But even the George W. Bush administration recognized for healthcare  rulemaking that ``[s]pecial ethical considerations arise when comparing  benefits and costs across generations,'' and they urged care about  using a discount rate when a rule is expected to harm future  generations.   In 2015, the United States settled on a 3-percent discount rate to  estimate the out-year costs of carbon pollution to society. Scott  Pruitt jacked that up to a 7-percent discount rate so out-year harms,  injuries, and losses would count for less. Mind you, our children and  grandchildren will still suffer the exact same costs at 3 percent or at  7 percent. It is just that present-day polluters--Scott Pruitt's  masters--get a way-big discount.   Pruitt's second trick is only to count the carbon pollution harm  within our borders. You might say: That is OK; we are Americans, after  all. But it is worth taking a look at what this rule does if all  countries were to use it because there is a trick hidden in the middle  of it. The fact is that we are harmed by other countries' carbon  emissions, and they in turn are harmed by our carbon emissions. On the  flip side, we harm other countries with our emissions, and they harm us  with theirs.   There is a total amount of global emissions, and there is a total  amount of global harm. If you call the total global emissions X and the  total global harm Y, what happens when every country follows the Pruitt  method of only pricing local emissions and local harms?   For purposes of illustration, let's say there are three countries in  the world, and each emits one-third of the total carbon pollution and  suffers one-third of the global harm from the collective global  emissions. If each country only counts its own emissions and the harms  only to its own country, guess what happens. All that cross-border harm  never gets counted. It never gets counted. It disappears off the  balance sheet. It vanishes into this trick of calculation. If you are  the tool of the fossil fuel industry, how rewarding it must be to  implement a trick that just vanishes so much of the fossil fuel  industry's harm to the world.   In this hypothetical, how much harm simply vanishes? Two-thirds of it  does. Two thirds of the harm simply vanishes, never to be accounted  for--not in the real world. Nothing has changed in the real world. In  this three-country hypothetical, the total emissions is still X and the  total harm is still Y. None of that has changed. This Pruitt trick of  accounting just wiped two-thirds of the harm off the books. A happy day  for polluters, and a happy, happy day for the polluters' tool, for  there will no doubt be rewards for implementing this trick.   Those fossil fuel industry bottom-dwellers no doubt think that this  is pretty cute and that this is pretty clever stuff, indeed. There are  high-fives in the corporate boardrooms that they have a tool in office  who will pull such a trick of magical, vanishing carbon pollution  harms. But the problem with these crooked little schemes is that the  whole world is actually watching. Anybody can do the analysis that I  just did and show that this is nothing more  [[Page S6948]]  than a trick, and sooner or later, consequences do come home to roost.   Out in the real world, the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati is  buying up land in Fiji so it can evacuate its people there when rising  seas engulf its islands and eliminate the nation. It is on its way to  becoming a modern-day Atlantis, lost forever to the waves. You can  replicate that risk along the shores of Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia and  the Maldives.   You can add in the risk of lost fisheries that left a country's EEZ  for cooler waters. If you think that is just a hypothetical, ask  Connecticut and Rhode Island lobstermen about their catch. Add in the  expansion of the world's desert areas in the Sahel and elsewhere that  forces farmers' crops and shepherds' flocks away from their historic  homes.   Add unprecedented storms powered up over warming seas. As bad as  things have been in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico, we are rich  enough to rebuild, to throw billions of dollars at the problem, and we  are. Other places do not have those resources. Without the help,  imagine that suffering.   To those who will suffer in the future, what do we say? On that day  of reckoning, on that judgment day, what do we tell all those people  who suffered? Ha-ha-ha, do we say? We came up with this little trick  that wiped most of your suffering off our books. We used a discount  rate that discounted your suffering to virtually zero. Is that the kind  of America we want to be? Remember the saying: The power of America's  example is more important than any example of our power. Some example  we would be, some city on a hill, if that was the way we behaved.   The natural world does not care about self-serving or ideological  arguments. The natural world is governed by immutable laws of physics,  chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Scott Pruitt's polluter-friendly  mathematics just doesn't add up. As Michael Greenstone, an economist at  the University of Chicago who helped develop the social cost of carbon,  put it, Pruitt's plan was not evidence-based policymaking. This was  policy-based evidence making.   There is enormous pressure in the Trump administration to get rid of  the social cost of carbon. What is bizarre about the Trump  administration is that they don't try to get rid of the social cost of  carbon by getting rid of its social costs, by lowering carbon  emissions, by addressing the harms that it causes. They try to get rid  of the social cost of carbon by getting rid of the scoring mechanism  that counts all of that. It is like saying: My team is winning because  I tore down the scoreboard.   Well, no, the world is getting clobbered out there by carbon  pollution and the climate change that causes it, and tearing down the  scoreboard doesn't help change the game on the field. You cannot just  cook the books and reduce the social cost of carbon.   For one thing, the social cost of carbon analysis is too well  established in the honest world. Courts have instructed Federal  agencies to factor the social cost of carbon into their regulations.  States are using the social cost of carbon in their policymaking. Most  major corporations, even ExxonMobil, factor a social cost of carbon  into their own planning and accounting.   The social cost of carbon pollution is at the heart of the  International Monetary Fund calculation, for which the fossil fuel  industry gets an annual subsidy in the United States of $700 billion a  year. Even to protect a multihundred-billion-dollar annual subsidy,  Scott Pruitt can't just wish the social cost of carbon away and just  can't stop counting it. Courts will take notice.   They may take notice that these stunts are arbitrary and capricious  under the Administrative Procedure Act. They may take note that Pruitt  has massive conflicts of interest with his fossil fuel funders. They  will surely note that the Supreme Court has said greenhouse gases are  pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that EPA is legally obligated  to regulate them. They will surely note that the EPA itself has  determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health and  welfare of current and future generations, a determination that the DC  Circuit resoundingly upheld.   But we are not in an ordinary situation. Pruitt has a long history of  doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry. In the recent Frontline  documentary, ``War on the EPA,'' Bob Murray of Murray Energy, a strong  Pruitt supporter, bragged about giving this administration a three-page  action plan on environmental regulations and bragged that the first  page was already done. That is the world we live in now, where the  regulated industry brags that it controls its regulator, gives it  direction, and that its work is already being done.   Courts that look at any rule proposed by Scott Pruitt must recognize  that there is a near zero chance that he is operating in good faith.  Our Nation's environmental regulator went in captured and has stayed  captured by our Nation's biggest polluters. Scott Pruitt is not their  regulator; he is their instrument. That is a conflict of interest.   I recently hosted my eighth annual Rhode Island Energy Environment  and Oceans Day, bringing together members of our business community  from the public sector, from government, and academia, to hear directly  from experts about the latest environmental news and initiatives. I was  very excited to be joined by excellent keynote speakers, including  former Secretary of State John Kerry, who has done such magnificent  work on oceans particularly but on climate change generally, leading us  into the Paris climate agreement. Also, there was former U.S. Special  Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern, who has labored in these vineyards  so many years, and ocean advocate and Oceana board member Sam  Waterston. They were all great, but one phrase stood out.   Sam Waterston called on us to tackle today's ocean and environmental  problems with what he called a ``battle-ready kind of optimism''--a  ``battle-ready kind of optimism.''   So let us go forward with a ``battle-ready kind of optimism'' to  clean the polluter swamp at EPA, to clean our Earth's atmosphere and  oceans of unbridled carbon emissions, and to clear the reputation of  our beloved country of the obloquy it is rapidly earning at the hands  of a corrupting industry.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Janus decision coming up in the  U.S. Supreme Court, which Senator Brown has just spoken about, is one  that merits the attention of people who are concerned about the country  and the Court.   I wish to make two points in my remarks. The first has to do with the  very difficult to explain--or at least very difficult to comfortably  explain--pattern of 5-to-4 decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, in  which the five consist entirely of Republican appointees.   The Supreme Court makes a lot of decisions, of course. But there is  something that is particularly interesting about the 5-to-4 decisions,  where the five Republican appointees line up and roll the other  appointees. When we start looking at those decisions, there are some  really significant patterns that emerge. The first pattern goes to  issues in which the court is treading into the world of politics.   Bear in mind that when Sandra Day O'Connor left the Court, it lost  its only member who had ever run for office. What Justice O'Connor left  behind was the first Court in the history of the United States that had  exactly zero experience with elections and politics. There has never  been as ignorant and green a Court in the history of the United States  when it comes to politics; yet there has rarely been a Court so  flagrantly eager to jump into politics and make very consequential  decisions.   When we look at the 5-to-4 decisions--which I think are probably the  bulk of those--each one aligns with the political interests of the  Republican Party--each one. It is not one or two or even three. It goes  on and on and on.   The oldest one in the series is probably Vieth v. Jubelirer, which  was the decision in which the five Republicans said: This whole  gerrymandering thing is just too difficult for us. We are going to  declare open season. There is going to be no judicial remedy. We can't  figure out one, so we don't have one.   It is not just me who is saying that. The ABA section on election law  said in its volume: Look, basically, it is game over for court review  of gerrymandering. What immediately happened after that was the  Republican Party went to work with that green-light signal and did the  REDMAP project, which created massive, bulk gerrymandering through the  battleground States. This was not an easy plan because, in some cases,  they had to spend millions of dollars to win one or two State  legislative seats, so they could then control the State legislature, so  they could then change the districts consistent with the bulk  gerrymandering scheme.   The result is what happened in States like Senator Brown's, where,  when he was reelected, he was on the ballot with President Obama, who  was also reelected, and the majority of the votes cast in his State for  Members of Congress were cast for Democrats, but against that  background, many more Republicans than Democrats actually went to  Congress in that election.   A similar thing happened in Pennsylvania. My recollection is that on  the same set of facts, Senator Casey, a Democrat, was reelected;  President Obama, a Democrat, was reelected; a majority of Pennsylvania  votes were cast for Democratic Members of Congress; the delegation was  13 Republicans and 5 Democrats. Somebody is messing around, and it was  a 5-to-4 Republican Supreme Court that opened that can of worms and  unleashed REDMAP on the political landscape.   They have a chance to review that now. Senator McCain has written a  bipartisan brief asking them to wake up and smell the coffee about what  has gone wrong here. We will see if they do or not, but, clearly, that  was a decision that benefited the Republican Party's polls, and,  clearly, it was 5 to 4.   Then you go to the Voting Rights Act cases. There were two of them.  In the first one, Bartlett v. Strickland, the five Republican members  teed up a new standard, which they mentioned, but they didn't really  act on it. Then, when it came to the home run pitch, Shelby County v.  Holder, they created this new theory about which very conservative  judges, like Posner, said that, basically, it stands on thin air. It  has no basis whatsoever in any real legal theory. They knocked out the  part of the Voting Rights Act that requires States with a wretched  history of abuse of minorities and Democratic voters at the polls to  get preclearance from the Department of Justice or from a court before  they can change their State laws to scare people or keep people away  from the polls.   With that knocked out, guess what. All these legislatures across the  South went straight to work. They passed law after law after law to  deny people access to the polls, and over and over again, the courts  that reviewed those and the appellate courts that reviewed the district  court decisions found that the laws had been intentionally  discriminatory, that the legislature had intended to keep people away  from the polls, that they had intended to discriminate against Democrat  and minority voters, and that they had chosen to do that deliberately.   Of course, you can go back after all that litigation and clean it up  and try to get the laws stricken and all of that. But in the meantime,  you have had election after election in which the effect at the polls  was had.   They couldn't have been more wrong about the notion that if you  lifted the preclearance requirement, everybody was going to be fine.  Those were just the bad old days; it was a whole new America; racism  didn't exist; efforts by one party to keep the other parties away from  the polls weren't anything to worry about. Move along, move along;  nothing to see here, folks. They were just plain dead wrong. They had  absolutely no clue, and they have been proven dead wrong since. But,  again, both of those cases were 5 to 4, all Republicans together.   Then, of course, the big whammy came when the big special interests  that so often are the core backers of the Republican Party decided that  they felt really constrained by having to live under campaign finance  limits. They wanted to be able to spend unlimited money in elections.  Well, that is fine. It reminds me a little bit of the story of the  French philosopher who touted the majesty and equality of the French  law, which forbid both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges  and begging for bread. Well, guess who actually sleeps under bridges  and begs for bread. It is not rich and poor. And guess who can take  advantage of a rule that you can spend unlimited money in politics.  Only those who meet two conditions: One, they have unlimited money to  spend, and, two, they have a good reason to spend it. In other words,  really big special interests.   The Court's decision, presuming that this spending was going to be  either independent or transparent, has been turned into a mockery by  events since. They obviously did not know what they were talking about.  Facts have borne out that they did not know what they were talking  about. They were completely dead wrong.   Interestingly, since then, despite the presumption of their decision  having been cut completely out from underneath it, the Court has shown  no interest in a correction. They have shown no interest in correcting  their error. They seem completely happy, the 5 to 4--the five  Republican appointees--completely happy to have the landscape of  American politics polluted with this money.   There again, it wasn't just one decision. It was a bunch of them.  Citizens United was the big one; Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock  another; McCutcheon v. FEC yet another; Davis v. FEC yet another;  Arizona Free Enterprise Club's FreedomClub PAC v. Bennett yet another-- all 5 to 4, all the Republicans lining up, all throwing out precedent  or laws that had stood for 100 years.   So Janus fits right into this pattern of 5-to-4 decisions. Indeed, it  is actually a little bit worse because something weird happened early  on when one of those 5 to 4--the Republican five Justices on the  Supreme Court--signaled to the corporate supporters of  [[Page S6960]]  this ideology that he was interested in taking a whack at unions in a  particular way.   There is a pet peeve of the union-busting rightwing and the corporate  sector, which was a decision from 1977 called Abood v. Detroit Board of  Education. That decision allows unions to collect some dues from  nonmembers on the grounds that their work for their members has benefit  to other members. So you break out their wages work, which helps  everybody, from their political work, which you can disaggregate from,  and it allows you to collect certain dues--not complete dues, but  certain dues--from nonunion members. What Abood did was to help unions  keep revenues from the service that they give to nonmembers who benefit  from their work. Without that rule, employees would be encouraged to be  free riders and just get the benefit of what the union is doing without  making any contribution to support it whatsoever. Of course, if that  were to happen, the balance of power between corporations and unions  would shift further toward corporations.    The story is told quite well in the New York Times by a reporter  named Adam Liptak, who is a Supreme Court reporter. I will read his  story.         In making a minor adjustment to how public unions must       issue notifications about their political spending, Justice       Alito digressed to raise questions about the       constitutionality of requiring workers who are not members of       public unions to pay fees for the unions' work on their       behalf. . . . Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw what was going on.       ``To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedence,'' she       wrote in a concurrence, ``is a step we historically take only       with the greatest caution and reticence. To do so, as the       majority does, on our own invitation and without adversarial       presentation is both unfair and unwise.''        Michael A. Carvin, a leading conservative lawyer, also saw       what was going on. He and the Center for Individual Rights, a       libertarian group, promptly filed the challenge Justice Alito       had sketched out.    I would say that he had invited.         Indeed, Mr. Carvin asked the lower courts to rule against       his clients, a Christian education group and 10 California       teachers, so they could high-tail it to the Supreme Court.    Let me interrupt my reading of the story for a second and make the  point that this lawyer wanted to lose his case in the lower courts. It  is rare for lawyers to go into a court wanting to lose. You have to  have kind of a weird motive to take a case into court that you want to  lose. The obvious motive here is that Mr. Carvin had heard the signal  from Justice Alito that he was willing to rule his way if he would just  bring the right case. So it didn't matter whether he won or lost.  Losing is actually quicker. It gets you right up to the Supreme Court.  He is not interested in litigating the matter truly on the merits; he  is only interested in getting as quickly as possible to the Supreme  Court. Why? Because he knew that 5 to 4, he would get the right  decision.   When you are a lawyer, the most sickening feeling you can have is to  go into court with the belief that the judges you are going to argue  before are prejudged against you. The confidence that Carvin must have  had to want to lose a case deliberately below so that he could hightail  it at high speed up to a court that he knew was going to rule his way  because they told him they would--that is not American justice in the  way it should be delivered.   As it turned out, they took up the case. It was called Friedrichs. It  was going to be 5 to 4, just as expected, and then Justice Scalia  unexpectedly passed away. If you read about how the press took that, it  was very clear that the fix had been in on this case.         ``Corporate America had high hopes,'' the Journal said,       because ``the Supreme Court appeared poised to deliver long-      sought conservative victories.''    Since when should a court be poised to deliver long-sought  conservative victories, not fair, dispassionate adjudication? But that  is the reporting of the friendly Wall Street Journal. And those long- sought conservative victories were going to take the form of `` `body  blow[s] that business had sought against consumer and worker  plaintiffs.' The cases `had been carefully developed by activists to  capitalize on the court's rightward tilt.' ''   Come on. This is not adjudication any longer; it is just the exercise  of political power. And these 5-to-4 partisan decisions by the Supreme  Court are degrading the reputation of the Supreme Court, they are  degrading the integrity of the Supreme Court, and they are degrading  the role of the judiciary in our vaunted scheme of constitutional  government in the United States of America.   With that, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Oregon.
