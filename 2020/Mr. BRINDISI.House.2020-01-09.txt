 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I want to thank my colleagues from across the aisle, Mr.  Reed from New York and Mr. Gallagher from Wisconsin, for their support  of this amendment.   Support for clean air and protecting public health are not Democratic  or Republican values. They are American values, and I am glad to work  with my colleagues on this commonsense amendment.   My amendment is straightforward. First, it requires immediate action  on the most dangerous types of PFAS, including PFOA, which has been  found at elevated levels in drinking water in many communities,  including Hoosick Falls in upstate New York.   For these obsolete chemistries, EPA would be required to swiftly list  these and hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. While we  take action on the chemicals of greatest concern, we will also give the  EPA time for a thoughtful, science-based process that acknowledges the  differences across PFAS chemicals.   Our amendment will give the EPA 5 years to establish risk-based  standards that protect human health and the environment for the many  other types of PFAS chemicals.   This will bring the Clean Air Act provisions into line with the  CERCLA provisions in this bill. We need to be thoughtful in this  process. Protecting public health will make sure that our decisions are  informed by the best science available.   This amendment is a commonsense compromise that strikes that balance.  I, again, thank Congresswoman Dingell and Chairman Pallone, as well as  Chairman Tonko for their work on this important legislation, and their  willingness to work with me on our amendment.   I thank Congresswoman Stevens for her work raising the issue of air  contamination when it comes to PFAS chemicals.   I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  2100     Mr. Chairman, I again urge adoption of my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment as the designee  of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Congressman Kim, for writing this  amendment, and I rise on his behalf to offer it tonight.   This amendment is straightforward. It ensures that the list of  technologies that are most effective in removing PFAS from drinking  water are made public and available for public comment prior to final  publication. This will allow healthy debate and discussion by  scientific experts, universities, industry, and the public to help  understand the most effective means of cleanup. By allowing the public  to see this information, we can help ensure the EPA is putting our best  ideas and methods toward cleaning up these chemicals and making our  drinking water safe.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this commonsense amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.
