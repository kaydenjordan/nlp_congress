 Mr. President, today I wish to discuss S. 1309, the  Combating Global Corruption Act of 2019. There is heightened awareness  in the United States, the Western Hemisphere region, and around the  world that corruption is a serious threat to democracy, stability,  global security.   Corruption erodes trust and confidence in democratic institutions,  the rule of law, and human rights protections. It damages America's  global competitiveness and creates barriers to economic growth in  international markets. It threatens our national and international  security by fostering the conditions for violent extremism and  weakening institutions associated with governance and accountability.  As Transparency International noted in its 2018 Corruption Perceptions  Index published this January, failure to curb corruption is  contributing to a worldwide crisis of democracy. According to Freedom  House, in 2017, democracy faced its most serious crisis in decades and  marked the 12th consecutive year of decline in global freedom.   We have all seen the headlines, from scandals in Liberia, Hungary,  and Guatemala, to the doping by Russian athletes and their subsequent  ban from the 2016 Summer Olympics, to the Panama Papers. It is clear  that where there are high levels of corruption we find fragile states,  authoritarian states, or states suffering from internal or external  conflict, in places such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iraq, Syria,  Somalia, Nigeria, and Sudan.   The problem of corruption and the dysfunction that follows it can be  difficult to address because it is like a hydra, with many corrupt  actors that can include government officials, businessmen, law  enforcement, military personnel, and organized criminal groups.  Corruption is a system that operates via extensive, entrenched networks  in both the public and private sectors. It is ubiquitous and pervasive.   We must address it. We can't throw up our hands and accept corruption  as the status quo because the costs of not addressing and rooting it  out are too great. Corruption fuels violent extremism, pushing young  people toward violence, because they lose faith in the institutions  that are supposed to protect and serve them. Corruption feeds the  destructive fire of criminal networks and transnational crime. Citizens  lose faith in the social compact between governments and the people.  Terrorist groups use corruption to recruit followers to their hateful  cause. It is a vicious cycle.   The human cost of corruption is substantial. Across the globe,  millions of men, women, and children are victims of modern day slavery.  Corruption enables their trafficking within and among countries.  Corruption is a constant companion to modern day slavery and the  suffering that it brings. We also have seen this play out in the  refugee and migrant crisis, with thousands drowning in the  Mediterranean, victims of trafficking networks and corrupt government  officials who facilitate this illicit business. Make no mistake,  corruption is big business. UNICEF estimates that human traffickers  generate $32 billion in profits by smuggling 21 million men, women, and  children through corrupt networks every year.   Let's be clear-eyed: Any fight against corruption will be long-term  and difficult. It is a fight against powerful people, powerful  companies, and powerful interests. It is about changing a mindset and a  culture as much as it is about establishing and enforcing laws. As my  colleagues and constituents know, my attention has long been focused on  fighting corruption. I was proud to sponsor the Global Magnitsky Human  Rights Accountability Act with our late colleague Senator John McCain,  an unwavering enemy of corruption throughout the globe. That bipartisan  bill was enacted into law in late 2016, and I applaud the Trump  administration for aggressively using the act to target human rights  abusers and corrupt individuals around the globe who threaten the rule  of law and deny fundamental freedoms, but the problem of corruption is  enormous; we simply must do more.   I want to briefly discuss something that is hard to capture in  legislation. It is something that I grappled with when drafting this  bill. It is something that perhaps, more than anything, will dictate if  we win this struggle against corruption. That is bipartisan political  will, which as so critical in advancing the Global Magnitsky Act.  Global Magnitsky took several years to enact because some in Congress,  as well as some Obama administration officials, were concerned about  the political and practical ramifications of the bill.   Another example of the impact of a lack of political will on fighting  corruption is particularly salient this week, as we mourn the passing  of our dear colleague, former Senator Richard Lugar. In 2010, Senator  Lugar and I were able to get one of the most powerful anti-corruption  and antipoverty laws enacted.   Senator Lugar and I worked on the bill that would become section 1504  of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the ``Cardin-Lugar provision,'' for  several years. Over the course of our tenures on Foreign Relations  Committee, we had seen clear evidence that secrecy breeds corruption  and that corruption can breed instability and perpetuate poverty in  resource-rich countries. The Cardin-Lugar provision requires that all  foreign and domestic companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges and  involved in oil, gas, and mineral resource extraction must publish the  project-level payments they make to the foreign countries in which they  operate. The enactment of this provision was a watershed moment in  which the United States reclaimed its position as a leader in the  effort to increase global accountability and transparency. It took 6  years for the Securities and Exchange Commission to finally issue a  rule to implement the law--6 years. That is the length of a term of a  U.S. Senator. It is college and a master's degree. It took 6 years for  the United States to act on this bill. It took that long because some  people believed that less transparency is a good thing. Some groups  believed that accountability should take a back seat to profitability.  Unfortunately, the rule was repealed by Congress in February 2017.   Congress has a responsibility to reaffirm our bipartisan commitment  to combatting corruption not only to honor the legacies of our late  colleagues Senator Lugar and Senator  [[Page S2633]]  McCain. We also must act to show solidarity with the millions of brave  human rights defenders, anti-poverty advocates, journalists, and  investigators who put their lives at risk every day--and sometimes pay  the ultimate price--to fight the scourge of corruption and impunity.   I am proud that last week Senator Young and I, along with Senators  Leahy, Rubio, Blumenthal, and Merkley, reaffirm bipartisan political  will to combat global corruption by reintroducing the Combating Global  Corruption Act, S. 1309. Our bill makes clear that the United States  must meet the scale of the problem of corruption with greater resolve  and commitment. To do that, our bill focuses on four things.    First, we must institutionalize the fight against corruption as a  national security priority. Our bill requires the State Department to  produce an annual report, similar to the Trafficking in Persons Report,  which takes a close look at each country's efforts to combat  corruption. That model, which has effectively advanced the effort to  combat modern day slavery, will similarly embed the issue of corruption  in our collective work, so that we hold governments to account. This  bill establishes minimum standards for combating corruption, standards  that should be part and parcel of every government's commitment to its  citizens. These include whether a country has laws that recognize  corrupt acts for the crimes they are--violations of the people's  trust--along with appropriate penalties for breaking that trust,  whether a country has an independent judiciary for deciding corruption  cases, free from influence and abuse, whether there is support for  civil society organizations that are the watchdogs of integrity against  would-be thieves of the state. This bill, hopefully, will build  anticorruption DNA into the foundations of government action.   Second, in the United States, our whole-of-government effort must be  better coordinated. Right now, we work across multiple agencies and in  multiple offices to combat corruption. There is much information and  many best practices that can be shared; we have got to do better at  that and take advantage of those areas where we have been successful.  The State Department and the United States Agency for International  Development have done great work, but the vast nature of the problem  requires that we improve our ability to tackle it. In this bill,  agencies and bureaus and our missions overseas will have to prioritize  corruption into their strategic planning as an essential part of our  foreign policy work, a step that I believe will foster greater  cooperation.   Third, we must improve oversight of our own foreign assistance and  promote transparency. The U.S. taxpayer has a right to know how our  foreign assistance is being spent and also should feel confident that  we are doing the kind of risk assessments, analysis, and oversight that  ensure our assistance to other countries is having the effect we want  it to have. Our bill consolidates information and puts it online, where  citizens can see the numbers and the programs. That kind of  transparency is in and of itself good, but in my experience it has the  effect of making us better at self-policing our work. We can use the  data to capture redundancies and analyze trends, which I believe will  make our decision-making better. The bill embeds oversight into our  foreign assistance programs overseas, maintaining the flexibility we  need to meet our goals rapidly while also holding government to  account.   In fact, it is a natural complement to the Foreign Assistance  Transparency and Accountability Act, a bipartisan law Senator Rubio and  I cosponsored that looks at our foreign aid and seeks to ensure that  our foreign assistance programs are tracked and evaluated adequately  and appropriately.   I am a believer in the power of example. This ``one-two'' punch of  the Combating Global Corruption Act and the Foreign Assistance  Transparency Act strengthens our foreign assistance policy,  demonstrates that we hold ourselves to the highest standards, and shows  other countries that we are committed to this fight.   Finally, we have to find ways to resource anti-corruption work.  Corruption is big business and big money. We should look for ways to  use seized assets and ill-gotten proceeds to build civil society  capacity to fight corruption and make it easier to transfer these  assets to the appropriate effort. We have also witnessed the damaging  impact of corruption on our foreign assistance efforts. The Combating  Global Corruption Act understands that corruption risk assessment  before, during, and after the provision of foreign aid and security  assistance is integral to reducing and eliminating corruption. It holds  U.S. foreign assistance and security assistance programs accountable to  U.S. taxpayers by specifying transparency and accountability measures  for the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the U.S.  Agency for International Development to advance anti-corruption efforts  in those countries where the U.S. administers foreign and security  assistance.   As we project the American values of good governance and  anticorruption abroad, we must also redouble our efforts to strengthen  these core values here in the United States. Unfortunately, these  values have been put into question under our current administration.  Our concerns run deeper than noticing the lack of priority given to  anti-corruption and good governance policies. U.S. credibility has been  weakening on this issue. In turn, our U.S. foreign policy is  threatened.   For the 3rd straight year, the Trump administration, through its  budget request, sent a message to the world of its priorities for the  United States. For the 3rd straight year, the Trump administration  proposed drastic cuts to the State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs--SFOPS--budget, which would cut foreign assistance funding by  more than 30 percent. This also came amidst the recent decision to cut  off foreign assistance to the Northern Triangle of Central America, a  region of the world where U.S. assistance in combating corruption has a  direct impact on our national security. This decision threatens to  undermine the critical anti-corruption programming that helps us combat  narcotics trafficking groups and violent gangs, as well as to address  the root causes of migration. For this very reason, the bipartisan  U.S.--Central America strategy names good governance as one of its  central pillars.   This is why for Fiscal Year 2020, I asked the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs to  include at least $500,000 for the Department of State and $500,000 for  the U.S. Agency for International Development to achieve meaningful and  robust implementation of the activities outlined in the Combating  Global Corruption Act. This includes the bill's reporting requirements,  staffing, and staff training to support anticorruption as a foreign  policy and development priority. This bipartisan bill recognizes the  importance of combating corruption as a hurdle to achieving peace,  prosperity, and human rights around the world. Passage of S. 1309 would  signal to the international community that the U.S. Congress has not  forgotten U.S. values and that we will continue to fight to ensure such  values and U.S. credibility remain intact.   There is only one United States of America. There is only one country  that can do what we can do, and this bill sends the message that we  will continue to fight to ensure that stature does not change.   I am under no illusion that this global fight against corruption will  be easy. It will make the work of our government agencies more  challenging. It will make our diplomacy more challenging. It will  require political will, but political will finds its source and its  strength in our values. Political will is created when we embrace those  values. Political will endures in good governance, accountability, and  transparency and those values that are at the core of the compact  between the government and the governed.   As this bill moves forward, I urge my colleagues to find the  political will to combat global corruption, ensure accountability, and  keep our commitment to the best of American values.                            ____________________
