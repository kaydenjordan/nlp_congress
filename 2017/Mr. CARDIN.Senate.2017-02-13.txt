 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I take this time to explain to my  colleagues why I will be opposing Steve Mnuchin's nomination for  Secretary of the Treasury.   Mr. Mnuchin has an impressive record of accomplishment, and I admire  his willingness to serve the public. But because of his advocacy for  fiscally irresponsible and unfair fiscal policies, which I believe will  add to the deficit of this country, I cannot support his nomination.   Let me go back a while, if I may. I was in the Congress when we  passed a budget that balanced the Federal budget, where we were  actually reducing the Federal debt. It was controversial at the time  because we did it by cutting spending first--and we did--but making  sure we had adequate revenues in the Treasury to pay our bills because  we recognized that we had a moral obligation to pay our bills, that we  are wealthy enough of a nation that we don't have to ask our children  and grandchildren to pay for our spending today. We took the steps to  balance the Federal budget, and we did it by making some tough votes. I  was proud to be in the Congress that took those tough votes that  balanced the Federal budget.   After we balanced the Federal budget, we saw unprecedented economic  growth because we took the responsible actions. We should take a lesson  from the past and recognize that there is no easy way to get our budget  in better balance. It requires a fiscal policy that is fair--that is  fair to middle-income families, that is fair to our children and  grandchildren, that is fair to those who depend upon the services that  are financed through the government sector, including our seniors with  Medicare and Social Security. We can do that if we work together.   But Mr. Mnuchin's economic plan, the one that he has submitted to  Congress, I think, would put us at great risk. The main part of what he  is advocating is tax cuts primarily for the wealthy. The top 0.1  percent under the Mnuchin plan will receive in excess of $1 million in  tax breaks; the upper 1 percent in excess of $200,000 in tax cuts.   Here is the problem: How do we pay for this? How do we offset the  cost of these tax cuts? Because I don't think any of us wants to add to  the deficit.   So we asked Mr. Mnuchin that question during the confirmation  process. Let me just read for the Record the questions that I asked him  as to how he would offset the cost of the tax cuts. The Trump plan,  including those cuts, is estimated by the Tax Policy Center to add $6.2  trillion to the deficit and by the Tax Foundation to add $3.9 trillion  to the deficit.   I asked Mr. Mnuchin:         In your hearing, you discussed the importance of economic       growth in offsetting the revenues lost under the President's       tax reform plan. . . . For instance, you've said, ``[s]o we       think that by cutting corporate taxes, we'll create huge       economic growth and we'll have huge personal income, so the       revenues will be offset on the other side.''        Is it your view that the tax cuts in the President's plan       will be fully offset by economic growth?    That is the question I asked.   Mr. Mnuchin's answer: ``Our objective is to have any tax cuts offset  by economic growth.''   I asked: ``If so, could you please share your team's analysis  supporting that position?''   Mr. Mnuchin's answer: ``Our objective is to have any tax cuts offset  by economic growth.''   I then asked: ``Will you commit, as we discussed in our meeting, not  to put forward a plan that will increase the deficit and put our  country in a worse financial position?''   Mr. Mnuchin's answer: ``Our objective is to have any tax cuts offset  by economic growth.''   In other words, there is no effort here to offset the cost of this  tax cut, other than borrowing money, putting our children and  grandchildren at greater risk.   I want to repeat again the estimate that we have heard on the  President's tax proposal--that it will add anywhere from $6 trillion to  almost $4 trillion in deficit. Those estimates are from progressive and  conservative groups, and they do consider that there will be some  dynamic score keeping here, that there will be some economic growth.  That is in those estimates. So even with economic growth, these  proposals will greatly enhance the deficit of this country, something  that we should not be doing.   What does that mean? You increase the debt of this country. America  has to borrow more. Interest rates go up. Middle-income families have  to pay more on mortgage payments or car loans.   Middle income families are the ones who get hurt by this. If we are  going to see real economic growth, we have to help the middle class-- the growing middle class--the consumers, those who buy the goods, those  who are struggling every day to make ends meet. This plan doesn't help  them. What they are going to be saddled with is more debt and higher  interest costs, which will be a drag on our economic growth.   So for all those reasons, I think what is important to have is an  advocate for the President as Secretary of the Treasury, someone who  recognizes the balance here.   Let me tell you what else deficits do. They are used as justification  to continue to cut our discretionary spending accounts, as well as to  take a look at entitlement spending.   I acknowledge that, as part of the strategy to balance the Federal  budget, we must look at our spending, but we have to have the revenues  in order to make it balance. If you don't have the revenues, and you  are taking another $4 to $6 trillion out of the equation, there is  going to be a lot more pressure to make irresponsible cuts on the  spending side.   I heard Candidate Trump talk about that we are not going to cut  Social Security. But can you really have $6 trillion of tax cuts  without looking at Social Security? And how about Medicare? These are  programs that are vitally important for our seniors. It provides them  money to live on so they don't have to live in poverty, so they can pay  their medical bills. For a majority of seniors, Social Security is  their largest source of income. Are we really thinking about equating  that with tax cuts for the wealthiest in this country of over $1  million? I don't think that is fairness. I don't think that is what we  should be doing.   When you look at the programs that are financed through government,  are we going to take away from our students? They already are suffering  too high, as far as the cost of attending colleges. Interest rates are  already too high in regards to what they do.   Are we going to put more pressure to make more cuts in regards to how  we help our students? Are we going to cut maintaining our highways? We  want to spend more on highways, bridges, transit systems, and water  infrastructure, which I think we need to do. How do you do that if you  cut $4 to $6 trillion of revenue on the revenue side without adding  greatly to the deficit, which is something none of us wants to do?  [[Page S1105]]    How about something like our national parks? We take pride and want  to maintain that, but with the pressure on the budgets that is a result  of taking the revenues out of government, we know what is going to  happen. We have seen this movie before. We have seen what has happened  before. The driving force behind all of this is that the most important  thing, the most important part of the economic program, is to have  these tax cuts primarily for the wealthy.   No, I think the center of our economic policy needs to be fairness-- fairness for middle-income families, fairness so that Americans can  afford to raise their families and send their kids to college and can  afford to have decent opportunities in this country. That is how we all  grow together, and that requires a balanced approach to our Nation's  budget--one that, yes, looks at restraining spending but also looks at  having a Tax Code that is fair and raises the revenues to pay our bills  and not pushing that off to future generations.   I think for all those reasons, we need a person who is going to  advocate on behalf of middle-income families and on behalf of a growing  economy. I think the plan that Mr. Mnuchin is advocating will not  accomplish that. For these reasons and others, I cannot support his  nomination for Secretary of the Treasury.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
