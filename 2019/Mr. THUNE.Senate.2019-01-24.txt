 Mr. President, this afternoon Senate Democrats will have  the opportunity to vote to reopen the government when the Senate takes  up the President's compromise proposal. I hope they are as serious  about ending the shutdown as they have claimed to be.   Unfortunately, they haven't looked too serious over the past month.  Democratic leaders have spent a lot of time talking about ending the  partial shutdown, but they have absolutely refused to engage in any  genuine negotiations to reopen the government. Democrats don't seem to  understand that when there is a disagreement, both sides have to give a  little in order to get things resolved. If we are going to get the  government reopened, then both Democrats and the President are going to  have to compromise.   The President understands this. He has repeatedly made it clear that  he is willing to negotiate. On Saturday, he put forward a genuine  compromise--legislation that addresses his border security priorities  and some of Democrats' most important immigration priorities.   Unfortunately, Democrats' reaction was less than promising. The  Speaker of the House labeled the compromise a ``nonstarter'' before she  had even seen it. But, of course, she offered no replacement.   President Trump offered a proposal that he believed would address  some of the Democrats' concerns. If Democrats didn't like that  proposal, then they could have offered an alternative--one that  addressed their concerns and attempted to address some of the  President's concerns. But so far, the only Democratic proposals have  involved the President agreeing to all of the Democrats' demands in  exchange for vague promises to address the security and humanitarian  crisis at the border at some unspecified date in the future.   The Democratic leaders of the House and Senate may be persisting in  their refusal to negotiate, but there are signs that rank-and-file  Democrats are  [[Page S547]]  starting to get restless. More than one Democratic Member of Congress  has noted, in the words of one House freshman, ``[A]m I willing to talk  about more fencing and more drones and more technology and radar and  border agents? Absolutely.''   Even the House majority leader sounded as though he was ready to  break with Speaker Pelosi's obstruction, stating that Democrats are  ``for border security'' and that ``physical barriers are part of the  solution.'' That is from the House majority leader.   I hope that spirit of compromise continues to grow. In a couple of  hours, Senate Democrats will have the chance to vote on the President's  proposal. The bill before us would immediately--immediately--reopen the  government. It would provide paychecks and backpay to Federal workers.  It would provide needed disaster recovery funding. It would deliver all  seven of the remaining 2019 appropriations bills, the product of  bipartisan work in the House and in the Senate. It would tackle the  security and humanitarian crisis at our border and address Democratic  immigration priorities.   In fact, this bill contains a version of immigration legislation  originally sponsored by the Democratic leader, the Democratic whip, and  the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, among others.   The bill before us today is a genuine compromise. I hope at least  some of my Democratic colleagues will see their way to supporting it  because it is the only legislation we will be voting on today that can  be signed into law, end the shutdown, reopen the government, make sure  that Federal workers are getting paid, and address our crisis at the  border.   Democrats' refusal to engage in serious negotiations has already cost  Federal workers a paycheck and limited government services for  literally tens of thousands of Americans. It is time for Democrats to  stop putting their antipathy for the President above the needs of the  American people. I hope we do that this afternoon. The time has come to  make a deal, and we need Democrats at the table.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), and  the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kentucky (Mr. Paul) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch)  would have voted ``yea''.

Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch)  would have voted ``nay''.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
