 Mr. Speaker, we don't want to go to  school in a prison. That was the message I heard today from five  incredible students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, Florida.   As they get ready for their school to reopen, what kind of school  will we be sending them and all of our children back to? It should not  be one of armed teachers. They should be there to teach. What they need  are real solutions.   Military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines are  designed for the sole purpose of killing as many people as possible.  They have no place on our streets.   No matter what gun you are buying, nobody should be able to complete  a purchase without clearing a background check. That is common sense.   But Republicans are refusing to act because the NRA and gun  manufacturers value profits over safety. That is not right.   The students told me today that they want to make ending gun violence  a priority for their generation, and that means acting today.                            ____________________
