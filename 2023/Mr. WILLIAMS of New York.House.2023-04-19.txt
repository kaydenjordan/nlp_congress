 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, within just a few years, our Nation will task the first  women with the awesome responsibility of commanding our nuclear  submarines. These submarines will serve on the front lines of any  future global conflict, and they are among the most feared and powerful  weapons in the world. Women who will command these boats will lead many  of the finest sailors our Nation has ever seen.   In nearly every case, these women's paths to this extraordinary  responsibility and this extraordinary call to leadership begin with and  traveled through their competitiveness in sports.   Leadership, excellence, teamwork, inspiration, and sacrifice are all  learned and earned on the sports field. They are champions. They are  scholars. They are warriors.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 734 in celebration of the  dramatic impact that women's competitive sports has brought to our  Nation and are now adding to the defense of our Nation.
