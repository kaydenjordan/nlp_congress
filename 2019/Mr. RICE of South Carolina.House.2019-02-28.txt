 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, Dylann Roof is a monster.  Dylann Roof should never have been able to buy a gun. Dylann Roof  walked into a church in my hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, my  birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, and he slaughtered nine  people in a Bible study. I can't imagine a more horrific crime. We all,  naturally, look for a response.   My friend, Mr. Clyburn, and the majority have noted that thousands of  people have wrongfully acquired guns because of the failure of our  background check system under what has become known as the Charleston  loophole.   The stated purpose of this underlying legislation, Mr. Clyburn's  legislation, is certainly noble: to close the Charleston loophole. The  only problem is that it does not carry out that purpose.   Too often here, we take up noble causes; we create legislation with  noble names; we pass this legislation to feel better; but the  legislation fails to solve the problem in the title.   After these horrific murders, the families of the victims sued the  Federal Government for allowing this monster to buy a gun.                                time  1015    Charleston Federal District Court Judge Gergen wrote a lengthy  opinion in which he laid bare the Federal background check process and  its failures in this case, the case of Dylann Roof. His opinion is  available for anybody to read.   And in his 22-page opinion, he lays out the various structural flaws  in the background check system. Most notably, that the FBI maintains  four criminal databases. And under the background check system, the  background checker is allowed to check only three of those.   Why? I assume because those are the three that existed in the  nineties when the background check came into place.   There is a fourth one. It is more extensive and it is more detailed.  It is called N-DEx. In this file was all the information that Dylann  Roof's background checker needed to know to deny him the right to buy  the gun. This N-DEx system contained that information, and it is  maintained by the FBI. All they had to do was allow this background  checker to look at that. The FBI has admitted had they been able to do  that, this man--this monster--would never have been able to buy a gun.   My amendment would actually fix the Charleston loophole. The problem  is that I cannot support the underlying legislation. Why? Because it  creates an undue amount of time to be able to buy a gun.   And number two, the thing that bothers me the most, is that it shifts  a part of the burden to the American citizen trying to exercise his  Second Amendment rights. It requires him, in the event that you don't  hear back from the government, to file a petition with the Federal  court. I think this is an undue interference with his Second Amendment  right; therefore, I cannot accept this underlying legislation.   The Senate has indicated it will not be taken up in the Senate; and  the President has indicated that, if it passed, he would veto it.  Therefore, I plan to withdraw my amendment.   I plan to offer it separately as a new piece of legislation, which  will, in fact, close the Charleston loophole. It will allow the FBI  background checkers to search the most current N-DEx file that has all  this detailed information that was created after 9/11, well after the  background check law came into effect.   The FBI has admitted, it would have prevented Dylann Roof from buying  a gun and, I suspect, many of the other people who have carried out  these horrific shootings in recent years.   It will hopefully garner the bipartisan support necessary to actually  become law and fix the underlying problem.   Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.
