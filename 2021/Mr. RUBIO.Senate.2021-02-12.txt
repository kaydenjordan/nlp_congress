 Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is from the Senator from  Florida, and it is to both sides.   The clerk will read the question. The House managers will go first  for the first 2\1/2\ minutes.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Voting to convict the former President would create a new       precedent that a former official can be convicted and       disqualified by the Senate. Therefore, is it not true that       under this new precedent, a future House, facing partisan       pressure to ``Lock her up,'' could impeach a former Secretary       of State and a future Senate be forced to put her on trial       and potentially disqualify from any future office?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers go first.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, Senators, three quick points here.   First of all, I don't know how many times I can say it. The  jurisdictional issue is over. It is gone. The Senate settled it. The  Senate entertained jurisdiction exactly the way it has done since the  very beginning of the Republic in the Blount case, in the Belknap case,  and you will remember, both of them, former officials.   In this case, we have a President who committed his crimes against  the Republic while he was in office. He was impeached by the House of  Representatives while he was in office. So the hypothetical suggested  by the gentleman  [[Page S693]]  from Florida has no bearing on this case because I don't think you  ar talking about an official who was impeached while they were in  office for conduct that they committed while they were in office.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The counsel for the former President has  2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Thank you.   Could I have the question read again to make sure I have it right and  can answer it directly?   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Voting to convict the former President would create a new       precedent that a former official can be convicted and       disqualified by the Senate. Therefore, is it not true that       under this new precedent, a future House, facing partisan       pressure to ``Lock her up,'' could impeach a former Secretary       of State and a future Senate be forced to put her on trial       and potentially disqualify from any future office?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. If you see it their way, yes. If you do  this the way they want it done, that could happen to, the example  there, a former Secretary of State. But it could happen to a lot of  people, and that is not the way this is supposed to work. Not only  could it happen to a lot of people, it would become much more regular  too.   But I want to address that, and I want you to be clear on this. Mr.  Raskin can't tell you on what grounds you acquit. If you believe--even  though there was a vote that there is jurisdiction, if you believe  jurisdiction is unconstitutional, you can still believe that. If you  believe that the House did not give appropriate due process in this,  that can be your reason to acquit. If you don't think they met their  burden in proving incitement, that these words incited the violence,  you can acquit. Mr. Raskin doesn't get to give you under what grounds  you can acquit. So you have to look at what they have put on in its  totality and come to your own understanding as to whether you think  they have met their burden to impeach.   But the original question is an absolutely slippery slope that I  don't really think anybody here wants to send this country down.   Thank you.
