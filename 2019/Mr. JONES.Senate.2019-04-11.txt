 Mr. President, today I wish to offer a resolution  recognizing the critical contributions the laboratories of the  Department of Defense make to the national security of this country.  The 63 Laboratories, Warfare Centers, and Engineering Centers of the  Department of Defense spread across 22 states and the District of  Columbia are important components of the U.S. warfighting establishment  and are instrumental in maintaining the technological edge of our  military forces. My resolution would highlight the contributions of  these laboratories by designating April 25, 2019, as ``Department of  Defense Laboratory Day 2019'' in order to celebrate the work and  accomplishments of the men and women in those defense labs. Many of the  technological advantages upon which our military rests are rooted in  the diligent, dedicated work and innovative mindset of the scientists  and engineers in our defense labs. Their work drives not only the near- term, tactical innovations needed to support our soldiers, sailors,  airmen and marines in the wars of the past century, but they are  critical foundations of research that will fuel the processes and  technologies needed for the next century and beyond. In addition to the  cutting-edge research and development of new technologies, our defense  laboratories are a resource to the national economy and innovation  ecosystem of the nation--providing the people, facilities, experience,  operational problems, and capabilities for technology transfer that  support the warfighter, industry,  [[Page S2441]]  academia, other parts of federal government, and even many of our  allies and partners throughout the world. The nearly 76,000 scientists  and engineers employed by the Department of Defense labs are exemplars  of public service, and the outstanding dedication, qualifications,  service, and accomplishments of these scientists, engineers,  technicians, and support staff of the defense laboratories should make  all Americans proud.   In recognizing the men and women of the defense labs, I am especially  proud of the contributions Alabama makes. As the home to multiple Army  laboratories--including the Aviation and Missile Center, Space and  Missile Defense Technical Center, and the Army Aeromedical Research  Laboratory--Alabama punches far above its weight in terms of  contributions of people, facilities and resources to the defense  laboratory network. This results in one of the highest per capita  concentrations of scientists and engineers in the country, with an  extraordinary economic impact on the State. Not only do these labs  provide thousands of jobs in Alabama, they bring in billions of dollars  in investments and return those dollars back into the communities in  which they reside.   The network of Department of Defense laboratories is not just an  asset for the Department, but is a national asset as well. With over a  hundred DoD-funded Nobel prizes, and thousands of patents and  publications, defense laboratories are technological and economic  engines on par with any industry or university laboratory. I applaud  the work of the defense labs, and all of the scientists and engineers  that make them successful, especially those in Alabama. I urge my  colleagues to support the contributions of the labs by supporting the  proclamation of April 25th as the 2019 Laboratory Day.                            ____________________
