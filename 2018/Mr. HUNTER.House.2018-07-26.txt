 Mr. Speaker, imagine living in a country where the  Federal Government decides whether you are jailed or set free based on  your politics. Well, don't imagine anymore. It is real and it is  happening right here. My colleagues are right to introduce Articles of  Impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.   The Department of Justice is corrupt, answerable to no one, and uses  a law to extort the American people and effect political change.  Loretta Lynch, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Rod Rosenstein, Bob Mueller,  and countless others in the DOJ and FBI who will never be found out,  tried to undermine our last Presidential election and destroy our  President, duly elected by the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I call on this Congress to root out all of the corrupt  lawyers and bureaucrats in the DOJ and FBI so the greatest President of  my generation can do the work that the American people duly elected him  to do.   Over the next 5 weeks, Congress will not be around to watch the  President's back and hold those subversive, partisan officials  accountable. For 5 weeks, the lies and coverups and destruction of the  President and his family and associates will continue unchallenged.   The President needs the support and prayers of the American people  now more than ever. I look forward to the day when the American people  can trust the institutions created to protect them, instead of fearing  the retribution of a rigged, politically driven, and corrupt legal  system.                            ____________________
