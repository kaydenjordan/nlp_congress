 Mr. President, a year ago today, we witnessed one of the  worst assaults on our democracy in living memory. For those of us who  were in the Chamber--that includes virtually every Senator--there are  images which are emblazoned in our memory. Mine, like others, was of a  Vice President sitting, where you are sitting, who shortly after 2 p.m.  in the afternoon was pulled off of the dais by two of his security  detail and hurried out that door. It is an unusual thing to happen  under any circumstances, but while we were counting the electoral  college returns, it was amazing and unprecedented.   Then they came up and the Capitol Police instructed us: Stay at your  desk. This is going to be a secure room. We are going to start bringing  in all the staff, and they will be lining the walls here. We will keep  you safe.   Well, we all sat there in anticipation of the next thing to happen  and, not 10 minutes later, another Capitol policeman came up and said:  That last directive is off. Evacuate this body, this room, as quickly  and orderly as possible.   And we all started piling out the doors. As we left and went down the  exit stairways just outside the doors of this Chamber, I looked out the  window and saw a sea of Trump signs converging on the Capitol. It was  an image I won't forget.   We went to what we considered to be a safe location and witnessed  over television what most of America was watching.   How serious was it? Well, one misguided soul, a Republican  Congressman from Georgia, said it was just a group of tourists-- tourists--in the Capitol.   Yesterday, the Attorney General of the United States, Merrick  Garland, had a press conference and remarked on the first anniversary  of January 6. And among the things he said was this: All of the  investigations--the criminal investigations of what happened that day-- have disclosed some horrible things: evidence of perpetrators punching  dozens of law enforcement officers, knocking them unconscious. Some  perpetrators tackled and dragged law enforcement officers. Among the  many examples of such violence, one officer was crushed in a door,  another was dragged down a set of stairs facedown, repeatedly tased and  beaten, and suffered a heart attack.   Some perpetrators attacked law enforcement officers with chemical  agents, burning their eyes and skins. We saw it--didn't we?--spraying  the bear spray in the faces of these officers.   Some assaulted officers with pipes and poles and other dangerous and  deadly weapons. Perpetrators targeted, assaulted, tackled, and harassed  journalists, destroying their equipment, and that launched the most  comprehensive and perhaps largest criminal prosecution in the history  of this Nation.   According to the Attorney General, 725 individuals have been charged  with a Federal crime, and 145 pled guilty already to Federal  misdemeanors. Over 325 have been charged with felonies, many for  assaulting officers and many for corruptly obstructing or attempting to  obstruct an official proceeding. Twenty defendants charged with  felonies have already pled guilty, and the investigation continues.   They talked about the assistance they received: over 300,000 tips  from ordinary citizens to help our government bring to justice those  responsible for January 6. I say that because I listened in disbelief  to the polling data which suggests that it really wasn't an attack on  the Capitol; it was only a visit of tourists who were in an orderly  fashion visiting this building. The videos don't lie. The facts are the  facts.   Individuals are paying a criminal price, and their lives will be  changed because of their bad decisions to leave the Trump rally and  follow his instructions to come up to this building. That is the  reality of what happened that day.   But the grimmest reality was the death of five of our law enforcement  officials, who have been named and should be named every time we stand  on this floor--Officer Brian Sicknick, Officer Howard Liebengood,  Officer Jeffrey Smith, Officer Gunther Hashida, and Officer Kyle  DeFreytag--and 140 other law enforcement officials who were assaulted,  many of them seriously, and are still paying the price for that day in  their lives when they stood in defense of us, in defense of this  building.   That is the reality, and if nothing more comes of this speech,  commemoration today, I hope that all of us, regardless of our political  persuasion--the most conservative Republican to the most progressive  Democrat, Independents in between; Black, White, and Brown; men and  women; rural, urban across America, will finally come to agreement on  one thing: Violence has no place in a democracy.   Those who resort to violence, wherever they fit on the political  spectrum, do not fit on that spectrum, do not belong in this country.  And what we saw a year ago today was violence unbridled, violence  provoked by a former President of the United States, and many innocent  people paid a price.   I listened as the President and Vice President spoke this morning in  Statuary Hall. It was a somber and meaningful occasion, as they talked  about what was at stake on January 6 and the challenge we face today.  And I thought for a moment what a difference it would have made, in  fact, as the President spoke, if Republican and Democratic leaders  stood by his side, but that was not to be the case.   You see, when the proposal was made for a bipartisan commission of  Democrats and Republicans--commissions we have seen in the past, from  9/11 and other events that marked our history--that was stopped by  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, by the threat  of a filibuster.   He wouldn't agree to a bipartisan commission to look into the origins  of January 6 and what we need to do to avoid them in the future. So I  want to salute Speaker Pelosi for organizing a bipartisan committee in  the U.S. House of Representatives, who is investigating this matter.   I want to salute my fellow Congressman from Illinois, Adam Kinzinger,  who has had the courage to step forward and be part of it, as well as  Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming and the Democrats who are part of  that effort. They are serving this Nation as they should: bringing  forth the facts, fighting the resistance from those who don't want to  tell the truth.   But there is more that we must do. It has been mentioned several  times and bears repeating: What is happening across America since  January 6 is equally alarming to this assault on the Capitol, and that  is the effort by dozens of States across the Nation to restrict  Americans' right to vote.   To think of it, in that last election in 2020, we had the largest  turnout in the history of the United States to cast votes in the  Presidential election, and the response by so many of these States  controlled by Republican legislatures is to try to do their best to  make sure that never happens again; to restrict the opportunity to vote  for eligible Americans, when we should be doing just the opposite.   I have won elections, and I have lost elections. As long as they were  fair elections, I accepted the results, and they all were. I was lucky.  Sometimes, I won; sometimes, I lost. But I felt at the end of the day  that they were fair elections. We should feel the same way about the  election that occurred the year before last, in 2020, with the election  of Joe Biden as President of the United States.   It was a fair election. It has been certified. I marvel at my  colleagues on the Republican side who come to the floor and say we have  no right to tell these States what their laws should be when it comes  to elections.   This little booklet is in each of our desks. I would commend to my  colleagues, particularly on the Republican side, to consider opening it  and consider reading article I, section 4. I would like to read into  the Record: ``The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for  Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the  Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or  alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.''   And you go further in and read the Bill of Rights and the amendments  to the Constitution. And then Amendment 15 says:         The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall       not be denied or abridged by the  [[Page S61]]       United States or by any State on account of race, color, or       previous condition of servitude.    Section 2 of the amendment says:         The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article       by appropriate legislation.    And yet Republican after Republican comes to the floor and questions  how we can have the audacity to suggest that we are establishing  standards so eligible voters across this country have an opportunity to  vote.   It is our constitutional responsibility to do it, and simply making  that eligibility turn into an actual exercise of that right is  consistent with our democracy.   I know other colleagues are here to speak today. I will close by  saying this: What brought that mob to this Capitol was the inspiration  of a former President, who provoked them, incited them, and turned them  loose on this building, and now, we are led to believe that he sat back  and watched on television, as the events unfolded, doing nothing--not  picking up the phone, not calling on anyone to stop the violence, to  stop the bloodshed, to stop the death that took place in this Capitol.  He did nothing for hours until, finally, enough forces came in to  reclaim this building.   When I saw the images, the photographs, and the videos of people who  were clowning in this Chamber, posing for photographs, going through my  desk and other desks, and others taking photographs with their phones,  sitting in that chair to pose for pictures to send back home, it makes  me sick to my stomach. This is a sacred place. It is not sacred because  I serve here or anyone else does. It is sacred because it was built to  be a symbol of this great Nation.   It was during the administration of a man from Illinois named  Lincoln, who completed the Capitol dome in the midst of a Civil War so  that this building would always be a symbol of the unity of our Nation  and the promise of our Nation.   That symbol was desecrated on January 6. And now, the question  arises: Will we summon the courage to come together and lead to extend  the opportunity to vote to more and more Americans, to make this  democracy more complete and more just? Or will we step back and accept  the verdict of history that we are going to go back in time instead of  forward as a Nation?   I trust we will move forward. These American people are great people.  Regardless of their political persuasion, they have one abiding  knowledge, and that is the fact that we are blessed to live in this  country, and we each bear a responsibility to its future.   I yield the floor.
