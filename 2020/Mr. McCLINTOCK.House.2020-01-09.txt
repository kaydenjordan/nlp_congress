 Mr. Speaker, our Constitution is clear that only  Congress can start a war, but only the President can wage it. Congress  started this war with the AUMF in 2002. It is still in effect.   The Founders didn't want one individual getting us into a war; but  once in it, they didn't want 535 squabbling prima donnas second- guessing every decision on the battlefield.   President Trump needed no other reason to order the attack that  killed Soleimani in Iraq, beyond the simple fact that he was acting as  an enemy combatant against U.S. forces in a war zone in which the  Congress had authorized the President to take military action.   I happen to believe the AUMF was a colossal mistake, but this  resolution doesn't correct that mistake. It compounds it by  deliberately undermining the position of the United States Government  and the Armed Forces that we sent to Iraq at a perilous moment, which  makes it not only unconstitutional, but disgraceful.
