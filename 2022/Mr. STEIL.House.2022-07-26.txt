 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10-year  anniversary of the horrific attack at the Oak Creek Sikh Gurdwara on  August 5, 2012. I rise to honor the memory of those we lost in that  attack.   On August 5, 2012, a shooting took place at the Sikh Temple of  Wisconsin, killing seven worshippers.   I also rise to honor Lieutenant Brian Murphy, who responded to the  scene and was shot at 15 times at close range.   This senseless act of violence should have never occurred and, in  particular, in a house of worship. Nonetheless, the Oak Creek community  came together. The Sikh community responded with compassion and stayed  true to the Sikh principle of Chardi Kala, translating to relentless  optimism.   I join the Oak Creek community to remember and honor the victims of  this tragedy.                           Impact of Rising Prices     Madam Speaker, every day I am home in Wisconsin, I hear  about the impact of rising prices and the impact that they are having  on families' budgets. Wisconsin's families and seniors have continued  to share their concerns with me about rising costs.   A 79-year-old woman in Janesville, Wisconsin, told me: Bryan, I drive  less and am more careful about what I buy in the grocery store because  I am on a fixed income.   A woman in Oak Creek said: Bryan, I am on a fixed income and with the  increased cost of medication, groceries, and gas, it is difficult to  stretch money until the next month's payment.   A 68-year-old woman from Kenosha, Wisconsin, said: Bryan, I am  delaying my retirement. Food costs and energy costs are out of control.   Madam Speaker, we need to change course. It is time we unleash  American energy, get spending under control, and address the issues  American families are facing every day.                Protect Our Communities from Illicit Fentanyl     Madam Speaker, illicit fentanyl is devastating our  communities. In Racine County last year, 68 people died from an illicit  fentanyl overdose. In Kenosha County, 48 people died of an illicit  fentanyl overdose death.   Illicit fentanyl is the leading cause of death for individuals aged  18 to 45. We must keep working to keep these drugs off our streets.   I am pleased to announce two of my amendments passed the House last  week.   The first amendment will support funding to combat fentanyl from  entering the country and strengthening border security. The second  amendment will support funding for high intensity drug trafficking  areas. This will be used to combat the increase in overdose deaths from  fentanyl and related substances. These amendments are an important step  in keeping these dangerous substances off our streets.   In order to stop the illicit fentanyl flow, we need to secure the  border, fund law enforcement, and make fentanyl-related substances a  permanent schedule I drug.   I encourage Congress to take the steps necessary to protect our  communities from this illicit substance.                           Children's Mental Health     Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 shutdowns exacerbated a  worsening crisis in our country. What I am talking about is our  children's mental health.   I recently sent a letter to the CDC regarding our youth's mental  health. The CDC has not released data on suicide rates among children.  Why?    The data on suicide rates in children is an important tool needed to  strengthen our mental health infrastructure across our country.   As we approach the coming school year, this critical data will help  us make informed decisions to support our children and improve their  mental health. I urge the CDC to release this important data regarding  our children's mental health.                       Quality Healthcare for Veterans     Madam Speaker, I will discuss an issue impacting veterans  in my district. I am continuing to hear stories from families in  Wisconsin about the quality of care at the State-run Wisconsin Veterans  Home in Union Grove.   The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in May that the State-run  veterans home ranks among one of the worst State-run veterans homes in  the entire country. This is unacceptable. The substandard care veterans  have  [[Page H7081]]  suffered at the Union Grove facility is abhorrent and must be addressed  immediately.   Two months ago, I asked for a Federal review of the State-run  facility. Our veterans and their families should be receiving the  highest-quality care at any facility in Wisconsin. The quality of care  at that facility has long been a concern of mine.   It is abundantly clear that the veterans home at Union Grove has much  larger issues than many imagined. We need to ensure our veterans are  receiving the care they deserve. I continue to call on the Department  of Veterans Affairs and CMS to provide a Federal review of the Union  Grove Veterans Home.                            ____________________
