 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with friends and  family of our former colleague and my personal friend, Earl F.  Hilliard, who this weekend will be celebrating his 75th birthday.   While a Member of this body, Earl and I worked very closely together  preserving the integrity of Historically Black Colleges and  Universities and supporting the preservation and restoration of  historic sites and buildings.   This weekend, a gathering will establish a scholarship in his honor  in order for more rural Alabama young men and women to have  opportunities to further their education.   I want to congratulate my friend for reaching this milestone in his  life--a place I got to last year this time--and wish him a happy  birthday and further success in establishing benefits for young men and  women throughout Alabama.                            ____________________
