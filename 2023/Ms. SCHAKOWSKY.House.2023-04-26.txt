 Mr. Speaker, I brought my Constitution with me  because the Constitution is very clear that it is the duty of the  United States of America to pay its debts. Somehow, it doesn't say a  darn thing about how you can negotiate to hold the whole economy  hostage and threaten the economy of the United States of America before  you are willing to pay the debts.   Under President Trump, as I am sure it was said before, three times  the debt ceiling was raised. Yet, you are saying now, at the same time  Donald Trump gave a $2 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest Americans,  but don't blame him for the deficit. Let's talk about these poor people  who are trying to get healthcare or put food on the table for their  families or the veterans who are seeing a cut in their healthcare. No  way. Vote ``no'' on this terrible, mean proposal.
