 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my  colleague's bill, H.R. 4477, the Domestic Explosives Detection Canine  Capacity Building Act of 2017.   This bill will help develop a domestic program through which the DHS  and the TSA can acquire high-quality explosives detection canines from  the United States. Currently, too much money is spent on too few  canines because we are forced to compete for dogs from other countries  in this high-demand threat environment.   Mr. Rogers' bill will help mitigate threats to aviation security by  working to build our capacity here at home while proliferating the use  of highly capable explosives detection canines. In a time when threats  to homeland security are rapidly evolving, these dogs represent one of  our greatest security tools in detecting explosives in surface and  aviation transportation systems.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Rogers for his leadership on this issue,  and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4567) to require a Department of Homeland Security overseas  personnel enhancement plan, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Overseas Personnel       Enhancement Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. OVERSEAS PERSONNEL BRIEFING.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela) each will  control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4567, the DHS  Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017.   As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on  Transportation and Protective Security, I recently led a bipartisan  congressional delegation to Europe and the Middle East to examine  international aviation security and counterterrorism operations. The  efforts of DHS personnel stationed overseas to build relationships with  foreign partners, to coordinate with other Federal agencies, and to  secure our homeland from threats before they arrive on our shores are  truly a testament to the vital counterterror mission of Homeland  Security. Additionally, the trip underscored the need to ensure the  effectiveness and efficiency of our overseas programs in a manner that  is risk-based.   Unfortunately, however, I also observed that even today, more than 15  years after 9/11, the United States Government still struggles to avoid  stovepiping and effectively participate in information sharing and  collaboration on homeland security matters. It is imperative that DHS  personnel serve as a force multiplier with their Federal counterparts  to act in genuine partnership when mitigating threats to the homeland  both here and abroad.   My legislation takes observations from our delegation and codifies  requirements to make overseas DHS personnel more effective and better  equipped. This bill provides critical transparency to the training  provided to overseas DHS employees, as well as how their positions and  roles measurably contribute to the counterterrorism mission of the  Department of Homeland Security.   Additionally, my bill will allow Congress to understand what  organizational culture or bureaucratic hindrances exist to effective  information sharing among DHS personnel and how we can break down  barriers to better address evolving threats to the United States.   The first role of government is to protect its citizens, and it is  incumbent upon those of us in Congress to ensure that the United States  Government is doing all it can to respond to changing threats, share  information effectively,  [[Page H35]]  and build counterterrorism capacity among our foreign partners.   I appreciate the bipartisan support of Ranking Member Watson Coleman,  Congressman Vela, and Congresswoman Meng of this bill and I look  forward to continuing our work together on these and other issues. I  also wish to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, for  his unwavering support of our efforts.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the starkness of the challenges facing the men and  women of DHS to accomplish our mission was made clear to me and my  committee colleagues on a recent trip to the Middle East and Western  Europe. I hope they know just how much we appreciate all of their  tireless efforts to protect the homeland.   Madam Speaker, I digress just for a moment before I close and note  that, for the last 3 years on my committee, one of my colleagues, the  main committee staff person, Krista Harvey, has worked on all these  bills and worked on all these trips I have taken and has played a key  role in the things we do to keep our country safe. In fact, I was just  checking. Twenty-one bills that she helped author passed the House, and  many were signed into law.   Ms. Harvey, regrettably, is leaving our service, but she is going to  continue serving the government in working at the Department of  Homeland Security in a senior capacity at the Transportation Security  Administration. I thank her for her work and doing all she does as a  public servant helping us keep our country safe.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 4567, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4561) to provide for third party testing of transportation  security screening technology, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4561, the SAFE  TECH Act, sponsored by my good friend and colleague and a knowledgeable  alumnus of the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman Bilirakis, who  recently participated in my subcommittee's overseas congressional  delegation to examine airport security and the passenger screening  technology in place at last point of departure airports with direct  flights to the United States.   As part of our delegation, we visited Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,  where we saw the effective deployment of new and advanced computed  tomography screening technology, as well as a number of other screening  technologies aimed at making the passenger and employee screening  checkpoints both more effective and more efficient.   Upon returning to the United States, the committee conducted rigorous  oversight and found that the existing testing and evaluation processes  in place at the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation  Security Administration are riddled with bureaucratic bottlenecks that  serve to delay new technologies for years.   I will note that the technology in place at the airport in Schiphol  was made in the United States, yet we are not taking advantage of that  technology because of these bottlenecks.   Additionally, due to logjams at Homeland Security and TSA facilities,  small businesses, as well as technology startups, are often prevented  from participating in the acquisitions and procurement processes. As a  result, our aviation system is left with antiquated security technology  that is incapable of adequately responding to new and ever-evolving  threats.   Madam Speaker, this is simply unacceptable, and we must act to reform  the Homeland Security and TSA acquisition processes. H.R. 4561 takes  significant steps toward making these reforms by allowing new  technologies to receive third-party testing and evaluation, while  maintaining existing lines of authority for the TSA administrator to  ensure such testing remains held to the highest standards of security  and integrity.   This bill will not only drive innovation but will also save taxpayer  dollars at Homeland Security and TSA, while reducing costs to companies  developing new screening technologies. That is why we have received  broad support, not only in a bipartisan manner here in Congress, but  also from the private sector.   Madam Speaker, I commend the dedication of Congressman Bilirakis to  reforming the broken acquisitions process currently in place and for  working with me and the committee on developing this bill. I also wish  to thank Chairman McCaul for supporting this legislation and moving it  quickly through the committee to address the serious concerns we found  through our oversight efforts.   I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who  routinely support bills of ours, and we routinely support bills of  theirs, because we both understand that homeland security is a very  bipartisan issue.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the time is long overdue to apply strong oversight and  reform to the manner in which TSA develops and deploys new screening  technologies across our aviation system.   With persistent threats facing the aviation sector, H.R. 4561 makes  much-needed improvements to the innovation and procurement process at  TSA. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Weber of Texas). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the  House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4561, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of bill, H.R.  4559: The Global Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017. This  legislation will help raise the global baseline of aviation security  and protect the traveling public from a litany of terror threats.   After recently participating in a bipartisan Congressional delegation  to the Middle East  [[Page H43]]  and Europe to observe international aviation security efforts  firsthand, my colleagues and I returned home determined to bolster the  Department of Homeland Security's efforts to build capacity among  foreign partners.   When it comes to aviation security, we are only as secure as our  weakest link. Unfortunately, through our oversight on the Homeland  Security Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective  Security, we have grown increasingly concerned that existing standards  are simply not sufficient to keep up with the changing threats to  aviation.   This legislation will ensure that DHS and TSA are aggressively  committed to eliminating security vulnerabilities and inconsistencies  at overseas airports with direct flights to the United States.   I wish to thank Congressman Estes for participating in the important  delegation we undertook which led to this legislation, as well as his  commitment and leadership to security America's transportation systems  on my Subcommittee.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the cost estimate  from the Congressional Budget Office regarding H.R. 4559. The cost  estimate was not available at the time of the filing of the Committee  report.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4559, the Global       Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Megan       Carroll.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.                                   ____        H.R. 4559--Global Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017    As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on                             December 13, 2017         H.R. 4559 would direct the Transportation Security       Administration (TSA), in consultation with other federal       agencies, to review security-related standards across the       global aviation system. The bill would require TSA to       identify best practices for:        Enhancing security by collaborating with foreign partners       involved in aviation security,        Identifying foreign entities that have not yet implemented       international standards,        Improving processes for issuing security-related directives       to air carriers, and        Assessing cyber-related threats to screening equipment.        Using information from TSA, CBO estimates that meeting the       bill's requirements would increase the agency's costs by less       than $500,000 in 2018; such spending would be subject to       appropriation. Enacting H.R. 4559 would not affect direct       spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do       not apply.        CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4559 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 4559 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll.       The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy       Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 4559, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
