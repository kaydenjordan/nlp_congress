 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, these rules would mark the capitulation by a large  number of Republicans who, for a time, reflected the views of 86  percent of the American people and the hopes of the Dreamers those  Americans support. If they vote for this pretense of reform and  security, they will have abandoned the principles they mouthed and the  people who relied on their courage.   Contrary to the Speaker and majority leader, the test for bringing  bills to  [[Page H5377]]  the floor must not be whether the President, untethered to principle,  would sign them, but whether they reflect the will of the people and  this House.   The Speaker refuses to put options on the floor supported by, at one  time, 247 Members of this House. Now, 240 Members have supported a rule  to give us four competing options to address the Trump-caused crisis.  That number may not comply with the Hastert rule, but it does comply  with democracy.   And it would give the Speaker his option as well. The Speaker clearly  fears that his alternative will fail. As a result, he has opposed an  open process. So much for the leadership that claimed--falsely--to  pursue transparency, openness, and a willingness to take the tough  issues head on and individually.   The bill it would bring to the floor, contrary to what Speaker Ryan  and Leader McCarthy claim, is no compromise. A compromise, by  definition, requires both sides to come together and meet in the  middle. We did. And we built a majority of support for a bill.   The Ryan bill is a capitulation by those who have professed support  of the Dreamers. Indeed, the only compromise in this bill is how it  compromises our values, our principles as Americans, and how it  compromises our economy and national security.   The conservative Cato Institute has said that only 12 percent of  Dreamers would ever actually attain citizenship under this hoax of a  bill.                                time  1130    For those seeking refuge from fear for their lives and from assault,  and from having their children torn from their arms and separated--as  Laura Bush pleaded, ``immoral''--this bill does not provide a solution.  Instead, it provides for locking up those children in prison with their  parents. Isn't that a wonderful option?   The American people are overwhelmingly outraged by what is happening  at the border and want to see Congress take real action. As John McCain  stated, such a policy that is being promoted by the President and the  Republicans in Congress ``is an affront to the decency of the American  people.''   In addition, the Ryan bill imposes new restrictions on legal  immigration. Democrats will strongly oppose this noxious bill.   Mr. Speaker, please summon the courage to let the people's House work  its will and demand that the President return to a policy of treating  these children as we would want our own children to be treated. That is  not what these bills do. Reject these bills. We are America. We are  better than these bills.
