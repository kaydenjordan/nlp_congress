 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Robert  Minichiello, a Blauvelt resident and American hero who recently turned  100 years old.   Born a few years after the end of World War I, he has lived through  some of our country's most transformative moments and some of its  greatest tests.   Robert served our country honorably during World War II, where he  fought in Europe as part of the 26th Infantry Division and was wounded  in the Moselle region of France in November of 1944.   Robert received the Purple Heart in recognition of his efforts and  the injuries he sustained. The heroes of our Greatest Generation should  never be forgotten, and I am proud to count Robert Minichiello, a hero  of our Greatest Generation, as one of my constituents.   So please join me in wishing Robert Minichiello of Blauvelt a happy  100th birthday.                            ____________________
