 Mr. President, first, my hometown of Louisville, KY,  is mourning a young man who was shot and killed on Saturday at a  protest in Jefferson Square Park.   Tyler Gerth was just 27 years old. He was a graduate of Trinity High  School and the University of Kentucky. He was an up-and-coming  photojournalist with a lot of talent.   He had been attending demonstrations, both to speak up for Breonna  Taylor as well as to document history. Instead, he lost his life.   The investigation is still proceeding, but it appears the suspect in  custody had been a frequent participant in these protests. He had  already been arrested once. It seems he had gotten into some dispute  and fired indiscriminately--the definition of ``senseless violence.''   My sympathies and the sympathies of all Kentuckians go out to the  Gerth family.   We are 30 days into these protests. Kentuckians and all Americans  deserve safe streets, safe communities, and peace                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, each time I have  returned home over the last several weeks, I have had the opportunity  to travel to different Kentucky hospitals to safely meet with  healthcare professionals and thank them for their incredible work, as  well as to listen to what is on their minds.   For more than 3 months now, our Nation's doctors, nurses, and health  professionals have been fighting day and night to heal strangers and  protect our Nation. I said in mid-March that our country was about to  meet a lot of new heroes and that among them would be many people who  wear scrubs, who rush toward the sick, and who wash their hands until  they bleed.   Well, Americans and families from coast to coast have met just such  heroes. The frontline professionals I am meeting are proud to do their  work, and you had better believe they are appreciative that the  sacrifices and smart precautions taken by the American people stopped  health systems from being overrun in the springtime, allowed them to  continue giving each patient the care they deserved, and bought our  country time to plan a smart, safe, and gradual reopening.   So until we have a safe and effective vaccine, it will remain all of  our jobs as American citizens to help our Nation settle into a middle  ground between unsustainable emergency lockdowns and our ordinary life  from before all this. In short, we cannot go back to April, and we  cannot go right back to normal. We need new routines, new rhythms, and  new strategies for this new middle ground in between.   It is the task of each family, each small business, each employer,  and all levels of government to apply common sense and make this  happen. To name  [[Page S3628]]  just one example, we must have no stigma--none--about wearing a mask  when we leave our homes and come near other people. Wearing simple face  coverings is not about protecting ourselves; it is about protecting  everyone we encounter.   In fact, the more we hate the pain and suffering that accompanied the  strict stay-home guidelines a few months ago, the happier we should be  to take responsible, small steps every day to ensure our country can  stay on offense against the virus.   Now, the Senate should take pride in the degree to which our historic  response has helped the country get where we are. All of the health  leaders and professionals I meet continue to be glad for the CARES Act,  the historic bipartisan legislation that Senate Republicans wrote and  then negotiated across the aisle.   We sent historic resources to hospitals and health providers to help  them do their healing work and to fight this new invader. That was in  addition to the historic relief we provided to households and small  businesses, which economists across the political spectrum say saved  millions of jobs and prevented an economic freefall.   In May and June, while the Democrat-led House has been mostly absent,  the Senate has kept right on leading. In addition to legislating on  other important subjects, we have continued to work all angles of the  pandemic.   By the end of this week, I believe our committees will have held more  than 40 hearings on key aspects of the crisis so this institution can  continue to learn and inform any future work.   As I have been saying for weeks, a number of us are putting together  strong legal protections for healthcare professionals, K-12 schools,  colleges and universities, and employers so that our recovery is not  promptly swamped by a second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits.   While the Democratic House slapped together an absurd multitrillion- dollar wish list that even the mainstream media panned immediately, the  Senate has continued with our substantive, serious, facts-first  approach. That is the winning formula that built the historically  successful CARES Act, and that is the formula we will replicate in any  future recovery legislation down the road.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, on  Thursday I noted that in recent weeks the Air Force has scrambled jets  to intercept intrusions by Russian military aircraft near U.S. airspace  in Alaska.   Well, on Saturday it happened again. According to the Defense  Department, Russian reconnaissance planes entered the Alaska Air  Defense Identification Zone and lingered for 8 hours. Obviously, this  is just the latest in a series of escalations from Putin's regime.   Meanwhile, China has resumed its submarine intrusions into Japanese  contiguous zones and picked deadly fights with India at high altitude.   North Korea State media has stepped up its unhinged, anti-American  rhetoric, reportedly declaring over the weekend that nuclear war was  ``the only option left.''   And Iran has issued a warrant for the arrest of the President of the  United States because we took the mullahs' top terrorist off the  battlefield back in January.   Our adversaries are as intent as ever on undermining peace;  disrupting commerce; and threatening American citizens, our interests,  and our allies wherever and whenever possible.   So this year's National Defense Authorization Act is as urgent and  important as it has been for 60 consecutive years. Thanks to Chairman  Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed, the legislation we will consider is  already the product of exhaustive bipartisan effort.   It includes 229 bipartisan amendments adopted by our colleagues on  the Armed Services Committee. It may include more amendments before we  finish with it here on the floor.   But the primary missions of the legislation are already clear. On the  homefront, it will increase pay for servicemembers; reform the military  housing and healthcare systems; and increase transparency in Pentagon  budgeting, hiring, and acquisition.   Around the world, it will make clear our commitments to our allies in  Europe and the Pacific, invest in key technologies from biotechnology  to hypersonics, and make sure that our men and women in uniform have  the tools to remain the greatest fighting force in world history.   I am grateful to our committee colleagues for giving the Senate the  opportunity to set strong priorities for our national defense. Our job  now is to follow their example, work together in a bipartisan way, and  pass the NDAA on behalf of our men and women in uniform and the Nation  they protect.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 4091.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2080.    I ask consent that the reading of the amendment be  waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  June 30; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time of the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, following leader remarks, the  Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 483, S. 4049; finally, that  the Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly conference  meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of our Democratic  colleagues.
