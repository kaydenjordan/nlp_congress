 Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to the life  and legacy of a selfless community servant, Eddie Jones, II, who passed  away last week at the much-too-soon age of 69.   Eddie was truly remarkable and exemplified the best in us. He was a  steady hand for anyone who needed it and a sturdy presence who  dedicated himself to being a good steward of our Chicagoland community.   Born in Arkansas to Eddie and Rosie Jones, Eddie grew up in Chicago's  Bronzeville neighborhood, graduating from Wendell Phillips High School  and Western Illinois University before embarking on a 30-year career  with IBM and All Points Security.   Eddie was chairman of the Iota Delta Lambda Educational Foundation,  the March of Dimes, and served as the president of the Chicago Urban  League Metro Board. He was a proud brother of Alpha Phi Alpha  Fraternity and made sure we all knew it. He was even prouder to be a  grandfather and a father.   I am thankful to have called Eddie my friend, and I am comforted and  inspired by the fact that his life and legacy endure in the memory,  smiles, and service of others.   On behalf of a thankful Second Congressional District I say: We will  miss you, Eddie. Thank you for a life well lived.                            ____________________
