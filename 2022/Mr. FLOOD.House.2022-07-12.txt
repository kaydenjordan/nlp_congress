 Madam Speaker, I rise today and am incredibly grateful for  the opportunity to be here.   I would like to recognize my wife, Mandy, and my two boys, Brendan  and Blake, both future Cornhusker linebackers. Their support and hard  work have made this day possible.   My mom passed away in January, and today would have been her 79th  birthday. Although she is a Democrat, I know she was smiling from  Heaven as I took my oath tonight.   When the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District woke up  this morning, they simply wanted to know that their elected officials  and leaders were working to solve problems, create opportunities for  their children, and make sure our homeland is safe.   In that spirit, with a deep sense of abiding love for our country, I  look forward to working with all of you to find solutions to America's  toughest problems.   I pledge to be honest, work for the betterment of our country, and  conduct myself in such a way that I honor this institution, the  people's House.                            ____________________
