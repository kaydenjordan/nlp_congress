 Mr. Speaker, I rise to set the record straight on tax  reform.   Opponents to this plan would have Members believe that tax reform is  only a benefit for the wealthy or, hearing them today, a plot by the  Trump family. That is simply partisan rhetoric.   I have long said I would only vote for tax reform that helps families  living paycheck to paycheck--families like the one I grew up in. My dad  worked on the line at General Motors, and my mom worked for the  Salvation Army. More money in their pockets from their paycheck every  week would have made a huge difference. They worked hard to support  their family and raise seven children. That little bit of money would  have made a difference. Undoubtedly, now, it will make a difference for  the American people.   That is exactly what this plan does. It puts meaningful money back in  the pockets of working families. A typical family is projected to save  over $2,000 a year. That may not sound like much to some on the other  side of the aisle, but, where I grew up, that is huge.   For 57 percent of Americans who don't have enough money to cover a  $500 emergency, that money matters. For businesses, it means  investments, hiring, and better wages. I have talked to business owners  across my district, and they have had the same message: cuts taxes so  they can increase wages and hiring.   Vic, a restaurant owner in my district, talked to me about tax cuts  that would help his business. Vic said: We pay our taxes first, we pay  our people second, we pay our bills third, and then if there's anything  left over, we get paid.   Our Tax Code shouldn't be a challenge or impediment for business  owners like Vic.   Currently, Americans pay more in taxes than they pay for food and  clothing. It is time to fix this. This tax plan does that. This tax  plan will help families and businesses across my district and across  America, which is why I proudly support it, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.
