 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to  the remarkable life of Lynda DeLaforgue. DeLaforgue was an activist and  friend who passed away on January 12, 2019, in her Chicago, IL, home  due to complications from metastatic colon cancer.   DeLaforgue, a graduate from Rockford College, had over 30 years of  experience working in the public interest. She was a longtime activist  and was also, for many years, the codirector of Citizen Action/ Illinois. She was an instrumental voice in the progressive movement,  serving as a leader in the fight to preserve healthcare by engaging  local stakeholders against the repeal of the Affordable Health Care  Act. She was instrumental in organizing many townhalls and galvanizing  local groups for causes on behalf of working men and women.   DeLaforgue was a sustaining board member of the Healthy Schools  Campaign and a member of the USAction board of directors, as well as a  2013 recipient of the Chicago Coalition of Labor Union Women's Olga  Mader Award.   Her service to her community was remarkable, and she will be greatly  missed by the countless people she came across, including myself.   DeLaforgue is survived by her daughter Katy DeLaforgue Hintzen, her  son Jordan, her life partner Brian Reizfeld, her mother June Kaczur- Tate, and her sister Laura.                            ____________________
