 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  profound legislation, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a long  overdue step towards ending the scourge of police brutality in America.   I am deliberate when I call this a step, however important. We have  so much more to do to dismantle racist systems that have infected our  country since before we were a country and, indeed, were part of our  foundational documents.   Genocide of Native Americans. Slavery. Jim Crow. Mass incarceration.  And many forms of racist injustice ongoing as I speak.   Mr. Speaker, this month I marched with 6,000 of my constituents in  Macomb County crying out for major, structural change in what may have  been the biggest antiracism rally that county has ever seen. If we pass  this bill and pat ourselves on the back for having done something, we  will have failed the people. Instead, let's pass this bill today and  continue to work to end systemic racism tomorrow.
