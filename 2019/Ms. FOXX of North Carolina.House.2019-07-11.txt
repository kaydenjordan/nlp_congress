 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for yielding me time and including my amendment in the en bloc.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc package. I thank Chairman  Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for their assistance on my  amendment and thank the Rules Committee for recognizing the importance  of this issue.   My amendment sends a clear signal to the European Union on the  importance of the primacy of NATO over our shared defense interests.   As some European capitals push for the formation of a European Union  army, my amendment expresses the importance of NATO centrality over our  defense policy architecture and the necessity of military system  interoperability and burden-sharing efforts among NATO allies.   We all know that increases in European military capability must be  made by our European allies to comply with their NATO obligations.  Investments underway in the form of the PESCO pact and the European  Defense Fund can risk system interoperability and present divergent  spending priorities within our alliance. EU defense investments should  take place under the NATO umbrella to ensure accountability and the  guarantee of U.S. influence.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues again for their support of this  amendment.                                time  1615
