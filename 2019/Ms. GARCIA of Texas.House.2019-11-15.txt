 Mr. Speaker, the earned income tax credit and  the child tax credit are some of the most effective, bipartisan  antipoverty programs to come out of Congress; yet many hardworking  individuals are unable to access well-earned EITC or CTC refunds.   In some cases, the U.S. Treasury has seized an individual's tax  credits if they owed student loan debt. These tax credit seizures, in  many cases, have pushed families into homelessness. Some have lost  their homes; some have lost their cars; others can't even put food on  the table for their loved ones.   I am filing a bill this morning that seeks to protect these most  vulnerable people from EITC and CTC seizures. It would prohibit the  Secretary of the Treasury from automatically seizing an individual's  EITC or CTC refund for the purpose of paying back student loan debt.   This is the right thing to do. No one should have to decide between  paying off their student loan debt and providing for their family.                            ____________________
