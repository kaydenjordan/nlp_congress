 Madam Speaker, I stand first of all to thank President  Trump for the work he has done at the border and for something that has  been almost unpublicized since the mainstream media is busy focusing  solely on impeachment.   In May of this year, over 100,000 people were processed at the border  and placed in the United States. In September, that number has fallen  to under 1,000, solely because of the efforts of President Trump to  keep people who come to this country seeking asylum south of the border  and because of agreements reached in countries in northern Central  America.   However, we must ask this body to stop solely focusing on impeachment  and deal with the southern border, making permanent the policy changes  of President Trump. My fear is that if President Trump ever leaves,  then the real motivation of this impeachment hearing will become  apparent, and that is to return to the days of open borders.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to address National Bible Week.   The Bible is very important in this country. In part, it is important  because it is the Word of God, and that makes it the most important  book, but it is a particularly important book in America, and it is a  book that everybody should familiarize themselves with because I don't  think you can understand either the Declaration of Independence or our  Constitution without reading the Bible.   You have to remember what America was like in its founding and  probably  [[Page H9109]]  at least the first 125 years after its founding. People learned to read  by either learning to read the Bible itself or maybe learning to read  another book, such as ``The New England Primer,'' which had many  excerpts from the Bible in it, or ``McGuffey's Fourth Reader,'' which  had 10 chapters, which were solely parts of the Bible and also included  the Sermon on the Mount.   The Puritans, of course, who were such an important factor in the  founding of America, encouraged everyone to read the Bible. In 1782,  the U.S. Congress even commemorated an American Bible. The reason they  commemorated an American Bible is, at that time, there was somewhat of  a crisis in America. We had a Revolutionary War going on. It was  difficult to get Bibles from England. So somebody else had to get a  Bible or they had to get Bibles in other ways, and Congress talked  about that. But when you think about that, you realize why, for so many  early Americans, the Bible was so important to them.   It is kind of funny nowadays where they pretend that there is a  separation between church and state in America, because John Jay, who  was the first Chief Justice of the United States, was also president of  the American Bible Society; and I could go on at length from early  Supreme Court decisions in which they talked about the importance of  God and made reference to the Bible.   Other important Americans early on, Andrew Jackson, the Bible is  ``the rock on which our Republic rests.''   We can take two things out of this: First of all, we could remember  that the great Andrew Jackson felt the Bible was very important, and,  secondly, remind people--because a lot of people around here don't know  it--that we are a Republic.   Abraham Lincoln, of course, was known as our greatest Biblical  President. There are all sorts of lessons in the Bible.    I think in First Samuel it is interesting to read when the Lord did  not like Israel turning from Him and viewing Him as primarily their  king over Israel, but instead they wanted kind of a strong central  government under a king--example one of many lessons that I think our  forefathers read when they designed our wonderful country.   But in any event, I think, for National Bible Week, what every one of  us should do is take some time to read the Bible, particularly the  parts of the Bible in which Israel was formed, because I think it was  very important for our forefathers because they envisioned our country  as a country which would be pleasing to God, and they wanted the type  of country that God would love and bless. I think we have been given  that love and blessings not so much because of the way we behave today,  but because of the faith of our forefathers.   So, again, my encouragement for whoever sits at home and listens to  this, maybe say: Can I read the book of Deuteronomy or read First  Samuel and learn a little bit of the Bible, not only the Bible for its  own right, but to remember the type of books that were being read by  our forefathers when they wrote our Constitution, when they wrote our  Declaration of Independence, and those books which created their view  of the world.
