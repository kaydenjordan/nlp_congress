 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me the time.   These articles charge incitement. Once before, the House impeached a  President of the United States within a week of the alleged offense.  That was President Andrew Johnson days after he removed Secretary of  War Edwin Stanton in 1868. Over 50 years later, the Supreme Court  declared unconstitutional the Tenure of Office Act that President  Johnson had refused to obey.   In other words, the House was not only hasty, it was wrong, punishing  noncompliance with the unconstitutional law. At least when that  occurred, the constitutionality of the law in question was unsettled.  Here, however, an angry House majority races to impeachment in direct  violation of settled constitutional law.   Again, the articles before the House charge incitement to  insurrection. They do not specify inciting language. The law is well  settled: ``What is required, to forfeit constitutional protection, is  incitement speech that `specifically advocates' for listeners to take  unlawful action.''   The violence last Wednesday was abhorrent. Perpetrators should be  prosecuted. Those responsible for security decisions held accountable.  Congress can disapprove, revile, condemn, even censure. But Congress  cannot, consistent with the rule of law, punish that which the  Constitution's First Amendment declares protected. If my colleagues do  it, the violators of the duty to this Constitution, however angry, will  be those who vote for this Article of Impeachment. It is not Mr.  [[Page H161]]  Green's Article of Impeachment. It is incitement, and the Constitution  is settled on that point.
