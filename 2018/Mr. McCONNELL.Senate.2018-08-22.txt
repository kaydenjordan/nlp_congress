 Mr. President, this week, I have been highlighting  some of the examples of the strength of the U.S. economy. The people of  West Virginia, where President Trump visited yesterday evening, are no  exception to this national trend.   During the Obama years, West Virginia's economy was hit hard.  Manufacturing employment shrunk by 13 percent. Coal and logging  employment shrunk by 38 percent. But today things are different. The  State's unemployment rate has been lowered during each of the past 19  months under this united Republican government than it was during any  month of the Obama administration. Coal jobs are surging back, and  according to one industry estimate, in 2017, West Virginia saw faster  growth in construction jobs than any other State.   As Senator Capito explained in a recent op-ed, figures like these are  more evidence that Republican policies are helping her State and the  entire country write a new chapter. Senator Capito recently shared with  me that in Wheeling, WV, the owners of Warwood Tool are creating a new  line of products thanks to the new flexibility brought about by tax  reform. In Wellsburg, Eagle Manufacturing is buying new machinery. In  Jane Lew, Doss Enterprises is planning to hire up to 30 new workers. It  is really amazing when we remember that only one of West Virginia's  Senators voted for the tax reform policies that helped make all of this  good news possible.   As Senator Capito notes, recent months' promising economic numbers  and all the new opportunities they represent are only the beginning.  Tax reform will also help strengthen our economic foundation for the  long term.   In particular, one provision of the tax rewrite will specifically  help the most depressed communities in our Nation. It will turn these  areas into opportunity zones that are especially attractive for  investment. The Treasury Department has already certified zones in  every State, including 55 in West Virginia and 144 in my home State of  Kentucky. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities within the  newly designated opportunity zones. Together, they have an average  poverty  [[Page S5792]]  rate of around 32 percent. This program is just one of so many ways  that Republican policies are providing a boost to the very communities  that Democratic policies systematically left behind.   The opportunity zones, by the way, were the idea of Senator Tim Scott  from South Carolina, who was able to insert them into the pay raise-- into the tax reform bill.   So there are bonuses, pay raises, and tax cuts for middle-class  families today and the foundation for more investment and more jobs  tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a related matter, I am proud that on  this Congress's watch, our economy has produced so many job  opportunities for the American people.   Here was the AP's headline a few weeks ago: ``Open jobs outnumber US  unemployed for 3rd straight month.'' But that growth and prosperity  needs to reach all families and all communities. That means expanding  Americans' opportunities to invest in their own human capital by  building new skills and transitioning into growing industries. That is  why the appropriations legislation the Senate is currently considering  provides billions of dollars for training and employment services. It  includes $160 million for apprenticeship programs, $220 million for  dislocated workers, with a special $30 million emphasis on displaced  workers in rural communities like those I represent in Eastern and  Western Kentucky, and just under $100 million to integrate ex-offenders  back into productive society.   These are just a few of the important items that our appropriation  for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education will fund.   It provides the resources to continue investing in college  affordability through Pell grants, Federal work-study programs, and  programs specifically aimed at low-income and first-generation  students.   It contains a $2 billion funding increase for the National Institutes  of Health, paving the way for important research and, we hope, new  medical breakthroughs.   Crucially, it will supply more resources for treatment, prevention,  and recovery programs pertaining to the opioid epidemic. State opioid  response grants put States in the driver's seat so local responses can  be tailored to local challenges. This legislation funds them to the  tune of $1.5 billion. In addition, there are hundreds of millions of  dollars for community health centers, hundreds of millions for  prevention and public awareness, and more for research into the nature  of this addiction and alternatives for managing pain. There is over  $100 million in targeted help for rural communities, like those in  Kentucky, which continue to bear the brunt of this national crisis.   I was proud to secure $5 million for a brandnew Centers for Disease  Control initiative to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases  like HIV and hepatitis B and C, which are a consequence of the opioid  epidemic. The CDC is directed to prioritize high-risk areas, including  54 counties in Kentucky.   This legislation also contains provisions from my CAREER Act, which  would dedicate new Federal funds to career and training services so  that recovering substance abuse patients can transition back into the  workforce and begin to rebuild their lives.   In sum, the appropriations measures we are considering this week  invest in human capital from all angles. They will put new tools in the  hands of distressed communities, of workers who need new skills, and of  families who need help defeating drug addiction.   I thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator Blunt, and the ranking  member, Senator Murray, for their bipartisan work on the Labor-HHS  title. I look forward to voting in support of this legislation, along  with the vital funding for the Department of Defense, in the coming  days.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
