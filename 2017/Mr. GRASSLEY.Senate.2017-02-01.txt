 Madam President, last evening, I had the pleasure of  being at the White House when President Trump introduced his nominee to  be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who  happens to be serving on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. It  shouldn't surprise anybody that President Trump delivered on a promise  made during the campaign, when he listed 21 people he would choose  from. Everybody knew ahead of time what sort of a judge he would put on  for this vacancy or any future vacancy.   Judge Gorsuch's decade of service on the Tenth Circuit has earned him  a reputation as a brilliant, principled, and mainstream judge, just  exactly the sort of mainstream that Senator Schumer must have been  thinking about when he said he wants a mainstream judge.   It has already been widely reported that he was unanimously confirmed  by a voice vote to the Tenth Circuit in 2006.   There are still 31 Senators in this body who voted for the judge at  that particular time; 12 of them are Democrats, and one of them is  Senator Schumer. Judge Gorsuch was supported, of course, by both of his  home State Senators for the Tenth Circuit. One happened to be a  Republican, and one a Democrat. He has been recognized as a great  jurist by Members from both parties. For instance, when he was sworn  into the Tenth Circuit, Senator Salazar, then a Democratic Senator from  Colorado, remarked that the judge ``has a sense of fairness and  impartiality that is a keystone of being a judge.''    The judge happens to be fourth generation Coloradan. He is eminently  qualified to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. His  decades of experience span many facets of our legal system. A graduate  of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, the judge was also a  prestigious Marshall scholar at Oxford. He served as Principal Deputy  Attorney General at the Department of Justice.   Judge Gorsuch also knows the Supreme Court well, having clerked for  Supreme Court Justices Byron White and also Anthony Kennedy, who is  still on the Court.  [[Page S544]]    He currently serves with distinction on the Tenth Circuit, where he  has established himself as a mainstream judge with a reputation as a  fair and brilliant jurist. As a mainstream jurist, Judge Gorsuch enjoys  broad respect across the ideological spectrum. At the confirmation  hearing for his current judgeship on the Tenth Circuit, he was  introduced by Republican Senator Allard from Colorado and Democratic  Senator Salazar from Colorado. Senator Salazar, of course, isn't  exactly a conservative firebrand, having most recently served as head  of the transition team of Secretary Clinton.   At his hearing in 2006, William Hughes, Jr., a Democratic candidate  for the House of Representatives, authored a strong letter of  recommendation for Judge Gorsuch stating:         I have never found, nor thought, Neil's views or opinions       to be tainted or swayed by any partisan leanings. Quite to       the contrary, his approach to all things professional and       personal has always been moderate and practical.    There are plenty of other examples of strong bipartisan support for  Judge Gorsuch. Even observers in the press recognize his reputation for  fairness. Just last week the Denver Post endorsed the judge, saying: He  ``has applied the law fairly and consistently.''   Judge John Kane, a colleague on the District Court of Colorado,  appointed by President Carter, says this about Judge Gorsuch:         [He] listens well and decides justly. His dissents are       instructive rather than vitriolic. In sum, I think he is an       excellent judicial craftsman.    After his nomination was announced last evening, the highest praise  so far came from President Obama's former Solicitor General, Neal  Katyal, who described the nominee this way:         Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant       judges to have served our nation over the last century. As a       judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve       the rule of law. To boot, as those of us who have worked with       him can attest, he is a wonderfully decent and humane person.       I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme Court.    To me, following the law wherever that law and case may lead is  perhaps the most important attribute for a Supreme Court Justice to  possess. That principle guided Justice Scalia's decisionmaking and it  is also how Judge Gorsuch has said judges should approach the law.   The judge once wrote, quoting Justice Scalia:         If you are going to be a good and faithful judge, you have       to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going       to like the conclusion you reach. If you like them all the       time, you are probably doing something wrong.    That gets back to something very basic. A judge is supposed to be  dispassionate. A judge is supposed to leave their personal views out of  it. A judge looks at the law on the one hand and the facts of the case  on the other and makes the decision based on just those two things. So  from what I have learned so far, the judge's judicial record reflects  this philosophy of being dispassionate, following the Constitution and  the laws passed by Congress. I think he said last night something like  this: A judge is supposed to judge and a legislature is supposed to  legislate, and a judge should not be legislating.   Judge Gorsuch doesn't legislate from the bench, nor does he impose  his own beliefs on others. To quote from a speech at Case Western, he  said that judges should strive ``to apply the law as it is, focusing  backward, not forward, and looking to the text, structure, and history  to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in  question would have understood the law to be--not to decide cases based  on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe  might serve society best.''   I believe it is this fundamental sense of fairness and sense of duty  in upholding the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress that has  led Judge Gorsuch to be a highly regarded jurist.   After the tragic passing of Justice Scalia, we made it clear that the  Senate would wait for the American people to have a say in the future  of the Court. I said even before the election that no matter who won  the Presidential election, we would move forward with the new  President's nominee. I maintained this position even on the eve of the  election, and I maintained that position even when everyone seemed to  believe that our next President would be Secretary Clinton. I have been  consistent.   Unfortunately, some of my Democratic colleagues--the very Senators  who held all those rallies chanting ``we need nine''--have already said  they intend to do everything they can to stop this eminently qualified  judge. That is very, very unfortunate. I hope and trust that approach  won't be uniform on their side.   So I look forward to moving forward with a hearing, when we will  learn a great deal more about Judge Gorsuch, and I look forward to an  up-or-down vote on his nomination.   I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
