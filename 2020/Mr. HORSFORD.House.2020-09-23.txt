 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair and the committees of  jurisdiction for this bill.   For too long, communities of color, indigenous communities, and  economically oppressed communities have borne a disproportionate burden  from toxic pollution and environmental degradation.   Communities experiencing environmental injustice have been subjected  [[Page H4870]]  to systemic racial, social, and economic injustice.   This legislation will push all of our communities forward together,  whether through the $20 billion clean energy and sustainability  accelerator to finance and mobilize private investment in low-carbon  technologies and projects; over $4 billion for research, development,  demonstration, and commercial application to advance cutting-edge  renewable energy technologies, including: solar, wind, geothermal, and  water power; or grants to local communities to improve energy  efficiency, including workforce training and rebates for  weatherization.   It also authorizes over $36 billion for transportation  electrification, which will help Nevada, including $650 million to  deploy low- and zero-emissions school buses.   I urge my colleagues to approve this measure.
