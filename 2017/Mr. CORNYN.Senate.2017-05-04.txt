 Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from  Minnesota for working with us on this piece of legislation. People  sometimes say nothing ever gets done around here on a bipartisan basis,  and this proves that is wrong. While that isn't one of the biggest  pieces of legislation to come down the pike, it is important because of  the importance of the State Department's rejoining the Bureau of  International Expositions in order to preserve the possibility, in my  case, for Houston's world fair bid to be considered. I know the Senator  from Minnesota has a similar interest in her State. So it was a  pleasure to work with her on it, and I am happy we are able to see this  accomplished today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if I may speak on the bill before the  Senate, yesterday the House of Representatives passed the Omnibus  appropriations bill. Of course, this is the legislation that keeps the  Congress and the government up and running through the end of the  fiscal year, the end of September. It actually represents the first  demonstration of Republicans and Democrats in both Houses of Congress  working with the White House in order to pass an important piece of  legislation and keep the government up and running through the end of  the fiscal year.   Over the last few weeks, we have had many productive conversations  and debates about how best to establish our priorities, how much we  should spend--particularly my concern about underfunding our military  and our national security funding but also to update our priorities  because that is one of the things that happens in an appropriations  bill. When programs are obsolete or ineffective, there is no way to  eliminate them while operating under a continuing resolution. It takes  a positive piece of legislation like an appropriations bill--like this  appropriations bill--to eliminate those obsolete or no longer effective  programs.   I am hopeful that once we pass this bill and after the President  signs it, we will continue to plot a course toward a long-term  strategic budget that reflects the priorities of the American people. I  firmly believe we were elected to govern, not to shut down the  government. In my view, that is an abdication of our responsibilities.  I hope we will continue to follow on now after we have been able to  accomplish this bipartisan, bicameral negotiation with the White House,  and we will continue to govern and to demonstrate our sense of  responsibility to the American people for doing just that.   This omnibus package includes a good blueprint for how we can order  our priorities and take care of our country.   Yesterday I mentioned the increases in resources to better shore up  border security. This is the largest increase in border security  funding in 10 years. That is a significant accomplishment. This funding  will help the Department of Homeland Security hire more Border Patrol  agents and Customs officials to improve the infrastructure at our ports  of entry and checkpoints and hire more immigration judges to process  more immigration cases.   It also creates funding for our troops fighting abroad and for our  military in general and includes a pay raise for our men and women in  the military, which is very important as well, particularly in an All- Volunteer military and one that has been stressed by 15 years of  continuous conflict around the world.   This bill also takes a more strategic look at the threats we are  facing, including resources to shore up technology and equipment that  will help our military stay No. 1. After years of putting military  improvements and readiness on the back burner, actually cutting defense  spending by 20 percent during the two terms of President Obama, this  bill is a solid first step toward regaining our readiness and  maintaining a capable and modern military.   While I never will doubt the American people responding or our  military responding to the needs or the threats to our security, we  don't want to be roused out of our complacency by a crisis occurring  somewhere in the world, whether it is North Korea, Syria, Ukraine,  Crimea, or elsewhere. We want to be ready on day one. Some of that  readiness has seriously been called into question by some of our lack  of prioritizing defense spending and military readiness generally.   In addition to those two important topics, many across the country  have been impacted by severe weather, including violent storms and  tornadoes. Of course, Texas has been a part of that sad story. Several  in Texas have lost their lives due to these storms and the flooding  caused by them. Of course we mourn for those who have lost loved ones  and those who have been injured, but we have to do more than just  grieve for them--we have to help them as well. This omnibus bill  includes funding for previously approved disaster relief, which will  help communities in Texas and throughout the country rebuild and  recover following a natural disaster.   This legislation also includes money to help reduce the rape kit  backlog. This is a topic which most people are not all that familiar  with, but years ago we passed something called the Debbie Smith DNA  Backlog Reduction Act, named for a heroic woman, Debbie Smith, who  championed the use of forensic evidence and the tracing of DNA samples  in order to solve sexual assault cases.   The amazing thing about this great technology and DNA testing is that  it is enormously powerful. Even as long as 20 years later, we have had  rape kits taken out of evidence lockers at law enforcement agencies and  tested and come up with a hit on the FBI's database, which is the  purpose of the testing. It also has the power to exonerate people who  are perhaps falsely accused by excluding them scientifically from the  possibility of being the assailant in a given case.   It is very important for us to fund important programs like the  Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Reduction Act. I know at one point there was  an estimate that there were 400,000 untested rape kits in America. The  problem was that we didn't really know how many there were because some  of them were sitting, as I indicated earlier, in police evidence  lockers, and others were sitting in the laboratory and not tested.   The question arose, when the identity of the assailant was known,  what purpose could be served by testing the rape kit, which is not  inexpensive? What we found is that the assailant, even if identified in  the present case, is very likely to have been engaged in a course of  conduct or serial assaults, and it helps us solve not only the present  case but also other cases as well. Some of them are very old. That is  important so that criminals can be brought to justice.   This bill also funds the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, NASA. It funds a Federal study for a Gulf Coast  protection project and active-shooter training for first responders-- all priorities important to my home State of Texas.   This legislation also represents changes in Washington since  November. It is the first major piece of bipartisan legislation  negotiated with the new Trump administration. Instead of pushing more  regulations and rules that cripple our economy and disregarding the  needs of our military and the stark realities of the border, this  legislation begins to steer our country in a better direction.   I know that no piece of legislation is perfect, and perhaps the best  definition of a negotiation is that both sides are dissatisfied because  nobody gets everything they want. I look forward to voting for this  legislation because I believe we were elected last November 8 to  govern, not to abdicate those responsibilities or somehow engage in a  shutdown narrative, which I don't think serves anyone well, certainly  not the American people. I look forward to voting on this legislation  and encourage all of our colleagues to do the same.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S2739]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr.  Sasse).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Isakson) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr.  Sasse) would have voted ``nay.''
