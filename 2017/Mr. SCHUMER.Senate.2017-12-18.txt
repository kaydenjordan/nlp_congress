 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, our hearts go out to everyone who  has been affected by that horrible train crash near Seattle, WA. I know  that authorities are still investigating what caused the crash. We have  to find out what went wrong and then work to fix it. We in New York  know what this is like. We have had a few of these derailments and  crashes--Spuyten Duyvil on the Metro-North, where four people died  about a year and a half ago or a year or two ago. It was very bad. We  have to work on train safety, and there are lots of things to do. I am  not going to talk about that now, but we do have to. For now, we are  wishing the very best for everyone on that train, and we remain deeply  grateful to the first responders who reported to the scene.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another sad note and before I move to  the substance of the day, I want to spend a moment in recognizing a  dear friend of mine who passed away this weekend, Bob Wilmers, one of  the most respected and prominent benefactors in Buffalo, NY--one of the  great cities in my State and in our country.   Very few men had done as much for Buffalo since its founding hundreds  of years ago as Bob Wilmers had done for the last several decades. He  was the chairman of M&T Bank. He helped the bank grow from a small bank  into one of the largest employers in the region--6,500 employees. As he  built the business and created thousands of good-paying, middle-class  jobs, he helped Upstate New York dramatically.   M&T Bank was a large bank, but it was not one of these banks that  engaged in swaps overseas or other risky types of investments. It lent  money to small businesses, and it had a deep caring for the communities  which it served. It was a model bank, in my opinion. It did an amazing  job in helping to revitalize our upstate economy, which has had trouble  over the last several decades due to so many different things,  including bad trade policies.   Bob was also not just committed to the bank, which he loved, as he  loved the employees, cared about them, and was such an honorable  employee; he was also committed to Buffalo and philanthropy. He  directed almost $5 million to local nonprofit organizations in New  York--the bank did under his leadership. That is because Bob himself  was a philanthropist. He was a man with a big heart, and he always gave  in every way. He spent many years supporting one of the great art  museums in America, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, and the Buffalo  Philharmonic Orchestra, just to name a couple. He was a booster to  everything Buffalo. He was never in the camp that thought Buffalo's  best days were behind her. He always believed in Buffalo's potential  and its future and helped to make that happen. The city of Buffalo is  turning around. We are so proud in so many different ways. It is, in  good part, because of Bob Wilmers.   On a personal level, my wife and I will miss him. He visited my wife  for lunch a few months ago. He was 83 years old, and he was on his  rickety, old bike and rode through the streets of New York City to meet  her so that they could have lunch.   Bob's wife Elisabeth and Iris and I spent many happy hours together.  He was a brilliant man, a brilliant banker, decent, caring, and civic- minded. The loss is the Wilmers family's, and our condolences go to  Elisabeth. It is a loss for Buffalo and the United States. Bob will be  truly missed. His untimely death has sent shock waves throughout New  York State, and we will miss him so.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different subject, I again warn  about the danger of the smear campaign against Special Counsel Mueller.   Over the weekend, allies of the President in the media escalated  their phony attacks on Special Counselor Mueller to an outrageous  degree. One of the assertions that arose this weekend was that Special  Counsel Mueller improperly obtained emails from the Trump transition  team. This is a bald-faced lie. There is no proof behind the  allegations. There is no substance behind the allegations. They can't  point to any indication that Mueller's team did anything that was  improper, let alone illegal. The Mueller team is allowed to request  whatever it wants. They are special counsel, special prosecutors. They  either have to get the accountholder's permission or go  [[Page S8053]]  through appropriate criminal processes. In this case, there is no  indication that they didn't follow the guidelines.   So to those complaining here in the Congress and in the media, point  to something specific that Mueller did wrong here.   They can't. These attackers are creating impropriety when there is  none. Their attacks are not based on fact or logic. This is a hatchet  job, plain and simple. If they have a legal complaint, they can pursue  it in court, but of course they don't. That is why these attacks are  only speculation on TV by partisan pundits.   Robert Mueller is one of the most respected and trusted civil  servants in our country. His integrity is unimpeachable. The concerted  campaign to discredit him and his investigation in the rightwing media  is nothing more than propaganda and disinformation to try to turn the  public's attention away from the real investigation--Donald Trump's  potential collusion with Russia and the collusion of his campaign and  the attempt, if it is found, to obstruct justice and prevent an  investigation from going forward.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will defend the  special counsel from these spurious attacks. Everyone--Democrat and  Republican alike--must reject the strident voices that falsely impugn  Special Counsel Mueller.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we have a lot to accomplish before the  end of the year. Government funding runs out on Friday. We still  haven't reached a bipartisan agreement on lifting the budget caps to  ensure that our investments in economic growth and job creation rise in  tandem with our investments in our national defense or in a disaster  supplemental that treats equitably California, Puerto Rico, and the  U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Texas and Florida. We need a bipartisan  agreement to fully fund the Children's Health Insurance Program and  community health centers, end the sabotage of our healthcare markets,  protect the Dreamers, and shore up pension plans for hundreds of  thousands of hard-working Americans.   We should be doing all these things together instead of in a  piecemeal fashion. It will lead to a better bipartisan result, which is  a necessity. To try to do it in a partisan way, as the House of  Representatives seems to be doing, will lead to nowhere and to a  government shutdown. Instead of jamming through a partisan tax scam in  the House and Senate, we should be working on middle-class priorities.   To make matters worse, House Republicans continue to waste time on a  partisan CRomnibus that is dead on arrival in the Senate. There is  another path. Republicans and Democrats should continue to negotiate a  genuine bipartisan agreement that paves the way for the major  unresolved issues to get to the President's desk. With so little time  left before the end of the year, those negotiations must proceed in  earnest. They haven't been.   Today, in the House, the Republican Members of the team called off  the negotiations and said: Let's do it tomorrow--as the clock ticks.   A few items have become sticking points and should be addressed. We  still don't have a deal on pensions. Over 1 million Americans are  waiting for our Republican friends to do what is right and work with us  on a solution to the pension crisis in America. These working people  every month put money into a pension hoping that when they retire, they  are not going to become rich, but they can live a life of dignity. A  lot of that has been robbed from them. We have an obligation to help  them. That is a high priority for Democrats in the Senate and the  House.   We still don't have a resolution on Democratic funding requests for  opioid treatment. We know the scourge of opioids, the number of deaths  throughout America--rural, suburban, urban, Black, White, Hispanic,  Asian, everybody. In the flower of their youth, so many are being taken  by opioids. We don't do enough, and there is a clamor from the Nation  to do more.   What about veterans' care? Cuts have hurt our veterans who have  served us. They are not getting the help they need.   Our infrastructure is crumbling. We need help in rural areas, urban  areas, suburban areas. What about that?   There is no resolution on adequate funding for Puerto Rico and its  resiliency or the Virgin Islands, no resolution on fixing our wildfire  funding problem which we proposed.   We still don't have an understanding on the Republicans' plan to  extend the 702 FISA Court program. The majority leader has told us: Oh,  we have to act on FISA. He could put it on the floor today. He could  have put it on the floor last week, instead of putting three judges-- some of whom had dubious credentials--on the floor. So to tell us we  are running out of time for FISA, when the majority leader controls the  floor and hasn't done anything for months, rings a little hollow.   We still don't have a good deal on the healthcare package. Now that  Republicans are pushing through a partisan repeal of the individual  mandate in their tax bill, which causes premiums to rise 10 percent-- when America gets those premium increases this spring and summer, they  will know who to blame. The number of Americans without insurance will  rise by 13 million. The bipartisan stabilization bills will not have  the same impact. We will need new legislation to account for the  Republicans' latest attempt to undermine our healthcare system.   We still don't have a disaster package that adequately takes care of  Puerto Rico, California, the Virgin Islands. I hear that my friends  from Texas--both Houses--are demanding we rush through a partisan  disaster package through the end of the year. Texas needs the money,  but the Governor of Texas has refused to tap the State's $10 billion  rainy day fund--the largest in the country--to help Houston and other  parts of the State recover from Hurricane Harvey. Yet, at the same  time, he is demanding immediate Federal assistance. On its face, it is  absurd. It is an absurd position for a routine critic of Federal  Government spending to demand money immediately, while he has a $10  billion fund sitting there. Imagine if those moneys were in New York or  Maryland what our Republican colleagues would be saying. Constantly, we  have this what is good for the goose is not good for the gander on our  Republican side. I could have used stronger words, but I stopped  myself.   I say to the Governor of Texas: If a rainy day fund is not for a  rainy day, which Texas had, then what the heck is it for? I, for one,  don't want to vote for a nickel for Texas unless they tap that rainy  day fund.   Of course, last, but certainly not least, we have to ensure  protection for the Dreamers. Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing in the  House and Senate. That is good news. Democrats and Republicans in the  Senate and the House are trying to come to an agreement on helping the  Dreamers, who just want to become Americans, and coming up with border  security which we all believe we need. One thousand Dreamers are losing  their status every week. While our Republican friends twiddle their  thumbs, we need action on the Dreamers, and we need our Republican  colleagues to cooperate.   On these issues and more, there is a lot of work left to do. Instead  of rushing through their partisan tax bill, I would urge my Republican  colleagues to focus on the year-end negotiations.   Speaking of the tax bill, it appears it will be before us on a final  vote early this week. Although there were significant changes in the  conference report, Senators will not have much time to grapple with  them. The conference report was released late last Friday. We are  taking a final vote on a bill that will change the entire Tax Code only  a few days later. It will be a culmination of the sloppiest legislative  process I have witnessed in my time as a Senator. Fittingly,  unfortunately, the results will be a mess as well.   My Republican friends are squandering their so-called once-in-a- generation opportunity for tax reform on a massive corporate bailout  paid for by middle-class tax increases. What a shame.   At a time when our economy is increasingly stacked against the middle  class and in favor of the wealthy, the Republican tax bill will skew  the playing field even further out of whack. It will explode inequality  in the country,  [[Page S8054]]  where the top 1 percent of earners already capture over 20 percent of  the national income, while the bottom 50 percent take in only 13  percent. It will explode the deficit, starving our country of the  resources it needs to invest in education, infrastructure, and  scientific research--all the things that help the middle class.   After all of that, it will endanger Social Security, Medicaid, and  Medicare. Then, 1 or 2 or 3 years down the line, Republicans will come  back to slash those programs to pay for the deficit they have created.   Finally, our Republican friends say: Well, it will create a whole lot  of jobs. Give money to the wealthiest corporations. As has been shown  over and over again, the wealthiest corporations have a ton of money  right now. They are not creating jobs. Give them more money? They will  not create any more jobs. The only claim our Republican colleagues have  for the middle class is trickle-down. Well, my friends, no one believes  in trickle-down except for a handful of wealthy, greedy people who seem  to be controlling what you are saying and doing in this tax bill.   This bill, in short, is a cynical one-two gut punch to the middle  class. It raises middle-class taxes to pay for corporate tax cuts and  decimates their earned benefits as a kicker. Surely we can do better  than this.   Tomorrow Republicans will have a chance to vote down this tax bill,  which is one of the least popular pieces of legislation in the last 30  years. My Republican colleagues have accomplished an amazing trick. A  tax cut, usually popular, is 2-to-1 unpopular in America. Good work.   They know what is in it. The public knows. They know they are getting  crumbs, if anything, and many are getting increases, while the highest  income people do great. Well, let me just say, if by some miracle, our  Republican colleagues get the good sense to vote this package down and  really help the middle class instead of just helping the wealthy, we  Democrats will be there. They will find a Democratic leader and a  Democratic Party willing to work with them on real bipartisan tax  reform.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
