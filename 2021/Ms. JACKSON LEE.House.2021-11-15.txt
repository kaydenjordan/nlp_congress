 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to submit statements into the  Record.    Madam Speaker, breaking news. Today, the President  of the United States signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill,  legislation that our chairwoman and the Congressional Black Caucus were  instrumental in moving forward.   But breaking news: The President, Vice President, and Speaker of the  House made it very clear that we will pass the Build Back Better Act,  and that they are two bills that go together. And so tonight, I am  delighted to join the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus to  discuss the pathway and the vitality of the Build Back Better Act.   There is one thing that I want to immediately speak to. Pell grants  that is part of the Build Back Better will be an instrumental component  to increasing the number of students at community colleges,  historically Black colleges, and other colleges--minority-serving  institutions--more than they have ever had the opportunity.   Madam Speaker, in 2021, there are still families that are sending  their first generation to college. The Pell grants--unlike which was  discussed just a few minutes ago--will give Americans and legal  residents the opportunity to go to school, and many others who are DACA  and are deserving of going to school to build a better future.   Madam Speaker, I will speak very briefly on how important the Build  Back Better Act is, and to emphasize that it is often said that the  Federal budget is an expression of the Nation's values. Build Back  Better is an expression of our values, of our respect, and affection  for our families and our children. It is long overdue.   And even though we are excited about the infrastructure bill that  will bring some $26.9 billion in transportation to Texas, some $3.3  billion in ensuring the improvement of public transportation, making  sure there is $100 million for broadband, and making sure that we have  clean water--and that is in the $2.9 billion from the infrastructure  bill. I can tell you that Texans and Americans are excited about the  Build Back Better. African Americans who have suffered with poverty and  inequities will stand at the forefront in helping to end poverty as we  know it in our communities.    Madam Speaker, I am grateful to Chair Beatty for her leadership and  was eager to join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to  stand together to support this $1.75 trillion investment.   Very quickly: The bill is paid for. No one making under $400,000 will  see any taxes go up at this time. In addition, $130 billion will be  provided for healthcare.   Breaking news: If you are uninsured in States that never expanded  Medicaid, you will have insurance; huge numbers of African Americans.  Over 30 percent of seniors over the age of 70 can benefit from hearing  aids as well. We know the Build Back Better bill will give us an  additional amount of resources for uninsured persons and provide the  access to the Affordable Care Act.   Childcare, which impacts African Americans, the Build Back Better Act  will provide universal and free preschool for three- to four-year-olds  and cut down the amount of dollars that many young working families  have to pay. I am excited about the fact that we will be able to have  working parents, they will be looking for work, but they will have the  ability to have their children taken care of, and they won't pay more  than 7 percent of their income for childcare; $150 billion.   Madam Speaker, this weekend, I was at my public housing, public  development. Families, they are going to see a new makeover, more  housing built, and more down payments.   In fact, I am very grateful to say that we won't see these signs:  ``My landlord is calling and I must pay.'' How many were evicted  because dollars were not getting to people who worked hard every day  but yet, because of the pandemic and other factors, could not pay their  rent.                                time  1930    We will see that ended with the $150 billion for housing; education,  $40 billion; and, of course, the Pell grants, as I said.   It is important to take note of the fact that poverty among Africa  Americans will decrease seismically, particularly with the child tax  credit that will end poverty as we know it among the impoverished  children of America.   Again, I said, breaking news, the President signed the bipartisan  infrastructure bill with the help of the Congressional Black Caucus.   Breaking news, we are committed to leading on helping to pass Build  Back Better with all of our Democratic colleagues, and Madam Speaker, I  don't think that we would be against our bipartisan colleagues joining  us.   Let me conclude by saying that I am delighted to know this family at  the Gingerbread daycare, founded by a husband and wife, for hardworking  essential workers. How wonderful it will be that 3- to 4-year-olds can  have universal access to school and childcare and can now be supported  by the Build Back Better Act and paid family leave.   Breaking news, we are changing hearts and changing America, and I am  delighted to yield to our chair and thank her for her leadership. Keep  on leading. We are going to keep on standing so that we can pass the  Build Back Better Act this week. I am going to claim it. We say that  sometimes in our community.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Speaker, what a grand statement from our chair  who has captured the leadership of this entire body.   As I conclude my remarks, I just wanted to say, Madam Speaker, to the  chair, this is what you are doing and what we are doing by pushing  Build Back Better and putting our stamp on it.   Madam Speaker, 22.1 percent of Black people fall below the poverty  line, struggling to pay expenses like food, rent, healthcare, and  transportation for their families. But with the child tax cut, the  Build Back Better Act provides a major tax cut to nearly 3 million  Black people and cuts the Black poverty rate by 34.3 percent, which  will help the 85 percent of Black women who are either sole or co- breadwinners for their families.   I am very pleased to be on the floor of the House with you, showing  what will happen to many in the Black community who are out and about  working and helping. This bill will help them, and it will help all of  America. It will help those minorities who are in need.   May I say: Our Power, Our Message. I always like to say: Our Power,  Our Message. That is what we are tonight, and I am delighted to have  been able to join her at this time.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, and the Congressional Black  Caucus, I am pleased to co-anchor this Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order with my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from New  York, Congressman Ritchie Torres.   I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congresswoman Beatty of Ohio, for  organizing this Special Order to discuss the reasons why the CBC  strongly supports the $1.75 billion Build Back Better Act conceived and  advanced by President Biden and House Democrats to support visionary  and transformative investments in the health, well-being, and financial  security of America's workers and families.   Over the next hour, several of our colleagues will share their  perspectives on why it is essential that we ``go big'' in building back  better to our Nation and all of its people have the opportunities and  resources to compete and win in the changing global economy of the 21st  century.   Madam Speaker, it is often said that the federal budget is an  expression of the Nation's values and the investments made to Build  America Back Better are a clear declaration of congressional Democrats'  commitment to ensuring that our government, our economy, and our  systems work For The People.   Madam Speaker, these long-overdue investments in America's future  will be felt in every corner of the country and across every sector of  American life, building on the success of the American Rescue Plan,  accommodating historic infrastructure investments in the legislative  pipeline, and addressing longstanding deficits in our communities by  ending an era of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge from our  current crises a stronger, more equitable Nation.   Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we took in February 2021 when we  passed the American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the right  direction, but it was a targeted response to the immediate and urgent  public health and economic crises; it was not a long-term solution to  many of the pressing challenges facing our Nation that have built up  over decades of disinvestment in our Nation and its people in every  region and sector of the country.   We simply can no longer afford the costs of neglect and inaction; the  time to act is now.   The Build Back Better Act makes the transformative investments that  we need to continue growing our economy, lower costs for working  families, and position the United States as a global leader in  innovation and the jobs of the future.   This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build on the successes of  the American Rescue Plan and set our Nation on a path of fiscal  responsibility and broadly shared prosperity for generations to come.   The Build Back Better Act will provide resources to improve our  education, health, and child care systems, invest in clean energy and  sustainability, address the housing crisis, and more, all while setting  America up to compete and win in the decades ahead.   The Build Back Better Act is paid for by ensuring that the wealthy  and big corporations are paying their fair share and Americans making  less than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes increase by a penny.   Let me repeat that: Americans making less than $400,000 a year will  not see their taxes increase by a penny.   In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments made by the Build Back Better  Act will expand opportunity for all and build an economy powered by  shared prosperity and inclusive growth.   No one is better prepared or more experienced to lead the American  renaissance that will be produced by the investments made by the Build  Back Better Act than President Biden, the architect of the American  Rescue Plan and who as Vice-President during the Obama Administration  oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act, which saved millions of  jobs and rescued our economy from the Great Recession the Nation  inherited from a previous Republican administration.   And let us not forget that President Obama also placed his confidence  in his vice-president to oversee the rescue of the automotive industry,  which he did so well that the American car industry fully recovered its  status as the world leader.   Madam Speaker, one aspect of the Build Back Better Act that does not  get enough attention is the fact, as documented by the Department of  the Treasury, that the legislation will generate more than $2 trillion  in fiscal savings.   These savings come from ensuring large multinational corporations and  wealthy Americans pay their fair share and reducing the cost of  prescription drugs.   These provisions will not raise taxes on any taxpayer making less  than $400,000.   As a result of these changes, the ability of large corporations to  shift profits abroad will be substantially limited, and the race to the  bottom in corporate taxation will no longer be a driving force  weakening capital taxation.   In short, the Build Back Better Act under consideration in the House  of Representatives will be fully paid for and reduce the deficit.   Madam Speaker, let me briefly highlight some of the key investments  made by the Build Back Better Act:   The Build Back Better Act expands access to quality, affordable  health care by strengthening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable  Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that millions of Americans already  rely on.   It includes a major new expansion of Medicare benefits, adding a  hearing benefit to the program for the very first time.   Only 30 percent of seniors over the age of 70 who could benefit from  hearing aids have ever used them.   The Build Back Better Act strengthens the Affordable Care Act and  reduces premiums for 9 million Americans who buy insurance through the  Affordable Care Act Marketplace by an average of $600 per person per  year.  [[Page H6262]]    Just for example, a family of four earning $80,000 per year would  save nearly $3,000 per year (or $246 per month) on health insurance  premiums and experts predict that more than 3 million people who would  otherwise be uninsured will gain health insurance.   The Build Back Better Act closes the Medicaid coverage gap, leading 4  million uninsured people to gain coverage.   The Build Back Better Act will deliver health care coverage through  Affordable Care Act premium tax credits to up to 4 million uninsured  people in states that have locked them out of Medicaid.   A 40-year-old in the coverage gap would have to pay $450 per month  for benchmark coverage--more than half of their income in many cases,  but thanks to the Build Back Better Act individuals would pay $0  premiums, finally making health care affordable and accessible.   The Build Back Better Act strengthens the ACA by extending the  enhanced Marketplace subsidies that were included in the American  Rescue Plan.   It also provides an affordable coverage option for the more than two  million Americans living in states that have not expanded Medicaid  under the ACA and do not earn enough to qualify for Marketplace  subsidies.   When the Build Back Better Act is fully implemented, soon gone will  be the terrible old days when too many Americans are forced to choose  between medical care and putting food on the table or affording other  necessities.   Madam Speaker, approximately 3.9 million Black people were uninsured  in 2019 before President Biden took office and even with the Affordable  Care Act's premium subsidies, coverage under the ACA was too expensive  for many families, and over 570,000 Black people fell into the Medicaid  ``coverage gap'' and were locked out of coverage because their state  refused to expand Medicaid.   The Build Back Better Act closes the Medicaid coverage gap while also  lowering health care costs for those buying coverage through the ACA by  extending the American Rescue Plan's lower premiums, which could save  360,000 Black people an average of $50 per person per month.   With these changes, more than one in three uninsured Black people  could gain coverage, and with the addition of hearing coverage, more  than 5.8 million Black people on Medicare will benefit.   The Build Back Better Act will make an historic investment in  maternal health, including for Black women, who die from complications  related to pregnancy at three times the rate of white women.   Madam Speaker, the cost of preschool in the United States exceeds  $8,600 per year on average, and for as long as we can remember, child  care prices in the United States have risen faster than family incomes,  yet the United States still invests 28 times less than its competitors  on helping families afford high-quality care for toddlers.   The Build Back Better Act supports families in need of child care by  providing access to safe, reliable, and high-quality care delivered by  a well-trained child care workforce.   The Build Back Better Act will provide universal and free preschool  for all 3- and 4-year-olds.   This is the largest expansion of universal and free education since  states and communities across the country established public high  school 100 years ago.   This is important because our Nation is strongest when everyone can  join the workforce and contribute to the economy.   That is why this investment is vital to so many millions of people-- especially women--who are often forced to choose between working to  support their family or caring for their family.   The Build Back Better Act will ensure that the vast majority of  working American families of four earning less than $300,000 per year  will pay no more than 7 percent of their income on child care for  children under 6.   Under the Build Back Better Act, parents who are working, looking for  work, participating in an education or training program, and who are  making under 2.5 times their states median income will receive support  to cover the cost of quality care based on a sliding scale, capped at 7  percent of their income.   The Build Back Better Act will help states expand access to high- quality, affordable child care to about 20 million children per year-- covering 9 out of 10 families across the country with young children.   For two parents with one toddler earning $100,000 per year, the Build  Back Better Act will produce more than $5,000 in child care savings per  year.   In addition, the Build Back Better Act promotes nutrition security to  support children's health and help children reach their full potential  by investing in nutrition security year-round.   The legislation will expand free school meals to 8.7 million children  during the school year and provide a $65 per child per month benefit to  the families of 29 million children to purchase food during the summer.   The Build Back Better Act will deliver affordable, high-quality care  for older Americans and people with disabilities in their homes, while  supporting the workers who provide this care.   Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of older Americans and  Americans with disabilities on waiting lists for home care services or  struggling to afford the care they need, including more than 800,000  who are on state Medicaid waiting lists.   A family paying for home care costs out of pocket currently pays  around $5,800 per year for just four hours of home care per week.   The Build Back Better Act will permanently improve Medicaid coverage  for home care services for seniors and people with disabilities, making  the most transformative investment in access to home care in 40 years,  when these services were first authorized for Medicaid.   The Build Back Better Act will improve the quality of caregiving  jobs, which will, in turn, help to improve the quality of care provided  to beneficiaries.   Madam Speaker, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that the  Build Back Better Act will also reduce the cost of home-based care for  the hundreds of thousands of older Black adults and Black people with  disabilities who need it and are unable to access it.   Not to mention that investment in home care will raise wages for home  care workers, 28 percent of whom are Black.   In the area of housing, the Build Back Better Act makes investments  to ensure that Americans have access to safe and affordable housing by  providing resources to increase housing vouchers and funding for tribal  housing.   It also supports investments in programs that will help address our  Nation's housing crisis by increasing the supply of affordable homes  for those in need and investing in historically underserved communities  and those that have been previously left behind.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act makes the single largest and  most comprehensive investment in affordable housing in history and will  enable the construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of more than 1  million affordable homes, boosting housing supply and reducing price  pressures for renters and homeowners.   It will address the capital needs of the public housing stock in big  cities and rural communities all across America and ensure it is not  only safe and habitable but healthier and more energy efficient as  well.   It will make a historic investment in rental assistance, expanding  vouchers to hundreds of thousands of additional families.   And, perhaps even more importantly, the Build Back Better Act  includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in  history, enabling hundreds of thousands of first-generation homebuyers  to purchase their first home and build wealth.   In short, Madam Speaker, this legislation will create more equitable  communities, through investing in community-led redevelopment projects  in historically under-resourced neighborhoods and removing lead paint  from hundreds of thousands of homes, as well as by incentivizing state  and local zoning reforms that enable more families to reside in higher  opportunity neighborhoods.   The Build Back Better Act will provide two years of free pre-K and  two years of free community college to ensure every student has the  tools, resources, and opportunity to succeed in life.   It will also invest in our teachers and institutions that serve  minority students and provide funding to give school buildings long- overdue infrastructure updates.   People lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives when they  have had access to high-quality education and that is why the Build  Back Better Act makes necessary investments to increase quality  education by four years for all students at no cost to hard-working  families.   The Build Back Better Act expands access to affordable, high-quality  education beyond high school, which is increasingly important for  economic growth and competitiveness in the 21st century.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act will increase the maximum  Pell Grant by $550 for the more than 5 million students enrolled in  public and private, non-profit colleges and expand access to DREAMers.   It will also make historic investments in Historically Black Colleges  and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and  minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to build capacity, modernize  research infrastructure, and provide financial aid to low-income  students.   The Build Back Better Act will help more people access quality  training that leads to good, union, and middle-class jobs and will  enable community colleges to train hundreds of thousands of students,  create sector-based  [[Page H6263]]  training opportunity with in-demand training for at least hundreds of  thousands of workers, and invest in proven approaches like Registered  Apprenticeships and programs to support underserved communities.   The Build Back Better Act will increase the Labor Department's annual  spending on workforce development by 50 percent for each of the next 5  years.   The Build Back Better Act will spur and empower comprehensive action  to build an equitable clean energy economy with historic investments to  transform and modernize the electricity sector, lower energy costs for  Americans, improve air quality and public health, create good-paying  jobs, and strengthen U.S. competitiveness--all while putting our  country on the pathway to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035.   The Build Back Better Act extends and expands clean energy tax  credits and supports clean electricity performance payments so  utilities can accelerate progress toward a clean electric grid at no  added cost to consumers.   The Build Back Better Act invests in clean energy, efficiency,  electrification, and climate justice through grants, consumer rebates,  and federal procurement of clean power and sustainable materials, and  by incentivizing private sector development and investment.   Another exciting aspect of the Build Back Better Act, Madam Speaker,  is that it will drive economic opportunities, environmental  conservation, and climate resilience--especially in underserved and  disadvantaged communities--including through a new Civilian Climate  Corps.   Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better Act includes a $100 billion  investment to reform our broken immigration system--and does it  consistent with the Senate's reconciliation rules--as well as to reduce  backlogs, expand legal representation, and make the asylum system and  border processing more efficient and humane.   Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible for such protection are an  integral part of Texas' social fabric.   Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who are eligible for protection,  112,000 of whom reside in Harris County.   These individuals live with 845,300 family members and among those  family members, 178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children.   These persons in Texas who are eligible for protection under the bill  arrived in the United States at the average age of 8 and on average  have lived in the United States since 1996.   They own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay $340,500,000 in annual  mortgage payments and contribute $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes and  $1,265,200,000 in state and local taxes each year.   Annually, these households generate $10,519,000,000 in spending power  in Texas and help power the national economy.   The expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) enacted in the American  Rescue Plan has already benefitted nearly 66 million children, put  money in the pockets of millions of hard-working parents and guardians,  and is expected to help cut child poverty by more than half.   The Build Back Better Act not only extends this meaningful tax cut,  but it also extends the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and  the expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which help families  make ends meet and put food on the table, reduce child poverty, and  lessen the burden on hard-working Americans so they can provide a  better future for America's children.   Madam Speaker, 22.1 percent of Black people fall below the poverty  line, struggling to pay expenses like food, rent, health care, and  transportation for their families.   By extending the Child Tax Credit, the Build Back Better Act provides  a major tax cut to nearly 3 million Black people and cuts the Black  poverty rate by 34.3 percent, which will help the 85 percent of Black  women who are either sole or co-breadwinners for their families.   By permanently extending the American Rescue Plan's increase to the  Earned-Income Tax Credit from $543 to $1,502, the Build Back Better Act  will benefit roughly 2.8 million Black low-wage workers, including  cashiers, cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation workers, and child  care providers.   Earlier today, I celebrated with many of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle at the White House where President Biden signed into law  the Senate Amendment to the Invest Act of 2021, which invests into our  infrastructure:   $121 billion for Roads, Bridges, and Safety;   $89.9 billion for Public Transit;   $66 billion for Passenger and Freight Rail; and   $55 billion for Drinking Water Infrastructure and Assistance.   Of the amount of public transit funding authorized in the  legislation, my home state of Texas is expected to receive  $3,269,170,516, which is more than ample for the Federal Transit  Administration to allocate the $20 million authorized for Harris  County's METRO's BOOST Corridor project in my congressional district  provided in the version of the Invest Act passed by the House in June  of this year.   The population of Harris County is projected to exceed 10 million  people by 2040, which makes it crucial to develop a plan that addresses  the growing demand for expansion of public transit.   Approved by voters in November 2019, the BOOST plan includes 500  miles of travel improvements to help ease traffic congestion and  provide more ways to move around.   The BOOST plan calls for 75 miles of new METRO Rapid bus service that  operates like light rail, along with expansions to two-way HOV lanes,  park and rides, transit centers, light rail, and community connector  service, and enhancement to local bus stops to improve accessibility,  safety, and security.   With funding provided in the legislation before us, my constituents  and residents and visitors in Harris County can look forward to a  better walk with new or improved sidewalks along and/or near the route  and improved crosswalks at intersections for your safety; a better wait  at bus stops; and a better bus ride, with faster and more reliable  service with streamlined stops along the route, traffic signal  improvements at key intersections to improve bus speed and reliability  by reducing the time buses spend waiting at red lights, and  improvements designed to create easy traffic flow for buses and cars.   Let me highlight a few of the major components of the Senate  Amendment to H.R. 3684, the Invest In America Act, which represents the  fulfillment of a promise to the American people.             The infrastructure act on roads, bridges, and safety    Delivers $121 billion for better roads and bridges faster by  increasing investment by 54 percent, with an emphasis on fixing  existing infrastructure;   Dedicates $32 billion for bridge funding to ensure bridges in  communities of all sizes are safer, more reliable, and more resilient;   Invests $4 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure,  helping the U.S. shift to the next generation of clean vehicles;   Dedicates $8.3 billion for activities targeted to reduce carbon  pollution and provides $6.2 billion for mitigation and resiliency  improvements, also advances the development and utilization of green  construction materials;   Makes our roads safer with a significant boost to roadway safety  programs, record levels of investment in walking and cycling  infrastructure, complete streets planning and smarter road design, and  safe routes to schools;   Focuses transportation planning to promote mobility and facilitate  access to jobs and other essential services, and reconnects communities  that were divided by highways with a new $3 billion program to correct  planning mistakes of the past;   Targets investments to areas of persistent poverty, rural  communities, Tribes, and other continually disadvantaged areas;   Helps elevate state and local priorities by funding Member Designated  Projects.                      The Infrastructure Act on transit    Provides $89.9 billion and makes record investments in transit to  increase routes, reduce the transit maintenance backlog, and provide  more frequent service, resulting in better options for riders, improved  environmental outcomes, and increased access to jobs and essential  destinations;   Scales up investment in zero-emission transit vehicles, supporting  fleet conversion to reduce local air pollution and related health  impacts and these investments are paired with strong Buy America  requirements and provisions for workforce training to ensure America  can compete in the clean energy economy;   Funds and incentivizes transit-oriented development to make transit  more convenient to where people live and work and builds sustainable,  walkable communities;   Increases funding for rural transit by more than 50 percent in the  first year and sets aside $50 million a year for rural persistent  poverty communities and creates a pilot to improve flexibility in  paratransit trips, allowing for brief stops such as childcare pick-ups  and drop-offs, and short trips to the grocery store, pharmacy, or bank;   Creates a new reduced-fare pilot program to improve access for low- income riders, and doubles the set-aside for urban area formula dollars  based on low-income population and deep poverty census tracts and  directs transit agencies to serve these populations;   Streamlines the Capital Investment Grant program to improve project  delivery, reduce red tape, and achieve cost savings for transit  agencies; and   Creates new programs to address several pressing transit challenges-- improving compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),  and addressing transit deserts by providing expanded transit service to  unserved and underserved communities.  [[Page H6264]]                  The Infrastructure Act on Passenger and Freight Rail    Provides $66 billion for passenger and freight rail, tripling funding  for Amtrak, allowing for enhanced service, ADA upgrades, and  investments to renew and support service on the Northeast Corridor and  long-distance and state-supported routes;   Provides funding for corridor planning and development of high-speed  rail projects, reducing traffic congestion and shortening travel times;   Improves rail safety by addressing highway-rail grade crossings  needs, requiring additional rail safety inspectors, addressing  trespasser and suicide fatalities, and eliminating gaps in railroad  safety; and   Creates a federal blocked crossing program to collect data and  enforce a 10-minute blocked crossing limit.    The Infrastructure Act on Drinking Water Infrastructure and Assistance    Authorizes $55 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund,  the primary source of federal funding for safe drinking water  infrastructure;   This investment in drinking water infrastructure, will help eliminate  the Nation's lead service lines and pipes, thereby delivering clean  drinking water to up to ten million American families and more than  400,000 schools and child care facilities that currently do not have  it, including in Tribal nations and disadvantaged communities;   As many as 10 million lead service lines are currently in use,  including an estimated 400,000 schools and child facilities with lead  components; and   The legislation also strengthens drinking water standards and  improves the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to set those  standards, and directs EPA to set health-protective national standards  for PFAS, 1,4-dioxane, and microcystin toxin within two years.   In addition, the legislation provides:   1. $15 billion in zero emission and clean buses and ferries and  builds the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in  the United States, in order to address the adoption of electric  vehicles and support domestic manufacturing jobs;   2. $42 billion to modernize our airports, ports, and waterways;   3. $50 billion to weatherize our infrastructure and insulate it  against the threats of droughts, floods, and wildfires;   4. $65 billion to upgrade our power infrastructure to facilitate the  expansion of renewable energy;   5. $21 billion in environmental remediation, making it the largest  investment in addressing the legacy pollution that harms the public  health of communities and neighborhoods in American history; and   6. $65 billion to connect every American to reliable high-speed  internet, building on the billions of dollars for broadband deployment  in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   To put it all in perspective, Madam Speaker, although we already  passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, we now have a once-in-a- century opportunity to make gigantic progress in making ours a more  perfect union, and to do it in a single bound with enactment of the  Build Back Better Act, the most transformative legislation passed by  this Congress since the Great Society and the New Deal.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of Republican  Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully earlier this  year:   ``At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We need to  quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the cows and  just move. And move forward and move right now.''   The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:   ``The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the  occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We  must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
