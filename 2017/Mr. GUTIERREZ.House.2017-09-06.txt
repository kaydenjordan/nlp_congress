 Mr. Speaker, how did we get here? In December of 2010,  the House passed the DREAM Act right here on this floor. Almost all of  the Democrats voted for it, and a handful of Republicans, too. The goal  was to legalize immigrants who had grown up in the U.S., achieved  education, and had no way of getting legalization status unless  Congress took action.   Way back in 2001, I had introduced the first bill to legalize  immigrant youth. So it took almost 10 years until it passed in the  House in 2010. And later that same week, there was a vote in the  Senate. Fifty-five out of 100 Senators voted for cloture on the DREAM  Act to legalize the status of undocumented immigrant youth.   We know you need 60 votes in the Senate to move something forward, so  the DREAM Act was blocked, even though it had a majority of the votes  of the Senators because of a filibuster led by Republicans.                                time  1515    Not just any Republican led the filibuster, but the leader of the  opposition to the DREAM Act was none other than the Attorney General of  the United States, Jeff Sessions. So yesterday the President, unwilling  to go out to the cameras and announce he was killing the DACA program  himself, sent Jeff Sessions out to tell 800,000 immigrants: We don't  want you here anymore.   Included in that announcement was a halfhearted sales pitch for  Congress to pass legislation. But remember, when Sessions had a chance  to do exactly that, he led the fight to stop it. That is hypocrisy on  steroids. So President Obama finally took the only action he could take  2 years later and crafted a narrowly defined program call DACA that has  never been successfully challenged in court.   DACA recipients are teachers, nurses, and one is even a Chicago  policeman who straps on his gun and badge to protect people every day  in my city of Chicago. During Hurricane Harvey, DREAMers with DACA were  first responders and volunteers and those who gave their lives to save  others, like Alonso Guillen of Lufkin, Texas.   Look, we want a clean DREAM Act, an up or down vote.   Democrats, let's be clear. This is a crisis that requires swift  passage of legislation to fix it, as big a priority as anything else we  need to pass this month. Our votes are needed on the debt ceiling,  Democrats, and on this bill and on the CR. What are we getting for our  votes, Democrats?   When the CEO of Microsoft says that you can only take my DREAMers  with DACA by coming first through me, that is a challenge to every  policymaker in this Chamber and especially to my Democratic colleagues.   When will we throw down and say: No, you cannot have our votes unless  you give us the DREAM Act? When, Democrats?   When will we say: You cannot have our vote unless we can bring  800,000 young lives along with us? When, Democrats?   Let's demand a vote on the DREAM Act. We can pass it right here,  right now, and give our young people, the future of our Nation, the  safety and security they need and deserve to contribute to the United  States of America.    It is the only country they have known. They are  American in everything but a piece of paper, and we should all be  ashamed of ourselves by not allowing a vote. 800,000 young people,  once, twice, three times registered with the government, and what do  they get? Six months. Pack your bags and leave.   They have pledged allegiance to only one flag, the United States of  America and this country. This cowardly action turns its back on them.  I say no CR. I say no debt ceiling. Let's have a vote first on the  DREAM Act.
