 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3771, known  as the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 2021.   This bill establishes programs that support heart-disease research  and awareness among communities disproportionately affected by heart  disease, like the South Asian community within the United States.   The South Asian American community across the United States grew by  nearly 40 percent between 2010 and 2017. Today, there are over 5  million South Asian Americans in the United States.   South Asian Americans are four times more likely to suffer from heart  disease than other ethnic groups, and experience heart problems nearly  a decade earlier on average.   Globally, South Asians have emerged as the ethnic group with the  highest prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, which is a leading cause of  heart disease.   Type 2 diabetes often occurs due to a combination of a patient's  genetics, and environment. Those with South Asian heritage contain a  genetic predisposition that places them at an even greater risk for  Type 2 diabetes, and by extension, heart disease.   Studies have shown that South Asians in the United States--people who  immigrated from or whose families immigrated from countries including  India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal--are experiencing  dramatic rises in rates of heart disease when compared to other  immigrant groups within the United States.   As a co-chair of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus and a member of  the Congressional India Caucus, I've had the pleasure of engaging with  members of the South Asian community, especially within my hometown of  Houston. Texas has one of the highest populations of South Asian  Americans, along with California and New Jersey.   This bill would direct the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) Secretary to create grants to provide funding for community  groups involved in South Asian heart health advocacy, while also  developing culturally appropriate materials to promote heart health in  the South Asian community.   These culturally appropriate materials to promote heart health would  be tailored by health care providers who best understand the specific  needs of the South Asian community within the United States.   It would also direct the HHS Secretary to fund grants through the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct research on  cardiovascular disease and other heart ailments.   Organizations like the South Asian Heart Center and the South Asian  Health Initiative would be eligible for these opportunities.   These organizations work to educate members of the South Asian  American community  [[Page H7188]]  about their increased risk for heart disease, lead prevention efforts  through programs that promote healthy lifestyles, and work on research  towards understanding why South Asian Americans are at an increased  risk for heart disease.   This legislation would be instrumental in improving the health and  wellbeing of millions of Americans. It is endorsed by a number of  health organizations such as:   the American College of Cardiology,   American Heart Association,   American Medical Association,   American Stroke Association,   WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease,   American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin,   South Asian Public Health Association,   Hindu American Foundation,   Hindu American Physicians in Seva,   South Asian Health Lifestyle Intervention,   Bangladsh Medical Association of North America, and   South Asian Heart Center.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3771.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4040 the  Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2021, which would make  permanent several telehealth flexibilities under Medicare that were  initially authorized during the COVID-19 public health emergency.   This bill would extend the life-saving measures put in place by  Congress during the  [[Page H7196]]  COVID-19 pandemic that allowed millions of American people to access  telehealth-care.   Specifically, H.R. 4040 would:   permanently remove originating site and geographical restrictions  that limited telehealth services to designated clinics in the event of  a physician shortage,   give rural providers the ability to serve patients remotely while  being properly compensated for their work,   empower providers to provide access to smart devices and innovative  digital technology to their patients for monitoring purposes, and   provide coverage for audio-only evaluation, management, and  behavioral health services.   H.R. 4040 would codify critical telehealth policies implemented  during the pandemic for the continued benefit of all, but especially  those in isolated communities, people with disabilities, and seniors.   Telehealth has dramatically improved the medical industry by making  healthcare more accessible to people in rural areas, those with  mobility concerns, and individuals whose work or family schedules may  not accommodate an appointment at a physical location.   During the height of the pandemic, while more than 3,000 people were  dying per day of the virus, telehealth served as an invaluable weapon  against the spread of infectious disease.   Remote screening and care prevented undue burden on our already  exhausted medical professionals and allowed patients to get the care  they needed without putting themselves or their families at risk.   What began as emergency protocol then, has now emerged as best  practice.   Currently, 76 percent of hospitals in the U.S. connect doctors and  patients remotely via telehealth.   This is up from 35 percent a decade ago.   Remote healthcare allows for greater flexibility for patients,  enables certain physicians like allergists or occupational therapists  to access an individual's environmental needs, and streamlines the  scheduling process to prevent long wait times and wasted time.   Telehealth has allowed doctors to monitor their patients' chronic  conditions more closely, like heart or lung disease.   Better monitoring can improve patients' quality-of life and reduce  hospital admissions and deaths from chronic diseases.   Additionally, telehealth is a good way to deliver care quickly in an  emergency, such as a stroke or heart attack.   Telehealth has also played a significant role in expanding pediatric  mental healthcare access.   As of April 2019, there were only 8,300 practicing child and  adolescent psychiatrists in the U.S.   This number is dwarfed by the more than 15 million kids and teens in  need of a psychiatric provider.   For over a decade, The University of Texas Medical Branch has offered  telehealth services for rural patients.   After initially partnering with community mental health clinics in  fringe counties, the program has since been able to expand adolescent  mental health services directly to school districts.   This means children without access to a local psychiatrist can  receive the care they need without being pulled from school or  traveling long distances.   It also means psychiatrists can observe children in their natural  setting at home or in school, rather than in an inorganic hospital  environment.   Telehealth allows children to be where they ought to be--in the  classroom getting an education.   These are just some of the many examples of how telehealth has aided  our healthcare system in providing the quality medical services that  our constituents deserve.   The passage of H.R. 4040, the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19  Act of 2021, would ensure that these positive developments continue to  benefit communities across the country.   It is important to note, however, that telehealth has not always  served all people equally.   Historical data shows that People of Color have long faced obstacles  to getting the critical health care services they need.   Unfortunately, the rapid implementation of telemedicine hasn't  bridged the equality divide as much as one would have hoped.   A study led by the University of Houston College of Medicine found  that African Americans were 35 percent less likely to use telemedicine  compared to White Americans, and those in Hispanic communities were 51  percent less likely to use it.   Only 66 percent of African American and 61 percent of Hispanic  households have access to broadband internet compared to 79 percent of  white households.   Additionally, only a quarter of families earning $30,000 or less have  smart devices, such as a phone, tablet, or laptop at home, limiting  their access to telehealth services.   So, while telehealth has reduced many barriers to adequate  healthcare, we must stay vigilant to the needs of our most  disadvantaged community members.   We are a long way from full medical equality in this country,  however, I believe that the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of  2021 is an important step in bringing us closer to that goal.   H.R. 4040 is an opportunity to connect our healthcare providers with  patients who might otherwise go without the medical care they so  desperately need.   It is an opportunity to lift our nation's healthcare into the 21st  century and to utilize technology as a medical equalizer.   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 4040 the Advancing  Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2021.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  6929, the ``Susan Muffley Act of 2022.''   H.R. 6929 is a bipartisan, bicameral effort to restore the retirement  benefits for over 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees.   This legislation will lay out a formal procedure to pay the  difference between the pension benefits earned by Delphi salaried  retirees and what they received following the General Motors (GM)  bankruptcy in 2009.   Moreover, it will ensure that beneficiaries who have already begun  receiving benefits will receive a separate payment of the difference  between what was actually paid by the U.S. Pension Benefit Guarantee  Corporation  [[Page H7218]]  (PBGC) and what would have been paid without the limitations plus  interest.   Under H.R. 6929, retirees from this auto parts manufacturing company  will be eligible for increased benefits in connection with the  following pension plans:   The Delphi Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan.   The Delphi Retirement Program for Salaried Employees.   The PHI Non-Bargaining Retirement Plan.   The ASEC Manufacturing Retirement Program.   The PHI Bargaining Retirement Plan.   The Delphi Mechatronic Systems Retirement Program.   During the Great Recession of 2009, several major auto manufactuers  including GM filed for bankruptcy.   As a result, the PBGC recklessly cut retirement benefits by as much  as 70 percent for more than 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees, including  over 500 retirees in Texas.   This is unacceptable. Social Security, pensions, and personal savings  have long ensured that workers could retire with dignity.   Now, majority of these retirees are struggling to stay afloat  especially those with climbing medical bills.   Therefore, I applaud the efforts of my colleagues in both the House  and Senate for bringing this issue into greater focus.   Those who have worked hard their entire lives and played by the rules  deserve the benefits they earned.   That is why I am proud to support this legislation that will restore  the benefits that hundreds of Texans were promised.   This legislation will relieve the suffering of thousands of salaried  and hourly workers who were left behind after GM's filing for  bankruptcy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  6929 to finally correct the mistreatment of these union members and  allow them to live out the rest of days with dignity.    Madam Speaker, last week, I viewed a wall that  showed Brittney Griner and a list of hostages, American citizens, held  around the world.   A few weeks ago, the United States House went on record to demand the  release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.   I have always argued that the sovereignty of the United States should  insist on the freedom of its citizens. Now, we find that it has been  made public what we have known and what we have pressed for: The United  States is actively negotiating to bring Brittney, BG, and Paul Whelan  home.   It is crucial to let it be known that we are negotiating with an  entity that does not want to be fair. So, we demand that Russia be fair  and negotiate the freedom of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.   She sits in a cage, a cage when they transport her and a cage when  she is in trial. Obviously, the case is that this was a mistake, and  there is no basis for her conviction. We know that everyone that goes  to trial in Russia is convicted, found guilty.   Free her now. Free Paul Whelan.   As I close, I acknowledge the Americans with Disabilities Act on its  32nd anniversary. It is an important law.                            ____________________
