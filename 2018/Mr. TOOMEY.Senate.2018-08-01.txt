 Mr. President, I would like to recognize the 75th  anniversary of Queen City Airport, located in Allentown, PA.   Dedicated in October 1943, Queen City Airport was originally known as  Convair Field and consisted of an airstrip and several production  facilities leased from Mack Truck. During the Second World War,  Consolidated Vultee, a local aircraft manufacturer, produced the TBY-2  Sea Wolf torpedo bomber for the U.S. Navy at the airport and employed  several thousand workers. After the war ended, aircraft production shut  down and the leased facilities were returned to Mack Truck.   In 1947, ownership of the airport was transferred from the Federal  Government to the city of Allentown, which agreed to maintain the land  as an airport and emergency landing field. Shortly thereafter, the  Pennsylvania Air National Guard began leasing a facility at the airport  for flight training exercises. It was not until 1961 that the airport  was renamed Queen City Municipal and the city assumed full ownership  and operation of the airport. In addition to general aviation services,  the airport began hosting events and exhibitions for members of the  Allentown community, including airshows, hot-air balloon events, and  fireworks on the Fourth of July.   Today Queen City Airport is owned and operated by the Lehigh- Northampton Airport Authority, LNAA. Nearly 80 individual aircraft are  now based at the airport, a majority of which are used for local  general aviation. As a result of LNAA's support for general aviation,  the Federal Aviation Administration's Eastern Region recognized Queen  City Airport as the General Aviation Airport of the Year in 2006.   Again, I wish to congratulate Queen City Airport as it celebrates its  75th anniversary later this year. The airport serves as the home base  for many general aviation pilots throughout the Lehigh Valley, and  during State work periods, I often start my day at Queen City, using  the airport as a home base before flying to various parts of  Pennsylvania to meet with constituents and business leaders. I hope the  airport will continue to support the Allentown community well into the  future.                            ____________________
