 Mr. President, it is pathetic Congress, once again,  stands here at the 11th hour to fulfill its most fundamental  obligation. Partisanship and tunnel vision on damaging the opposition  and preventing the other side from getting a win has replaced  thoughtful legislating.   I have made clear the border is in crisis and Arizona is facing a  security and humanitarian crisis. Enough is enough. Stop using the  border as a political tool. We are here to do our jobs. We must fund  the government, and we must solve our border crisis.   This amendment keeps title 42 until a permanent plan is in place,  boosts desperately needed border funding for security, invests in our  agents and officers, and stops the flow of dangerous drugs.   I call on my colleagues to support this amendment.   I yield to Senator Tester.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.
