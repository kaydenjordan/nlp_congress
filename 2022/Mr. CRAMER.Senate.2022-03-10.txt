 Madam President, last year I had the honor of  congratulating two State championship teams from my alma mater, Kindred  High School, in boys basketball in March and boys football in November.   Last week, it was the Kindred Vikings girls basketball team that took  home the championship trophy at the North Dakota Class B State  tournament, winning a third State title in just 6 years. These girls  began their season with a win and kept on winning. They entered the  tournament undefeated and after their last game were 23-0.   In their final game, the Vikings played last year's State champions,  the Grafton Spoilers, dominating the game early and ending with a 64-40  win. This was the largest championship point margin of victory since  1991. Leading the team was senior guard Abby Duchscherer, who scored 25  points and 10 rebounds. She was also named Senior Athlete of the Year  and Tournament MVP.   Having three State championship sports teams in a year, along with  its overall general academic excellence, speaks highly of the quality  of the Kindred Public School system. I commend all administrators,  teachers, and staff, as well as the entire community for the role they  play in supporting quality education.   For this basketball championship, however, it is the awesome young  women on the team who deserve the greatest recognition. They are Charli  McQuillan, Peyton Gette, Avery Bartels, Abigail Duchscherer, Kacie  Burner, Lexi Ogren, Kristina Freier, Ana Freier, Laela Eisenschenk,  McKenzie Schmitz, Avery Amerman, Terryn Johnson, Leah Rolland, Kennedy  Bakko, and Tess Rohrbeck.   I congratulate the team, as well as Coach Sam Brandt, assistant  coaches Tenille Bakko, Ashley Fahnhorst, Perry Piatz, and Danni Sanders  and all the loyal fans on another Kindred Vikings State championship.   I join all North Dakotans in thanking each and every player on this  team for inspiring us with your excellence. You continue to show us  what can be achieved by combining faith and passion with determination  and teamwork.                            ____________________
