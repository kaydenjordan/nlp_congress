 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  career and service of a gentleman, the Honorable Ramon Garcia.   Judge Garcia recently completed his third term as the Hidalgo County  judge, serving with honor and distinction during his tenure. Judge  Garcia was first elected in 2002. At the end of his tenure in 2006,  Judge Garcia left Hidalgo County in the best financial position it had  ever been in, in its history.   Judge Garcia returned for a second round as Hidalgo County judge,  being elected for a second term in 2010, and a third term in 2014,  having served until this year in 2019.   His leadership and fiscally responsible policies have paved the way  for Hidalgo County to construct a much-needed county courthouse. The  Hidalgo County Commissioners Court officially named the courthouse's  law library the ``Hidalgo County Judge Ramon Garcia Law Library,''  paying homage to his positive contributions to Hidalgo County.  [[Page H2878]]    Ramon Garcia was born in 1948 at the old McAllen General Hospital,  the current location of McAllen City Hall. He graduated with honors  from the University of Houston, Bates College of Law, in 1972, and  passed the State bar the same year.   He began practicing in 1973 with Joe B. Evins, who was an attorney at  the time but would later go on to be the State district judge in our  county.   Recently, Judge Garcia formed a coalition of community leaders to  plan for the 2020 Census and ensure that Hidalgo County is accurately  counted. The coalition's work is recognized statewide and by other city  and county governments that are facing similar situations.   Today, Hidalgo County continues its fight for representation and  entitlement funds, and they owe many thanks to Judge Garcia for his  tireless work.   Madam Speaker, Judge Garcia is a pillar in our community. There are  many reasons to admire the work of Judge Garcia. I personally thank the  judge for his exemplary work in government, but I most admire his trial  and advocacy skills that he has used to advocate for south Texas.   He has challenged the status quo as a litigator and as our county  judge to the benefit of south Texans. It is a privilege to represent  resilient, hardworking individuals like him.                            ____________________
