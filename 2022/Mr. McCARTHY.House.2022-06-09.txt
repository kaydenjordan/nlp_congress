 Madam Speaker, I once again come to the floor to try to  protect our Supreme Court.   Just yesterday, a man who wanted to kill Justice Kavanaugh was  arrested outside the Justice's home. He was arrested with weapons on  his person. Justice Kavanaugh has a wife and children. Yes, he does.   The Senate already passed a bill with agreement from 100 Senators to  enhance the security protection for members of the Court and their  families. Madam Speaker, it has sat here for a month--a month.   Yet, yesterday, House Democrats are leaving. Today, they want to  leave for a long weekend. They gave tomorrow back.   I spoke to the majority leader this morning. I told him nobody on  this side would object, a unanimous consent. He could run that bill on  the floor right now and send it to the President so we could protect  the Supreme Court.   How many times do they have to be threatened? How many people have to  be arrested with a gun outside their homes? What would have happened  had he not called 911? He didn't just have a gun. He had zip ties.   But somehow, you want to leave. This bill could be on the President's  desk right now.   Now, think about this. This is coming from the same party whose White  House press secretary said this, encouraged protests ``outside of  judges' homes.'' She even said that that was President Biden's  position.   Let's not forget Majority Leader Schumer screaming on the steps of  the Supreme Court. What did he say? Madam Speaker, I want you to listen  to these words, and I want you to think about these words. What do you  think the American public would think Schumer was telling them to do?  He said: ``You will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you  go forward with these awful decisions.''   Now, I don't know if that young man yesterday with that gun and zip  ties that was at the home of Justice Kavanaugh listened to this and  that is why he went. I don't know, but I do know that is wrong. I do  know we can change that. I do know we can protect them.   That bill has been sitting here for 1 month. I talked to the majority  leader today. The only idea people have: Well, let's change it.   What does it mean if it is changed? It means it goes back to the  Senate and waits longer.   Why? Why would we do that?   Every single Senator voted for it. And I promise you this: Every  single Republican on this side would give unanimous consent to pass  that, send it to the President, and protect the Supreme Court.   Enough is enough.   I know the Democrats want to defund the police. I know what they want  to do across this country, but this is wrong. This is pure politics.  And it has got to stop.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's  table S. 4160, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, I want it very clear, it is cleared on  the House Republican side. There is not one Republican objecting, so  the only place it is not being cleared is on the Democrats' side, and  it is not moving. It has been sitting on the desk for a month, and that  is wrong.                            ____________________
