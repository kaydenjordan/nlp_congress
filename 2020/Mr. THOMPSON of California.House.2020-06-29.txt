 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 1425, legislation expanding and enhancing the Affordable Care  Act and lowering healthcare costs for all Americans.   In the past 6 months over 120,000 Americans have died due to COVID- 19. Millions have lost their jobs and, in many cases, their health  insurance. That is why it is so critical that we strengthen and build  upon the foundation of the Affordable Care Act, which is exactly what  this bill does.   This legislation reduces the price of expensive pharmaceuticals-- including insulin--saving taxpayers billions of dollars while driving  down drug costs for all Americans.   The bill uses those savings to lower insurance premiums and expand  tax credits, helping more Americans afford the coverage that they need.   This bill bolsters State Medicaid programs, funds COVID-19 vaccine  research, and cuts the number of uninsured Americans by nearly 4  million.   The President and my Republican colleagues are actively trying to gut  protections for preexisting conditions and take healthcare away from  millions of Americans.   By contrast, this legislation reduces healthcare costs for millions  of Americans at this critical time. It is vital that we give our  constituents the help they need.   I heard so many of my friends on the other side talk about how they  want to protect people who have preexisting conditions, every one of  which is in support of the lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  the very bill and the very law that protects people who have  preexisting conditions.   Madam Speaker, you cannot be for protecting preexisting conditions  and for repealing the law that provides that protection.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
