 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  North Carolina for her leadership here and on the committee as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1101, the Small Business  Health Fairness Act.   It is amazing as a freshman in this body to watch this debate over  what we are trying to do on this side when we know what has already  transpired, what has been done:   The Affordable Care Act was going to lower our premiums $2,500. That  is what the President said. But they went up by $4,800.   In my home State of Minnesota, we have seen back-to-back increases of  55 and 67 percent, 100,000 people thrown off their plan.   We have got 1,000 counties in this country with just one insurer.   The exchanges are imploding. As young, healthy people can't afford  the premiums, they drop out, and the pools only have the older and the  sicker.   We have job lock, where people trying to start a small business can't  get the same tax advantages or purchasing power as those in big  companies.   So what to do? We are going to stabilize the insurance markets  through choice and competition, and that is what H.R. 1101 does. It  lowers premiums. It enlarges pools. We do that. We must do that to save  the health insurance markets and health care in America. That is the  agenda of H.R. 1101. That is the agenda of what we are trying to do in  global healthcare reform.   So today, as we debate how to fix health care in America, let us not  forget the status quo and the debacle it is. So I stand and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I further urge my colleagues to  finish the job over what we are starting on real healthcare reform.
