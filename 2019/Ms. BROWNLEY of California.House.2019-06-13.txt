 Madam Speaker, yesterday was Women  Veterans Day in my home State of California, also home to 145,000 women  veterans.   Seventy-one years ago, President Truman signed the Women's Armed  Services Integration Act of 1948. This law recognized women's enduring  and critical service to the Nation and made them permanent members of  the United States Armed Forces.   As chairwoman of the Women's Veterans Task Force, I am working with  66 of my colleagues in the House, as well as in the Senate, to increase  visibility of women veterans. We are promoting inclusivity and  equitable access to healthcare, benefits, education, and economic  opportunity, particularly in the Department of Veterans Affairs.   I ask all Americans to join me in recognizing the 2 million women who  have served our country in uniform. To these women veterans I say:  Thank you for your service to our great Nation.                            ____________________
