 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my deepest  condolences and prayers to the families of Darin Johns and Marc  Boswell, who were tragically killed in a bus crash while traveling with  the Andrews High School band.   Darin Johns, the beloved band director, was an active member of the  Andrews community who dedicated his life to his faith and his beloved  wife, Karen, and their family and friends, and who invested in younger  generations as a band director for over 30 years.   He lent all of his time and energy to building up the dreams and  talents of those around him.   I also want to recognize Marc Boswell, a humble and beloved Andrews  public servant. Marc devoted his life to Andrews as a high school math  teacher, was an employee of the Andrews school district, and was  involved in the community as a leader and as a friend.   He was known for his servant heart, his incredible work ethic, his  infectious smile, and his deep love for his wife, Carol, and their  children and grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, Camille and I are sending our support and our prayers,  not only to the families of those who were tragically killed, but also  to the entire community and Andrews High School.                            ____________________
