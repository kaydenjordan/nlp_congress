 Mr. Speaker, this week the House is taking strong  action to stop the epidemic of youth tobacco use.   We have watched as the use of tobacco and vape products by kids has  exploded in our community over the past months. It has become a full- blown public health crisis affecting more than 5 million kids.   More than 200 Illinoisans have suffered respiratory illness from  dangerous vape products since last year. Eight of them have died. This  shouldn't be happening.   Thanks to decades of public health work and education, youth tobacco  use was actually going down until the introduction of sophisticated  vape products.   Let's be clear, these products are targeted at kids. They are made  with flavors like cotton candy and gummy bears. They are marketed  directly to children, and they are designed to keep children hooked.   This is a crisis that we will be dealing with for decades because 95  percent of adult tobacco users started when they were kids, and there  is still so much that we don't know about how the high doses of  nicotine and other chemicals in these products affect kids' bodies and  their minds.   Given the FDA's failure to effectively regulate these products,  Congress needs to act now before it is too late. It is time to stand up  and refuse to let our kids be hurt. It is time to pass the Protecting  American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019.                            ____________________
