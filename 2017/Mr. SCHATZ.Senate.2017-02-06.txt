 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I wish to tell a story about Evelyn, a  young woman I met from Molokai, which is a small rural island in the  State of Hawaii. It is the kind of place that has one radio station,  one high school, and everybody knows everybody. Of course, everyone in  town knows Evelyn.   They were all so very proud of her when she invented a pH sensor that  can detect even small changes in the ocean's environment. Her device is  nothing short of groundbreaking. It is actually more accurate than the  devices that marine scientists at our Federal agencies have been using,  and it is way less expensive. It is an estimated \1/42\nd of the price,  and it requires half the maintenance.   This invention makes Evelyn an accomplished scientist, an innovator,  an entrepreneur, and a passionate ocean steward, but she is also a  junior in public high school, Molokai High School. She is proof that  our public school students can compete and innovate at the highest  levels and that public schools can be a path to just about anything,  which is why public schools and public education are to be held up and  supported and understood as the great equalizer, the bedrock of our  democracy, our civil society, our country. You can trace back the  history of public education in America to the Original Thirteen  Colonies. In 1635, boys in Boston could get a free education, and by  1647, the Massachusetts Bay Colony  [[Page S770]]  required every town to provide boys a basic education.    Some 340 years later, our public education system has come a long  way, but some things don't change. Our communities still understand how  public education lays a foundation for success. It gives every American  the chance to pursue their dreams. But the nominee for Secretary of  Education doesn't seem to understand that, which is why we see  constituents flooding the phone lines, Facebook and Twitter, faxes, and  the in-boxes of U.S. Senators.   In terms of pure volume, this last week has been the highest point  for American interaction with the U.S. Congress in our history. Think  about that. Think about what we have been through as a country  together, and yet, this week and last, more people have called their  Members of the Senate than literally ever before because that is the  level of passion people feel for public education and because Americans  across the country are concerned and worried about what will happen to  public education under Betsy DeVos. My office alone has received  thousands of messages about her nomination.   I just want to be clear about this. There are certainly advocacy  organizations that make it easy for you to contact your Member of  Congress. They have form letters. They have Web forms. They make it  easy. They populate the thing. They pop off an email, and you just sign  at the bottom. That isn't what I am talking about. These are  organically generated, individual letters from across the State of  Hawaii.   Talking with colleagues, that is what is happening. People are, on  their own, calling because everybody has a story about public  education. Everybody has a reason to be passionate about public  education. Let me share a few of these concerns.   A parent on the Big Island of Hawaii wrote:         As a mother of two, and as a woman who went back to       graduate school in her 50s, I understand the importance of       free education in public schools as a fundamental American       right, one which can create a lifelong love of education and       learning.    A constituent from Kihei, Maui, wrote:         Public schools are not failing. We, as in our American       culture, are failing them.    Another one from Kahului, Maui, wrote:         Children are not a business, they are not a commodity.       Public education has its issues (of course it does), but       privatizing teachers and turning education into an       opportunity for the rich to get richer on one of the last       social services we provide to everyone in this country is not       the answer.    Here is one from a teacher on the island of Molokai:         The nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has       zero experience serving in public schools and is not       qualified for the job. I do not believe she understands the       needs of our students and what effort it has taken to move       our schools as far along as we have. Public education is a       great responsibility and cannot be left to those who have       never worked directly with children in need.        These are children who experience school as a safe place       when they are valued, fed and educated. This serious       responsibility of public education in no way can be left or       replaced by a voucher system.    Here is another message from a constituent on the Big Island:         My family has very strong ties to the education community--      many of which are or were educators. My husband is an English       as a second language teacher, and my mother-in-law is       currently a third grade teacher, so this issue cuts deep in       our beliefs. We at a minimum deserve a leader with some       experience and who knows at least some of the laws already in       place as well as how to enforce them.        Mrs. DeVos has never known what a child from Milolii has to       do just to get a good education. She has never had to make       the choice to go to college or to stay home, try to save       money while also helping to support her household. Neither       her nor her children had to question if she can afford out of       state tuition. She does not represent our plight and she does       not know our challenges.        I ask you from the pureness of my heart as a mom who wants       what is best for not only my child, but for every mother's       child, to please demand an educational representative with       experience and our values in mind.    Here is a message from another parent:         This is not about which side of the political arena you       fall upon. I believe there are many Republicans and Democrats       who are far more qualified and knowledgeable than Mrs. DeVos.       Our kids deserve better.    She is right--our kids do deserve better. But right now, not all of  them are getting the education they deserve. A 2016 report found that  half a million 15-year-old students in the United States haven't  mastered the basics in any subject--not math, not reading, not  science--and more than a million scored below the baseline level in  science.   U.S. News and World Report noted that if we could pull those kids up  to a basic understanding, our economy could grow by an estimated $27  trillion over the time period that these students are in the workforce.  Set aside the human impact for a moment. Set aside the family impact.  If all you care about is economic development, we are leaving $27  trillion on the table because we are not lifting up every child to  learn as much as they possibly can and reach their potential.   In too many places, we are failing these kids. The impact is both  negative and far reaching. Our failure impacts their ability to go to  college or learn a trade, to make a decent paycheck, to provide for  their family, and to pursue the American dream. But we don't have to  fail these children. This Congress can make choices that will improve  education for all. We can make, instead of break, the future for our  kids. We can decide to increase funding for disadvantaged students. We  can decide to protect our students from bullying, sexual harassment,  and gun violence. We can decide to set up children for success with  universal access to early childhood education.   There is abundant brain science now that confirms every parent's  instinct, which is that the first 5 years of a child's life--of an  infant's life into being a toddler, then to being a little kid--those  first 5 years are the most important years for a child. Now we don't  have to just use our instincts because there is abundant brain science  and data that have come in that have shown, in terms of the efficacy of  a Federal dollar spent, there is nothing that has a greater impact in  terms of reducing social service spending, in terms of economic  development, than investing in early childhood education.   We can decide to adhere to commonsense accountability standards to  ensure a high-quality education to all children, regardless of who your  parents are or where you live. We can decide to invest in wage-boosting  apprenticeship careers and technical education. We can make college  more affordable so our students can access higher education without  taking on crushing debt.   But to accomplish these goals, we need an excellent Department of  Education to make it happen because the agency is responsible for  implementing Congress's decisions. It is up to the executive branch to  ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence  throughout the Nation. That is literally the mission statement of the  U.S. DOE--to ensure equal access to education and to promote  educational excellence. And that is the way I look at the Secretary  nominee. Is she committed to ensuring access--equal access to education  and promoting educational excellence?   The Secretary of Education is responsible for the mission of  overseeing a $36 billion budget in K-12 and about $150 billion in  higher education funding. This person is responsible for enforcing key  civil rights protections for our students. This person advises the  President on all things education in the United States, whether it is a  policy that will affect a local public school or a policy that will  impact millions of student borrowers.   Up until this moment, every Secretary of Education who has served in  the President's Cabinet has had the resume required to take on these  responsibilities.   Shirley Hufstedler was the first Secretary of Education to be in the  Cabinet, serving under President Carter. As the daughter of a  schoolteacher and a part-time teacher herself, she was also a  trailblazing lawyer who was considered a favorite to be the first woman  nominated to the Supreme Court.   Terrel Bell was a teacher, a professor, and then a superintendent of  a school district in Utah before he served under President Reagan.   William Bennett was a professor at three universities who released  research about higher education curriculums before heading the  Department to serve under President Reagan.  [[Page S771]]    Laurel Cavazos was dean of Tufts Medical School before becoming  president of Texas Tech University. He would go on to be the first  Secretary of Education for President George H.W. Bush.   The esteemed Senator Alexander served as Governor of Tennessee and  president of the University of Tennessee before becoming President  Bush's Secretary of Education.   Richard Riley championed funding and support for education as  Governor of South Carolina before leading the Department of Education  under President Clinton.   Rod Paige was a professor, a dean, an innovator in education, and the  superintendent of the Houston school district before he served under  President George W. Bush.   Margaret Spellings advised then-Governor George Bush on education in  Texas before becoming his second Secretary of Education.   Arne Duncan served as the CEO for Chicago's public school system  before joining the Obama administration as Secretary of Education.   John King, Jr., was the commissioner of education for New York and  Deputy Secretary of Education before he led the Department as Secretary  for President Obama.   Every Secretary who has led the Department came to the job with a  history in government or in the classroom. They served as elected  officials or as policy advisers in the executive branch or worked as  administrators or educators. But now this administration is asking us  to make an exception by confirming someone who really doesn't have any  relevant experience. She has never served in the government, never  taught in the classroom, never managed a school district.   One woman from Oahu wrote me to say:         She is supremely unqualified to lead the department. As a       retired public school teacher--30 years both in regular and       special education--I am aghast that she is even being       considered. When one is being nominated to uphold Federal       education laws and is ``confused'' by what IDEA entails, it       becomes very apparent that this person is a poor choice for       this position.    Another letter I got from an educator reads:         I taught in both public and private schools for 10 years on       the mainland before moving to Hawaii and teaching for more       than 15 additional years. Watching video clips on the news of       her Senate hearings, it is appalling to see how little she       knows about the topic of education. I worry for all of our       children. I worry for our country. Please, if you can, do       what you can do to see that we get someone more qualified to       help guide our children and our country. HELP!    Everything that has happened since Mrs. DeVos has been nominated has  unfortunately only confirmed the concerns I heard from constituents.  Because her hearing was so short, Senators followed up with written  questions, and in some cases, her responses lifted language from other  sources without citing them. In one response, she wrote, ``Every child  deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment, where they  can learn, thrive and grow.'' Fine. Well, an Obama official used the  exact same language in a press release regarding the rights of  transgender students, but she did not cite that official or the press  release.   In another example, she answered a question about title IX  investigations in the following way: ``Opening a complaint for  investigation in no way implies that the Office of Civil Rights has  made a determination about the merits of that complaint.'' That is the  exact language the Department of Education uses in its own guidance.  There is nothing wrong with citing a source, especially when that  source is the Department you want to run, but it has to be cited. That  is one of the first things you teach a child in seventh and eighth  grade when they are trying to learn how to do research--cite your  sources.   But the central issue isn't the lack of a seriousness of purpose  during the hearings and in the questions for the record, although I  think that was what caused the Nation to kind of wake up and rise up  about the challenge in front of us when it comes to public education.  This was not part of some master strategy on the part of Democrats.  What happened in those hearings is that Michael Bennet, Al Franken,  Chris Murphy, and Elizabeth Warren just did their jobs and asked  questions.   If you told me that a clip about the distinction between proficiency  and growth--I mean, that is the wonkiest thing in the world. But what  happened was 2 million people or more saw that on Facebook. This wasn't  part of our political strategy. What happened was that people saw the  hearing and got very worried that we will have the wrong person in  charge of public education policy at the Federal level. So you have  people left, right, and center. You can ask the Senate Republicans  whether they are getting phone calls too. They are getting phone calls  too. This is not a Democratic strategy. What is happening is that we  have the wrong person who may be confirmed as the Secretary of  Education.   The central issue is that there remain concerns around Mrs. DeVos's  basic understanding of education policy. During her confirmation  hearings, there were several moments when she didn't seem to fully  grasp the important parts of Federal law on education.   The Washington Post actually published an article called ``Six  astonishing things Betsy DeVos said--and refused to say--at her  confirmation hearing.''         DeVos refused to agree with a Democrat that schools are no       place for guns, citing one school that needs one to protect       against grizzly bears.        When Senator Chris Murphy asked her whether she would agree       that guns don't belong in schools, she said, ``I will refer       back to Senator Enzi and the school he was talking about in       Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there       is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential       grizzlies.''    This would be hilarious if it weren't so serious. This would be  hysterically funny if this weren't the person who is about to become  our Secretary of Education.   When asked whether she would support President Trump if he, as  promised, moved to end gun-free zones around schools, she said: ``I  will support whatever the President does,'' even if that means moving  guns into schools, allowing guns in schools. She added: ``If the  question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know  that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost  any individual to gun violence.''   DeVos refused to agree with Senator Tim Kaine that all schools that  receive public Federal funds--traditional public, charter, or private  schools that receive voucher money--should be held to the same  standards of accountability.   A little background on this issue. I have a great charter school  movement in the State of Hawaii, but the deal we have struck--and it is  imperfect, and they are always arguing about fixed costs and capital  costs and all the rest of it, but the basic bargain when charters work  is that they are legitimately a public school. What does that mean?  That means they are held to the same standards as traditional public  schools because to the extent that you have two categories of public  schools with different metrics, then you are basically playing a game,  trying to divert money from one to the other.   OK, so Tim Kaine's question was exactly right. If public money is  involved--whether it is vouchers to a private school, school choice to  a charter school, or a traditional public school--shouldn't we measure  each school's success in the same way, just to be fair?   Kaine said: If confirmed, will you insist upon equal accountability  in any K-12 school or educational program that receives taxpayer  funding--whether public, public charter, or private?   DeVos said: I support accountability.   Kaine said: Equal accountability?   DeVos: I support accountability.   Kaine: Is that a yes or a no?   DeVos: I support accountability.   Kaine: Do you not want to answer my question?   DeVos. I support accountability.   This is someone who either did not prepare for the hearing or is  basically walking into this hearing saying: I have the votes. I don't  have to answer your questions. I don't have to reassure the parents,  teachers, and students who are desperately worried about what is going  to happen to public education because I have the votes.   Kaine said: Let me ask you this. I think all schools that receive  taxpayer funding should be equally accountable.   I mean, he is so polite, but he is also very lawyerly. So he asked  the question 14 different ways, trying to get the answer.  [[Page S772]]    Do you agree?   DeVos: Well, they don't. They are not today.   Kaine: Well, I think they should. Do you agree with me?   Well, no.   Kaine, interrupting her, said: You don't not agree with me. And then  he moved on to another topic.   DeVos appeared to have no idea what Al Franken was talking about when  he referred to the accountability debate about whether to use test  scores to measure student proficiency or student growth.   I mean, there is a debate about student proficiency and student  growth, and I won't bore you with the details except to say that I  don't expect regular folks out there to be into the weeds about the  difference between proficiency and growth. I get how wonky that is. I  absolutely expect the Secretary of Education nominee to know about  this.   I mean, even if you are brand new to the topic, if you just have  smart people in the room who briefed you on it--10 hours maybe--you  would be ready to talk about proficiency and growth. This is what I am  talking about when I talk about a lack of preparation, a lack of  humility around what advice and consent means, and the Senate has an  obligation to take every nomination seriously.   Franken noted that the subject has been debated in the education  community for many years and said, when she didn't weigh in and just  looked at him without much of an expression on her face: It surprises  me that you don't know this issue.   But it is not just issues like accountability or guns in schools that  concern me. On a whole host of issues, Mrs. DeVos's views are far out  of the mainstream of education policy.   I want to highlight four policy areas where Mrs. DeVos's views are  beyond my line in the sand. Let's start with K-12 education. I think we  can all agree that this country has work to do when it comes to public  education. But I am worried that Mrs. DeVos would prefer to privatize  our public schools instead of improving them.   Take a look at her track record. She has fought to strip away  protections around K-12 education and introduce a profit motive into  our education system. She has lobbied for vouchers and for for-profit  schools. She has been relatively successful in her lobbying efforts. In  her home State of Michigan, she had an enormous influence on the  State's approach to education.   Now, I would point any Senator on the fence about her nomination to  look at this case study because it speaks volumes. In 2000, Michigan  fourth and fifth grade students had higher than average test scores in  math and English.   Fifteen years later, students now perform below average. Last spring,  the Atlantic published a fascinating article about Detroit's education  system, which has been most influenced by the policies that Mrs. DeVos  champions. I would like to read a few excerpts from it.         Three months into her son's first pass at third grade,       Arlyssa Heard had a breakdown. Judah was bright, but had       begun calling himself stupid. The chaos of Detroit's       precarious education landscape had forced him to switch       schools every few months, leaving him further and further       behind.        There was no central system to transfer Judah's records       when he moved, and according to Heard the school where he       started the 2014-15 academic year had a single teacher       assigned to 44 third-graders. Heard was virtually alone in       trying to deal with the fact that her boy, then 8, could       write only the first two letters of his name.        Heard says she was one of the parents Detroit Public       Schools turned to when it needed a strong family showing at a       rally or community members to serve on a task force. She was       running for the Detroit School Board. But when she needed       help, she had nowhere to turn.        ``Here I was this advocate for education, and I couldn't       find a place for my son,'' she says. ``I was crying in the       principal's office and I said, `I don't know what to do.' The       principal said, `I don't either.'''        The scope of the problems plaguing Detroit schools--both       traditional district schools and charters--is almost       unfathomable. According to the most recent National       Assessment of Educational Progress, only 4 percent of       Detroit's eight grade students can read and perform math at       grade level, the lowest rate among the nation's big cities.        Schools aren't located where families need them--    Think about this--       and campuses often open and close with no coordination or       notice. Over the last six years, most schools in the city       have either opened or closed--or both. In one neighborhood in       the city's southwest quadrant, home to a large Latino       population and a number of industrial zones, a dozen schools       opened or closed in the span of 18 months. And when a parent       shows up to find a child's classroom abandoned, good luck       finding a new one. There are more than 200 schools with       roughly 50 different enrollment processes and almost no       standard for performance.        Some 44 percent of the Detroit students are enrolled in       charter schools, the second-highest rate in the Nation,       behind New Orleans. One of those schools is the Detroit       Leadership Academy, which two years ago was solidly at the       back of a flagging pack. Abutting a crumbling freeway access       road in the city's working-class Castle Rouge neighborhood,       several grades at the school's elementary campus did not       boast a single student reading or performing math at grade       level.        During the summer of 2015, a network of three charter       schools called Equity Education Solutions--which unlike most       of the city's charter operators is a nonprofit--was tasked       with turning the school around, a restart required under law       because of its consistently poor performance. Central       Michigan University, the authorizing entity that granted the       school permission to exist, told the fledgling network it had       8 months to fix things.        In reality, the operators of Detroit's charter schools       almost never close them because of poor academic performance.       So even a school where no child is achieving at grade level       can continue enrolling new students.    That is school choice for you. That is the charter school movement  for you--not in every instance, but this is how it manifested itself in  the State of Michigan, where Betsy DeVos played a major role.         And the higher-education institutions that authorize them,       often have financial incentives to keep the schools open;       charter networks give authorizers a percentage of the       funding.    So the agency, which is often a university or some other institution,  actually gets a cut of the revenue for authorizing. So they have a  problem saying: This charter must be shut down--because that costs them  money.         In some States in exchange for that revenue, charter       authorizers are encouraged to provide support and       accountability, but not in Michigan, where the trustees of       the colleges doing the authorizing are appointed by the       governor. ``Not even the governor has the authority to shut       down chronically low-performing charter authorizers in       Michigan,'' Education Trust-Midwest noted in a report       released last week, ``despite the fact that such authorizers       serve nearly 145,000 Michigan children--and their charter       schools take in more $1 billion annually.''        Critics say this is especially problematic because almost       all of Detroit's charter schools are run by for-profit       companies.    Think about that. This is public education. Right? These are public  dollars. Suddenly, they are going to for-profit companies. It would be  one thing to have the old talk from Members on the other side of the  aisle: We should run government like a business. Well, if the point is  to run things efficiently to do more innovation, fine. If the point is  to try to suck as much revenue out of the taxpayer as we possibly can  and deliver a minimal service, you know, I don't think we should run  the public education system like that kind of a business. In this case,  it is not running it like a business; it is running a business with  Federal and State tax dollars.         The private businesses aren't required to disclose their       earnings, but a 2014 investigation by the Detroit Free Press       suggests profits are huge.        During the 2012-13 school year, the paper found,       traditional Detroit public schools spent an average of about       $7,000 per student in the classroom. Charter schools spent       about $2,000 less per pupil.    They are getting the same amount of money, and they are spending  $2,000 less per kid. Yet they spent double that rate on per-pupil  funding on administrative costs. That is their skim. That is their  profit.         Meanwhile, the oversupply of seats in for-profit schools       has arguably kept nonprofit charter networks with better       track records out of the market.    So they really are operating like a business, like an airline; right?  They are operating like a credit card company, a financial services  company. I mean, this is the private sector at work in public  education. There are some private sector models where I think: Hey,  let's have a partnership with the Department of Education to try to see  how much clean energy we can develop. Let's work with the Department of  Commerce on export promotion. But there are some aspects of what the  government does that are not a good fit with the private sector. This  [[Page S773]]  is one of them. This is not some ideological test. It is just not  working.   We are ripping off our taxpayers, and we are giving a bad value to  the students who deserve better.         The Senate bill under consideration at the Michigan       statehouse would have created a Detroit commission with the       power to change all of that. The leaders of the Michigan       Association of Public School Academies, the main charter       lobby association, and some of Michigan's for-profit       management companies have long lobbied against policies that       would have tightened accountability. The most influential of       them is Betsy DeVos, a major player in Michigan's Republican       Party and in the efforts to widen the for-profit sector.        They have argued that proposals such as that put forward by       the Senate bill disregard the needs of Detroit's children.       ``Legislators should not give in to this anti-choice, anti-      parent, and anti-student agenda aimed at protecting and       maintaining the status quo for deeply entrenched adult       interest groups,'' Betsy DeVos opined in the Detroit News.       ``After all, since DPS has lost 75 percent of their       enrollment in the past decade, haven't Detroit parents       already voted resoundingly by fleeing for higher quality and       safer schools elsewhere?''        But critics, including Stephen Henderson, the Detroit Free       Press's editorial page editor, says it's groups such as the       DeVos foundations that have an agenda.        ``House Republicans, for instance, are also standing in the       way of [a bill] which would, quite simply, slow the spread of       mediocre or failing schools.''    The article ends with a few paragraphs about Arlyssa Heard, the  advocate described in the beginning of the story.         After enrolling her son in two more schools that didn't       work, she found a small startup school that has strategies       for helping Judah compensate for his ADHD. He had to repeat       the third grade, but has rocketed ahead. Now he talks about       becoming a scientist.        The realization that better is possible has redoubled       Heard's willingness to make the trek to Lansing as often as       parent voices need to be heard. ``Who are these people who       are making the decisions and why aren't they in the       schools,'' she asks. ``Why can't we know? Why can't you just       be accountable to the people you are serving?''    Now, during the confirmation hearing, Senator Bennet, whom I greatly  admire, and who is a former superintendent of the Denver Public  Schools, asked Mrs. DeVos how the policy failures in Detroit might  inform her leadership at the DOE.   She replied: I think there is a lot that has gone right.   Senator Patty Murray, a former school board president, asked if Mrs.  DeVos would promise not to privatize public education or cut funding. A  pretty straightforward question. A pretty mainstream question, right? I  mean, if you get sort of a mainstream Republican nominee for Secretary  of Education, they know how to answer this question. They may have a  different view of common core. They may have a different view of the  teachers' unions. They may have a different view on charter school  choice. But everybody knows it is the third rail; you do not talk about  privatizing public education.    Here is her response:         I look forward, if confirmed, to working with you to talk       about how we address the needs of all parents and all       students.        We acknowledge today that not all schools are working for       the students that are assigned to them. I'm hopeful that we       can work together to find common ground and ways that we can       solve those issues and empower parents to make choices on       behalf of their children that are right for them.    I don't know what that means. It is not a complicated question,  right? I mean, certainly in the United States Senate, you get a lot of  complicated questions, right, on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, on the Education Committee. I happen to be the ranking  member of the Communications Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee,  and half of what I say is totally unintelligible to people who don't  work in tech and telecom.   But this is a very straightforward question. The question is, Do you  promise not to work on privatizing public education? And the answer is  basically: No, I don't promise. I mean, it is a word salad, but it  doesn't mean anything. And she was given a very easy opportunity to  disavow her intent to privatize public education.   Privatization is not the answer. We should not be funneling taxpayer  money into unregulated and unaccountable private schools.   We need to champion access to public education and the accountability  measures that give all of our students a chance to succeed.   But in Michigan, Mrs. DeVos lobbied to block accountability standards  for charter schools and lift the cap on charter schools. These actions  pushed the number of unregulated, for-profit operators of charter  schools from 255 to 805.   Now, this doesn't mean that charter schools are the boogeyman here,  right? I mean, there may be some disagreements between people who  support charter schools and people who support traditional public  schools, but at the end of the day, the legitimate, mainstream charter  school proponents will always want to be able to look you in the eye  and say: Look, this is not about vouchers, and this is not about  privatization. This is about the flexibility to innovate. They  understand the basic bargain in the charter movement has to be: OK. It  is public education dollars, and there are a couple of things that are  mandatory, right? You have to comply with Federal and State law. You  have to be subject to the same accountability standards, and you have  to take all comers. So it is very important to the mainstream charter  people--   I was interested to know because I have a good relationship with  education reformers and with the charter movement, so when I heard  about Mrs. DeVos, I was interested to hear what they had to say. They  were, in a lot of ways, more alarmed than anyone because they believed  this would be the death knell for real charters because, to the extent  that charters are just cover for privatizing public education, well,  now it is going to be a fight. Now it is going to be a fight.   We have some great charter schools in my home State of Hawaii. They  are doing innovative things for their students, and that is something  we should all support, but when Mrs. DeVos talks about charter schools,  she is not talking about those schools. She is talking about  privatization.   The rallying cry behind privatization is often school choice, but  choice doesn't work as a practical matter in many places across the  country. In a lot of communities, particularly in rural areas, school  choice is not a practical response to the problems. There is no school  down the road, right? There is no little Catholic school. There is no  private charter school. There is no public charter school. There is  just the school, right? Because the town is too small to have multiple  options.   So when you talk about taking--and I heard a figure of $20 billion  out of the K-12 budget which is not that--I mean, it is $20 billion out  of $36 billion--and providing it for school choice and for charters,  well, what about Alaska, right? What about Nebraska? What about the  Dakotas? What about parts of Hawaii, where if you give a parent and a  student a voucher, and they say: Well, I have this voucher for private  education, for charter schools, and yet there is only one school left,  all you did was eviscerate the budget of the only school in your  neighborhood. That is how this is going to work as a practical matter.   I don't know if that is the intent or not. I honestly don't know if  that is the intent or not, but that is how it would end up working. To  drain money from traditional public education hurts people in small  communities, in rural communities, and places where there is no  possibility of multiple schools.   School choice can drain resources. When a charter school opens up,  the public school has to divert resources from its students, and that  is something I have heard about from people in Hawaii.   One teacher whom I heard from who has worked for two decades in both  Hawaii and Michigan wrote this to me:         Ms. DeVos would be a disaster for public education. She has       never been a teacher to know what current educational       practices consist of.        Her advocacy for more unaccountable (often for-profit)       charter schools and greater use of vouchers so that students       could attend private or religious schools would take needed       resources away from local public schools.        Her mission, in short, is to privatize public education.       I've witnessed firsthand in Michigan what happens when       schools privatize.        DeVos should be opposed not only for what she could do, if       confirmed, but for what she's done in Michigan.        The DeVos family set up the Great Lakes Education Project,       which has played a leading role in thwarting efforts to       regulate charter schools in Detroit and, for the most part,       failed to deliver on their promises of a better education for       students.   [[Page S774]]     I just want to pause for a moment and thank all of the people who  write my office every day but in particular the people who have been  writing my office on all of these nominees because it wasn't that  difficult to pull these incredibly insightful, passionate, individually  written letters, and this is happening across the country.   You know, you get the pundits as you leave the Senate. If it is the  middle of the day and not 2:30 in the morning, the media kind of comes  to you, and they stick the microphone in your face, and they ask you  about: Is there a new tea party on the left?   All I can tell you is, there are millions and millions and millions  of people who are rising up. I don't think they are all on the left. I  mean, when I saw those marches, there were lots of progressives, lots  of people who believe in liberal and progressive causes, but I also saw  some people who have never marched in their lives. I also saw some  people who just care about public education. They don't even know what  their politics are, except they saw Betsy DeVos, and they said: No,  this is not what I voted for. This is not what I want for my son or for  my daughter or for my niece or my nephew. This is not what I want for  the country's future, which brings me to the second policy area that I  think we ought to consider and that is for-profit colleges.   What is happening with some for-profit colleges is nothing less than  a national scandal. Students are being hurt, and we are wasting tens of  billions of dollars. So here are the facts:   Almost 2 million students are enrolled in for-profit programs, and  they have collectively taken on $200 billion in debt to attend, but  they often leave with little to show for it. More than half drop out  within a few months. At some colleges, fewer than 5 percent of their  students ever graduate.   For those who leave without a degree, repaying loans is an incredible  struggle. Students at for-profit colleges default on student loans at  double the rate of students at nonprofit colleges. This is morally  outrageous on its own, but it is particularly egregious to the American  taxpayer because these substandard programs are financed almost  entirely by the Federal Government, and the amount is staggering.   In total, for-profits receive over $32 billion a year in Federal  financial aid. That is 20 percent of the total aid, and they serve 12  percent of the students--20 percent of the aid, 12 percent of the  students, $32 billion in Federal funding.   There are several for-profit companies that each take in more than $1  billion in Federal aid a year and graduate fewer than 10 percent of  their students. Think about that. We taxpayers are paying most of the  bill a year, and these kids are not graduating. They take in more than  $1 billion, and they are graduating fewer than 10 percent of their  kids.   Not only are the education metrics on student performance awful, but  many of these for-profit colleges are also under investigation for  fraud and deception. Essentially, they have been lying to students and  to State and Federal agencies to cover up how bad their record is.   Even while prosecutors go after these schools for fraud, they remain  accredited, and they continue to rake in Federal funds.   Here are a few examples. Education Management Corporation faces  charges of fraud and deception brought by prosecutors in 13 States and  the Department of Justice and was facing a lawsuit to recover $11  billion in Federal and State funds. Yet EMC is still accredited and  still received $1.25 billion from the U.S. DOE last year.   Ultimately, the Department of Justice secured a $100 million  settlement, and a separate coalition of State attorneys general reached  another settlement for $102 million in student loan debt relief for  former students.   ITT Educational Services was investigated and sued by 19 States, the  SEC, the CFPB, and the DOJ. It is also under scrutiny from U.S. DOE for  failure to meet financial responsibility standards. They remained  accredited until the day they shut their doors. Think about that. They  were still accredited by the U.S. DOE, right, until they were shut down  by the U.S. DOJ.   The year before, they received just under $600 million. Their closure  has left thousands of students in the lurch, with hundreds of thousands  of dollars in student loan debt.   Another 152 schools are under investigation by a working group of 37  State attorneys general. They too are still accredited. Collectively,  they received $8 billion in Federal financial aid last year.   So what do these schools have in common? They never lose their  accreditation, even when there are ongoing investigations of fraud and  deceptive practices that harm students.   Accreditation is the key to the castle for accessing the spigot of  Federal financial aid. It is supposed to signify that a program  provides a quality education for its students, but here is the thing.  This accreditation doesn't mean much. The Government Accountability  Office released a study on accreditation in 2014, and its findings were  shocking. Over a 4-year period, the GAO found that accreditors sanction  only 8 percent of the institutions they oversaw and revoked  accreditation for just 1 percent. They revoked accreditation for just 1  percent. So 99 percent of them, even if there is nothing wrong, they  keep those Federal funds flowing in.   Even more troubling, GAO found that there was no correlation between  accreditor sanctions and educational quality. In other words, schools  with bad student outcomes were no more likely to be sanctioned by their  accreditor than schools with good student outcomes.   Our accreditation system is totally broken. According to the Higher  Education Act, accreditation agencies are supposed to be the ``reliable  authorities as to the quality of education or training offered'' by  institutions of higher education. That is the reason for making  accreditation a core criteria for receiving Federal funds.   How are we following the law when accreditation reviews find that 99  percent of these institutions are providing an education of value? How  can we say with a straight face that accreditors are acting as reliable  authorities on educational quality?   Here is the problem--money. Incentives are lined up against being  critical and against setting high standards. The problem can be traced  back to the funding and the governance of the accreditation agencies  themselves.   First, accrediting agencies are funded by the same institutions they  accredit. Colleges pay an additional fee to become accredited and  annual dues after that. They pay for site visits and other services.   Second, accrediting agencies are run by and are overseen by the  institutions they accredit. The member institutions elect their own  academics and administrators to serve on the board of the accreditation  agency. So everyone is in on it, right? Everyone makes money pretending  this is fine.   We have a system that is dysfunctional, if not corrupt, in which it  is far too easy to become and remain accredited.   This is a very similar system to what we had with S&P and Moody's and  all of these rating agencies that had financial incentives to determine  that all of these derivatives and credit default swaps and crazy  financial instruments that were clearly not creditworthy were getting  AAA ratings. Why? Because the financial incentives over time had  enmeshed the accreditors with the accrediting. This is supposed to be a  sort of independent relationship because they are supposed to be  certifying to the consumer that everything is all good, right? And what  happened? The system came crashing down.   I don't think the system will come crashing down, except that the  system is already coming crashing down on the students who are getting  ripped off. You ask schools that are taking in more than $1 billion of  Federal funds. There are several schools, every year with Federal funds  in excess of $1 billion, and 5 percent of the kids are graduating. For  the sake of students and taxpayers, the Department has to make this a  top priority, but I am not convinced that Mrs. DeVos will do that.    She has no experience in higher education, a fact that does not bode  well for the 6,000 colleges and universities in this country. When  Senator Warren questioned her about this in her confirmation hearing,  her response was concerning. This is what the transcript says:          Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    I thank the ranking member of the HELP Committee, the  senior Senator from Washington.   You can trace the history of public education in America to the  Original Thirteen Colonies. In 1635, boys in Boston could get a free  education, and by 1647, the Massachusetts Bay Colony required every  town to provide boys a basic education.   Some 340 years later, our public education system has come a long  way, but some things don't change. Our communities still understand how  public education lays a foundation for success. It is still the great  equalizer.   Senator Murray, during Betsy DeVos's hearing, you asked a very  important question. You asked: Can you commit to us that you will not  work to privatize public schools or cut a single penny from public  education?   Mrs. DeVos responded by saying she would work to find common ground  and give parents options.   I am wondering whether you were satisfied with her answer and her  commitment to the basic premise of public schools and public education.    Mr. President, I am an institutionalist. I believe in  this place. I love this place. People don't always like the rules or  how they are interpreted, how they are administered, but the rules have  historically differentiated the Senate from any other legislative body  in the world, and I believe in that.   But what Senator Warren did earlier tonight was not over the line.  And here we are worrying about decorum and rule XIX, which says that  ``No Senator in debate shall . . . impute to another Senator . . . any  conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.''   And let's be really clear here. This would not be a problem if  Senator Sessions were not a Senator.   In other words, anytime a Senator is nominated for a Cabinet  position, you can be as positive as you want, but if you want to be as  tough on a Senator who has been nominated as we have been on Rex  Tillerson or Betsy DeVos, you run the risk of breaking the rules.   Now let's pause a moment to understand how divorced from reality this  is. While debating Jeff Sessions as the next Attorney General,  Elizabeth Warren crossed an invisible line, and a rule almost never  used was invoked.   The rule was not invoked when somebody called another Member a  cancer. The rule was not invoked when somebody called another Member a  liar.   Now, this is ridiculous, but it is actually not the main point. Here  is the  [[Page S881]]  point. Lots of people--almost everybody in the world--everybody in this  country does not have the luxury of worrying about decorum. What a  luxury we have to debate if a stray comment crossed some theoretical  line.   This place, this place of privilege, this place, the dome next door  built by slaves, this place, where there were hardly any women or  people of color or gay people out of the closet until very recently,  yet we spent hours worrying about whether Elizabeth hurt Jeff's  feelings or broke a sense of decorum. What a luxury it is to worry  about that.   In the meantime, Muslim families in America are terrified. In the  meantime, DACA kids are worrying about whether they have to go into  hiding. In the meantime, LGBT youth are bullied in school. In the  meantime, anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise across the country.   And we are here worrying about whether it is impolite to quote in  full the statement of the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   Look, I am for this body. I am old-school. I like the rules. I spend  a lot of time talking with the Parliamentarian at this desk so I can  better understand it. But this body and its rules have to be in service  to the country. The country is not in service to the rules and the body  of the Senate.   Before I go on, I just want to thank the stenographers who are such a  critical aspect of the Senate and have been running marathon sessions-- literally marathon sessions. We rotate through. There are at least 30  of us doing about 30 hours of debate, but there are only seven of you,  and your wrists are sore, your legs are sore. This is incredibly  challenging. Yet without you, we have no Senate Record.   So thank you for your service and your contributions to the world's  greatest deliberative body.   In his final speech as Attorney General, Eric Holder gave us a  warning and one that remains relevant in the Senate today. He said:         Beware those who would take us back to a past that has       really never existed or that was imbued with a forgotten       inequity. Our destiny as Americans is always ahead of us.    Today our country faces a stark choice. Do we want to pursue an  imaginary past or do we want to continue to follow the path toward  progress? Do we continue in our struggle to form a more perfect union,  to secure the blessings of liberty? It is hard to believe, but these  are the dramatic choices before us as we consider the Cabinet  nominations of this administration. And that choice is perhaps most  clear in the nomination of our colleague Senator Jeff Sessions for  Attorney General.   The Attorney General is the highest law enforcement official in the  country. He or she is the defender of American values, of human rights,  and of civil rights, and this person needs to have an unbreakable  commitment to fight for what is right and to lead that pursuit in  making America more free and more just. That is the kind of approach we  need because that is what the job demands.   The Attorney General leads the No. 1 watchdog for civil rights in our  country. It is the Department charged with protecting voting rights and  prosecuting human trafficking and hate crimes. They determine and  defend the constitutionality of U.S. policies. Our next AG will face  critical challenges that will test our justice system and our values.  We need a leader committed to protecting the rights of every American  regardless of race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual  orientation.    While I do like him as a colleague, Senator Sessions is the wrong  person to serve as our Nation's Attorney General. In my judgment, his  policies, priorities, and overall philosophy fall short of the standard  our country has for the leader of the Justice Department. Throughout  Senator Sessions' career, he has been on the wrong side of history. If  you look at the key issues that this Attorney General will work on, it  is clear that Senator Sessions' views fall outside the mainstream of  America.   That is certainly true when it comes to criminal justice. Look at  Senator Sessions' opposition to the Sentencing Reform and Corrections  Act. This bill was a big deal. It would have reduced mandatory minimum  sentencing for low-level, nonviolent crimes, while keeping tougher  penalties for serious or violent crimes; it would strengthen drug  addiction, rehabilitation and mental health treatments, and improve our  efforts to help people who were leaving prison to settle into their  communities and get back on track. Everybody liked it. Senator Grassley  introduced it with cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. The bill  had support from the House Speaker, the International Association of  Chiefs of Police, the Major Counties Sheriffs' Association, the  National District Attorneys Association, the Leadership Conference on  Civil and Human Rights, among many others. Even the Koch brothers liked  this piece of legislation. That is because it tackled problems we all  agreed needed to be solved.   No one wants to see excessively punitive sentences that expand the  Federal prison population, which has grown by 734 percent between the  year 1980 and 2015. No one wants to see unnecessary barriers that make  it harder for formerly incarcerated people to stay out of jail. No one  wants to see taxpayer money spent needlessly.   So we had a thoughtful, bipartisan bill, but we were not able to  enact it into law. Senator Sessions personally blocked the bill from  being considered after it passed the Judiciary Committee last Congress.  And he said: ``Federal drug and sentencing laws have already been  considerably relaxed.''   The failure of reform impacts the lives of people who are hurt by  unfair and outdated sentencing rules. It especially affects the  families and communities of color who have been ravaged by the  overincarceration of minorities. The ACLU reports that sentences  imposed on Black men in the Federal system are almost 20 percent longer  than sentences imposed on White men with similar crimes. Think about  that--the same crime, and you get 20 percent more time if you are  African American. And while people of color are just as likely as White  people to sell or use illegal drugs, they are more likely to be  arrested. Think about how preposterous that is--equal for justice for  all, equal application of the laws, right?   People of color and Caucasians use drugs and distribute drugs in the  same percentages, yet they are more likely to be arrested. African  Americans make up 14 percent of regular drug users but 37 percent of  people arrested for drug offenses. This raises the question of bias in  law enforcement. Senator Sessions opposes holding State and local law  enforcement accountable for racial bias and policing or the excessive  use of force. He has called the approach the Justice Department took to  this accountability an end run of the democratic process. He has  attacked bipartisan efforts to reduce the sentences of nonviolent, low- level drug offenders, and he opposed President Obama's initiative to  address racial disparities in our criminal justice system and restore  fairness by granting clemency. Senator Sessions was critical of a  Justice Department initiative that reduced overcrowding in Federal  prisons by 20 percent over just the last 3 years.   Senator Sessions' views on drug policy are maybe even more out of the  mainstream. He has been one of the most outspoken advocates against the  legalization of marijuana, both recreational and medicinal. In an April  2016 hearing, he suggested that the Federal Government must send the  message that ``good people don't smoke marijuana.''   This is 2016. This isn't 1975. This is 2016. Our Attorney General  nominee says ``good people don't smoke marijuana.'' Tell that to the  cancer victim. Tell that to my good friend John Radcliffe, who has  stage 4 liver and colon cancer.   But Senator Sessions supports aggressive Federal intervention in  States that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana. He  criticized the Federal Government's guidance on Federal marijuana  regulation, which directed the Justice Department to respect the  decisions of States to determine their own criminal laws. Because of  this guidance, Federal prosecutors stopped targeting patients who rely  on medical marijuana products for relief. They stopped targeting local  dispensaries that are operating squarely within State law. Instead they  went after criminal drug traffickers and violent drug crimes. That  seems like a  [[Page S882]]  smart prioritization of resources within the Justice Department--not  going after people who want to utilize marijuana to alleviate pain but  rather going after violent drug crimes. That seems smart, but Senator  Sessions opposed that.   The respect for federalism reflected in the Justice Department's  guidance should be right in line with conservative values. Under the  guidance, as long as States are preventing the distribution of  marijuana to minors, if they are preventing the growing of marijuana on  Federal lands, and if they are stopping State-authorized marijuana  activities being used as fronts for other illegal activities, then the  Justice Department doesn't interfere.    I would like to quote from Senator Sessions' argument against this  policy. He said:         I think one of Obama's great failures that is obvious to me       is his lax treatment and comments on marijuana. . . . It       reverses 20 years almost of hostilities in drugs that began       really when Nancy Reagan started ``Just Say No.''    But here's the thing. There is a bipartisan consensus now that the  drug war is a failure. The drug war did not work. The drug war did not  decrease the percentage of people utilizing illegal drugs. Every time  the government succeeded in shutting down a drug trafficking ring,  another would pop up. And a harsh penalty didn't slow addiction rates,  it just incarcerated mostly young men. They didn't slow the flow of  drugs; instead, they crowded our prisons, hurt taxpayers, and increased  drug-related violence in other countries.   Now is the time to shift our strategy and focus on people who  struggle with addiction. We also need to respect the decision in many  cities and States to decriminalize drug possession. It is up to them as  to how to ascribe relief to citizens who could benefit from using  medical marijuana.   There is another area where I believe Senator Sessions is out of the  mainstream, and that is his views on LGBTQ equality. Senator Sessions  opposed the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a bill that I was proud  to support that would have ended workplace discrimination for LGBTQ  people. Right now there are no Federal laws that explicitly protect  LGBTQ individuals from discrimination. That is not because we haven't  tried. Last Congress, I cosponsored a bill to prohibit this kind of  discrimination, but even without a law on the books, the Justice  Department has interpreted the Civil Rights Act to include sexual  orientation and gender identity. That could change, however, under the  next Attorney General.   As head of the Justice Department, Senator Sessions could choose to  interpret the law differently, and his record gives us every reason to  be concerned. Senator Sessions also voted against the reauthorization  of the Violence Against Women Act. He voted against the reauthorization  of the Violence Against Women Act because of a provision that ensures  that victims of domestic violence are not turned away because of their  sexual orientation or gender identity. That is why he voted against  VAWA, because there is a provision that says you have to provide  services to individuals regardless of their sexual identity. He  advocated for stripping that provision and ultimately voted against the  bill. As Attorney General, he could choose not to enforce this  nondiscrimination clause.   Think about this. If a gay person is a victim of sexual assault, are  they not morally and legally entitled to the same humanity, the same  protection under the law? Senator Sessions has repeatedly opposed hate  crimes protections against LGBTQ Americans, even attempting to insert a  poison pill amendment to stop the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr.,  Hate Crimes Prevention Act from moving forward. He has argued against  Federal prosecution of hate crimes, saying on the Senate floor that  there is no need for the Justice Department to get involved. As  Attorney General, Mr. Sessions would be in charge of enforcing the Hate  Crimes Prevention Act. It is not a stretch to ask whether or not his  enforcement would be vigorous. In fact, Senator Sessions has repeatedly  supported laws that criminalize the LGBTQ community. In the 1990s, he  tried to block an LGBTQ student conference--a student conference for  gay kids that ``promoted a lifestyle prohibited by sodomy and sexual  misconduct laws.'' He argued against a conference for kids to give each  other support and come up with strategies to survive bullying, to  understand that what they are going through other kids are going  through, arguing that it promoted a lifestyle prohibited by sodomy and  sexual misconduct laws. And he sharply criticized the legal decision  that put a rightful end to the criminalization of same-sex  relationships.   He supported don't ask, don't tell, saying that it was pretty  effective. And he opposed the repeal of that law.   On marriage equality, Senator Sessions has vowed to work again and  again to amend the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. We went  through this in 1998 in the State of Hawaii. How unusual it is to  enshrine in the Constitution the removal of a right.   I want you to just think about that--that you want to amend the  Constitution, not to provide additional rights, not to clarify  something, but to explicitly prohibit Americans from having a certain  right.   I don't think there are many families who would agree on Senator  Sessions' views here. People don't want their sons and daughters to  have to hide their sexuality in order to serve their country. They  don't want to go back to the days when our Nation failed to recognize  the legitimacy of same-sex relationships. And they certainly don't want  to see their friends and family lose a job or even go to jail because  of whom they love, but that is the record that we are dealing with.   To be clear, these aren't views from the 1970s. These are his views  as of last year. These are his current views on these matters.   The Senator has a similarly out-of-step approach on immigration. Mr.  Sessions was instrumental in defeating the 2007 immigration reform  bill, referring to it as ``terrorist assistance.'' He was a strong  opponent of a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill, even though the bill  had the strongest border security provision ever seen in an immigration  bill. It was such a strong security border provision that I hated it. I  had to think about whether I was going to vote for this thing because I  felt it was too much of a militarization of our southern border. I  thought it was a giveaway and a waste of money. But it had a strong  border security provision, and it was voted out of the Senate by a wide  margin.   If it were up to him, we would also limit legal immigrants coming to  our country. During the markup in the Judiciary Committee, Senator  Sessions offered an amendment to limit legal immigration, which failed  17 to 1. If you are wondering whether it is rhetorical to say his views  on immigration are out of the mainstream, the record shows 17 to 1--17  to 1.   In addition, he promotes cutting Federal funding for sanctuary  cities. Sanctuary cities is a brand. People aren't sure what that  means. Let's be clear what we mean by that. Stripping funding from  sanctuary cities is wrong because cities have decided that the strength  of their relationship between their police and their citizens is more  important for public safety than doing the Federal Government's job of  enforcing immigration laws.   Senator Sessions, of course, is against the right of children born in  the United States to be American citizens. He is against helping the  many DREAMers in this country.    Let's have an honest discussion about immigration. We need to start  talking about why people come to this country. Some of them come  because they want to escape their own awful circumstances and live in  freedom and opportunity. It is my grandparents escaping the Ukraine. It  is my wife's grandparents leaving China. It is the Schatz; it is the  Binders; it is the Kwoks. It is Albert Einstein; it is Madeleine  Albright. This is who we are. We are people from all over the world who  are united not by our ethnic extraction or our religious affiliation,  but tied together by our love for America and our belief in this  country as the beacon of hope, the shining city on the hill. The idea  that we would shred that legacy in the face of some imaginary public  desire for immigration reductions, frankly, is disturbing.   Look at the protests happening every weekend at our country's  international  [[Page S883]]  airports. Americans are not out in the streets demanding that we shut  off the lamp outside the golden door. They are demanding that we stay  true to our history and to our roots.   That is why we saw close to 100 companies file a legal brief earlier  this week against the Muslim ban put in place by the President and  implemented by a man who has been mentored by Senator Sessions. The  brief they filed notes an important statistic about our country. More  than 200 companies currently listed on the Fortune 500 list are founded  by immigrants or the children of immigrants, and this stands in direct  contrast to the nominee's views. If immigrants are coming to the United  States and starting businesses and hiring people, they aren't taking  jobs from Americans. They are creating jobs for Americans, and that has  been the story of our country since the very beginning.   Immigration is one of the cornerstones of our country, and the  nominee's policy proposals would chip away at that.   The world is watching. History is watching. We have to ask ourselves:  What do they see? Do they see Lady Liberty? Or do they see something  else, something darker?   Our country is asking similarly ominous questions about the basic,  most fundamental right in our society, and that is the right to vote.  Our country's history books are filled with stories of the struggle for  voting rights, of African-American men risking it all to go to the  polls and women in white marching through the streets of Washington,  DC, demanding to vote. But that struggle and that progress is in danger  with the kinds of policies that are being promoted. It is on all of us  to honor that history and make sure that whoever is eligible to vote is  able to vote. This is the bedrock of all other rights, because it is  what gives us the voice when incumbent leaders and our representatives  fail to protect the other rights.   In his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sessions  said:         The Department of Justice must never falter in its       obligation to protect the civil rights of every American,       particularly those who are most vulnerable. A special       priority for me in this regard would be aggressive       enforcement of our laws to ensure access to the ballot for       every eligible American voter, without hindrance or       discrimination, and to ensure the integrity of the electoral       process.    But his record does not support that view. Senator Sessions supports  voter ID laws that will disenfranchise many, many voters. He has called  the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive,'' and he has praised the Supreme  Court ruling that dismantled a key part of the Voting Rights Act. He  has already had his nomination rejected by the Senate because of his  views on this issue.   This should concern anyone and everyone who cares about our democracy  because, at the most basic level, democracy is built on the ability of  American citizens to go to the polls.   Let's be honest. Our right to vote is being restricted. It is being  restricted even though the United States has some of the lowest voter  turnout of any developed democracy on the planet, and it is being  restricted based on a lie. There is no voter fraud. Voter fraud is not  the problem. Voter disenfranchisement is the problem.   I talked with a buddy of mine back home who was watching FOX News and  he was watching MSNBC, and he said: Democrats are saying there is voter  disenfranchisement and Republicans are saying there is voter fraud, and  I don't know what to believe. Well, here are the facts. There is a  vanishingly small amount of voter fraud. You are more likely to be  struck by lightning than to be convicted of voter fraud. This is a  made-up problem. Why would you make up a problem such as this? Because  it gives you a context and a pretext to do the systematic dismantling  of voting rights. This is happening in North Carolina, this is  happening in Wisconsin, and this is happening all over the country.   The final policy area I would like to raise is women's rights. The  nominee's record is very clear on these issues. He opposed the Lilly  Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which lifts the legal restrictions for people  who may have faced pay discrimination. That, in itself, is  extraordinary, because Lilly Ledbetter is from Senator Sessions' home  State. She worked in a factory in Alabama for years, and then one day  someone slipped her an anonymous note--what a story. Someone slipped  her an anonymous note that said: You are paid way less than everyone  else in this same job.   But when Ms. Ledbetter tried to address the pay disparities, she hit  a brick wall and at every turn. When she turned to the justice system  for help, she found that the laws had statutes of limitations that kept  her from getting the pay she was denied for years and years and years,  working side by side with men, doing the same job, and getting paid  less in that factory.   The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act changes that. It makes it so that if  women find themselves in an ugly, unequal pay structure, just as Ms.  Ledbetter did--and we all know people, such as sisters, wives,  children, and mothers who have a suspicion they are pretty much doing  the same thing to them, especially in a factory setting, a blue collar  setting, or a clerical setting. This is not impossible to decipher when  you have the same job description.    Just as Ms. Ledbetter did, they can do something about it.   Senator Sessions voted against that law. He also voted against  another equal pay bill called the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would go  even further and try to close the gender wage gap.   On women's health, his record is similarly troubling. He has opposed  funding for title X, which would ensure that low-income women have  access to contraception, breast cancer screening, and other health  services. He has voted time and again to defund Planned Parenthood, an  organization that provides health care to some of the most underserved  women across the country. Finally, Senator Sessions voted against the  Violence Against Women Act, not once but three times.   Senator Sessions' voting record should concern everyone who cares  about fair pay, reproductive rights, access to health care, and access  to services for survivors of domestic violence.   The last policy area I want to highlight is our environment and  climate change. Just 2 years ago, the nominee voted for a resolution  that would kill the Clean Power Plan. He also voted for a bill that  would deny protections for streams that are the water source for  hundreds of millions of Americans.   This is bad news for the world's race to address climate change,  which is one of the biggest civil rights battles of our time. This  isn't just a battle against fossil fuels. It is a battle to save the  air we breathe and the water we drink. It is a battle to save the land  we live on. It is a battle for things that we take for granted.   I worry that under an Attorney General Sessions, we are going to have  a hard time. That is because even if we really don't have great laws on  climate--and we don't yet--they are being rolled back as we speak. Even  if Senator Sessions does not push back on those laws, he still has the  ability to prioritize certain things over others. So it is not just his  policies that we need to consider. It is also his priorities.   Every AG makes decisions about what problems the Justice Department  should move to the front of the line. I have seen lots of reports that  leave me wondering if Senator Sessions' priorities might be misguided.   The Web site FiveThirtyEight wrote a piece about Senator Sessions'  confirmation process, and I wish to read a section of it now. ``I care  about civil rights,'' Sessions said. ``I care about voting rights.''  Sessions has cited his record as evidence.         In 2009, he said he'd been involved in 20 or 30       desegregation cases as a prosecutor, and this year, he told       the Judiciary Committee that four civil rights cases were       among the 10 most important cases he'd worked on in his       career. Some committee members were skeptical.        Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota said Tuesday that       Sessions had overstated his role in the anti-segregation       litigation. This is an area where the administration's       priorities are clearly going to matter.        The number of anti-discrimination and voting-rights cases       brought by the Justice Department civil rights division       dropped sharply under President George W. Bush compared with       his predecessor, Bill Clinton. The Voting Rights Act recently       moved closer to Sessions' personal beliefs.        When a 2013 Supreme Court ruling weakened the law, Sessions       said it was ``good news . . . for the South.'' On Tuesday,       Sessions called the act ``intrusive.''   [[Page S884]]     So what does this write-up say about what priorities an Attorney  General Sessions might choose? Well, to me, it says that voting rights  are going to be dealt a bigger blow than we have seen in the past few  years. Again, we come back to the sense of being extreme. Senator  Sessions' priorities and his policy views are not in the mainstream for  the Justice Department.   I don't think the American people are comfortable with letting  politics about policing trump data. I don't think they are comfortable  with overlooking our history and our commitment to democracy. So why  are we comfortable with this nomination?   The final area I want to touch on is Senator Sessions' philosophy.  The Washington Post published a news article about a week ago that  looks at the Executive orders we have seen out of this White House. It  is called ``Trump's hard-line actions have an intellectual godfather:  Jeff Sessions.''   I would like to read a few excerpts from the article.         In jagged black strokes, President Trump's signature was       scribbled onto a catalogue of executive orders over the past       10 days that translated the hardline promises of his campaign       into the policies of his government. The directives bore       Trump's name, but another man's fingerprints were also on       nearly all of them: Jeff Sessions.        The early days of the Trump presidency have rushed a       nationalist agenda long on the fringes of American life into       action--and Sessions, the quiet Alabamian who long cultivated       those ideas as a Senate backbencher, has become a singular       power in this new Washington. Sessions' ideology is driven by       a visceral aversion to what he calls ``soulless globalism,''       a term used on the extreme right to convey a perceived threat       to the United States from free trade, international alliances       and the immigration of nonwhites.        And despite many reservations among Republicans about that       world view, Sessions--whose 1986 nomination for a federal       judgeship was doomed by accusations of racism that he       denied--is finding little resistance in Congress to his       proposed role as Trump's attorney general.        Sessions' nomination is scheduled to be voted on Tuesday by       the Senate Judiciary Committee, but his influence in the       administration stretches far beyond the Justice Department.        From immigration and health care to national security and       trade, Sessions is the intellectual godfather of the       President's policies. His reach extends throughout the White       House with his aides and allies accelerating the president's       most dramatic moves, including the ban on refugees and       citizens from seven mostly Muslim nations that has triggered       fear around the globe.        The tactician turning Trump's agenda into law is deputy       chief of staff Rick Dearborn, Sessions' long time chief of       staff in the Senate. The mastermind behind Trump's incendiary       brand of populism is chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who,       as chairman of the Breitbart website, promoted Sessions for       years.    Here's a quote from Bannon:         Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest,       most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of       Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the       clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the       implementation of that agenda.        Sessions helped devise the President's first-week strategy,       in which Trump signed a blizzard of Executive orders that       begin to fulfill his signature campaign promises--although       Sessions had advocated for going even faster. The senator       lobbied for a ``shock and awe'' period of executive action       that would rattle Congress--    I think we got that--       impress Trump's base--    I assume we got that--       and catch his critics unaware--    I don't know about that--       according to the two officials involved in the transition       plan.        Trump opted for a slightly slower pace, these officials       said, because he wanted to maximize news coverage by       spreading out his directives over several weeks. Trump makes       his own decisions, but Sessions was one of the rare lawmakers       who shared his impulses.        There are limits to Sessions's influence, however. He has       not persuaded Trump--so far, at least--to eliminate the       Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, under which       children brought to the United States illegally are allowed       to stay in the country.        Sessions became a daily presence at Trump Tower in New       York, mapping out the policy agenda and making personnel       decisions. Once former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was out       of consideration for secretary of state, Trump considered       nominating Sessions because he was so trusted by the inner       circle, including Kushner, although Sessions' preference was       to be attorney general, according to people familiar with the       talks.        Since his nomination, Sessions has been careful to not be       formally involved even as his ideas animate the White House.       In a statement Sunday, he denied that he has had       ``communications'' with his former advisers or reviewed the       executive orders.    I have no reason to doubt that he established a proper distance while  he was the nominee.         Sessions has installed close allies throughout the       administration. He persuaded Cliff Sims, a friend and       adviser, to sell his Alabama media outlet and take a job       directing message strategy at the White House.        Sessions also influenced the selection of Peter Navarro, an       economist and friend with whom he coauthored an op-ed last       fall warning against the ``rabbit hole of globalism,'' as       director of the National Trade Council.        John Weaver, a veteran GOP strategist who was a consultant       on Sessions' first Senate campaign and is now a Trump critic,       said that Sessions is at the pinnacle of power because he       shares Trump's ``1940s view of fortress America.''        ``That's something you would find in an Allen Drury       novel,'' Weaver said. ``Unfortunately, there are real       consequences to this, which are draconian views on       immigration and a view of America that is insular and not an       active member of the global community.''        Inside the White House and within Sessions's alumni       network, people have taken to calling the Senator ``Joseph,''       referring to the Old Testament patriarch who was shunned by       his family and sold into slavery as a boy, only to rise       through unusual circumstances to become right hand to the       pharaoh and oversee the lands of Egypt.        In a 20-year Senate career, Sessions has been isolated in       his own party, a dynamic crystallized a decade ago when he       split with President George W. Bush and the business       community over comprehensive immigration changes.        In lonely speeches on the Senate floor, Sessions would       chastise ``the masters of the universe.'' He hung on his       office wall a picture of He-Man from the popular 1980s comic       book series.        As he weighed a presidential run, Trump liked what he saw       in Sessions, who was tight with the constituencies Trump was       eager to rouse on the right.        ``Sessions was always somebody that we had targeted,'' said       Sam Nunberg, Trump's political adviser at the time.        In May 2015, Nunberg said, he reached out to Miller, then       an adviser to Sessions, to arrange a phone call between Trump       and the senator. The two hit it off, with Trump telling       Nunberg, ``That guy is tough.''        The next month, Trump declared his candidacy. In August of       that year, Sessions joined Trump at a megarally in the       senator's home town of Mobile and donned a ``Make America       Great Again'' cap. By January 2016, Miller had formally       joined the campaign and was traveling daily with the       candidate, writing speeches and crafting policies.    That Washington Post article offers a look into the nominee's  philosophy. Out of the gate, the President has pushed for all  punishment and no mercy. The administration has shown a willingness to  trample on rights to satisfy political objectives. This should trouble  everybody on both sides of the aisle who cares about Executive  overreach.   This week, John Yoo--the driving force of enhanced interrogation  under the Bush administration, the torture man, the famous John Yoo  from the Office of Legal Counsel, the John Yoo demonized by  progressives for sort of being the key thinker behind understanding  Executive power as more expansive than it had ever been understood  before--this week, John Yoo came out saying that he thinks this  President has taken Executive power too far. John Yoo is saying that-- not Sheldon Whitehouse, not the ACLU; John Yoo from George W. Bush's  administration. If that is what John Yoo is saying, then we should all  be worried.   Think of what the President might do with an Attorney General in  place who shares his philosophy on immigrants, minority communities,  gay Americans, voting rights, and women's rights.   The NAACP has pulled together a list of facts about the Senator that  further flushes out this philosophy, and it is deeply concerning.         In July 2015, during the confirmation hearing of a district       court nominee from Maryland, Sessions made the nominee answer       for her career as a public defender and civil rights lawyer,       and invoked Freddie Gray, the teenager unlawfully arrested       and killed by Baltimore police in 2015, as a client       inappropriate for a lawyer nominated to the bench:        ``Can you assure the police officers in Baltimore and all       over Maryland that might be brought before your court, that       they'll get a fair day in court and that your history would       not impact your decisionmaking?'' he asked.        ``And I raise that particularly because I see your firm is       representing Mr. Freddie Gray in that case that's gathered so       much attention in Maryland, and there's lots of law       enforcement officers throughout the state and they want to       know that they don't have someone who has an agenda to bring       to the bench--can you assure them that you won't bring that       to the bench?''  [[Page S885]]         In December 2010, Sessions took to the Senate floor to rail       against judicial nominees who have what he calls ``ACLU DNA''       or the ``ACLU chromosome.'' The ACLU ``seeks to deny the will       of the American people,'' he said, ``and has taken positions       far to the left of mainstream American and the ideals and       values the majority of Americans hold dear.''        In October 2009, Sessions opposed a district court nominee       and former ACLU staff attorney by saying, ``I think we're       seeing a common DNA run through the Obama nominees, and       that's the ACLU chromosome.''    I know people have mixed feelings about the ACLU. Sometimes I have  mixed feelings about the ACLU. But remember what happened when this  Executive order was issued: It was the ACLU that took them to court to  protect every American's civil liberties, and they were the ones who  won in court right away. So I say that we need to have special respect  for the lawyers who protect our civil liberties.   These events should give us all pause because our country has long  associated groups like the NAACP and the ACLU with the mission of the  Justice Department, and now we may have an Attorney General who has, at  least in the past, relished opposition to these groups.   Before concluding, I just want to say that I understand there may be  a distinction between politician-elected official representing a  certain State and a certain perspective Jeff Sessions, Senator  Sessions, and Attorney General Sessions. This sometimes does happen as  people move from legislative to executive or as they advance in their  careers. It is entirely possible, and I sure hope that there will be an  evolution, that he understands he may have his views or he may have  been vigorously advocating for the views of his constituents, but now  he has a different role as the chief law enforcement officer for the  United States of America, somebody who is there to uphold equal justice  for everyone.   So as critical as I have been of his record, I hope to be proven  wrong. There are people on the other side of the aisle and one Democrat  on our side of the aisle whom I respect greatly who really love Jeff  Sessions. I hope everything they believe about him and the way he will  conduct himself as Attorney General ends up being true. I just don't  see any evidence for that yet, other than the word of my colleagues.  That means a lot, but the record is too decisively against all of the  things I care for and all of the things I believe are important in an  Attorney General.   I know I am not alone in having these concerns. Millions of people  have signed petitions, made calls, and posted online in opposition to  this nominee.   I have received very thoughtful messages from people in Hawaii about  Senator Sessions. I wish to quote a few of them.         I'm writing as a thoughtful voter and human being that Mr.       Sessions is not the right man for the job of Attorney       General. He may be a friend of the president and his inner       circle, but he does not represent the values of our       democracy.        Given his approval of the ban on immigration, I believe he       will help the president radicalize and destabilize this       country.    Another person mentioned the former Acting Attorney General, who was  fired by the President because she was true to the word she gave  Senator Sessions in her own confirmation hearing. Sally Yates said what  so many people are thinking, which is that this Muslim ban cannot  stand.   Here is another letter from Hawaii:         I'm writing to express my most heartfelt disappointment at       the direction our country is quickly taking with the Trump       administration.        While I accept that those with more conservative views than       mine are now in power, I find the actions being taken a gross       and crass disregard of our diverse and tolerant national       identity.    I want to end by making something very clear: We can respect Senator  Sessions as a colleague while still believing that his policies, his  priorities, and his philosophy are too extreme for the Justice  Department. And there are too many issues that this country cares about  to confirm him as Attorney General.   If you care about criminal justice reform, if you care about seeing  fewer people go to jail for petty crimes, if you care about directing  fewer taxpayer dollars to the prison industry, then you have to be  opposed to this nomination.   If you care about the LGBT community; if you believe that people  shouldn't be discriminated against or punished because of whom they  love; if you believe that people, regardless of their identity, should  be able to get married or wear our Nation's finest uniform, then you  have to be opposed.   If you care about immigration; if you believe in immigration; if you  are a business owner who wants to hire the best and the brightest; if  your family came to this country to pursue the American dream; if you  are a person of faith who believes in caring for those who suffer, for  the stranger in our midst, you have to be opposed to this nomination.   If you care about women's rights; if you believe that women are not  to be treated like second-class citizens, that our daughters are just  as capable as our sons and that they have the right to make their own  decisions about their own health care; if you believe they should be  paid the same for doing the same job, then you have to be opposed.   If you care about our democracy; if you want people to raise their  voices and take part in shaping the future of our country; if you are  dismayed to know that millions of people are being prevented from  voting not because they aren't eligible but because of senseless laws  that restrict their rights, then you have to oppose this nomination.   The Senate must stand up for civil rights, for voting rights, for  women's rights, for immigrants' rights, and that means we must vote no  on Jeff Sessions for Attorney General.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
