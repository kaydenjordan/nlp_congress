 Mr. Speaker, the people of Venezuela  have taken to the streets to demand an end to 20 years of dictatorship  and repression. I am grateful that President Donald Trump is supporting  the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people.   The people of Venezuela deserve to prosper. They are fortunate to  hold the world's largest supply of crude oil, but decades of socialist  corruption and mismanagement, first under Hugo Chavez and then Nicolas  Maduro, have impoverished Venezuela.   Then came the sham 2018 Presidential elections. That is why the  National Assembly President Juan Guaido implemented their constitution  by declaring himself interim President and called for new elections.   We must continue to support hope in Venezuela. Free and fair  elections must be held. The people of Venezuela deserve freedom and  democracy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
