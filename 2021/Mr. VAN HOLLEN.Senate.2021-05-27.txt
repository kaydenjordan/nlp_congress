 Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for  the recent passage of S. 914, the Drinking Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure Act of 2021. I believe it is a vital investment in the  current and future health of all our communities, and I applaud my  Senate colleagues for helping to get this done.   Ensuring access to clean water is essential--and one of the most  basic duties of government. Every American deserves safe drinking water  and wastewater treatment systems, and in my home State of Maryland,  these systems are vital both to the health of our fellow citizens and  to the health of our rivers and our beloved Chesapeake Bay.   This bill will help pull our waterways into the 21st century by  providing a critical boost in water systems investments to restore  aging infrastructure, fund cutting-edge waterway technology, create  resiliency in the face of climate change, and create new jobs. And  critically, this legislation was designed with equity in mind, so  marginalized communities can benefit from this big leap forward. This  has been a longstanding bipartisan priority, and I am pleased that  colleagues from both sides of the aisle have come together to pass this  vital legislation through the U.S. Senate.   Now, it is up to our colleagues in the House to pass this bill too so  we can get it to the President's desk. And should he sign it into law,  as I believe he will, I will be doing my part as a member of the Senate  Appropriations Committee to ensure we fully fund this initiative.   I thank my colleagues for joining me and a bipartisan group of  Senators in supporting this key investment in our Nation's water  infrastructure.                            ____________________
