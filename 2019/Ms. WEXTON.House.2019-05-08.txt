 Mr. Speaker, in an unprecedented move, the Trump  administration issued dangerous guidance last year that could  effectively eliminate protections for Americans with preexisting  conditions. The administration's guidance puts coverage for the over  130 million Americans with preexisting conditions at risk.   Our friends and neighbors, Americans who have had cancer, Americans  who have high blood pressure, and Americans who have been pregnant  would all be at risk of being priced out of their health insurance or  being denied coverage outright.   Mr. Speaker, we can't go back. Healthcare is complicated, but this  issue is not. No American should ever be denied coverage for a  preexisting condition--not now, not ever. That is why I will be  supporting the Protecting Americans With Preexisting Conditions Act on  the House floor this week, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
