 Mr. Speaker, I have a chart that I am  going to put up here in a minute, but there is something that I think  we all need to realize: Our positions here not only are as  representatives but also stewards of taxpayer money.   Now, a lot of people sometimes become confused as to whose money it  is that we are talking about, and what we are talking about is  hardworking American taxpayers.   The definition of a steward is pretty simple: It is someone who  manages another's property or financial affairs; one who administers  anything as the agent of another or others.   The oath we take makes us responsible for every single penny that we  spend or allocate because it came out of the pocket of a hardworking  American taxpayer.   So it just seems to me that Mr. Barletta's idea makes sense: this  idea that somehow actually making sure that people qualify for a  subsidy is somehow being mean-hearted and not being actually a steward  of these dollars.   I just wanted to point this out. This is H.R. 3590, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was the final vote on March 21,  2010. And I would just tell some of my colleagues: Take a look because  some of your names are very prominent there--and you can see it. The  piece that we are talking about is the piece that was included in the  Affordable Care Act. This isn't something that we dreamed up overnight;  this is something that was actually part of the Affordable Care Act.   And now we are saying: My goodness, we are allowing these subsidies  to be out there. And then what we are saying is: Well, we are going to  presume that whoever it is who applied for these subsidies actually is  entitled to them.   Now, that only works in Washington, D.C. In the private sector, you  usually have to verify before you do anything, as opposed to saying:  Well, do you know what, somebody said that they were entitled to this,  so we ought to just go ahead and pass this on.   I have got to tell you: It is a lot easier when it doesn't come out  of your pocket. But, when it comes out of hardworking American  taxpayers' pockets, I think it is incumbent upon us, as elected  representatives, to say that there is something that doesn't make sense  here.   When over half a million people receive over $750 million in  subsidies, somebody, somewhere, should be saying: How did this happen?    I think it is interesting that neither HHS or the IRS has any method  in place to actually go out and recoup these dollars that were  wrongfully awarded. This just doesn't make sense. Mr. Barletta is doing  something that is common sense.   And I know that when the act was passed, the most famous quote of all  is: We have to pass it to find out what is in it.   Well, we did pass it. I wasn't here. I was in the private sector. But  these are all of the folks who passed it. This is actually your policy.  This is Lou Barletta's policy. This isn't a Republican policy. This is  a policy that was part of the Affordable Care Act.   Why in the world would we ever, as taxpayers, expect people to verify  this type of activity?   We should just say: Listen, they seem like pretty good folks, and  they are going to eventually get back to us.   We have no way of recouping this money.   Now, we can rail about people not having hearts; we can rail about  people who don't like immigrants; and we can rail about taking this out  on hardworking families and making it difficult for them to get by.   I would just say this: We are trying to protect taxpayer money. We  are trying to protect something that is so basic. We are trying to  protect something that is actually part of the law that was passed as  part of the Affordable Care Act. This isn't a foreign idea. This just  makes sense.   So I would just ask my friends: Listen, please go to H.R. 3590, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and go to section 1411-- this is your language, by the way. As I said, I wasn't here at the  time. I did read it, and I am still scratching my head to say: Do you  know what, this is probably a good policy; you should probably read it  before you pass it.   But it says exactly what it is that you expect people receiving these  subsidies to go through.   It is amazing me today that, all of a sudden, this is Potomac  amnesia: I don't remember that part of the law.   So, look, there could be nothing more sensible--commonsensical--than  making sure that before we issue subsidies, that are funded by  hardworking American taxpayers, that we actually verify who it is that  is getting them; rather than going ahead and putting it out there and  then saying: Do you know what, maybe they don't qualify.   Well, how do you get the money back?   This pay-and-chase idea, to me, would never work in the private  sector because we actually have to be responsible for what we do.   Now, I don't want you to get all wrapped around the axle and think  that somehow we are coming after people in a way that doesn't make  sense.   Here is what I want you to think about: I want you to think about the  people who actually pay the tab, the people who actually pick up the  check, the people who actually pay taxes, the people to who we are the  most responsible.   And to somehow come up with an idea that it is mean-hearted to verify  who is getting these subsidies, to me, is tomfoolery. If you want to do  something, and you want to make it hard for people to understand what  we are doing, do this: I would love to go back home and tell people  what you folks just don't understand. You sent the money to us, we  decided how we are going to spend it, we decided that we can give it to  anybody we want, and, by the way, if they don't qualify, that shouldn't  bother you.   Now, let's just do something that makes sense.                                time  1400    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Well, you know what? I really don't need a  full minute to talk about something that is common sense, but I have  been here now a little bit over 6 years, and it is hard for me to  believe that this act was passed back on March 21, 2010, and the  language we are talking about today is the actual language that was in  the bill that we had to pass before we could find out what was in it.   Maybe at that time somebody should have read this, and it was a good  idea to actually verify these things. That would have saved a whole lot  of time, a whole lot of money, and a whole lot of irresponsible  spending.  [[Page H4880]]    Again, whether you want to agree with the study or not agree with the  study, when half a million people receive over $750 million in  hardworking American taxpayer money, and then we are told: Geez, I  can't believe you are that mean that you want to go back and recoup  money from people who didn't deserve it--no. What we are saying is  let's verify first. Let's make sure of every single penny that goes out  of this House--the people's House, by the way--and let's do what is the  responsible thing to do as stewards of every single taxpayer penny.
