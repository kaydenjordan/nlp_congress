 Madam Speaker, at a time when our Nation is reeling  from an unprecedented public health crisis and our fellow Americans are  struggling just to survive, the Democrat leadership is wasting precious  time on yet another partisan messaging bill.   This legislation is going nowhere, and my friends on the other side  of the aisle know it. The name Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Enhancement Act is no such thing. It is the protecting ObamaCare act.  It is the pretend we are legislating under the guise of partisan  messaging act. It is the perpetuate the broken promises of ObamaCare  act. It is empty; it is devoid; it is going nowhere. We are wasting  time in this national crisis.   If it did pass, it would take flexibility and responsibility from  States. It would coerce States to expand Medicaid--a flawed Medicaid  system, I might add--and it would allow for these monies to be used on  abortion, which is a nonstarter. We know it is not serious when that is  in there. That is a poison pill.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to stop wasting the American  people's time, and let's get back to governing this great Nation.
