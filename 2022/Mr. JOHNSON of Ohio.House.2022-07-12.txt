 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2472, to honor John Armor Bingham, a man who played an important role  in advancing a more perfect Union for all Americans.   Bingham first came to Cadiz, Ohio, in the early 1800s as a teenager.  While studying law at Franklin College, he befriended former slave  Titus Basfield, the first African American to graduate college in Ohio.   Bingham's commitment to advancing liberty and equality for all can  notably be attributed to Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the United  States Constitution, which he drafted. This amendment is the foundation  for many famous Supreme Court decisions that have advanced liberty.                                time  1600    Additionally, he represented the great State of Ohio in Congress,  served as a House manager for the impeachment of President Andrew  Jackson, and was appointed by Abraham Lincoln as Judge Advocate of the  Union Army.   While John Armor Bingham's legacy remains enshrined in the pages of  the Constitution, I hope this body will see fit to honor John Bingham  by renaming the Cadiz, Ohio, post office after him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
