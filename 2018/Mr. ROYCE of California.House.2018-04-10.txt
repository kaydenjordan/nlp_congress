Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill in the  Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is on human trafficking, which, put  another way, is modern-day slavery. It continues to devastate the lives  of millions of people; and whether we are talking about trafficking,  labor trafficking, which is indentured servitude or, basically,  slavery, or whether we are talking about underage children that are  frequently trafficked for sexual exploitation by these criminal  syndicates, the results are the same.   The results to these broken lives, due to these perpetrators of these  disgusting acts who prey on these vulnerable and defenseless people,  leave in their wake the broken lives of these children and of those who  are trafficked for labor.   These are not faraway crimes, as the Members here know from their own  districts. These are crimes in the United States; and if you go to Los  Angeles and ask the District Attorney, or you ask the District Attorney  in Orange County, what is the average age that children are trafficked  into these brothels or into these syndicates, they will tell you the  average age now is 14.   When you ask them why, they will tell you because a 14-year-old or  15-year-old is much less likely to put up resistance once she has been  kidnapped or enticed by some Romeo into this kind of conduct.   I think of the survivors when I think about this, the ones that many  of us have met who share their stories with us, and I think of Angela  Guanzon. She was labor-trafficked, working in an abusive workplace day- in, day-out, 16 hours, 18 hours, never seeing the light of day,  sleeping on the hallway floor. Survivors have taught me that the horror  of trafficking lies not in the statistics that we talk about here, but  in the stolen lives of these people.   Why is this so common? How can it be that we have so many instances  of this?   It is common because it is profitable and because these people, these  children and others who are trafficked, have very little resistance.  That is why.   The International Labor Organization estimates that it is a $150  billion business in illegal profit made from forced labor each year,  making human trafficking the third most valuable criminal enterprise in  the world.   And guess what? If your gang is involved in this instead of in drug  crimes, they are much less likely to experience violence themselves  because their victims cannot really fight back. They are in a line of  work where they can lord their violence over their victims.   Traffickers are laundering their money through financial institutions  that they can access with the click of a keyboard; and cutting off  their access to the banking system is critical to putting an end to  these illegal operations once and for all.   The End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2018 will help law  enforcement and financial institutions identify and report suspected  human traffickers so that they can be prosecuted to the fullest extent  of the law.   In California, by the way, we had, a few years ago, put a new law on  the books that allows us, if we can catch them, to put them away for  over 20 years.   I want to thank my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee,  especially Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Maxine Waters, for  their important contributions to this legislation.   This legislation will not only bolster our efforts to combat human  traffickers' use of our domestic financial institutions, but it is  going to encourage other countries to cut off traffickers from their  global financial system.   This bill is going to update the State Department's annual  Trafficking in Persons Report to require a country-by-country  assessment of whether foreign governments have a framework in place to  prevent financial transactions involving the proceeds of severe forms  of human trafficking.   Now, these annual reports, as we know, which the State Department  uses to rank countries' efforts to combat trafficking, are taken very  seriously in foreign capitals. They have helped to reinforce global  norms of responsible behavior.   I say that because when we first introduced this some years ago, we  have seen 120 governments now enact national anti-trafficking laws in  order to try to comply with the reports that we do through our audits  through our State Department in these other countries. They do not want  to be shamed. When we name them, we shame them, and so we get  compliance. This will assist on that as well. It is a critical first  step for enforcement.   So, as the center of the global financial system and the leading  country in terms of combating human trafficking in the world, the  United States must take all possible steps to address this crime and,  for this reason, this bill, H.R. 2219, deserves our unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.    I would just begin here by recognizing Representative Bill Keating,  who brings to this issue--I just want to acknowledge this. We don't  have that many District Attorneys, former District Attorneys in this  body who have the experience of law enforcement in terms of dealing  with the types of criminals that go into this line of work, and he  brings that expertise and has assisted greatly in this. I just wanted  to acknowledge that before the body today.   I acknowledge also the contribution of Congressman Chris Smith, who,  I think it was in 2000, as I recall, originally brought before us this  very idea of how to combat human trafficking internationally. He has  worked on many, many issues, the International Megan's Law, and many  others.   But this idea of how we could hold governments around the world to  account, this idea of the TIP Report, and then, on top of it, the  enforcement, so that it meant something; the idea that he would get on  a plane and go and make certain that our consulates and our embassies  overseas were carrying out that audit, and that the victims had someone  to explain this to; that NGOs had someone to talk to about what was  going on in-country, so that, country by country by country, he could  identify situations where underaged children were being trafficked or  being exploited.   I just wanted to acknowledge that the gentleman has really been  dogged all of these years in moving this issue, and thank him again for  what he has done for humanity, frankly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith).                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with Chairman Smith present, I want to speak on the  legislation which he previously brought up, the legislation prior to  this bill. I want to join him--I am a cosponsor of his legislation--in  support of H. Res. 128.   He and Karen Bass and other Members have worked together as  cosponsors of this legislation, and I want to say the Ethiopians are a  very proud people. They have a very rich heritage and a very rich  history.   Ethiopia is a very important partner for the United States. It has  asserted regional influence through rapid economic growth, as we know,  and strong cooperation with us on our security initiatives in the  region. It has that commitment that it constantly shows towards  combating radical jihadist extremism, and it has made notable strides  to address domestic challenges of health and child survival and food  security.   We have both made trips out there to see that progress, and we  celebrate these accomplishments. Ethiopia has come a long way from the  devastating famines of the 1980s, and it has achieved much of the  benchmarks. Most of the benchmarks that the Millennium Development  Goals have set out for it to date have been met.   This resolution recognizes the need to continue a close partnership  between the United States and Ethiopia to continue that momentum. But  it is because of these important bilateral ties that we must ensure  that Ethiopia is respecting good governance and democratic values.    Deeply ingrained ethnic divisions, marginalization, and years of  conflict provide unique governance challenges for the country.  Advancing democratic values is never easy, but they are the best way to  further Ethiopia's progress and to further our robust bilateral  relationship.   Reports of widespread human rights abuses and crackdowns on freedom  of expression and excessive force against peaceful protestors are  unacceptable.   The Government of Ethiopia has released thousands of political  prisoners in the last few months, and this is a welcome development.  However, the recently reimposed state of emergency criminalizes  peaceful assembly and allows state security forces to arrest citizens  without charge. This state of emergency must be lifted immediately,  which is what this resolution also calls for.   The United States must hold the Government of Ethiopia accountable to  the peaceful voices of their citizens, while allowing for inclusive  political participation and respecting human rights and freedom of  expression.   All parties must come to the table in order to advance democratic  principles and chart the course for a prosperous, inclusive, and  peaceful Ethiopia; otherwise, stability and economic progress will  suffer over the long term.   There is cause for hope, and I commend Dr. Abiy Ahmed for his recent  appointment as Prime Minister. I am so encouraged by his call for  increased political competition and in defense of fundamental human  rights. We hope that, under his leadership, the government will enact  meaningful political and social reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleague Representative  Coffman for his work on this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, returning to the End Banking for Human Traffickers Act,  I want to again thank my colleagues, the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel, Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member  Waters of the Financial Services Committee, and, of course, Bill  Keating for their support of this important legislation. And I thank  Mr. Chris Smith again.   I have seen some real reasons for hope that I think, when we are  talking about a topic that is this grim, it is good to remind ourselves  of how awareness can lead to coordinated action and how that, then, can  lead to freeing people from this bondage, especially freeing children  from this bondage.   In southern California, we have had great involvement from concerned  citizens, certainly from our NGO community, the local law enforcement.  I have a trafficking task force that I put together some years ago to  bring all of these forces together and work also with victims-- survivors, as they refer to themselves--working together to drive these  forms of exploitation out of our community; and I have seen some of the  effectiveness, especially last October, with the good work of the FBI  shutting down, across this Nation, so many of these rings.   But if we are going to be successful in ending this horrific trade,  not just here but worldwide, we have got to cut traffickers off from  the financial system. These criminals are laundering profits through  that financial system far too easily. This bill will help end that easy  access, and it is certainly going to strengthen the tools for law  enforcement to fight these crimes against human dignity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
