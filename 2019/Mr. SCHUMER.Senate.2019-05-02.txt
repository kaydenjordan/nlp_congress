 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Attorney General Barr's performance in  yesterday's Judiciary Committee hearing was abysmal. It raised all  types of questions about his willingness to be a faithful steward of  the law. Of the several outlandish claims, one stood out. One of them  should send shivers down the spine of anyone who believes in this  democracy. It would probably send shivers down the spines of the  Founding Fathers if they were to hear this Attorney General say what he  said. Attorney General Barr said yesterday that the President could not  have obstructed justice because he believed he was falsely accused. He  even went further. He made a broad principle.   Here is what he said:   [[Page S2581]]              [If an investigation is] based on false allegations, the       president does not have to sit there constitutionally and       allow it to run its course. The president could terminate       that proceeding and not have it be corrupt intent because he       was falsely accused.    What a statement. If the President himself believes he has been  falsely accused, he can terminate any investigation or proceeding  against him. Any at all? Is that the determination in the President's  own head and in nobody else's? I am sending a letter to the Attorney  General this morning and am asking him a whole bunch of questions based  on that awful, confounding statement.   First, we know he had a theory of the unitary executive. He issued  that letter before he was chosen as Attorney General, and many believe  that is why he was chosen. Yet this is the first time he had stated it  so crassly and so baldly as Attorney General. Does he stand by that or  was it a mistake? That will be my first question.   Does he stand by the statement that he said yesterday, based on false  allegations, that the President does not have to sit there  constitutionally and allow it to run its course? ``The president could  terminate that proceeding and not have it be corrupt intent because he  was being falsely accused.'' He could terminate the proceeding. So who  is the determiner of what a false allegation is? Is it the President  himself solely? I am going to ask Attorney General Barr that question.   What about other proceedings and investigations? Let's say one of the  President's family members is being investigated. If the President  determines that it is based on false allegations, does he have the  unilateral power to terminate the proceeding? What if it is one of the  President's business associates, and the President believes they are  false allegations? Does he have the ability to terminate? What if it is  one of his political allies? Again, does he have the ability to  terminate?   I will also ask him: Does that mean that Richard Nixon, who certainly  believed he was falsely accused, could have simply dismissed the entire  Watergate investigation? Is that what the Attorney General believes?   I mean, my God, what President doesn't believe he is being falsely  accused? If this were to become the actual standard, then no President  could be guilty of obstructing a Federal investigation, and every  President would have the right to terminate any investigation-- certainly, about that President and maybe about many others who would  have some relationship to the President.   Attorney General Barr's comments are as close as they can get to  saying the President should be above the law. So I will be writing him  a letter and sending it to him this morning, asking him explicitly  these questions and asking him if he stands by his statements. If he  does, he should not be Attorney General. I will await his answers. I  hope he doesn't stonewall as he has been doing over in the House.   (Mrs. HYDE-SMITH assumed the Chair.)
