 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Protecting Our Kids Act. This overdue legislation will tighten gun  regulations.   Unfortunately, in the world's wealthiest country, we have the 32nd  highest rate of death from gun violence across the planet. This is a  horrific statistic that is impacting all of our districts--blue  districts and red districts.   In my district, gun violence has taken far too many lives, including  the young life and brutal murder of Krystal Bayron-Nieves, working the  midnight shift in an East Harlem Burger King. The brutal murder of two  police officers in Harlem's 32nd Precinct.  [[Page H5385]]  An 11-month-old gunshot victim in the Bronx. Yes, Madam Speaker, only  11 months old.   Madam Speaker, I am here to tell my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle that this epidemic is serious. In fact, it is a public health  crisis. For this reason, Congresswoman Escobar and I urge our  colleagues to join us in a resolution declaring gun violence a national  public health crisis.   This is just the beginning, Madam Speaker. We will continue to pass  more gun regulations.
