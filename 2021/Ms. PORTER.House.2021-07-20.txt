 Mr. Speaker, when I was a law professor at U.C. Irvine, I  wrote a 600-page textbook on consumer protection. And luckily for  everyone, you do not need to read the book to understand one  fundamental truth: Nobody likes to get cheated; not Republicans, not  Democrats; not young, not old; not White, not Brown, not Black. Nobody  likes to get cheated.   But when consumers do get cheated, the only way they get justice is  if they get their money back. The Federal Trade Commission has used its  authority under section 13(b) of the FTC Act to return literally  billions of dollars to victims of a wide range of scams; everything  from telemarketing fraud to companies lying about how their products  can be used to prevent or treat COVID.  [[Page H3736]]    If a wrongdoer steals from you, it is the FTC's job to put your money  back into your pocket. The Consumer Protection and Recovery Act lets  the FTC return to doing just that.
