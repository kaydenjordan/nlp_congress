 Mr. President, as we gather today here in peace and  safety in this quiet Chamber, we must remember that there is a city  half a world away that is struggling to survive--a city that is  fighting for human rights and human liberty and a city that is a  solitary pinpoint of light on a continent of authoritarianism, a city  called Hong Kong.   The need there is urgent, and the hour there is late, and it is time  for America to act. I know this because I have been there. I have been  there myself. I have seen it. I have been to Hong Kong. I have been to  the streets of Hong Kong. I have seen the protesters marching in  support of and in defense of their basic human rights. I have seen them  demonstrating for their basic human liberties. I have seen them  confronting the police with their tactics of brutality and oppression.   It makes me think that sometimes, in the course of history, the fate  of one city defines the challenge of an entire generation. Fifty years  ago, that city was Berlin. Today, that city is Hong Kong. The situation  there is critical. Hong Kong is sliding toward becoming a police state.  Have no doubt and make no mistake that Beijing wants to impose its will  on Hong Kong. It wants to silence dissent in Hong Kong. It wants to  steamroll Hong Kong, just as it wants to steamroll all of its neighbors  in the region, just as it wants to control the region, and just as it  wants ultimately to control the entire international system.   We know what is at stake in this country because we have gotten all  too familiar with Beijing's tactics. We have seen what Beijing has  tried to do to this country for decades now. They have stolen our jobs.  They have stolen our technologies. They have tried to build and are  building their military on the backs of our middle class. Their aims  are expansionist, and their aims are domination, and their aims are not  compatible with the security or the prosperity of this country. That is  why what is happening in Hong Kong today is so important and the fight  there is so significant.   Will a totalitarian China and totalitarian Beijing be allowed to  dominate the city of Hong Kong, to silence it, and then to turn to the  region as a whole?   You know, let's review what is actually happening there in the  streets of Hong Kong. This didn't start with the people of Hong Kong;  this started with Beijing. This started with Beijing and its puppet  government and its puppet chief executive in Hong Kong attempting to  revoke the rights of Hongkongers--the rights, by the way, that Beijing  promised to the people of that city in 1984 and again in 1997. They are  trying to revoke those rights by bringing in a bill for extradition of  Hong Kong citizens and Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be  tried in China's courts, where there is no due process, where there are  no basic guaranteed liberties, and where there is no recourse. That was  Beijing's plan, and that would have affected not just the citizens of  Hong Kong but the residents there, including over 80,000 Americans who  are currently residents in the city. And the people of Hong Kong said  no.   On the 12th of July, just a few days after Beijing put forward this  extradition bill, 2 million Hong Kong residents--2 million took to the  streets in peaceful protest. This is a city of 7\1/2\ million. There  were 2 million on the streets on the 12th of July. When the Hong Kong  Government--the Beijing-controlled government refused to back down, the  people of Hong Kong refused to be silenced. For months now, months on  end, 20 weeks and more, the people of Hong Kong have been taking to the  streets protesting, seeking to vindicate their rights, and they have  been doing it in the face of escalating opposition.   The Hong Kong Government--on orders, no doubt, from Beijing--has  sought to deny the protesters permits to gather peacefully. They have  sought to deny them the right to cover their faces because, let's not  forget, China is a surveillance state, and the persecution and  retribution against protesters is real, and it is constant.   Now they are talking about a potential curfew. They are shutting down  subway stations early so protesters can't get from one place to  another. They have used violent tactics to put down the protests--tear  gas and beatings and dye blasted at protesters.   China continues to escalate--Beijing continues to escalate the  situation, turning the screws on Hong Kong and taking away the rights  and liberties of the people there.   Hong Kong's demands are not outlandish; they are asking for what they  were promised. They were promised in 1984, by the Government of  Beijing--in a duly ratified international treaty, they were promised  the right to assemble and the right to peacefully gather and protest.  They were promised the right to vote and to be able to choose their own  government. They were promised the right to speak openly. They were  promised the right to worship. Those are the rights the people of  [[Page S6064]]  Hong Kong seek to vindicate today, and those are the rights Beijing is  attempting to strip from this city as we stand here today in this  Chamber.   The people of Hong Kong--they have an expression. The protesters say  they are going to be like water. They say ``Be water.'' Some have  actually referred to this as a water movement. They mean ``Be fluid. Be  reactive. Adjust to the situation.''   I just have to say, having been there myself, having been to the  streets, having seen the protesters, having met with them and talked  with them, their courage and their bravery under pressure is really  something to behold. It is an inspiration to me, and I think it should  be an inspiration to all of us. Their love of liberty--you never love  something more than when it is threatened--their love of liberty is  really extraordinary.   I want to say something the Reverend Chu Yiu-ming said about liberty  and democracy. He said it so beautifully. These are his words:         We strive for democracy, because democracy strives for       freedom, equality and universal love. Political freedom is       more than loyalty to a state. [Political freedom] professes       human dignity. Every single person living in a community       possesses unique potentials and unique powers, capable of       making a [unique] contribution to society.    That is extraordinary, and he is exactly right. Hongkongers know it,  and that is what they are standing for, and that is what they are  fighting for.   The people of Hong Kong need our support, they deserve our support,  and they are depending on our support. That is why it is time for this  body to act. It is time to take up and pass the Hong Kong Human Rights  and Democracy Act. The time for debate is over. The time for delay has  passed. It is now time to stand with the people of Hong Kong and to  send a signal to the world that the United States will stand with  freedom-loving people, that the United States will stand up to Beijing,  and that the United States will not permit China to dominate its  neighbors and its region and the world.   It is time for this body to act and to act now, and it is time to do  more. That is why I will soon be introducing further measures to help  support the people of Hong Kong. I will be calling for the imposition  of Global Magnitsky sanctions on individuals and business entities that  abet Beijing in its suppression of the freedoms of speech and assembly  that rightfully belong to the people of Hong Kong.   I would just say to those corporations doing business in China and to  those multinational corporate entities and organizations like the NBA  that it is time for you to take a stand as well. It is time for you to  show a little backbone. It is time for you to show some independence.  You may be multinational corporations that do business everywhere in  the world, but remember that you are based here in this country.  Remember--the NBA should--that you are an American organization. These  companies need to remember that they are American entities, and it is  time to show a little American independence.   When Beijing tries to use threats of coercion and threats of market  access to get the NBA to censure and to get corporations like Apple to  censure, it is time for these corporations to stand up and say: We are  not going to participate, and we are not going to become part of the  Chinese Communist Party's propaganda arm. It is time for these  companies to remember where their loyalties actually lie.   I have to say, for too long now and for too many years now, we have  seen too many of these companies and these same corporate executives-- who make money hand over fist in China--we have seen them happily send  our jobs to China. We have seen them happily outsource our work to  China. Now they want to import censorship into this country from China.  Well, no thank you. It is time that they are open about what it is they  are doing, and it is time they stand up to Beijing and say: No further.   I want to say again that the situation in Hong Kong is urgent, and  the people of Hong Kong are looking to the United States and to other  freedom-loving peoples around the world for support and for strength.  It is time that we send them the message--and call on our allies to do  the same--that we must stand with Hong Kong because our own security  and our own prosperity and our own ideals are at stake there.   I think, finally, of the words of John Quincy Adams, whom I will  paraphrase. He said: Wherever the standard of freedom is unfurled,  there will be America's prayers, there will be America's benedictions,  there will be America's heart, and today, there needs to be America's  voice.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Merkley's intern, Thomas Sipp, have privileges of the floor for the  remainder of the day.
