 Madam Speaker, across America, we can hear the cries  of those who have been victims of crime. It is not in any way  distinguished by communities, race, age, or sex. It prevails in our  society.   I am reminded of the tragedy of two brothers on a crime spree killing  a man and kidnapping a woman. Those are victims of crimes. Their  families are victims of crimes.   I can assure you, Madam Speaker, that we stand collectively, as  Members of Congress, recognizing that VOCA is crucial to responding to  restorative justice for victims.   The Federal grants used to support victim services through VOCA have  decreased significantly over the past several years. Further drastic  cuts to VOCA funding are expected as the nontaxpayer-funded pool from  which these grants originated, the Crime Victims Fund, is running dry.   I am delighted to be an original cosponsor with Chairman Nadler, Mr.  Fitzpatrick, and Ms. Scanlon, and to have worked with Congresswoman  Wagner over the years on this very important legislation.   Further drastic cuts to VOCA are expected as the nontaxpayer-funded  pool from which these grants originate, the Crime Victims Fund, is  running dry. The Crime Victims Fund serves as an example of true  justice because the money used to support victims comes, not from  taxpayer dollars but, rather, from the criminal fines and penalties  paid by federally convicted offenders.   The Crime Victims Fund has shrunk rapidly in recent years and  continues to decline because, rather than prosecuting cases, the  Department of Justice increasingly settles cases through deferred  prosecution and nonprosecution agreements, and the monetary penalties  associated with these agreements are deposited in the Treasury rather  than the Crime Victims Fund.   We don't want to pit one form of reform against one great need. These  agreements may diminish the ability of VOCA to be funded because of the  lack of dollars going into the fund. The crimes for which these  penalties are derived are the same whether they are prosecuted or  settled, and the funding should be given to serve victims.   The VOCA Fix Act of 2021 fixes this by ensuring that monetary  penalties associated with deferred and nonprosecution agreements go  into the Crime Victims Fund instead of into the Treasury. It is common  sense. Victims are outcrying their need for relief.   This simple fix will prevent future funding cuts that jeopardize  programs' abilities to serve their communities and will help address  the many growing and unmet needs of victims and survivors, including  survivors of domestic violence.   We will be on the floor tomorrow with the opportunity to vote on the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. There are countless  examples in domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, and sex  trafficking that show that victims are in need. Victims are elders,  victims are young, victims are families, and victims are mothers and  fathers.    We are doing so because we recognize the urgency and  dire need faced by victims and survivors throughout this country during  a pinnacle moment caused by the pandemic.   The numbers of domestic violence have gone up in cities like Houston  and San Antonio and in States like Oregon and New York. We should  recognize that cooperation on this legislation, in terms of improving  the funding, is absolutely crucial.   Without the VOCA fix of 2021, survivors of domestic violence and  sexual assault will inevitably lose access to victim support services.  It is leaving victims and survivors without options for safety and  valuable opportunities to help them in their victimization if we don't  fund this and change this process.   The VOCA fix will rebuild lives, and it will save the lives of  children who have been impacted by violence against their family  members.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1652, or the ``VOCA  Fix Act of 2021,'' a critical piece of legislation designed to curtail  and prevent future cuts to an already diminished federal victim service  grants program.   This legislation must pass, because VOCA grants provides compensation  to victims of crime at critical moments of desperate need.   VOCA funds could help compensate the only surviving victim of Robert  Lee Haskell who, driven by vengeance, fatally shot six members of his  ex-wife's family in Texas, including four children.   The survivor of Haskell's rampage, a girl of only fifteen, was shot  in the head and only survived by playing dead.   VOCA funds could help compensate the wife and two children of a man  killed in a home intrusion in Harris County, Texas, after an intruder  entered the family's home, ordered the wife and children to lock  themselves into a room, and then proceeded to shoot their husband and  father.   VOCA funds could help compensate a woman who was abducted in Houston  and forced to drive to an ATM at gunpoint, where she withdrew cash to  give to her abductors.   VOCA funds could help compensate innumerable victims and survivors of  federal crimes, but only if we pass this legislation.   VOCA grants have been vital in their support of traditional victim  service providers across the nation, particularly for those  organizations serving victims of domestic violence, sexual assault,  child abuse, trafficking, and drunk driving.   VOCA grants also fund victim compensation, which helps survivors pay  medical bills, missed wages, and in the most severe cases, funeral  costs.   However, the federal grants used to support victim services through  VOCA have decreased significantly over the past several years.   Further drastic cuts to VOCA funding are expected, as the non- taxpayer-funded pool from which these grants originate, the Crime  Victims Fund, is running dry.   The Crime Victims Fund serves as an example of true justice, because  the money used to support victims comes not from taxpayer dollars but  rather from the criminal fines and penalties paid by federally  convicted offenders.   The Crime Victims Fund has shrunk rapidly in recent years and  continues to decline, because rather than prosecuting cases, the  Department of Justice increasingly settles cases through deferred  prosecution and non-prosecution agreements, and the monetary penalties  associated with these agreements are deposited into the Treasury rather  than the Crime Victims Fund.   These agreements deny funding to victim services, which is contrary  to the spirit of VOCA: monetary penalties from crimes should go to  serve victims of crimes.   The crimes from which these penalties are derived are the same,  whether they are prosecuted or settled, and the funding should be going  to serve victims.   The VOCA Fix Act of 2021 fixes this by ensuring that monetary  penalties associated with deferred and non-prosecution agreements go  into the Crime Victims Fund instead of into the Treasury.   This simple fix will prevent future funding cuts that jeopardize  programs' abilities to serve their communities and will help address  the many growing and unmet needs of victims and survivors, including  survivors of domestic violence.                              Victim Cooperation    This legislation not only recognizes that it is the victims of crime  that bear the brunt of the drastic cuts being made, but also that we  must protect those victims that have the courage to come forward and  work together with the authorities to bring justice to their offenders.   Victims who cooperate with authorities often fear for their own  safety and face pain at revisited trauma, and this legislation  recognizes that rather than putting victims in further danger, we  create for them a safe environment--both physically and emotionally.   Victims may be intimidated by law enforcement or other government  agencies, but if we want victims to fully and freely cooperate with the  authorities, we must ensure that victims feel protected and that there  is no risk of becoming retraumatized.   We must also make sure that if victims cooperate with authorities,  then measures to ensure the safety of victims will be provided in our  government agencies working in tandem with victim service providers.   Tomorrow, the House will vote on H.R. 1620, which will reauthorize  the Violence Against Women Act (VA WA) of 1994.   We are doing so because we recognize the urgency and dire need faced  by the victims and survivors throughout this country during a  significant moment of ongoing domestic violence caused by this pandemic  and experienced by both women and men.   Although local victim services agencies are there to help, they are  facing record numbers of clients as well as the economic consequences  of the pandemic.   Without the VOCA Fix Act of 2021, survivors of domestic violence and  sexual assault will inevitably lose access to victim support  [[Page H1393]]  services, leaving victims and survivors without options for safety and  vulnerable to further victimization.   Madam Speaker, the time is now to deliver access to the services  victims and survivors so desperately need during a critical moment when  the need for victim assistance has skyrocketed, and programs are being  forced to cut lifesaving services for victims.   Yes, it will be the fair assessment of justice. That is what we are  here to do; fair operatives of justice. So I ask my colleagues to  support this legislation and to join us tomorrow to support the  Violence Against Women Act, to recognize that it is our job to promote  justice.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I thank the manager of the bill for  her leadership and the rule.   Let me, first of all, rise in support of H.R. 6 because there are  millions of young people waiting for this relief in the DACA promise.   The American Dream and Promise Act is long overdue. These are nurses  and doctors, these are hardworking young people, these are college  students who are ready to serve America.   Let me also rise in support of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act  for the many, many farmers across America who are supporting that and  needing that.   And I don't know who would be against making sure that there are no  Medicare cuts as we proceed to give a lifeline to the American people  through the American Rescue Act. I stand solidly behind that bill.   But let me spend most of my time, Madam Speaker, on the question of  the Violence Against Women Act, H.R. 1620, and H.J. Res. 17.   First of all, there is no divisiveness, and I really stand openly  against that interpretation. Is there divisiveness on helping rape  victims across America who, as President Biden has said, live  [[Page H1396]]  in States that are not blue States or red States, but they live with  the scourge of domestic violence, one of the most dangerous calls that  police officers make?   In 2018, we could not get the Violence Against Women Act, which I  wrote, to the floor because our Republican friends would not proceed.  At that time there was a Republican President, a Republican House, and  a Republican Senate. Nothing happened, and women suffered.   My women's center right now is teeming with women who are impacted by  domestic violence during this pandemic. They are crying out for this  legislation, and they don't see divisiveness.   What they do see is enhanced legal assistance.   What they do see is $110 million for rape prevention.   What they do see is intervention, with training for men and boys.   They see a space that provides training and refuge for culturally  distinct women who are victimized who can go to a quiet, calm place and  deal with culturally sensitive counselors and others.   What they see is cooperation between the victim and law enforcement  by providing and making sure that they have the kinds of resources and  legal representation that is necessary. No one goes without legal  representation, whether they are immigrant or Native American.   They see an enhanced response to the victimization of Native American  women who, in fact, there are those who victimize them on their  particular reservation or pueblo and then run off outside of that, and  they are not prosecuted. We changed that.   They see the closing of the boyfriend loophole.   They see the taking away of guns from stalkers.   Yes, this is a lifeline. The Violence Against Women Act,  constitutionally grounded, due-process protected for those who may be  accused, but it is legislation that women have been waiting for.   This bill expired in 2018. We wrote it in 2018, we built on it in the  last Congress, and the amendments that were both Republican and  Democrat are still in this bill because we believe in bipartisanship,  and it is a bipartisan bill with Members from the Republican  Conference, who are in this bill in terms of cosponsors.   As it relates to H.J. Res. 17, let me say that Congress has the  authority to extend the deadline for ratification of the ERA.   The ERA says that women do not have to live in discomfort and live  under equality and live in inequality. They live in a Nation of  equality, and they live in inequality in housing, in income, in access  to credit, in employment, in many ways. Why are we continuing this in  the 21st century?   So what does H.J. Res. 17 do? It extends the deadline for the  compliance with the equal rights amendment for the States to be able to  reach the 38 margin.    It extends that time beyond the time that was last  extended. When we extended that time, we extended it by majority vote  in the United States Congress.   A decision came out just recently about the fact that the deadline  had expired, but what it did say is that the deadline was created by  Congress and that Congress obviously has that authority.   When we researched this in 1978 in the Judiciary Committee, there was  no requirement that that extension of the deadline constitutionally  require a two-thirds supermajority vote. Simple majority. Are you going  to suggest that women now should be denied the ERA when a number of  States have already sanctioned this? There are some States that have  rescinded, but that will be the jurisdiction of the United States  Congress when appropriate.   I ask my colleagues to support VAWA, H.R. 1620, and H.J. Res. 17,  removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights  amendment. It is time for VAWA. It is time for the ERA.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to pose a question to my  good friend, the Senator from Wisconsin.   It amazes me that in the conspicuous and confirmed insurrection of  January 6, when there were persons who were literally attacking and  beating law enforcement officers in plain view; seeking to kill the  Vice President, the Speaker, and Members of Congress; and throwing off  racial epithets, that Senator from Wisconsin seemed to be confused.   He was not afraid of the insurrectionists, who were beating police  officers, but he would be afraid of young people of Black Lives Matter,  who were fighting for social justice, and allegedly those who were  Antifa, which is really an ideology.   It strikes me quite amazing that this individual would not understand  that that is racist. That is racism.   I would hope that if a Senator takes an oath to serve the people of  the United States of America and his own State that is very diverse  that he would correct that kind of behavior and that he would, in fact,  not be someone who would offer to say that Black Lives Matter is worthy  of being frightened of.   No, they are not. They are fighting for social justice. They are  fighting for what is right. I think the gentleman needs to get  corrected in what he is thinking.                            ____________________
