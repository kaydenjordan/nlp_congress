 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  service of Bishop Phillip Brooks, who passed away at 88 years old, as  the First Assistant Presiding Bishop of the Church of God in Christ.   After moving to Michigan in 1949, Bishop Brooks became a leader in  the faith community for Detroit. He was also the first African-American  pastor to broadcast on television in Detroit.   Bishop Brooks also stressed and taught the importance of  relationships and service within the community.   The bishop became the supporter of several Detroit institutions,  including the Charles Wright Museum of African American History, and he  raised money and resources to aid displaced New York workers after 9/11  and supported relief efforts for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.   His 36 years on the executive board of the Church of God in Christ  was the longest of any bishop. Detroit and the faith community will  always remember Bishop Brooks for his devoted service.   I take personal privilege to honor his spiritual leadership for me  and for my family, the Cranford family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5661, the  Continued State Flexibility To Assist Older Foster Youth Act.   As co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, this issue  is incredibly important to me. In my home State of Michigan, there are  approximately 13,000 children in foster care. Unfortunately, they have  been at particular risk during this COVID-19 pandemic.   This legislation would take meaningful action to ensure that States  have the opportunity to assist children in foster care by extending  pandemic-related provisions passed under the Consolidated  Appropriations Act for an additional year.   Mr. Speaker, I am confident that these flexibilities will help  States, like my own Michigan, provide foster children with the  assistance they need.   We must do everything in our power to assist and support at-risk  youth. It is necessary that we follow through on this commitment to  them.   Mr. Speaker, I often remind people: Foster children are a ward of the  State and are our responsibility.
