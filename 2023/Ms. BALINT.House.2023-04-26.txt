 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2811, the  default on America act.   A budget reflects our values, and we can plainly see where the  Republicans' priorities lie. They are threatening default with  catastrophic consequences, and why? Why? So they can secure 10 years of  devastating cuts that American families depend on. Those programs will  be devastated.   Republicans have to abandon this dangerous path. America pays our  bills. We must prevent default as we have done countless times under  Democratic and Republican Presidents, including President Trump.   A default will be a terrible blow to low-income and middle-income  Americans. They don't care about these reckless political games. They  care about how disastrous a default will be on them in their quest to  buy a house or lease a car or pay for college. They don't care about  this. They care about results.   I sit on the Budget Committee and have a front row seat to this  nonsense. We have to pay our bills, and we have to reject the ransom  note.
