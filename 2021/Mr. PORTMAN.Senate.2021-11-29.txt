 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio, and I am  on the floor today to talk about a major public health crisis facing  our country, one that is resulting in thousands of people losing their  lives, causing the death of over 100,000 Americans a year, and has  negatively impacted so many millions more in my home State of Ohio and  all around the country.   And, no, I am not talking about COVID-19. I am talking about an  epidemic within the pandemic. I am talking about the surging epidemic  of drug use and addiction that has fueled a record number of overdose  deaths and threatens to get even worse.   In the past 19 months or so, our attention has, understandably, been  directed toward the COVID-19 crisis. And, once again, we see with  Omicron the possibility of another variant coming, and those public  health challenges are real.   But I have to tell you that it has led us to ignore another crisis.  The Centers for Disease Control, the CDC, recently issued a report  which was shocking and should serve as a wake-up call to all of us.   It said that between April of 2020 and April of 2021, the most recent  year for which we have data, we had over 100,000 individuals lose their  lives to drug overdose deaths in this country. That is the highest  ever. It is a record.   By the way, 100,000 deaths per year is more than the deaths from  gunshot wounds and the deaths from car accidents combined. It is truly  the epidemic within the pandemic.   Away from the headlines, we have this other tragic healthcare crisis  that has left no part of the country unaffected. Forty-six States and  the District of Columbia have seen their overdose rates go up in the  last year, with a 26-percent increase in my home State of Ohio. In some  States, there are now as many drug overdose deaths as there are COVID  deaths.   Like many of you, I have seen firsthand the damage drugs like crystal  meth or cocaine or heroin or now the synthetic opioids are causing to  the families we represent, to people who have gotten caught in that  spiral of drug abuse and addiction.   I have also seen the heroic efforts of first responders who have  saved people's lives by administering naloxone, which some call Narcan,  its brand name. It is a miracle drug that literally saves lives by  being able to reverse the effects of an overdose.   And I have ridden with law enforcement and treatment providers on  rapid response teams in various places in Ohio that follow up with  those who have overdosed. Literally, somebody overdoses, and then this  rapid response team--usually made up of law enforcement but also  treatment providers, social workers--goes to people's homes, and it is  amazing what you will find out.   I was, frankly, a little surprised during my first visit--then, I got  more used to it--which is that people respond very favorably. Most  people who are approached by these rapid response teams agree to get  into treatment. And isn't that the key? Using Narcan again and again  and again to save someone's life is not the answer. The answer is to  get that person into treatment so that that person can get back to his  or her family, his or her work, and to a normal life and to be more  productive in life.   I have also met with families and loved ones affected, hearing their  stories about how losing a family member to addiction has had such a  negative impact, often tearing those families apart.   And, of course, I have talked to a lot of people in recovery who have  told me about the grip of addiction on their lives and how they got  help and what worked and what didn't work.   Unfortunately, a lot of people get help, get into treatment, and it  doesn't work for them. They have to do it again and again. But,  ultimately, for those who can stay in recovery and are able to stay  sober and clean, they have the most amazing stories. And so many of  them are coming back and contributing in big ways to our communities-- many helping others. Their recovery, basically, is reaching out to  others and helping them along the way. Some are called recovery  coaches, which is a more formal title, but so many of them are, in  effect, recovery coaches helping others who are struggling.   There are so many lives that have been touched by this crisis-- 100,000-plus deaths, but so many others affected. And I have made it a  goal of mine to make sure Congress is playing its role in addressing  this effort that must be at the community level, at the State level,  but also at the national level to respond to what is a true national  crisis.   What makes it especially heartbreaking to me is that, only a few  years ago, we had finally begun to make progress on this. We were  beginning to turn the corner. We were seeing lower addiction rates. We  were seeing lower overdose deaths for the first time in decades.   How did we do it? Well, we redoubled our efforts on prevention, on  getting people into treatment, on getting people into longer term  recovery, making more naloxone available.   Thanks to the bipartisan leadership here in Congress, the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, which I coauthored  with my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse, and the 21st Century CURES Act  were both signed into law in 2016, helping to pave the way for several  billion dollars in new Federal funding to strengthen State, local, and  nonprofit efforts to combat addiction.   Our CARA legislation and the follow-up CARA.2 legislation that we  passed a few years ago took a comprehensive approach based on best  practices. We actually had seminars here in Washington. We brought  people from all over the country here. We had four different  conferences where we got information as to what was working and not  working in our communities, and things that were working we funded.   We directed resources toward more treatment and recovery services for  individuals and more focus on prevention.   I can't overstate how critical these kinds of proven services are for  people on the path to recovery. Congress had never, before this  legislation, ever funded recovery services.   I have visited a number of inpatient and outpatient centers for  addiction in Ohio to talk with those working to overcome their  addiction. They have told me time and again how these recovery services  gave them the structure, the support, and, most importantly, the hope  they needed to be able to overcome this disease.   And we actually started to see that hope translate into real success  on the ground, real numbers and real people's lives.   In 2017, Ohio's overdose death rate had increased for 30-plus  straight years, and Ohio's death per capita that year, 2017, was almost  three times that of the national average.   But that next year, in 2018, as these two signature laws, CARA and  CURES, were fully implemented, Ohio began to turn the tide with a 22- percent reduction in overdose deaths in 1 year.   Again, after more than 30 years of increases in overdose deaths every  single year, a 22-percent decrease. Nationally, overdose deaths  declined that year about 4 percent, again, after a year after year of  increases. In 2019, we had a slight decrease also. These were promising  developments.   But since then, there has been a lethal convergence on both the  supply side of this issue and the demand side of this issue. Sam  Quinones, the author of ``Dreamland,'' which I think is the seminal  book on the rise of opioids in this country, recently put it well. He  said in an interview that before COVID hit, Mexican cartels had  achieved their goal, finally, of covering our country with ``the most .  . . mind-mangling drugs we've ever seen. . . . It just so happened that  we went into isolation at the very moment when these drugs hit their  apex.''  [[Page S8800]]    A terrible coincidence that as the supply increased because of the  greed of traffickers, the demand increased because of COVID. These two  things came together, and that has caused this huge increase in  overdoses, addiction, and overdose deaths.   Let's look at the supply side of this crisis first. The record number  of deadly narcotics and other drugs that are taking the lives of moms,  dads, children, and loved ones all across the country are coming into  our country in record numbers. As many are aware, for much of the past  few decades, the most common cause of overdose deaths were prescription  opioids like OxyContin or Percocet. Often people who suffered a serious  injury or accident needed pain relief, and often, unfortunately,  doctors and dentists overprescribed opioids. People developed an  addiction that led to accidental overdoses, often from cheaper and more  available heroin when the prescription drugs ran out.   Now we are dealing with a class of drugs that are tens if not  hundreds of times deadlier than those prescription drugs, the so-called  synthetic opioids. The most well known of these is fentanyl, which, as  you can see by this chart of drug overdoses, has become the drug most  responsible for overdose deaths.   The red here is overdose deaths overall, and the blue is overdose  deaths that are attributed to fentanyl. You can see what has happened.  Fentanyl was about half of overdose deaths in 2018. Half of all  overdose deaths was one drug, fentanyl. In 2019, it was more than half  and, in 2020, way more than half of all the overdose deaths caused by  one drug, a synthetic opioid called fentanyl. It is the deadliest one.   Incredibly, 80 percent of drug overdoses in Ohio and overdose deaths  in Ohio can now be attributed to this deadly substance, based on what  the experts tell me--80 percent. It is not surprising that the amount  of fentanyl seized on the streets of Ohio cities like Dayton, OH,  recently has nearly doubled compared to last year. And it is not only  the amount of fentanyl that is flooding our country.   Evil traffickers have increasingly disguised it by mixing it with  other drugs or pressing it into fake pills to look like common  pharmaceuticals. This concerted effort to expand the reach of fentanyl  addiction started before the pandemic, but it is only accelerating.   It is a profitable business for drug dealers. Compared to heroin,  fentanyl is less expensive to manufacture and, pound-for-pound, far  more potent. A few flakes can kill you. Traffickers make a bigger  profit, and people are trapped into addiction more easily.   Traffickers increasingly lace fentanyl with other drugs--cocaine,  crystal meth, heroin, and even marijuana in some cases. They do it as a  way to boost its effects and cut down on its costs. In Mexico, they use  cheap pill presses to mold fentanyl doses into the shape of  prescription drugs--everyday pills that people take for a variety of  reasons. What that means is that many of the individuals who now lose  their lives to a fentanyl overdose don't even know they are taking  fentanyl until it is too late.   Recently, I participated in a roundtable discussion on the border  crisis and how it has impacted the addiction crisis. We heard from an  Ohio mother, Virginia Krieger, who lost her daughter Tiffany to an  accidental fentanyl death. Virginia told us about how Tiffany had been  unable to get the care she wanted from her physician. That led her to  buying pills on the street--pills she was told were Percocet, and it  looked like Percocet. That is what was stamped on it. But in reality,  it was laced with lethal doses of heroin and fentanyl. When Tiffany  took these pills for her pain, she was poisoned by the fentanyl, and  the life of a young 26-year-old woman was snuffed out far too soon.   We are hearing this across the State. Recently, in Cleveland, OH,  Xanax pills, an antianxiety medication--fake pills pressed by Mexican  traffickers contained fentanyl and caused overdoses and overdose  deaths.   My heart goes out to these families. My heart goes out to Virginia,  who, by the way, has channeled her grief into something positive, and  that is going to schools and explaining to young people how dangerous  this is. Her view is that no one should ever take a pill unless they  know it comes from a pharmacy.   She is right. People across the country need to know that pills of  all shapes and sizes can contain fentanyl even though they might say  something else. No street drug is safe right now from the threat of  fentanyl poisoning, and too many kids and adults who weren't addicted  to opioids are unknowingly ingesting these substances and putting  themselves at risk. We need to be on high alert. Parents and kids need  to know that right now no drug you get on the street can be safe.   Our communities are saturated with fentanyl and other synthetic  opioids right now. Among other things, of course, this drives the price  of the drugs down. So, yes, the most important thing is to reduce the  demand for drugs, but with its overwhelming supply, the price of the  drug goes down and there is higher use and higher demand.    A conversation about how we can cut down on the supply side of course  has to start with our strategy on our southern border. For years,  fentanyl and other synthetic opioids were overwhelmingly illegally  manufactured in China. As then-chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee  on Investigations, I led a bipartisan investigation back in 2017 which  showed that fentanyl was coming into our country from China primarily  through our own lax Postal Service. Our own Postal Service was the  conduit. That is why I worked in a bipartisan manner to write and pass  what is called the STOP Act, which required the Postal Service, for the  first time, to crack down on fentanyl through the mail.   We required the Postal Service to get advanced tracking data on  international shipments coming to the United States, showing the  package's origin, contents, and destination. This allowed law  enforcement to spot potentially dangerous packages ahead of time and  make it much more difficult to move fentanyl into the United States in  this manner. Other carriers were already doing it--FedEx, private  carriers, DHL, but the post office was not.   The good news is that the STOP Act has been effective, and also,  after persistent engagement and pressure from the United States, China  scheduled fentanyl, meaning made it illegal, and its analogues as a  class of illegal drugs. We believe these changes have helped to  dramatically reduce the flow of fentanyl directly from China into the  United States.   But, obviously, it hasn't solved the problem because Mexican  transnational criminal organizations know a great business opportunity  when they see one, and they moved in to take over the fentanyl market  in the United States. Now Mexican transnational criminal organizations  work with criminal gangs in China to import into Mexico the ingredients  used to make fentanyl, where the final product is made in so-called  superlabs.   We have a record amount of the substance pouring in, both at our  ports of entry and through other gaps in our southern border security  by car, by truck, by courier. This is a problem that continues to get  worse as this shocking chart shows us.   Look at the dramatic increases in fentanyl that was seized along the  U.S. border. This past fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection  seized 11,201 pounds of fentanyl, enough to kill every man, woman, and  child in America--more than double the amount from the previous year  and four times the amount from fiscal year 2019. Just a few weeks ago  in Southern California, border officials discovered 8\1/2\ tons of meth  in a single truck along with 400 pounds of fentanyl. Remember, it only  takes a few flakes of fentanyl to kill you. This 400 pounds could kill  millions.   Their smuggling operations are complex and sophisticated, and Customs  and Border Protection have their hands full. According to the most  recent statistics, last month, seizures of fentanyl increased 42  percent. That is 42 percent in 1 month. This is only how much we know  was discovered, was apprehended. We don't know how much more made it  over the border undetected.   When I have asked Customs and Border Protection and DHS, our homeland  security officials, in public hearings, as I did the week before last,  they don't  [[Page S8801]]  answer the question because they don't know. But in private  conversations with Border Patrol agents, they tell me that they believe  the vast majority of drugs are coming in undetected. So this is just  the seizures, not the amount of drugs that are streaming across the  border.   I take no pleasure in saying this, but the failure of the Biden  administration to control the southern border has resulted in record  levels of deadly fentanyl coming in to our country and contributes to  the growing strength of the Mexican transnational criminal  organizations. Part of the problem is that the Biden administration's  own policies have encouraged an unprecedented surge of unlawful  migrants at the border, diverting our Customs and Border Protection  officers and Border Patrol agents away from interdicting drugs. I have  seen that on the southern border as has anyone else who has visited.   These law enforcement officers who should be on the line stopping the  criminals carrying drugs are instead processing a record number of  migrants. This massive influx of unlawful migrants began when President  Biden was inaugurated and made specific policy changes, and it has only  continued to worsen ever since. We had all hoped that during the summer  months, when normally unlawful migration slows down because of the  heat, that we would have a lessening of this issue, but it didn't  happen. In fact, last month was a record month for October for Border  Patrol apprehensions.   As the border crisis created by the Biden administration policy  changes continues, the administration has failed to give Customs and  Border Protection the resources they need: additional personnel, better  technology, infrastructure, and more, to enable them to better protect  our Nation along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. On an  average day in 2020, Customs and Border Protection processed 650,000- plus passengers and pedestrians, 187,000 incoming privately owned  vehicles, and 77,900 truck, rail, and sea containers. The amount of  traffic at the border is going up now that there is less concern about  the pandemic.   However, only 2 percent of those privately owned vehicles are  physically searched at the border, and less than 20 percent of all  those commercial vehicles are scanned for drugs before they cross into  the United States.   Let me repeat that: 2 percent. So if you are a smuggler driving a  sedan with multiple pounds of fentanyl concealed in hidden  compartments, right now you have a very good chance of getting across  the border without a search. That is not a gap in our security, that is  a gaping hole.   We have known this is a problem. Congress, last January, almost a  year ago, passed and President Trump signed into law a requirement that  the Department of Homeland Security give Congress a plan and a strategy  on using technology and making policy and resources changes to be able  to scan all vehicles.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration is late delivering this  report. It was due over 4 months ago, and we still don't have it. In  conversations with administration officials the week before last, I got  assurances that it is coming soon. I hope so. We need it. It would be  extremely helpful to have this information as we finalize the spending  bills over the next month or so.   I am proud that the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act invested billions of dollars in upgrading and modernizing our  ports of entry, including ports of entry on the southern border. Our  ports are aging, some of them badly. This funding would allow Customs  and Border Protection officers to have adequate space to do more  screening of vehicles.   However, we cannot and should not build a brandnew port of entry and  then just install the old legacy technology for scanning and detection  of deadly narcotics. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  dramatically upgrade seaports of entry with modern, state-of-the-art  detection technology that can help our officers catch more of these  drugs before they enter our communities.   In May, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Mark Kelly  of Arizona to establish a $1 billion irregular migration border  response fund so that the Department of Homeland Security is not forced  to transfer resources away from drug interdiction priorities to fund  processing of individuals, food, clothing, blankets, and transportation  when there is an influx of migrants, as has happened periodically.  These contingency resources would be available immediately when there  is a surge to quickly respond to increased migration at the border.   Considering the crisis at our border and the record amounts of  fentanyl coming in, it was not surprising to me in September when the  Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, issued its first public safety alert in  more than 6 years after it seized more than 9.5 million fake pills this  year, more than the last 2 years combined. As I said, we all need to be  on high alert.    We hear a lot these days about problems with the supply chain, with  delayed shipments and cancelled orders. I will tell you the Mexican  transnational criminal organizations don't have that problem. They are  moving more fentanyl than ever into our communities, and once that  fentanyl is here, what a waste. Sadly, more people are caught in the  grip of addiction.   This brings us to the demand side of the equation. Again, most  important to me is reducing the demand for these drugs, but both the  demand and the supply side are related.   As we discussed, the supply of deadly fentanyl was already increasing  when COVID-19 hit us almost 2 years ago. Clearly, this pandemic has led  to more isolation, anxiety for some, depression for others. Millions of  Americans lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Millions have  lost loved ones to COVID-19. Some in recovery have not been able to be  with their treatment providers or with their recovery coaches, as we  talked about earlier. Millions have had their lives turned upside down,  and some have turned to drugs as a coping mechanism. Others, who were  on the path to recovery, have suffered setbacks--relapsing into drug  use again.   Last month, I visited with Erin Helms, who runs recovery homes for  women in northeast Ohio that I have had the chance to visit. Erin told  me about the challenges during COVID to connect people with treatment  and recovery support services when they overdose or when they are being  released out of the criminal justice system. When we were in the most  restrictive time of the pandemic, those people fell through the cracks,  and we are seeing the results of that today. These overdose deaths are  happening away from the national headlines, but they are taking a toll  all the same.   As I said, this is truly a nationwide crisis. It will take all of us  here in Congress coming together to work on a bipartisan basis to find  solutions to turn the tide again, reduce overdose deaths, and put more  affected individuals on the path to recovery.   So what can we do here in Congress in moving forward? What are the  answers?   First, we have got to be able to address both the supply side and the  demand side. This chart lays out some of the ways we can help with  both, all of which I have talked about tonight. This means we need to  complete the installation of enhanced border security technology, which  has already been appropriated by Congress, so that the Border Patrol  has the tools it needs to complete its national security mission--so  enhanced border security.   In March, I visited El Paso and saw fully funded construction  materials laying on the ground, at the border, at the place where there  was a gap in the wall. I heard directly from Border Patrol officers  about the importance of enhancing border security to give them the  opportunity to complete their national security mission and help them  to stop the drugs.   That is why, at his nomination hearing in October, I pressed Tucson  Police Chief Chris Magnus, the nominee to be Commissioner of the U.S.  Customs and Border Protection, on the need to install the enhanced  border technology and complete the funded sections of the wall.   Not only are there physical gaps in the wall right now that we have  already paid for, but there is technology, which, to me, is the most  important part of the wall. So you need the barrier, but, also, you  need the technology to be able to monitor it, and it is only about 10  percent completed in that El Paso sector. That is outrageous.  [[Page S8802]]    Everybody--Republicans and Democrats alike--likes to say they are for  technology. We should complete the technology along the border and help  the Border Patrol be able to do their important job, including keeping  these deadly narcotics out of our communities.   We also must pass the bipartisan Border Response Resilience Act,  which I talked about, that I introduced with Senator Kelly. It would  provide an additional billion dollars to the Border Patrol and U.S.  Customs and Border Protection folks during a surge in unlawful  migration, like the one we are in right now.   Due to limited resources, Border Patrol agents are pulled off the  border to care for migrants, and drug cartels are taking advantage of  these open gaps in our Nation's security. Even some of the checkpoints  had to be closed down when there was a recent surge on the border near  Del Rio, TX. Drug interdiction checkpoints here in the United States  are left unmanned so offices can process more migrant families.   But the supply chain doesn't start and end on the U.S. border.  Criminals understand the opportunities of the globalized world, and  they pose a dynamic threat to the United States. They are smart and  adaptable and can take advantage of the complexity and volume of  international trade and travel patterns, and they do that. They also  understand how to exploit openings in law enforcement and regulatory  approaches.   Many of the ingredients used to make fentanyl continue to come from  China, and Chinese money laundering networks have emerged as key  enablers in the business model of Mexican transnational criminal  organizations. This must stop. While we have a complex and difficult  agenda with China, this issue needs to remain at the top of our list. I  urge the Biden administration to push the Chinese Government to be our  partner in cracking down on these international crime rings rather than  a tacit enabler. It is in both of our countries' interests.   Likewise, the issue should be front and center in our relationship  with Mexico. Both of our countries lose when the traffickers are  successful. Our country is inundated with lethal substances, and the  cartels gain money and sometimes American-made firearms that allow them  to better wage war on the government in Mexico City. For both of our  countries' sakes, we need to partner more effectively with Mexico-- international cooperation.   We should also recognize that these adaptable drug traffickers will  have other options as we go after this current supply chain. We saw  this after the STOP Act started to be implemented and traffickers from  China shifted to Mexico. There is a risk that it becomes a game of  whack-a-mole--when you stop it in one place and it crops up somewhere  else. As an example, as we work to stop the flow of fentanyl  ingredients from China, other countries, like India, could prove to be  good alternative sources. We need to be prepared to partner with India  and other potential new sources in this lethal supply chain to ensure  we continue to improve our security.    We also need to continue to enforce the provisions in the STOP Act to  ensure that our postal service does not, once again, become the viable  option for traffickers moving fentanyl into the United States. After  missing the initial October 2019 deadline for full implementation of  the STOP Act regulations, in March, Customs and Border Patrol finally  began demanding 100 percent of advanced tracking data on shipments  entering the country. That is good. I am glad we got there. That means  that, for every package coming into the United States that originates  from a country like India or China, we have a sense of what the package  contains, where it is from, and where it is going, or else it doesn't  come in.   However, a number of waivers remain in place for these regulations  for low-risk, low-volume, and less-developed countries. These waivers  allow some countries to continue to skirt these reporting requirements,  including, if you can believe it, Russia. It should not be in that  category. This means criminals in Russia can continue to send  potentially illegal packages into the United States without our knowing  in advance what they may contain, posing a significant security risk,  and undercutting the goals of the STOP Act.   Frankly, I think it is an unacceptable oversight in enforcement, and  I believe there is bipartisan agreement that that is the case. That is  why I am urging DHS Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration to  narrow down the STOP Act waivers and ensure that high-risk countries,  like Russia, have to comply with these critical advanced tracking data  requirements.   In addition to this added security at the border, closer cooperation  with the international community, and better STOP Act enforcement, we  need to take the unexpected but important step to make sure that these  deadly synthetic opioids actually remain illegal so that our law  enforcement can take the proper steps to crack down on them. In order  to avoid prosecution, prior to 2018, evil scientists in China and drug  traffickers started making slight modifications to fentanyl, sometimes  adjusting a single molecule and creating what are essentially fentanyl  copycats to get around the law.   While these fentanyl-related substances have the same narcotic  properties as fentanyl, their tiny variations allow them to evade  prosecution. Oftentimes, actually, these simpler substances than  fentanyl were even more deadly. Carfentanil is actually more deadly  than fentanyl, and that was one of the substances that was being made.  Just this past week, we have learned that a fentanyl-related substance  called para-fluorofentanyl has been discovered laced into drugs in my  home State of Ohio, as an example.   To address all of this, the Drug Enforcement Administration, in 2018,  used its authority to temporarily classify all fentanyl-related drugs  as schedule I substances, which allows law enforcement to aggressively  intercept and destroy them. Unfortunately, this designation was only  temporary. We have successfully extended the designation a few times,  but it will expire in about 2 months, at the end of January.   Until we make these fentanyl-related drugs--these are fentanyl  copycat drugs, some more dangerous than fentanyl--law enforcement will  not have the certainty they need to go after criminals moving these  deadly substances, and lives will be lost.   Fortunately, we have legislation, already, to address this. Our  bipartisan FIGHT Fentanyl Act, which I introduced with Senator Joe  Manchin, would fix this problem by permanently classifying fentanyl- related drugs as schedule I. It is about time. That would give our law  enforcement the certainty to go after synthetic opioids in all of its  forms and show we are committed to addressing the threat posed by this  dangerous class of drugs. The FIGHT Fentanyl Act would increase the  costs of fentanyl on the street and would be an important step toward  rededicating our efforts to stopping these drugs from stealing  thousands of lives and causing so much pain.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and  support this legislation to help us reduce the supply of dangerous  synthetic opioids on our streets.   So, again, on the supply side, let's pass legislation to be sure we  are making fentanyl permanently illegal.   Let's look at what we can do on the demand side to reduce this  demand--insatiable sometimes in our country--for these illegal drugs:  more effective prevention and education and ensuring individuals  struggling with addiction get the support they need to overcome the  disease and no longer feel the need to turn to these dangerous  substances. That is all part of it.   The first step, to me, is to continue to build on what we know has  worked. Remember, back in 2018, we actually had the first year-over- year decrease in overdose deaths in the country in about three  decades--a 22-percent decrease in my home State of Ohio in 1 year.  Building on that success starts with building on our CARA legislation  we talked about earlier.   Before CARA, the Federal Government provided no funding of any kind  for recovery support services, which are so essential to so many in  overcoming their addictions. There was also no Federal funding for  naloxone, also known as Narcan, which is so effective because it is a  miracle drug that allows first responders to reverse the effects of an  overdose and save lives and get people into treatment.   CARA also lifted the cap on the number of patients a doctor could  treat  [[Page S8803]]  with a medication assisted treatment called Suboxone, while also  allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe this  medication. All of these provisions expanded access to treatment, and  that was incredibly important.   I remember a father who came to me from Ohio and talked about his  daughter. His daughter had an accident, an injury. She took pain  medication. She became addicted to opioids. She then shifted to heroin  because it was more available and less expensive. She was in and out of  treatment and never took it seriously. One day, she went to her father  and said, ``I am ready. I am ready to go into treatment. I am ready to  turn my life around.'' He was convinced it was true until he went out  to find a treatment provider for her, and as continues to be the case  in some communities--and at that time, before 2018, it was the case in  many communities--there were no beds available. There was no treatment  option. She had to go on a waiting list. While she was on the waiting  list, she overdosed on heroin and died in her own bedroom, and her  father found her there.   So all of these provisions we put in place expanded access to  treatment to be able to ensure that those stories are not repeated.   In the 5 years since our CARA legislation has become law, I have  visited with hundreds of recovering addicts at treatment centers; I  have visited with experts on local addiction and mental health boards;  and I have been to recovery homes and other nonprofits across Ohio. We  have talked about what we can do now to build on the successes we were  having back in the 2018-2019 period, as well as what we did with regard  to CARA 2.0, which is the bill that passed in 2018.   The result of those discussions is CARA 3.0--the third CARA  legislation. I introduced that with Senator Whitehouse earlier this  year, and it builds on the existing CARA framework and expands its  scope to ensure all Americans who are fighting addiction have the  chance to overcome this disease. It does so by addressing three  important areas: one, research, education, prevention; two, treatment  and recovery; and, three, criminal justice reform.   CARA 3.0 will bolster our work to prevent drug abuse--before it even  happens--through better research and better education and prevention.   I believe effective prevention is done when it is at the community  level, which is where it is most effective, and engages a wide variety  of stakeholders--youth, parents, faith leaders, educators--all with a  focus on showing the risks of drug abuse and addiction.   There are now about 2,000 community coalitions around the country  that do this, and God bless them for the work they do. They benefit  from our legislation called the Drug-Free Communities Act, which is  also something that is important with regard to CARA 3.0.   Over 25 years ago, I found in my own community an antidrug coalition.  It is now called PreventionFIRST! It is still in existence, doing a  great job. In fact, I had a Zoom call with the leaders of  PreventionFIRST! last week to learn about some of the new innovations  they are coming up with to reach more people. They do a drug survey  every 2 years--they are in the middle of fielding that right now--where  they get the best information. It is almost like a census, not a  survey, from high schoolers all over the greater Cincinnati area to  find out what drugs are being used, what people's attitudes are about  drugs. They take that and use that to try to promote the prevention  message in a way that is effective.   I appreciate what they do, again, and that is part of what we need to  do in this new legislation, is to redouble our efforts on prevention,  to keep people out of the funnel of addiction in the first place. It is  obviously the most effective way to address this issue.   In our legislation we call for a massive new national drug awareness  campaign as part of this. I believe that ought to be done with help  from the private sector, by the way. There are plenty of people in the  private sector who have concerns about this issue and should. It  affects their workforce.   Certainly, with regard to companies that are in the pharmaceutical  business, they should have a strong interest in this. We could leverage  funding--taxpayer funding--in ways that could create, for the first  time in a couple of decades, a very effective national media campaign  to get the word out there.   We know that a number of Federal Agencies have smaller efforts on  this front, but we need more coordination and a united message coming  from the Federal Government and from the private sector.   Our bill also includes more for research and development of  alternative pain treatment methods that don't lead to addiction. To me,  it is unbelievable that we are still relying on these opioid pain  medications that were developed a couple of decades ago. And although  some have worked on this issue--and I appreciate those researchers--we  need to put more money and focus on this to find ways to treat pain  without the addictive properties of the opioids.   And CARA 3.0 will also take the important step of addressing the  disproportionate effect the addiction crisis has had on certain  vulnerable communities.   Second, our bill will build on what has worked with regard to  treatment and recovery. So the first step is more research, education  and prevention. The second one is with regard to treatment and  recovery. It will double down on proven evidence-based addiction  treatment methods while expanding treatment options for groups  particularly vulnerable to addiction, including young people, new and  expecting mothers, rural communities, and communities of color.   Third, our bill will build on what works and how we treat addiction.  It will double down on these treatment methods. It will, importantly,  make permanent the current expanded telehealth options for addiction  treatment that were temporarily created in response to the social  distancing required by the COVID-19 pandemic.   This is important. Telehealth was something that was a necessity  during COVID. People couldn't come to the doctor for visits. They  couldn't be at their treatment providers in person. And we wondered  whether telehealth would be effective. I believe that for mental health  treatment and for addiction services, behavioral health, that it has  been incredibly important. And although addictions have gone up during  this period, obviously, and the overdose rates are at record highs, my  belief--and from talking to experts I have come to this belief--it  would be even worse if we had not had the telehealth options.   So in the dark cloud of the pandemic, the silver lining may be that  we learned how to use telehealth better. And our legislation allows  that to continue to be used with reimbursement; as an example, Medicaid  reimbursement or Medicare reimbursement.   CARA 3.0 will also bolster the recovery options for individuals  working to put addiction behind them through funding to support the  recovery support services and networks. It eliminates the waiver  required of physicians who want to provide medication-assisted  treatments to their patients and changes the law to allow those drugs  to be prescribed via telehealth for greater ease of access.   The bill will also help to destigmatize addiction recovery in the  workplace by ensuring that one of these medications to treat addiction  does not count as a drug-free workplace violation.   Finally, CARA 3.0 reforms our criminal justice system to ensure that  those struggling with addiction, including our veterans, are treated  with fairness and common sense, putting them on a path to recovery  rather than a downward spiral of abuse.    Importantly, CARA 3.0 funds a Department of Justice grant program to  help incarcerated individuals struggling with addiction to receive  medication-assisted treatment while they are still in the criminal  justice system. This means that when they are released, they have a  much higher chance of success.   If someone is addicted, and you don't treat it, and you let them out  of the system, they are very likely to go back to a life of addiction.  But if we allow medication-assisted treatment in the criminal justice  system, we will reduce recidivism or repeated offenses. I think that  makes sense for the person addicted, for the community, and certainly  for the taxpayer.   CARA and CARA 2.0 have given States and local communities new  resources and authorities to make a real  [[Page S8804]]  difference. CARA 3.0 renews and strengthens these programs. And given  the recent spike in addiction, it provides a boost in funding as well.  When added with the existing CARA programs that are authorized through  2023, we would be investing over $1 billion per year to address this  longstanding epidemic, putting us on the path toward a brighter future  free from addiction.   The addiction epidemic has proven to be resilient. It is a disease  that knows no ZIP Code, and one that is always ready to come roaring  back should we not stay vigilant.   Columnist Peggy Noonan was exactly right when she wrote a couple of  weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal that:         We have a deep and profound addiction crisis in our country       and we've had it so long we forget to see it . . . and       nobody's talking about it because nobody has a plan.    She is exactly right. We need a plan right now to tackle this crisis  that continues to devastate our country. I have laid out one tonight  that can give us some understanding of the magnitude of the problem,  the nature of the challenge, but also have the Federal Government take  concrete steps to turn the tide once again. Again, we have done it  before. Let's do it again.   Washington can and should be a partner to the State and local groups  on the ground every day working to combat this crisis. We should be a  better partner. We have got to all work together to find constructive  solutions to the addiction epidemic and ensure more Americans don't  suffer in silence, that we don't lose more lives to these deadly drugs  but instead ensure that more Americans can achieve their God-given  potential in life.   I yield back my time.                            ____________________
