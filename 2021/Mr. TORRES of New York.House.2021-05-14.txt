 Madam Speaker, in the United States, there  are 1.4 million LGBTQ businesses contributing more than $1.7 trillion  to the American economy. We have a vested interest in sustaining and  strengthening those businesses with equal access to credit, which is  the beating heart of the American economy.   As a former New York City Council member, I partnered with the  National LGBTQ Chamber of Commerce to establish the Nation's largest  municipal certification program for LGBTQ business enterprises,  enabling those businesses to enjoy equal access to a $25 billion pool  of government procurement. I am continuing in the United States  Congress the advocacy that I began years ago in the New York City  Council.   My legislation, the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and  Investment Act, builds on a foundation laid by several statutes and  regulations. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, ECOA, prohibits credit  discrimination, including but not limited to sex discrimination.   A new interpretive rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  clarifies that ECOA's prohibition against sex discrimination applies to  sexual orientation and gender identity.   Section 1071 of Dodd-Frank, which exists to enable and enhance the  enforcement of ECOA, requires financial institutions to report  information about the race, ethnicity, and sex of credit applicants who  serve as the principal owners of small businesses.   My legislation would expand the 1071 reporting requirements to  include not only sex but also sexual orientation and gender identity.  In doing so, it would enable antidiscrimination enforcement where none  might exist.   Even though the United States has made substantial strides toward  LGBTQ equality, the mission is far from accomplished. Seventy percent  of the LGBTQ community remains unprotected by antidiscrimination laws.  When it comes to credit, in particular, according to the Williams  Institute, more than 7.7 million LGBTQ adults live in States that offer  no protection against credit discrimination based on sexual orientation  and gender identity.   Francis Bacon once said that knowledge is power. Knowledge affords us  the power to detect discrimination that might otherwise go undetected.  Take, as an example, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which is  analogous to my legislation.   Both the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and Iowa State  University reviewed data from the HMDA and found that same-sex couples  were denied loans at higher rates than heterosexual couples, despite  having comparable creditworthiness. It also found that those same-sex  couples paid higher interest rates and higher fees.   The experience of the HMDA tells us that sunlight can be a powerful  disinfectant against discrimination.   The Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act would make credit  more accessible, credit laws more enforceable, and creditors more  accountable. It would represent a triumph of transparency in the  service of economic opportunity for all, regardless of who you are and  whom you love.                                time  1300                           Hate Never Brings Peace     Madam Speaker, earlier in the week, a public  official posted on Twitter the following image of a map where the State  of Israel is nowhere to be found. There is nothing accidental about the  omission. Wiping Israel off the map is the objective of the BDS  movement. Notice the image includes flowers to symbolize peace, as  though peace meant the destruction of Israel itself.   When most Americans speak of peace, we mean the peaceful coexistence  of an Israeli state and Palestinian state, not the existence of one to  the exclusion of the other. Most Americans are anguished by the trauma  of Israelis seeking refuge in bomb shelters in the face of relentless  rocket fire. And most Americans are anguished by the deep suffering and  death toll of Palestinians who live under the repressive rule of Hamas  and who have fallen victim to the wretchedness of war.   The rapid-fire rhetoric that we have seen directed at Israel is so  hyperbolic, so vitriolic, that it inflames rather than informs. It  delegitimizes Israel rather than deescalates the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.   Those propagating hate are not part of the solution, but part of the  problem. Hate never brings peace. It never has. It never will.   You can either promote hate or you can promote peace, but you cannot  advance both. Let us not be fooled by the pretense of peace. Let us  find the wisdom to tell the difference between genuine peace and hate  hidden under the guise of peace.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
