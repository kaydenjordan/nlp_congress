 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis  and Honorable Jennifer Wexton National Plan to End Parkinson's Act.   These past few years, I have been honored to champion this  legislation on behalf of the more than 1 million Americans living with  Parkinson's.   I first learned more in-depth about Parkinson's from a friend who  suffered with the disease. When the opportunity arose to partner with  Congressman Bilirakis on this meaningful effort, I jumped right in and  made it my personal mission to get this done on behalf of the millions  of people living with Parkinson's.   Mr. Speaker, currently, there are no treatments to cure, prevent, or  significantly slow down its progression. Parkinson's is the second most  common neurological disease and is, unfortunately, growing and growing  fast.   Mr. Speaker, I will highlight that there is hope on the horizon.  Earlier this year, researchers discovered a new biomarker for  Parkinson's disease. This is an exciting step forward, but much more  research and coordination is needed.   Our bipartisan, no-cost legislation will, for the first time, unite  our Federal Government in a mission to cure and prevent Parkinson's,  alleviate financial and health burdens on American families, and reduce  government spending over time.   This pioneering legislation is greatly needed. This bill will bring  Federal stakeholders and non-Federal experts together to implement a  national plan to prevent and cure the disease, improve diagnosis and  treatment options, and lessen the burden for caregivers and their  families.                                time  1615    The bill's text is modeled off the successful National Alzheimer's  Project model which brought together many parts of our Federal  Government to improve the Federal response.   Once signed into law, this bill will do for Parkinson's what the  national plan did for Alzheimer's and bring together coordination,  care, and research all to help those with Parkinson's, as well their  loved ones.   This will help bring a strong focus on a cure, a treatment, and also  prevention. It will shine a needed light on the suffering related to  Parkinson's.   Sadly, we recognize that environmental triggers are likely a part of  Parkinson's, but so much is still unknown. More research and more  coordination are critical to getting answers to these questions.   I thank The Michael J. Fox Foundation for everything that it does,  but especially all of the work that they provided on behalf of this  bill.   I thank the New York-based groups and advocates who stood by my side  demanding action on this bill and giving a face to Parkinson's. That  mission and their journey was over a series of years.   Together with patients, with families, and with medical professionals  we learned about the challenges of Parkinson's and why this bill is so  desperately and urgently needed.   I thank my good friend, Gus Bilirakis, for working on the National  Plan to End Parkinson's Act with me. It is an honor to work with the  gentleman on this, and I know how much this means to him personally. I  thank him for his relentless work to push this forward. The loss of his  brother and mother-in-law in this last year, indeed, has been a  devastating blow for their family. I admire how my friend has channeled  that pain and committed to making a difference so that we can bring  hope to those with Parkinson's.   I thank Chair Rodgers and Representative Pallone for staying with us  and finding the resolution to move this meaningful bill forward. I  thank Congressman Guthrie and Congresswoman Eshoo for their support, as  well.   Additionally, I thank our committee staff for their hard work on  bringing this together. Special thanks go to Tiffany Guarascio, Una  Lee, Waverly Gordon, Shana Beavin, and Jacquelyn Bolen for all of their  efforts.   From my personal office, I thank Emily Silverberg, our legislative  director, for the resolve to continue until we pass that finish line.   I thank Congressman Bilirakis' team, especially Chris Jones, for her  hard work on this effort.   I also thank our good friend, Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton. We love  [[Page H6919]]  Jennifer. She has been there. She has faced a devastating diagnosis,  and she not only joined this fight but became one of the most vocal  advocates fighting for the Parkinson's community.   Mr. Speaker, as many of us know, Congresswoman Wexton was first  diagnosed with PSP this year which she describes as a kind of  Parkinson's on steroids.   Today and every day, Jennifer gives a face to Parkinson's, and she is  changing the future for those who have not yet received the diagnosis  and those who will benefit from the National Plan to End Parkinson's. I  thank my friend for her advocacy and for bravely sharing publicly about  her journey. I value her friendship and am in awe of her determination  and her journey. I understand that receiving a Parkinson's diagnosis  has got to be truly devastating for individuals and their loved ones.   It is, indeed, incumbent upon Congress to ensure Americans know they  will be supported during this frightening and life-altering time. Our  legislation does just that and offers a dose of hope.   This is a commonsense, compassionate bill that will establish a  robust response to address Parkinson's and ensure that patients and  their families receive the care that they need and deserve. By moving  this forward, we will make a positive difference, improve lives, and  even save lives.   For the millions of Americans living with Parkinson's, as well as  their loved ones, I hope this brings much-needed hope. Hope has finally  arrived. Hope is on the way, and that has been the message of this  whole effort.   To all my colleagues, I thank them for their strong support and  commitment to the Parkinson's community. I urge my colleagues to  support this meaningful bill. It will make a difference totally to  those who are impacted and to the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan), who is an active member on our Energy and  Commerce Committee and a very strong supporter of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from the Commonwealth of Virginia (Ms. McClellan), who is a  great supporter of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Mrs. Fletcher).    Mr. Speaker, this is a very emotional journey, and in the  words of Jennifer Wexton, this could happen to anyone, so any one of us  could be touched by the impact of this legislation that will deliver  efforts to search for better diagnoses, sounder treatment, and  ultimately find a cure, but it is also about hope, and hope rings  eternally here with this effort so that folks like Jennifer will know  and folks from Gus Bilirakis' family will know that America cares, that  she cares deeply.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
