 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, school shootings are dreadful atrocities that are  plaguing our Nation. Nearly 20 years have passed since the horrendous  shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where 13  people lost their lives, yet schools and universities continue to be  soft targets for deadly attacks.   Last year, between the months of January and May 2018, there was the  Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting that claimed the lives of 17  individuals, but there were also shootings nearly every week at our  Nation's schools.   As history has shown us, there is no profile for a school likely to  be targeted. This tragedy can happen at any school.   In 2012, after the horrific shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, the Department of Homeland Security conducted  an internal review of actions that its components were taking to help  improve school security. Today, I understand that multiple DHS  components currently have programs underway to address school security,  but the degree to which there is coordination is unclear.   The Coordinating and Leveraging Activities for School Security, or  CLASS, Act will establish a standing council within the Department of  Homeland Security to coordinate school security activities, plans, and  policies. The coordinating council would include all the key players in  school security at the Department. They include the DHS Under Secretary  for Strategy, Policy, and Plans; the Director of Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Protection; the FEMA Administrator; the Secret Service  Director; and the heads of DHS' Offices of Academic Engagement and  Public Affairs.   This legislation was not developed in a vacuum. Inspiration for this  legislation came directly from experiences of those impacted by school  violence and from the input of New Jerseyans.   Last July, my subcommittee held a school security field hearing in  Newark. At the hearing, the subcommittee heard from the New Jersey  State Police, the New Jersey Department of Education, the New Jersey  Association of School Resource Officers, and the New Jersey Office of  Homeland Security about the security risks the schools face and how  Congress can provide support.   At the hearing and subsequently through our outreach and oversight,  we came to understand there needs to be better coordination of school  security activities within DHS to bolster coordination and minimize  fragmentation.   As a leader in developing school security best practices and  policies, it is important for DHS to have a formal school security body  so that it can provide an example to those on the State and local  levels on how to coordinate the protection of schools.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elder Thyson T. Halley  for his advocacy and service on behalf of the deaf community.   At age 2, Elder Halley was diagnosed with spinal meningitis. Doctors  said he would never again walk or talk.   Despite losing his hearing, Elder Halley has dedicated his life to  helping the deaf community. Elder Halley got his associates degree in  deaf studies, then went on to become a certified deaf interpreter.   His career as a deaf interpreter was inspired by a Biblical Scripture  that says ``go ye therefore and teach.''   Over the years, Elder Halley has led deaf ministries throughout  Newark, Jersey City, and across my district. He is the founder of His  Hands Deaf and signing language and interpreter ministry of Chosen  Generation Ministry in Newark. Through his ministry, Elder Halley has  assisted with taking more than 1,500 underprivileged youth and parents  to Disney World.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Elder  Thyson T. Halley's service to the people of my district.                            ____________________
