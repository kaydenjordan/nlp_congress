 Mr. President, 6 years ago, the Syrian people rose up  against the tyranny of the Assad regime and hoped that the  international community would stand by their side in this monumental  endeavor. Nearly half a million Syrians have been killed by this  conflict. More than 13 million Syrians have been forced to flee their  homes and continue to face starvation and sieges by pro-Assad forces.  Assad's barrel bombs and Russian airstrikes still target hospitals and  schools. Syria's neighbors have provided refuge to nearly 5 million,  mostly women and children. At the same time, many Syrians continue to  risk their lives in an attempt to find safety on Europe's shores.   In the vacuum left by Assad's devastation, extremist groups like ISIS  and al-Qaida have found fertile ground. Ankara, Baghdad, Beirut,  Brussels, Paris, San Bernadino--these are just a few of the places  impacted by ISIS. As long as the Syrian conflict continues, violence  and extremism will continue to spiral out of the region. It is time for  the United States and international community to hold the Assad regime  and its backers accountable for their actions. The Trump administration  should take an active role in resolving this conflict. The Syrian  conflict has many dimensions--leaving this to the Russians and hoping  that they can end this war is not a strategy. American leadership,  along with support from regional actors and the international  community, is the only meaningful approach towards bringing peace to  Syria and its citizens and justice to the Assad regime for its brutal  actions.   I am pleased to introduce this resolution with Senators McCain and  Rubio and Murphy that condemns the Assad regime's blatant disregard for  international law and human life and asks the Trump administration to  pursue a strategy that can help bring the brutal conflict to a peaceful  conclusion. The resolution also denounces Iran and Russia for their  political and military support of the Assad regime and calls for  protection of civilians and humanitarian workers.                            ____________________     Mr. President. I would like to recognize the George C.  Marshall Foundation's museum and library as the National George C.  Marshall Museum. General George C. Marshall was born in Uniontown, PA  to a Virginia family. He is a distant relative of Chief Justice John  Marshall, the fourth Supreme Court Justice of the United States.  General Marshall graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1901  as senior first captain of the Corps of Cadets.   General Marshall served in a variety of posts in the Philippines, the  United States, France, and China, distinguishing himself as a military  leader. In 1939 he was named Chief of Staff by President Roosevelt and  was responsible for building, supplying, and deploying over 8 million  soldiers. Marshall also urged military readiness prior to the attack on  Pearl Harbor.   After World War II, President Truman sent General Marshall to China  to broker a coalition government between the Nationalist allies under  Generalissimo Chaing Kai-shek and the Communists under Mao Zedong. In  1946, General Marshall received the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor.  President Truman appointed Marshall Secretary of State in 1947. In what  became known as the Marshall Plan, as Secretary of State Marshall  oversaw the postwar European economic recovery strategy. In 1953,  General Marshall received the Nobel Peace Prize for his postwar work,  the only career officer in the U.S. Army to ever receive this honor.   The George C. Marshall Foundation was established in 1953 and  officially opened in 1964. The foundation's museum is located in  Lexington, Virginia and is dedicated to educating the public and the  military and diplomatic career of General George C. Marshall. The  foundation has devoted its mission to educating the public about the  important contributions of General Marshall through its museum and  research Library. The Museum has five extensive exhibits and houses  General Marshall's Nobel Peace Prize.   I am proud to introduce this resolution which will recognize and  honor General George C. Marshall.                            ____________________
