 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Congresswoman  Slotkin's War Powers Resolution, which I am proud to cosponsor, and  also to express my support for legislation introduced by Congresswoman  Barbara Lee and Congressman Khanna to repeal the much-abused 2002 AUMF  and to prohibit funding of any offensive military operations against  Iran.   President Trump's incoherent strategy has brought us to the brink of  another disastrous war in the Mideast.   I have seen this madness before. In 2002, I stood here to oppose the  use of force in Iraq because I knew that tragic war was based on a lie.   The Constitution is clear. Donald Trump needs congressional  authorization to use force against Iran.   So I say to you all today: No more lies, no more lost lives, and no  war with Iran.                            ____________________
