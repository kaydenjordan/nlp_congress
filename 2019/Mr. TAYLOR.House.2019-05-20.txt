 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2480, the  Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which includes my  provision asking for a study of forced child marriages in the United  States.   It is shocking to think that the Tahirih Justice Center estimates  that, between 2000 and 2015, more than 207,000 children were married in  this country. In Texas alone, 40,000 minors were married between 2000  and 2014.   I hope we can all agree that marriage should be between consenting  individuals and that children should not be married without their  consent.   I was proud, on a bipartisan basis in Texas, to end forced child  marriages in Texas. I know that States, red and blue, have addressed  this problem and solved it. But we need to work harder here in the  United States Congress.   I am grateful to my colleague from Washington for accepting this  amendment to work on studying forced child marriage in the 43 States  that have not adjusted their laws to end what I would consider to be a  barbaric practice.   I look forward to supporting this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th  anniversary of the House passage of the 19th Amendment of the United  States Constitution, prohibiting the government from denying the right  to vote to citizens on the basis of sex.   In the year 1893, the first attempt to organize the women's suffrage  movement in the State of Texas took place in Dallas with the formation  of the Texas Equal Rights Association. Twenty-six years later, Texas  became the first State in the South to ratify the 19th Amendment.   From raising families to organizing political movements to fighting  overseas, our country could not thrive without the influence of so many  strong and determined women. It is with great admiration that I ask my  colleagues to join me in remembering the pioneering efforts of women  100 years ago that are still shaping our Nation today.                            ____________________
