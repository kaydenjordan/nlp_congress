 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues, and all  Americans, to never forget the tragedy of the Beirut barracks attack.   On Sunday, October 23, 1983, 241 brave American heroes lost their  lives in defense of our freedom. That fateful date, cowardly Iranian- backed terrorists, Hezbollah, drove truck bombs into the U.S. Marine  Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. It was the deadliest single-day attack  against U.S. Marines since the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945.   As a marine and veteran of that conflict, I made a promise to always  remember and honor those fallen. I will always remain faithful to that  promise.   God bless America and semper fi.                        Crisis at the Southern Border     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize just how awful the  crisis at our southern border is.   In the Biden administration's latest show of contempt for this mess,  vaccine mandates for CBP agents and ICE agents will further throw the  situation in flux.   Who is the Federal Government to force vaccines upon our Border  Patrol agents, and all of us, when they are not holding illegal  immigrants entering our country to the same standard?   Sadly, this is another way for Democrats to defund the police, when  too many CBP agents will be fired or forced to quit because getting  vaccinated is not the right choice for them.   I will continue to denounce these lawless and disastrous policies  that are perpetuating this border crisis.             Celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Hoosier Gym     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of the Hoosier Gym.   Before the Knightstown Gym became the Hoosier Gym, home of the  Hickory Huskers, it served the community for 64 years, opening its  doors back in 1921.   Many know this iconic locale when it became famous with the release  of the classic movie ``Hoosiers'' in 1986.   Congratulations to the Hoosier Gym, its staff, and patrons. We are  looking forward to the next 100 years.                   Turning the IRS Into a Political Weapon     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the disturbing trend  we have seen of turning the IRS into a political weapon.   Democrats have included provisions in their reckless tax-and-spending  bill that will give the IRS rogue authority to monitor individuals'  financial bank accounts and transactions.   Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, no one should ever support  this communistic invasion of privacy by our Federal Government.                            Biden's Energy Crisis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the energy crisis we  are facing. The Biden administration's poorly crafted, radical climate  agenda has led us here.   This crisis is already hitting home for Hoosiers. An Indiana-based  energy company just announced that my constituents are going to pay  more for their energy this winter. What was an $88 a month energy bill  will now be $133 a month, a 40 percent increase.   To those over at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who have deemed this a  high-class problem, wake up. You are taxing the middle class through  inflation.    Recognizing the Law Enforcement Community of Indiana's Sixth District     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  work our men and women of the law enforcement community do for  Indiana's Sixth District.   From Muncie to Madison, and everywhere in between, these hardworking  Hoosiers are on the front lines of keeping our cities safe.   Sadly, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to  demonize these heroes.   To put it simply, thank you to those who risk their lives every day  so we can live ours.                   Recognizing Hardworking Hoosier Farmers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our hardworking  Hoosier farmers as they wrap up their efforts for this year's harvest.   These fine men and women are the backbone of the State and Nation.  Because of their dedication, dinner will be on the table today and  tomorrow.  [[Page H5678]]    To those who have been working sunup to sundown to make that a  reality, I say thank you.                            ____________________
