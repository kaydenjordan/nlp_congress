 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to speak on the FY  2022 appropriations package. I thank Ranking Member Granger for  yielding me the time and for her outstanding leadership this year.   I also want to thank my counterpart, CJS Subcommittee Chairman  Cartwright for his partnership over the last year.   Within the CJS title, we've been able to increase funding for the  Space Launch System, the Exploration Upper Stage, and other space  technologies. All are key in our efforts to establish a strategic  presence on the Moon ahead of Russia and China.   There are increases provided to support our communities within  agencies such as the DOJ and NOAA. We're investing millions of  additional dollars to improve our ability to understand and forecast  extreme weather, so that local leaders can help create more resilient  communities, and Americans can get safely out of harm's way when  dangerous weather strikes.   We're increasing funding for critical drug court programs and other  vital initiatives that address the opioid epidemic, as well as DNA  analysis programs that are helping to solve cold cases.   Even as we reflect on the spending priorities within this package for  our own citizens, we must not turn our eyes away from the atrocities  being committed by Vladimir Putin against the people of Ukraine.   Today, we stand in strong support of the people and forces of our  ally. Putin's violent attempt to strip Ukrainians of their freedom will  be met with an even stronger force because of our help.   American strength has long been a deterrent of global conflict. I  take this responsibility seriously and will continue working to ensure  adequate funding is provided to meet both the immediate and long-term  security needs of this country.   I encourage my colleagues to support the security package within the  omnibus appropriations bill and ensure the Ukrainians have the  resources they need to defend themselves from these heinous acts.
