 Mr. President, may I inquire if the Senators are  concluded with their discussion?    Mr. President, I am back again, thee and me once  again together, to discuss climate change as unprecedented wildfires  scorch the west coast and a deadly hurricane season turns in the  Atlantic and Americans cry out for action.   Powerful players outside this Chamber hear that cry, including,  recently, over 200 CEOs of major American corporations who form the  Business Roundtable.   Here are some of the 200 companies represented by those CEOs. As I  discussed last week, the Business Roundtable just earlier this month  called for science-based climate policy to reduce carbon pollution,  consistent with the Paris Agreement, and specifically endorsed carbon  pricing--from Verizon, to Chevron, to Apple, to Wells Fargo, to  McKinsey, to American Airlines, to Amazon, to Pfizer, to Ford. It is  quite the who's-who of corporate America.   So why, you might ask, did the Business Roundtable do this when  normally business lobbyists are up here telling us to get out of their  way? The answer is economics 101. Pollution is the textbook example of  market failure. A factory dumps toxic pollution into a river, and  anyone living downstream bears the costs of that pollution. They can't  use their well, perhaps. Their property values decrease. They may even  get sick. It is basic economic theory that polluters ought to bear  those costs, called negative externalities--the downstream costs, if  you will. Even Milton Friedman, the patron saint of free market  economics, agreed that polluters should pay the costs associated with  their pollution.   For climate change, for the big carbon polluters, this is big bucks.  The International Monetary Fund calculates that fossil fuel enjoys a  $600 billion--not million but billion with a ``b''--subsidy in the  United States every year--every year, $600 billion. It is mostly  because the industry has managed to offload the costs of carbon  pollution onto the general public. Why do you think they are so busy  here in Congress all the time? They are trying to protect that subsidy.   So if it is economics 101 that a product's price should reflect its  true cost, and if, in the case of fossil fuels, they are cheating on  that rule, then a price on carbon pollution, as the Business Roundtable  recommends, is a correction to that market failure.   The CEOs also read the same warnings as the rest of us. Dozens of  central banks, economists, and other financial experts warn of massive  economic risks caused by our failure to address climate change--risks  one recent estimate put at triple the 2008 great recession; risks that  are commonly called systemic, meaning they take down the whole  financial system, not just fossil fuel. Business executives tend to  take that kind of warning seriously.   So this is a good-news story if you look at the business voice coming  through the Business Roundtable. Here is the problem: The business  voice doesn't just come through the Business Roundtable; it also comes  through other groups--groups that are historic enemies of climate  action, constantly up to climate mischief.   The very same corporations whose CEOs sent that friendly message  through the Business Roundtable send the opposite and even louder  message through these enemy groups, which brings me to the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce, by far the largest lobbyist in town, a prolific litigator,  a dark-money elections spender, and an inveterate opponent of serious  climate action.   In a recent study by InfluenceMap, the chamber was denominated one of  the worst climate obstructers in America. In my view, it is not one of  the worst; it is the worst because of the power that it brings behind  its message. If you imagine the Business Roundtable as emitting a  positive political squeak, the chamber can emit a negative political  roar--and they have for a long time.   This chart is a partial list of the companies that are members of  both the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce. I say it is  partial because the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, unlike local chambers of  commerce, is very secretive. It doesn't disclose its funds. It doesn't  disclose its membership. So the companies here either voluntarily  disclosed their membership, or the press ferreted it out. So let's look  at what some of these companies say about climate change and what they  do through the chamber. Let's start here with Johnson & Johnson.   Johnson & Johnson is a giant healthcare and consumer goods company.  You probably have plenty of Johnson & Johnson products around your  house.   Through the Business Roundtable, Johnson & Johnson says that climate  change is serious and that Congress should enact a carbon price. In its  corporate materials, Johnson & Johnson says that climate change is  impacting health and that ``risks resulting from a changing climate  have the potential to negatively impact economies around the world.''   Johnson & Johnson recognizes the importance of government action,  stating:         While companies have a responsibility and ability to       [mitigate climate change], the unilateral capabilities of       businesses are limited. Addressing these issues requires the       collaboration of companies with governments . . . to achieve       systemic change at scale.    So it sounds like the company gets it. But Johnson & Johnson also put  at least $750,000 behind the chamber last year.    What did the chamber just do on climate? It filed a brief supporting  the Trump administration's effort to undo emissions standards for cars  and trucks set by California but honored across the country. Well, the  nonpartisan Rhodium Group estimates that revoking those fuel emissions  standards would result in up to about 600 million metric tons of  additional CO2 emissions through 2035. That is equal to the  emissions in a year from 130 million cars or from the electricity  needed to power 100 million homes.   So which voice of Johnson & Johnson are we supposed to listen to--the  Business Roundtable voice or the chamber voice?  [[Page S5929]]    How about United Airlines. Here is United. United Airlines doesn't  disclose its funding of the chamber, but it is on the chamber's board,  so it is likely a major financial backer involved in chamber policy  decisions. Same thing--through the Business Roundtable, United says  that climate change is serious and Congress should enact a carbon  price, and on United's website, you will find good language about  climate change and the importance of reducing emissions. Indeed, United  has pledged to cut emissions in half by 2050.   Meanwhile, what is the chamber, on whose board United sits, doing?  The watchdog group InfluenceMap has caught the chamber repeatedly  lobbying the Trump administration to unravel carbon pollution limits.  So you have to wonder: From its seat on the chamber board, did United  know about this? Did they do anything to stop those activities? They  sit on the board, after all.   Look also at Coca-Cola, one of our most iconic American brands.  Through the Business Roundtable, Coca-Cola says that climate change is  serious and that Congress should enact a carbon price. Coca-Cola says  in its own materials that ``[c]limate change is already having an  impact on our business at multiple points in our value chain.'' It says  that it is committed to reducing its emissions. But in 2019, Coca-Cola  gave the chamber at least $34,000. It didn't disclose the total amount.   What was the chamber up to on climate? It was in court litigating in  favor of the Trump administration against efforts to reduce carbon  pollution from powerplants.   Now, Coca-Cola and the beverage industry also have a trade  association of their own, which appears from public reporting to have  made zero effort on this climate problem, notwithstanding those  multiple impacts on Coca-Cola's value chain. That trade association  knows how to lobby when it wants to. On climate, it just doesn't want  to.   Let's have a look at AT&T, another one here on the board. I am not  seeing it right now, so I am going to keep looking as I talk. It is  another iconic American brand like Coca-Cola, and, like United, AT&T  sits on the chamber's board. Presumably sitting on the chamber's board,  it is influential within the organization. In the first 6 months of  2019, AT&T reported giving the chamber at least $144,000.   Now, AT&T wants Congress to adopt a very specific climate policy.  First, of course, through the Business Roundtable, AT&T says that  climate change is serious and that Congress should enact a carbon  price. Also, AT&T is a founding member of the Climate Leadership  Council, and AT&T supports the CLC's detailed carbon price proposal.   Well, that is through their Business Roundtable and Climate  Leadership Council voice. What do we hear through their chamber voice?  Well, I could tell you something about where the chamber is on carbon  pricing because, with Senators Schatz and Gillibrand and Heinrich, I  have introduced carbon pricing litigation that is not all that  different from the CLC proposal. Senators Coons and Feinstein have a  carbon pricing bill. So does Senator Van Hollen. Senator Durbin, our  deputy minority leader, just announced one. Over in the House, there  are multiple carbon pricing bills, including one with over 80  cosponsors. Has the chamber supported any of these bills? Nope. Not a  one. Has it even engaged on any of them? Not with me. Not on ours. Not  that I can tell on any of the others.   When election season rolls around, the chamber has spent millions  supporting candidates who oppose comprehensive climate policies. So the  Chamber message is pretty clear: Don't support a serious carbon price.   So which voice of AT&T's are we to listen to--the CLC and Roundtable  positive squeaks about carbon pricing or the chamber's negative roar  against carbon pricing, the roar that says to members here: Don't you  dare?   These companies--all of them--which just said they support carbon  pricing, are funding a group that is opposing climate action and  specifically carbon pricing at every turn--in Congress, in court, in  elections, in regulatory agencies.   I have called out just a few. There is AT&T right here. I called out  just a few companies today to make the point, but every one of these  companies--every one of them--is in the same position. The climate  policy they support through the Business Roundtable is opposed by the  entity they support: the chamber.   They have to straighten that out. Whether you are UPS, Home Depot,  American Express, Marathon, MetLife, Northrop Grumman, Sales Force,  Marriott, Abbott, Morgan Stanley, Microsoft, Exelon, Sempra, Southern  Company, GE, Intel, Citi, PepsiCo--you name it--Anthem, Pfizer, Johnson  Controls, Lilly, Dow, ExxonMobil.   You have to straighten this out because these are big and influential  companies. In fact, this year, the market capitalization of the entire  oil and gas sector dropped below the market capitalization of just  Apple. Quartz reported in June that Apple could nearly buy ExxonMobil  just with cash on hand.   Yet these companies have been mostly silent while polluters called  the shots around here in Congress and for a long time. They haven't  asked hard questions about the chamber's fossil fuel funding, and they  mostly stood by while the chamber--their own organization--became a  worst climate obstructor. I think this is beginning to change.   Last week, I spoke at a CERES, C-E-R-E-S, event on corporate climate  lobbying during New York Climate Week. Over 100 people from scores of  different companies participated. The interest among corporations and  investors in getting a handle on anti-climate lobbying is surging. To  all of them I said: Change the chamber. Get it to follow the Business  Roundtable and support carbon pricing. Get it to come to Congress in  favor of science-based climate policy. Get the truth out of the chamber  about how much money it has been taking from the fossil fuel industry,  particularly for these companies who are board members of the chamber.  You guys have a due diligence duty to know that stuff. Changing that  behemoth--the anti-climate chamber--would be a sea change indeed. That  would help finally break the logjam that the fossil fuel industry has  created here in Congress.   Let me wrap up by pointing out the obvious, which is that time is  running out. If we don't act soon, we will lock in the worst  consequences of climate change for decades. So to these companies I  ask: Why, if this is as important as you say it is, do you not speak  with a clear voice? Why do you let corporate America's most powerful  political mouthpiece oppose you? Look at these companies. Why do you  tolerate that, and why do you fund it and sit on its board while it  opposes you? Climate change is not an issue you want to be on both  sides of, so why are you on both sides of it? Whom do you expect  Congress to listen to? Which voice of yours are we to take as the real  one? If you want us to listen to your Business Roundtable voice, you  better make sure it is not drowned out by the massive business lobby  that you fund that has been our worst enemy against climate action. You  all need to wake up.   I yield the floor.
