 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent,  Mr. Henry Wheeler, who will be celebrating his 100th birthday on  Sunday.   Henry was born and grew up in Buffalo, New York, in the midst of the  Great Depression. He met and married his wife, Betty, just before  leaving to serve his country in World War II.   During the war, Henry served as an intelligence specialist in a  number of major campaigns in Europe. In one instance, he was captured  and held captive by the Germans as he gave blood to a fellow officer.  He was released after the Allies' victory in the Battle of the Bulge.  As the Nazis surrendered, Henry was part of cleanup operations at  Buchenwald, seeing firsthand the evidence of the Holocaust. For his  service, he was awarded both the Bronze Star and the European-African- Middle Eastern Service Medal.   After the war, Henry returned home and cofounded Service Systems  Corporation, which became a conglomerate of specialized service  companies, employing approximately 5,000 people nationwide.   In 1967, he moved to Fort Lauderdale with Betty and their five sons.   He has always paid his success forward, making substantial charitable  contributions to various causes. But in a testament to his character,  he always made those donations anonymously.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Henry  Wheeler and thanking him for his contributions to our country and south  Florida.   Happy birthday, Henry.                            ____________________
