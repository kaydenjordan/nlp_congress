 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today or tonight or tomorrow,  Democrats say they will break the bipartisan streak that has defined  the pandemic response up until now. They are dead set on ramming  through an ideological spending spree packed with non-COVID-related  policies.   This is just what a leading House Democrat admitted they would do  back at the start of the crisis: Exploit the pandemic as ``a tremendous  opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.'' To give them  credit, they never hid the ball. That is how you get a 628-page bill  that costs nearly $2 trillion, but only 9 percent addresses the fight  against the virus itself and only 1 percent--1 percent--for the  lifesaving vaccines that are ending this nightmare as we speak.   That is how you craft a bill that does nothing to immediately get  kids back to classrooms. In fact, that spends only 5 percent of the K- 12 school money this fiscal year.   This isn't a pandemic rescue package; it is a parade of leftwing pet  projects they are ramming through during a pandemic.   There is a costly ObamaCare bailout that will disproportionately  benefit wealthier people; payments to farmers and ranchers based solely  on the demographics of the recipient without any regard to actual need;  and a massive cash bailout for mismanaged State and local governments,  multiple times the size of COVID needs.   Instead of pushing back on the anti-science bullying from Big Labor  that is locking kids out of the classrooms, they buy into it.   They want to create generous new benefits for parents who are dealing  [[Page S1219]]  with school closures but only if they are Federal employees. To all the  parents without government jobs, no such luck.   There are provisions to let abortion providers raid the small  business rescue funds that were meant for Main Street businesses.   They want to pay people a bonus not to go back to work when we are  trying to rebuild our economy.   There is an effort to create a brandnew, sprawling cash welfare  program--not the one-time checks but constant payments--that ignores  the pro-work lessons of bipartisan welfare reform and which the White  House has already stated they want to make permanent.   The unrelated liberal policies are simply endless. It is like they  have forgotten we have a pandemic to fight.   Larry Summers, a top economist in both the Clinton and Obama  administrations, says this plan piles way more debt on our kids and  grandkids than we need to spend right now. That is Larry Summers, Bill  Clinton's Secretary Treasury. Jason Furman, who chaired President  Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said the State and local bailouts  are ``overkill.'' These are liberal economists, Madam President.   By one analysis, the Democrats' extra cash bonuses for laid-off  workers who stay home will result in almost 60 percent of workers  earning more money staying home than they would earn from returning to  work--more money by staying home than they would earn from returning to  work. What a great idea. This isn't State unemployment insurance; it is  borrowing from our kids and grandkids to pay yet an additional cash  bonus for not working.   This would extend deep into 2021, when we anticipate serious job  growth. Just this morning, we had a jobs report that shattered  expectations, nearly doubling the job growth experts had expected to  see.   This is what the Washington Post says about this mess. This is the  Washington Post about this mess that is before us:         For policy experts and even members of Biden's own party,       the improving picture is raising questions about whether the       stimulus bill is mismatched to the needs of the current       moment.    That is from the Washington Post editorial.   It is mismatched all right because it was never designed to meet  Americans' needs. The goal was to ``restructure things to fit'' their  ``vision.'' That is why there was no bipartisan process after a year of  completely bipartisan COVID bills that we worked on together. That is  why the Senate Republicans who went to the White House to propose  working together were told: No thanks; take it or leave it.   This is such a poorly targeted rush job that Democrats can't even  settle on one set of political spin. The White House Chief of Staff is  going around town admitting that they have written ``the most  progressive domestic legislation in a generation.'' That is the White  House Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, here in the Senate, Democrats are  still pretending this is some down-the-middle proposal and lecturing us  for not supporting it. They can't even get their stories straight.   The administration campaigned on ushering in a new day of unity and  bipartisanship, but in 2020, under Republican leadership, the Senate  negotiated five rescue bills totaling $4 trillion, and none of them got  fewer than 90 votes. That is how this Senate was run last year in a  time of divided government, and now, in this supposed new era of  healing leadership, we are about to watch one party ram through a  partisan package on the thinnest margins. Go figure.   Republicans have many ideas to improve the bill, many ideas, and we  are about to vote on all kinds of amendments in the hopes that some of  these ideas make it into the final product. We are going to try to  improve the bill. The millions who elected 50 Republican Senators will  have their voices heard loud and clear.   Our country is already set for a roaring recovery. We are already on  track to bounce back from this crisis. That is not because of this  bill; it is because of our work last year. This is a trend this new  Democratic government inherited. We are going to come roaring back and  mostly not because of this bill--in fact, in some ways, in spite of  this bill. It will be because of the bipartisan foundation we laid last  year and the strength and resilience of our people. Democrats inherited  a tide that was already turning.   We could have worked together to do something smart to finish this  fight as fast as possible. Democrats decided to do something else.                            ____________________     Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: At what time did  the previous vote on the Senator's amendment begin?    How much total time elapsed during the floor vote on  the Senator's amendment?    Well, my goodness, this has been quite a start, quite  a start to this fast-track process. They were in a big hurry. We  started voting  [[Page S1231]]  on the first amendment, as the Parliamentarian said, right after 11  a.m. The Democratic leader held the vote open all day so they could try  to figure out what was going on with their own legislation that they  want to pass only with their votes.   Now, the last time we had a long string of amendment votes was just a  couple weeks ago. We considered about 40 amendments. So if you multiply  11 hours of scrambling times 40 amendments, you would land at about 440  hours. That is about 18 days with zero breaks.   So, look, the whole idea behind this, I gathered from listening to  them over the last few weeks, was to use the crisis to jam through what  the White House Chief of Staff called ``the most progressive domestic  legislation in a generation.'' A little tougher than they thought it  was going to be, isn't it? It turned out to be a little bit tougher.   Well, what this proves is there are benefits to bipartisanship when  you are dealing with an issue of this magnitude. We all remember that  we did this five times last year. We did it together. I think there  were no more than eight votes against any of these proposals. We spent  about $4 trillion on pandemic relief. Every one passed, as I said, with  90 or more votes. Not a single spectacle like today--not one.   Exactly 1 year ago, instead of partisan scrambling, we were humming  with bipartisan work, working on it together. We had a bipartisan task  force building the CARES Act from the bottom up. We passed the bill 96  to 0.   We were prepared to do yet another bill on a bipartisan basis.  Several of our Members went down to the White House, sat down with the  President, laid out a proposal we thought made sense given where we  were now. But, no, they wanted to do it the hard way. Wanted to do it  the hard way.   So now they want to begin the vote-arama that could have been done in  daylight because of their own confusion and the challenges of getting  together 50 people to agree on something when they could have been  doing it quicker on a bipartisan basis.                              Motion to Adjourn    Mr. President, so rather than start the voting at 5 minutes to 11, I  move to adjourn until 10 a.m. tomorrow, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.    The Senate has never spent $2 trillion in a more  haphazard way or through a less rigorous process.   Voters gave Senate Democrats the slimmest possible majority. Voters  picked a President who promised unity and bipartisanship.   Democrats' response is to ram through what they call ``the most  progressive domestic legislation in a generation'' on a razor-thin  majority in both Houses.   The right path was obvious. We followed it five times last year--five  rescue packages totaling $4 trillion, and none of them got fewer than  90 votes.   The Senate wrote the CARES Act, Republicans and Democrats, shoulder  to shoulder. That was the road to real pandemic relief, but Democrats  actually wanted something else. They explained their intent very  clearly: to exploit this crisis as ``a tremendous opportunity to  restructure things to fit our vision.''   That is how you get this massive bill with only 1 percent--1 percent  for vaccinations, that ignores the science on reopening schools, that  is stuffed with non-COVID-related spending that even top liberal  economists say is wrong for the recovery.   Democrats inherited a tide that is already turning--2021 was already  set to be our comeback year--because of the American people's  resilience and the bipartisan foundation that we laid last year.   We could have worked together to speed up victory, but our Democratic  colleagues made a decision. Their top priority wasn't pandemic relief.  It was their Washington wish list.   So, Mr. President, colleagues, I strongly recommend a ``no'' vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill having been read the third time,  the question is, Shall the bill pass?
