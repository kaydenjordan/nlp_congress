 Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Florida [Mr. RUBIO] moves that the       managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the       disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment       to the bill H.R. 1 be instructed to insist that any       conference report shall increase the refundable per-child tax       credit to no less than $2,000 and that the credit be expanded       to benefit more low-wage parents.     Mr. President, this has to do with the child tax credit.  We had a debate about it last week. I want to explain to everybody why  it is so important that we continue to focus on it. Irrespective of  whether we agree with the final outcome and whether the numbers were  high enough in the Senate bill--and I continue to believe they were  not--they are significantly better than the House position on this  matter. I want to explain why.   The loss of the personal exemption hits middle-income families to the  tune of about $600. That has to be made up for. If you add to that the  fact that over the last 15 years because of inflation, the value of the  child tax credit has declined by over $300, that leads you to the  conclusion that the break-even point for a child tax credit that deals  with the middle-income family hit and the erosion of the value of the  credit due to inflation brings you to $1,900. As a result, if you  wanted to actually help families be better off than they are today,  which is the goal of tax reform, the $2,000 amount in the Senate bill  is basically the break-even point, plus $100. The House, unfortunately,  in their bill only calls for $1,600.   The first part of this motion to instruct is to ensure that the  increase in the child tax credit, to our conferees instructing, be no  less. Maybe it is more, but it can be no less than the $2,000 that is  in the Senate bill.   The second part, which was the topic of our debate, is the impact on  low-income workers or workers in the lower part of the income scale-- firefighters, teachers, police officers, construction workers, welders,  home health aides. These are working people, the backbone of our  country, the people who have suffered the most over the last 25 or 30  years, as the economy has made some people very profitable but left far  too many American workers behind. Their anxieties, their daily  concerns, the challenges they are facing really underpin a lot of the  anxiety in our country, both electoral, political, and economic. Their  primary tax liability is the payroll tax. If you make $40,000 a year,  the biggest chunk of the taxes you pay is the payroll tax.   By the way, when I hear people say that people making $40,000 or  $30,000 a year don't pay taxes, they are wrong. They pay taxes. They  take money out of your paycheck. They paid a tax. It is irrelevant  whether it is a payroll tax or an income tax. Those are taxes. When I  hear people say that, it is offensive. Working people across the income  scale pay taxes. Unfortunately, that is not recognized in a lot of the  debates that are going on here about working people.   One of the things the Senate bill does do is it lowers the threshold  upon which the tax credit begins to apply from $3,000 to $2,500. Again,  not nearly enough, but it is certainly better than the House position.  We can't regress on that point.   The second part of this instruction is, it asks the conferees to  ensure that the final bill expands benefits so more low-income, low- wage parents and workers will be able to benefit from the child tax  credit.   I remain surprised that there is not more consensus to support the  reality that we need to do more to help working people in this country,  and the child tax credit is one of the best tools to do it. I hope that  what comes back from the conference committee is as good as or better  than what we put out in the Senate. If it is worse, there are going to  be problems.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.                              Motion to Instruct
