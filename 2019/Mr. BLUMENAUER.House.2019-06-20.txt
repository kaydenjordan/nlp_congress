 Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and  I appreciate his leadership on this.   Sadly, invoking the memory of Teddy Roosevelt is not exactly the best  symbol of conservation. He was one of the people that slaughtered  thousands of buffalo and had trophy hunting around the world.   What is different today is that the scale is much greater, the  populations we want to protect are dwindling.   At one point, we thought there was an inexhaustible supply of wild  animals to kill. Even Teddy Roosevelt ended up supporting legislation  to be able to protect endangered species, which he did in terms of the  slaughter of wild birds.   We have seen these populations drop dramatically.   What trophy hunters do, they kill the strongest, the most magnificent  animals, that if they are left in the population, would promote  stronger herds of elephants and lions.   We are working against ourselves.   For a while here, the Federal Government took steps to limit the  issuance of these permits, which as my friend Mr. Buchanan points out,  even Donald Trump says is a horror show.   Now, I have been in Tanzania recently and looked at what happened on  the ground. If you talk to those people there, their future is not  slaughtering wildlife, it is protecting it.   The photo expeditions where they take the pictures and they don't  kill them, that they reuse over and over and over again, is far more  valuable and doesn't hurt the species.   Mr. Chair, I would respectfully request that we approve the  gentleman's amendment, that we stop this barbaric practice, that we not  undermine the protection of these species, and do everything we can to  reverse the horrific condition they have faced over the course of the  last 20 years.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   This amendment is simple. It would restrict the subsidization of  logging roads in the Tongass wilderness.   There are currently more than 5,000 miles of road that are used for  logging. They are not accessible to the public. These roads are  subsidized simply because the timber industry in the Tongass cannot  sustain itself. It could not exist other than the fact that we build  logging roads for them.   It is a problem on several levels. First and foremost, there is a  long-term liability associated with them. Currently, there is some $90  million worth of deferred maintenance, and if you do not adequately  maintain these logging roads, they become an environmental liability.   But more fundamentally, it is undermining this great resource. The  true value of the Tongass that makes it unique and the true economic  driver of the region is tourism and fishing, which is sustainable.   Alaska has been damaged by climate change more than any other State.  The temperature has risen twice what we see in the rest of the country.  The Tongass is part of the effort to be able to reduce climate change  by providing a carbon sink.   This amendment is supported by many environmental and taxpayer  advocate groups: Alaska Wilderness Action, Earthjustice, the Sierra  Club. But because it is a profligate waste of tax dollars, we have  Taxpayers for Common Sense and Citizens Against Government Waste that  have supported this amendment, which has passed Congress in the past on  a bipartisan basis.   I urge my colleagues to look hard at this unnecessary subsidization  of the destruction of this precious resource making climate change  worse while undermining the values that make the Tongass so valuable.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time each  side has remaining.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, first and foremost, my friend from  Alaska--who is my friend, and I respect, and have enjoyed our give-and- take over the years--misses the point. What I am talking about is  Federal subsidization of logging roads.   I mentioned that there is a deferred backlog that is expensive, that  the logging operations that we have do not recover enough money to  fully fund the operations and the deferred maintenance. I referenced  the fact that we have an opportunity to be able to focus our attention  on things that really do make a difference.   I haven't spent time in the Tongass; I have spent time in Alaska. But  the principle applies in Oregon and other States in terms of heavily  subsidized logging roads.  [[Page H4962]]    Logging roads don't make forests safer. They don't prevent forest  fires. And as a matter of fact, when we look at logging operations,  they are often less sustainable. In fact, logging sometimes causes  forest fires and puts people in these areas who cause fires.   Now, I would just respectfully suggest that what I said about Alaska  being threatened more by climate change than any other, I am happy to  provide my good friend from Alaska the references in terms of verifying  the statistics and facts that I have used, but the fact remains this is  something we shouldn't do, we don't need, and I strongly urge adoption  of the amendment.
