 Mr. President, let's revisit recent history. Four weeks  ago,  [[Page S3900]]  my Republican colleagues were meeting secretly in this building, in a  hallway that the press was not allowed in because they didn't want to  have the press see them sneaking in and sneaking out of this completely  undemocratic process--13 Republican men crafting a healthcare plan to  destroy healthcare for 22 million Americans. That is where we were 4  weeks ago.   We made a big deal out of the fact that is not the way a Congress is  supposed to operate. You are supposed to have committee hearings. You  are supposed to have committee debate and invite experts in. You are  supposed to have time to consult with your constituents back home, but  none of that was happening. No, we had the Republican zero-zero-zero  process: Zero committee meetings. How does that compare to more than  100 committee meetings and roundtables and walkthroughs from 8 years  ago? Zero committee amendments. How does that compare to more than 400  amendments that were considered 8 years ago and more than 100 minority  amendments, Republican amendments, that were adopted in this process?  Zero exposure of the bill to the folks back home and to the healthcare  stakeholders.   Then, 2 weeks ago, we had a draft, and we had a chance to circulate  that draft and get a few folks from home to weigh in on what it looked  like. We received a CBO analysis. Yes, it looked a lot like the House  bill. The House bill was going to eliminate 14 million healthcare  policies in a year, and the Senate was going to best that by  eliminating healthcare for 15 million Americans and 22 million  Americans over a 10-year period.   The President had called the House bill mean, but we had the even  meaner Senate bill. Fortunately, we were able to create such a fuss  that the majority leader canceled the vote--the vote that was going to  take place with the zero committee hearings and zero amendments and  that would give my colleagues the opportunity to go home and talk to  their constituents. But what happened?   Well, in the course of this entire year, two-thirds of my Republican  colleagues haven't held a single townhall, and last week, when they had  a full opportunity to finally take their secret 13 bill--zero-zero-zero  bill--and ask their constituents what they thought, they didn't hold  townhalls. By best count, 2 Senators across the aisle held a townhall  out of 52.   Why are my colleagues so terrified of their constituents? Is it  because wiping out health insurance for struggling Americans is a  travesty? Is it because wiping out healthcare for working Americans is  a crime--a crime against decency? Is it because their bill proceeds to  give $33 billion to the richest 400 Americans? No, that is not $33,000  or $33 million, that is $33 billion to the richest 400 Americans--more  than several hundred billion dollars to the richest Americans overall.  You know, the money they want to give to the top 400 richest Americans  would fund healthcare for more than 700,000 Americans under Medicaid.   Well, I went home. I went to a lot of places. I went to three cities  in what you might call blue Oregon. I went to 13 towns in what can  clearly be called red Oregon--predominantly Republican Oregon. I went  to towns like Echo and Helix; Adams and Athena; Weston and Sumpter;  Granite and Greenhorn, with 37 individuals; and Adams, with a  population of 348. I went to larger towns like North Powder and  Wallowa; and Baker City, Burns and Nyssa.   In six of those Republican towns, I held full townhalls, and what did  I hear? I heard that the top concern was healthcare because  constituents in red America across this country are terrified of the  secret 13's bill and all that it involves. What would it do in my home  State? Well, 400,000 Oregonians under the Oregon Health Plan would lose  their care. At least another 100,000 would lose their care because of  the changes in the way the exchange operates. They kind of put their  minds to work at what the picture looks like from the draft the  Republicans were willing to circulate after we applied extensive  pressure. And what did we hear? Well, we heard that they are very  concerned about extinguishing the expansion of Medicaid. Those are  folks who are working hard but struggling, often in multiple part-time  jobs.    We heard about the fact that Medicaid pays for more than two out of  three individuals on long-term care in rural America. In fact, I went  to one nursing home and asked: Does Medicaid--Oregon Health Plan--pay  for two-thirds of your residents?   They said: No, Senator. Here in Klamath Falls, it is nearly 100  percent.   Realize that an individual who is getting paid-for, long-term care  under Medicaid has to have assets of less than $2,000. So there is no  backup plan. You wipe out healthcare for those 400,000 individuals who  are on expanded Medicaid, many of whom are in long-term care, and they  have no backup plan.   One woman, Debra, said to me: Senator, I am paid for by Medicaid, and  if they cut Medicaid, I will be out on the street. That will be a  problem because I can't walk.   That is right, Debra, you are in trouble, and so is every other  individual who is funded through Medicaid for long-term care.   What about maternity care? One out of three individuals in rural  Oregon and rural America who is preparing to have a baby is funded  through Medicaid. Children and the disabled are funded through  Medicaid.   What do we get as an alternative now that the Republicans are back,  having ducked their constituents? They want a new plan to offer? Well,  they are talking about the Cruz plan. Now, this is interesting. It is a  plan that says an insurance company can offer policies that cover  nothing as long as they have at least one policy that covers quite a  bit, which means the young and the healthy buy the policy that covers  almost nothing, and then the policy that covers quite a bit that older  Americans and those with preexisting conditions need becomes incredibly  expensive because the group in that pool are people with lots of  healthcare problems, and it creates a death spiral in insurance.   Well, at the one end of the spectrum, you have a death spiral for  insurance policies that cover a lot; at the other end of the spectrum,  you have fake insurance because it covers virtually nothing. Oh, maybe  it only costs $50 a month. Oh, isn't that wonderful--until you find out  it doesn't cover a day in the hospital; doesn't cover a trip to the  emergency room; doesn't cover maternity care; doesn't cover drugs. In  fact, it doesn't cover anything.   Why is it that a President who is so concerned about fake news is so  interested in supporting fake insurance?   My constituents back home told me a lot of stories. These are stories  that I hope to share in the next couple of days, but right now, I think  it is important that we hear from my colleague from Virginia, Senator  Tim Kaine, because he has also been looking in detail at this bill. He  also understands what a devastating consequence TrumpCare will have for  American healthcare.   Can't we come together with a better vision? Can't we come together  and make the marketplace work better, restore the reinsurance that has  ripped apart the ability of insurance companies to go into new markets?  Can't we restore the cost-sharing payments that buy down the premiums,  in fact improve them, so there are lower premiums and lower  deductibles? Can't we come together and do a better job of funding  opioid treatment? Can't we come together and take on the high costs of  drugs in general, which is driving costs in the healthcare system? Just  those four things would be something very positive to make our current  healthcare system even better.   Let's work together to make healthcare here in the United States of  America even better, not tear it down and destroy it, as is being  proposed by my Republican colleagues.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Virginia.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Gloria Ramirez, be granted privileges of the floor for the balance of  the day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
