 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding, and I thank all of my colleagues for their comments.   Madam Speaker, I would like to focus my comments on the attacks on  the Irwin County Hospital and the staff at the Irwin County Hospital.  And one of the things that I would like to make very clear is: While I  was not invited to the event at the Irwin County Detention Center that  my colleagues had--even though it is in my district--I was on the  telephone with people who were there at the time, including our local  hospital administrator. I have been to that facility, and one of the  things I want everybody in this Congress to understand is, surgical  procedures are not done at the Irwin County Detention facility. They  are not. They are done at the Irwin County Hospital.   So when you talk about procedures being done at the Irwin County  Detention facility, it is just false. They are done at the Irwin County  Hospital. The detention facility is not set up to do surgical  procedures.   So the question is: How do we get here?   Well, there was a whistleblower complaint filed by a group named  Project South on September 14, 2020. I have a copy of the complaint.  The complaint focuses on COVID and the challenges that the facility may  or may not have had with COVID. And every facility in the United  States, including this Congress, had challenges with personal  protective equipment and COVID, and how we were handling those issues.   Now, in this complaint, which focuses predominantly on COVID, they  make an allegation of hysterectomies. And I read to you from one of the  AP articles: ``But a lawyer who helped filed the complaint said she  never spoke to any women who had hysterectomies. Priyanka Bhatt, staff  attorney at the advocacy group Project South, told The Washington Post  that she included the hysterectomy allegations because she wanted to  trigger an investigation to determine if they were true.''   And the investigation has been triggered. And we all want the  investigation to go forward, and we want the facts to come out. And  nobody wants the facts to come out more than those of us who live in  that area. Nobody wants the facts to come out more than the doctor and  the hospital and the staff at that hospital and the people who work at  the detention facility.   Madam Speaker, I share with you a couple of quotes from some other AP  articles. This is from The Washington Post: ``The advocacy group that  filed the complaint, Project South, did not make the hysterectomy  allegations the focus of its September 14 complaint to DHS, a complaint  that alleged there is poor medical care and novel coronavirus risks at  the ICE facility.''   The attorney at Project South who was the lead investigator for the  complaint said in an interview with The Washington Post that she did  not speak to or identify any women who had undergone a hysterectomy.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Washington Post article.                 [From the Washington Post, Sept. 22, 2020]       Hospital Where Activists Say ICE Detainees Were Subjected to             Hysterectomies Says Just Two Were Performed There                              (By Nick Miroff)         A hospital in rural Georgia where a physician has been       accused of performing a large number of hysterectomies on       immigrant detainees said its records show that just two women       in immigration custody have been referred to the hospital for       the procedure since 2017.        Heath Clark, an attorney for ERH Healthcare, which operates       the Irwin County Hospital, said both of the procedures were       performed by Mahendra Amin, the physician whom activists have       accused of carrying out forced sterilizations on immigrant       women in U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement custody.        According to a complaint filed last week by immigrant       advocates and attorneys, a former nurse who worked at the       Irwin County Detention Center, Dawn Wooten, claimed that a       doctor known as ``the uterus collector'' was subjecting       female ICE detainees to unwanted hysterectomies. The doctor       was later identified in news reports as Amin. Through       attorneys, he has denied the accusations, and calls to his       office were not answered Tuesday.        Clark said hospital records show that Wooten's claims are       ``demonstrably false.''        ``These allegations are disturbing and sensational, but       they are not supported by reality,'' said Clark, speaking by       phone from Nashville. ``Dr. Amin is a longtime member of the       Irwin County Hospital medical staff and has been in good       standing for the entirety of his service to the Irwin County       community.''        The allegations of forced sterilizations received       significant attention from lawmakers, news organizations and       human rights groups last week. Attorneys who represent       several women have come forward to say that their clients       received gynecological treatments from Amin that they did not       agree to or fully understand, including one former Irwin       detainee, Pauline Binam. Binam said that one of her fallopian       tubes was removed without consent.        Binam's deportation to Cameroon was halted last week at the       behest of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.).        Amin has a private clinic near the detention facility, but       the hospital is the only place where such a procedure would       be performed in small Irwin County, Clark said. Amin does not       have an ownership stake in the hospital, contrary to some       news reports, Clark said.        Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), one of the lawmakers       who participated in a virtual hearing Monday to discuss the       ICE report, called Wooten's allegations of sterilization       procedures on ICE detainees ``one of the most inhumane things       I have ever heard.''        Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wrote a letter signed by 173       lawmakers demanding a DHS inspector general investigation.        ``There may be at minimum 17 to 18 women who were subjected       to unnecessary medical gynecological procedures from just       this one doctor, often without appropriate consent or       knowledge, and with the clear intention of sterilization,''       Jayapal said.        In a subsequent interview, Jayapal acknowledged that she       did not know the details of each of those cases, but the       number she cited referred to the clients of attorneys with       whom she had spoken.        The advocacy group that filed the complaint, Project South,       did not make the hysterectomy allegations the focus of its       Sept. 14 complaint to DHS, a complaint that alleged there is       poor medical care and novel  [[Page H5129]]       coronavirus risks at the ICE facility. But it was the       allegations of forced sterilizations that triggered a       firestorm.        ``The rate at which the hysterectomies have occurred have       been a red flag for Ms. Wooten and other nurses at ICDC,''       the Project South complaint said, without identifying other       nurses.        According to Project South, ``Ms. Wooten explained: `We've       questioned among ourselves like goodness he's taking       everybody's stuff out . . . . That's his specialty, he's the       uterus collector. I know that's ugly . . . is he collecting       these things or something . . . . Everybody he sees, he's       taking all their uteruses out or he's taken their tubes out.'       ''        Priyanka Bhatt, the attorney at Project South who was the       lead investigator for the complaint, said in an interview       with The Washington Post that she did not speak to or       identify any women who had undergone a hysterectomy. Bhatt       said she included the allegations to spark an investigation       into their validity.        The legal director at Project South, Azadeh Shahshahani,       said by email Tuesday: ``We have already heard from multiple       attorneys representing numerous women who have suffered       abuses reflected by Ms. Wooten's whistleblowing disclosures.       Some of these women are considering speaking up because Ms.       Wooten courageously stepped forward. There has been a       troubling pattern of misreporting on the health and welfare       of detained immigrants held inside ICE facilities, and we       look forward to Congress, the Inspector General, and all       other relevant offices conducting a full investigation and       applying immediate, necessary, corrective actions.''        ICE said its own records show that two female detainees at       Irwin have been referred for hysterectomies since 2018.       Officials at ICE said the agency would have records of such       procedures, which would require the approval of a supervising       medical officer at the agency. ICE officials say they are       cooperating with investigators.     Madam Speaker, here is another article  from Reuters: ``Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on  Thursday that the government has not yet found any proof of forced  sterilization of Mexican women being held at migrant detention  facilities in the United States.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this article.                       [From Reuters, Sept. 24, 2020]    No Evidence of Sterilization of Migrant Mexican Women, Says Foreign                                  Minister                             (By Reuters Staff)         Mexico City (Reuters).--Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo       Ebrard said on Thursday that the government has not yet found       any proof of forced sterilization of Mexican women being held       in migrant detention facilities in the United States.        The comments came after U.S. immigration officials earlier       this month said a federal watchdog would investigate       complaints made by a whistleblower nurse in a Georgia       immigration detention facility who alleged detainees had       improperly received hysterectomies and other gynecological       procedures.        Ebrard told reporters that 20 of 24 female Mexican       nationals being held at detention centers in the U.S. states       of Georgia and Texas had been interviewed and none of them       had been subjected to such procedures.        He added, however, that an investigation was ongoing as       more women still needed to be interviewed.        Ebrard at the time described such potential abuse as       ``unacceptable'' and said that if the procedures were       confirmed, measures would have to be taken, without giving       details.     Madam Speaker, now somewhere between  September 14 and September 25, H. Res. 1153 was drafted. And I think  that that date is extremely important because the resolution was  drafted before you even went to the ICE detention facility in Irwin  County. It was drafted before you even got on the site to see what was  actually happening. The hospital administrator was there at the  facility on the 26th. And there are a couple of things I want to point  out:   One, the hospital administrator is a lady. She is a good lady and she  is a good hospital administrator. And the doctor is an immigrant.   Now, everyone who came to that facility had the opportunity to meet  with the hospital administrator, and every single one of you refused  the opportunity to get the facts from the hospital administrator.   Never mind the facts. And you wonder why people hate us up here.   Madam Speaker, I have a statement I would read from the Irwin County  Hospital, who wants a complete and thorough investigation: ``Irwin  County Hospital is aware of various allegations of misconduct against  individuals being detained at the Irwin County Detention Center.   ``Irwin County Hospital is committed to the safety and welfare of  everyone in our care, including patients referred for care from the  Irwin County Detention Center. From 2017 to the present, two  individuals in detention at the Irwin County Detention Center were  referred to Irwin County Hospital for hysterectomies.''   You have made accusations of mass sterilization. You should be  embarrassed by your conduct.   You don't want an investigation because you don't want the facts.    Madam Speaker, ``From 2017 to the  present, two individuals in detention at the Irwin County Detention  Center were referred to Irwin County Hospital for hysterectomies.  Mahendra Amin, MD, performed these two procedures. Dr. Amin is a long- time member of the Irwin County Hospital medical staff and has been in  good standing for the entirety of his service to the Irwin County  community.   ``Irwin County Hospital is and will continue to cooperate with any  and all regulatory investigations related to healthcare services  provided at Irwin County Hospital.''   Dr. Amin has only performed two hysterectomies in 3.5 years on  detainees at Irwin County Hospital. This has been acknowledged by  independent reviews by ICH, ICDC, ICE, and even the Associated Press.   Independent peer review has confirmed those cases were medically  necessary.   Irwin County Hospital is the closest hospital facility to the Irwin  County Detention Center.   The CEO of Irwin County Hospital was available to the Hispanic Caucus  during their visit to the detention center. The warden made the Caucus  aware of her presence at the facility and availability and no questions  nor interaction was made by the Caucus. You absolutely refused to even  speak to the lady that runs the local hospital because you don't want  the facts.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this statement released by the  hospital.        Irwin County Hospital is aware of various allegations of       misconduct against individuals being detained at the Irwin       County Detention Center.        Irwin County Hospital is committed to the safety and       welfare of everyone in our care, including patients referred       for care from the Irwin County Detention Center. From 2017 to       the present, two individuals in detention at the Irwin County       Detention Center were referred to Irwin County Hospital for       hysterectomies. Mahendra Amin, MD performed these two       procedures. Dr. Amin is a long-time member of the Irwin       County Hospital medical staff and has been in good standing       for the entirety of his service to the Irwin County       community.        Irwin County Hospital is and will continue to cooperate       with any and all regulatory investigations related to       healthcare care services provided at Irwin County Hospital.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to call up H.R. 8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep  millions of employees on the payrolls of America's small businesses.
