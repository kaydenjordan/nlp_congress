 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, after almost 2 years, Special  Counsel Mueller filed his report with the Attorney General. The  Attorney General sent us a short letter that summarized the major  findings of the report.   A summary is not going to cut it. The Attorney General's own letter  discusses the vast extent of the special counsel's investigation. It  mentions over 500 witness interviews, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search  warrants, 230 orders for communications records, almost 50 orders for  pen registers, and actually 13  [[Page S2253]]  requests to foreign governments. This was an extraordinarily extensive  investigation that yielded a rich collection of facts about Russia's  attack on our democracy. The American people deserve to see the results  so that they can judge the facts for themselves.   We know from court filings, news reports, and the Senate Intelligence  Committee's own investigations that the Russians attempted to influence  the Trump campaign in many ways. At least 17 individuals in the Trump  orbit had over 100 publicly released contacts with Russian officials or  intermediaries. Yet, with all of those 100 contacts during the midst of  a campaign, somehow not one of those individuals--even those contacted  with explicit offers of assistance from a hostile government--called  the FBI to report those offers.   The Attorney General's four-page summary of this sprawling  investigation--a summary that according to press reports may not even  accurately reflect the Mueller report--focuses almost exclusively on  the criminal portion of the Mueller probe and barely mentions the  special counsel's counterintelligence investigation into these  contacts.   The Senate Intelligence Committee--with the only bipartisan  counterintelligence investigation still standing--has documented  extensive efforts by the Russians to reach out to those around then- Candidate Trump. Here are a few examples:   We have documented in the public domain Candidate Trump's efforts to  negotiate a business deal to build what was going to be called the  largest building in all of Russia. He negotiated that deal throughout  the whole primary process. According to his attorney Mr. Giuliani, it  may have been negotiated all the way through the election. The deal  itself may not have violated any laws. Yet, frankly, I think, if I were  a Republican primary voter, I would have liked to have known that my  potential Presidential candidate was still trying to do a deal with  Vladimir Putin's government.   In our investigation, we also had exposed ongoing communications  between the President's campaign chairman, Mr. Manafort, and Konstantin  Kilimnik, who has ties with both Russian intelligence and oligarch Oleg  Deripaska.   Our committee has made multiple criminal referrals to the special  prosecutor based on what we have learned and witnesses' efforts to lie  to us and to obstruct our investigation.   This is what a counterintelligence investigation is all about. We  need to fully understand what the Russians were trying to do, and we  need to be able to warn future campaigns and candidates about the  lengths to which hostile governments will go and the new tools they  will use to undermine our democracy. I believe we cannot make that full  guidance to future campaigns without there being a full release of this  report.   Some observers have said that the report cannot be released without  its jeopardizing sources and methods. Let me be clear. As vice chair of  the Senate Intelligence Committee, no one is more sensitive to those  concerns than am I, but the resolution that we have specifically states  that the report should be released to the public in accordance with the  law. Clearly, sources and methods would not be released under this  standard, nor would grand jury information.   What we are talking about here is basic transparency. Let's make sure  the full Mueller report is released to Congress, including the  underlying documents and intelligence. Then let's make sure the  American people see as much of this report as possible and as soon as  possible. Let's do it in a bipartisan way to protect sources and  methods.                  Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 24    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as in legislative  session, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con.  Res. 24, expressing the sense of Congress that the report of Special  Counsel Mueller should be made available to the public and to Congress,  and which is at the desk; further, that the concurrent resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    In reserving the right to object, I would simply point  out to my colleague from Kentucky that the intelligence community, in  its January 2017 report, reached a unanimous conclusion. That  conclusion was that Russia massively interfered in our elections.  Russia did it in the form of hacking into personal information and  releasing it subjectively, and Russia did it in terms of at least  touching the electoral systems in 21 of our States in  [[Page S2254]]  ways that, frankly, found a great deal of vulnerabilities. Russia also  did it in ways that manipulated social media that, quite honestly,  caught our Intelligence Committee and the social media companies off  guard.   Our Intelligence Committee spent a year in its review of the  conclusions of the intelligence community, and in January of 2018, it  unanimously agreed that the intelligence community's findings were  correct--that the Russians interfered and that they did it on behalf of  one candidate, Mr. Trump, against another candidate, Mrs. Clinton.   For those reasons, I respectfully object to the request of my  colleague from Kentucky.    Mr. President, in closing, I hope we can move past this.  The President himself has called for the release of the report. In a  rare stroke of unanimity, the House voted 420 to 0. I think many in  this body would like to move beyond this issue. The only way we are  going to be able to move beyond this is to get this report released, to  get it out to the American public, and to let those of us who are  charged with the intelligence community's responsibilities see all of  the report, including the underlying documents. I hope we can get to  that point.   I yield the floor.
