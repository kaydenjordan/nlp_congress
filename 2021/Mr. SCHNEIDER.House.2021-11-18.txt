 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Build  Back Better Act that will make transformative investments in the lives  of everyday Americans, all without adding to the deficit.   This bill is good for our country. It will unquestionably enhance the  future for our children, but also improve the here and now for their  parents and grandparents creating opportunities like universal pre-K.   It takes on national challenges by lowering the cost of prescription  drugs and, critically important, giving working families a tax cut.   I have said from the start that I want a bill that will address four  things: climate change, kids and education, healthcare, and economic  growth. This legislation checks every box.   I am proud of the work of all the House committees, and particularly  our Ways and Means Committee. I am also proud that several initiatives  I have long championed are included in this bill, including sustainable  aviation fuel to fight climate change, Health Profession Opportunity  Grants and graduate medical education to make healthcare more  accessible, onshore wind manufacturing tax credits to bolster domestic  energy supply chains, and, significantly, tax cuts through the child  tax credit and State and local tax deduction.
