 Mr. Speaker, LaQuisha Anthony, a  Philadelphia native, was an undergraduate track star at Kutztown  University in my district. Horrifically, in her freshman year, she was  sexually assaulted.   LaQuisha was forced to withdraw from her studies to focus on her  recovery. She faced crushing student loan debt, and when repayments  began, she ultimately defaulted.   Heartbreakingly, LaQuisha's story is not uncommon. Many survivors are  not afforded enough time, space, or peace to heal. That is why I am  reintroducing the Student Loan Deferment for Sex-Based Harassment  Survivors Act to provide a compassionate, sensible exception to the  student loan repayment policy.   This bill would allow survivors of sexual harassment, stalking, and  assault to pause student loan payments for up to 3 years so they can  focus on their mental and physical well-being. This pause is practical.  Without it, many like LaQuisha are unable to return to school because  of outstanding loans, but with time to heal, survivors can get a fresh  start.   Today, LaQuisha is a dedicated advocate in preventing sexual assault  and supporting survivors, including her support of this bill.   Let her work be our light. Let us pass this legislation.                            ____________________
