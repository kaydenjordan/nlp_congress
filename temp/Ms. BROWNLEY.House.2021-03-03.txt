 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the For  the People Act.   The limits of our democracy have been tested like never before,  especially in the last election, where we saw baseless lawsuits,  misinformation, attempts to suppress legal votes, a refusal by a  sitting President to transfer power peacefully that resulted in an  attempted insurrection aimed solely to block the will of the people.   While our system ultimately worked--thanks to patriotic State and  local officials and volunteers across the country--its limitations were  laid bare, for us to fix.   H.R. 1 would shore up our democracy and the people's faith in its  power.   I am pleased this bill incorporates two of my bills. The first  requires all States to offer same-day registration. The second ends  partisan gerrymandering by requiring States to adopt citizen  redistricting commissions.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' for this  transformational bill that fights special interests, takes money out of  politics, and puts power back in the hands of the American people.                            ____________________
