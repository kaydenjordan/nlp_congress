 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3823, the  ``Bankruptcy Threshold Adjustment and Technical Corrections Act.''   This important bipartisan, bicameral legislation introduced by my  colleague, Congressman Neguse, will ensure that our bankruptcy system  works for the entrepreneurs, small businesses, homeowners, and American  families who are the backbone of this country and of the communities  where they live and work.   If there is one foundational principle of American bankruptcy law, it  is the promise of the ``fresh start.'' The fresh start is a  quintessentially American idea. It is the promise that even when your  best efforts have failed, you will have a chance to get back up and try  again. It is the promise that your debts will not destroy you.   By increasing the debt limit for small businesses electing to file  for bankruptcy under subchapter V of Chapter 11 to $7.5 million, and  for individual Chapter 13 filers to $2.75 million, this legislation  will provide much-needed certainty that the bankruptcy system will be  responsive to hardworking Americans and their families trying to stay  afloat in a world that can get turned upside down by global economic  shocks.   We all benefit from the fresh start. When it works as intended, it  boosts economic growth, reduces unemployment, and encourages innovation  and entrepreneurship. This legislation represents a major step toward  ensuring that our bankruptcy system makes good on that promise.   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Neguse and Cline, for their  leadership on this bill and for their work to ensure that small  businesses and families have meaningful access to the bankruptcy  process.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 3823.
