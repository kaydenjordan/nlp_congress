 Mr. President, today I recognize Muhammad Babar  Khokhar, an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work  he has done on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South  Dakota.   Currently, Babar is attending the University of South Dakota in  Vermillion, SD, where he studies economics and psychology. He is a  dedicated and diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most  out of his internship experience and who has been a true asset to the  office.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Babar for all of the  fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
