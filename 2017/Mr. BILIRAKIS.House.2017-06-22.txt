 Mr. Speaker, last weekend, I had the honor of  attending the centennial commemoration of Rose Historical Cemetery in  Tarpon Springs, Florida.   Rose is the oldest African-American cemetery in Pinellas County and  is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was an  especially meaningful ceremony because it was held on Juneteenth, the  anniversary marking the end of slavery in the U.S.   Those who have been laid to rest at Rose represent a major part of  Tarpon Springs history and culture. Civil rights pioneers, veterans,  and many others, including friends I grew up with in Tarpon, are buried  there.   I would like to especially thank Tarpon Springs Mayor Chris  Alahouzos, Annie Dabbs, a member of the cemetery's board, and the  dozens of volunteers who work tirelessly year-round to preserve the  legacy of Rose Cemetery. Because of their dedication, Rose continues to  be a beautiful, historical site for our community.                            ____________________
