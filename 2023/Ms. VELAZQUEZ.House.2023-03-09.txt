 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  resolution.   For 50 years, the Clean Water Act has safeguarded our rivers,  streams, and wetlands from pollution and degradation. Before the  passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, New York City dumped millions  of gallons of raw sewage and trash into the East River every day.  Today, thanks to the CWA, we have made significant progress cleaning up  the East River and the Hudson, so much so that marine life, like the  humpback whale and dolphins, have been spotted in recent years.   This environmental progress is not unique to New York. Communities  across the country have experienced the benefits of cleaner water, but  the advantages of the CWA aren't limited to the environment. The law  has also helped our economy.   Yesterday, during a Small Business Committee hearing on this topic,  the owner of a South Carolina seafood company testified on the  fundamental importance of clean water to his business. Robust Federal  protection for clean water is a prerequisite for the success of  businesses in a range of industries all across our country.    Despite this, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to  allow industries to pollute our waters while shifting the cost of  pollution to families, businesses, and communities downstream. They  want to continue Trump administration policies that significantly  limited Federal protections for clean water by excluding safeguards for  many wetlands and streams.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  resolution.
