 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Bishop, as well as Mr.  Grijalva.   Mr. Speaker, I rise enthusiastically today to support this package  that the House is considering. It includes one of my bills, the Yakima  River Basin Water Enhancement Project Phase III Act. This legislation  authorizes the next phase of the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan, which is  a decades-long effort to address the vital water needs of the ag  community, conservationists, and certainly my constituents throughout  the Yakima Basin.   Mr. Speaker, I have not only worked on this project for the last  three Congresses, but I hate to say it, my efforts go back even  further, almost 30 years, more than I would like to admit, as a farmer,  former State legislator, and as director of the State department of  agriculture. Today demonstrates the closest we have ever come to  sending this crucial legislation to the President to sign into law.   I firmly believe that the Yakima Workgroup and the Implementation  Committee are a model for the rest of the Nation to follow to address  divisive issues. I invite all of my colleagues to come see for  themselves. This group represents a diverse array of local, Tribal,  State, Federal, ag, environmental, and private interests. They have  worked through decades of painstaking compromise, collaboration, and  efforts to find solutions.   So I rise to thank all of them for their hard work, all of the Tribal  leaders, the State-Federal partners, the commissioners of the counties,  conservation organizations, the cities, local irrigation  representatives, and certainly the Natural Resources staff who have  worked very hard on this all along, including Mr. Bill Ball. Without  their hard work and deep commitment to addressing this comprehensive  issue, we would not be as close as we are today to getting this crucial  step done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the strong support of all my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle for this package of legislation that we consider  today.
