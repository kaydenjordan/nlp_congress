 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  rule.   Yes, indeed, we have a responsibility to act. As Speaker Pelosi has  said, we must do this for the sake of the children, and I thank her for  not capitulating to the Senate demands for a blank check.   When I reflect on the number of deaths that we have seen at the  border, when I reflect on the horrific conditions in facilities where  children are being held in ice-cold cells with no one to care for them  but a child stranger--conditions in these facilities are horrific--I  ask myself: Is this the America that I came to as a young child? Is  this the America that my son swore to protect when he joined the U.S.  Air Force? This surely isn't the country that welcomed me as a young  child from Guatemala.   But we must work toward that American ideal that we all share. We  cannot simply allocate funds to agencies where we have seen numerous  children die in their custody.   No blank checks.   No more torturing of babies.   No more separating infants from their mothers.   This legislation brings funds to the children that are urgently  needed.    It brings more transparency to CBP and ICE  and HHS, and it contains important provisions to protect children. It  ensures that the emergency funding that Congress provides is spent on  what it is intended for and not the President's deportation force.   So I look forward to supporting this rule, and I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in doing so.
