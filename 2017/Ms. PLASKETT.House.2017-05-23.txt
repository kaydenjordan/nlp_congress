 Mr. Speaker, today the President put forth his budget  proposal. The budget includes roughly $2.5 trillion in cuts to programs  that help struggling families and elderly and disabled people afford  the basics, like putting food on the table, keeping a roof over their  heads, and affording healthcare.   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, would be cut by  $192 billion over the next decade. Medicaid, the health program for the  poor, would be cut by $800 billion. TANF, Temporary Assistance for  Needy Families, would be cut by $21 billion. In 2014, 20 percent of the  population of my district, the Virgin Islands, received SNAP. SNAP  feeds primarily poor children. In 2013, 19 percent of Virgin Islands'  children were covered under Medicaid. Another 27 percent went without  any health coverage at all.   Mr. Speaker, budgets are about priorities. Unfortunately, our  President's priorities are clear: more tax cuts for the wealthy taking  precedence over ensuring that poor children have enough to eat, that  people with physical and mental disabilities can make ends meet, and  that low- and moderate-income Americans have access to healthcare. The  budget would make inequality and poverty significantly worse, while  allowing deficits, when honestly measured, to soar. Mr. Speaker, we  must reject this budget.                            ____________________
