 Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Granger for yielding, and I  thank Ms. DeLauro for the work you have done, but I cannot support this  bill.   Before giving my short testimony, I would like to quickly  congratulate Lydia Jacoby from Seward, Alaska, on winning an Olympic  gold medal on the 100-meter swim. She is 17 years old. That is  something to smile about.   I want to thank, very frankly, the majority side. Thank you for  getting me elected every time, which you do. Because every time we have  an appropriations process, you add a provision in there preventing  access to building roads in the Tongass National Forest. As long as you  keep doing that, I am going to get reelected, so I thank you for that.   In the over 60 years I have lived in Alaska, I have watched tens of  thousands of jobs in the logging industry and support industries  shrivel up and not be there anymore. These are working American jobs.   The economy in southeast Alaska is hurting, and it is not because of  a poor timber market; it is because of, very frankly, radical  environmentalism.   The timber industry supports great-paying, year-round jobs in  southeast Alaska. Even though the environmentalists have already  succeeded in locking up over 96 percent of the Tongass forest,  eliminating most of these jobs, they are now after the remaining 4  percent of that land mass. Where this idea came from, other than  extreme environmentalists, I don't know.   This is nothing less than economic terrorism, hurting a community in  Alaska, which I represent. It is not just about timber.    Madam Speaker, it is about communications. I can't even  build a road from one community to another community. No place else in  America can that happen.   So I am asking you to continue what you are doing, which you are  hurting my State, but you are getting me reelected, so thank you very  much.
