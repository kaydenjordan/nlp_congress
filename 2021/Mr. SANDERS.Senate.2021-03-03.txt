 Madam President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalists' essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the 11th annual ``State of the Union'' essay  contest conducted by my office.   The material follows:                                 Finalists           Emily Borrazzo, South Burlington High School, Sophomore                          Supporting Our Veterans         Every day, men and women in the military risk their lives       for the protection of their fellow citizens. The ideology of       our nation depends on their service. Yet every day, veterans       across the country face issues regarding claim approvals,       mental health, and post-service employment.        The lengthy claim approval process and 36% claim granting       rate is something that many veterans encounter. The issue is       not the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' generous budget,       but how the money is spent, and the efficiency/availability       of the benefits being offered. The VA should hire more people       to process claims in order to shorten the processing time,       which is currently four months or longer on average. Hiring       veterans in these positions would also address unemployment       issues. Additionally, more guidance should be given on how to       file a claim. This includes identifying the quickest claim       type and specifying what medical information should be given.       Lastly, the VA only approves claims for illnesses and       injuries which they deem to be a direct cause of service.       Extending this to all serious illnesses and injuries       throughout life, or at least partial financial and medical       support, would be extremely beneficial to veterans and could       even improve their mental health.        Studies have shown that veterans have a higher risk for       alcohol/drug abuse, and suicide. One in five veterans suffer       from mental health problems like PTSD, depression, and severe       anxiety. Veterans account for 13.8% of the suicides in       America, and for over a decade 17-18 veterans have died daily       from suicide. We cannot take away their experiences, but       offering more support in their recovery is the least we can       do. Many veterans with mental health problems are not aware       of their condition, or are too embarrassed to ask for help.       Educating veterans (especially while serving) about signs and       effects of mental health problems, and the care and treatment       available to them, could save lives. Additionally,       implementing a mental health scan for veterans every few       years could be very effective in identifying these issues       early on, and opening thousands of veterans' eyes to the care       available to them. Enforcing quality-of-care standards for       treatment in all mental health care facilities would also       benefit the nation.        American veterans receive very effective military training       and preparation, but are rarely prepared for post-service       employment. Studies suggest the unemployment rate for       veterans is considerably higher than their civilian       counterparts. This can be attributed to the rarity of higher       education and the numerous mental health issues among       veterans. Increasing accessibility and lowering costs for       college education would broaden the post-service career       opportunities for countless veterans. Lower tuition rates for       veterans could be paid for by the VA, with the extra money       resulting from having to offer less veterans unemployment       benefits.        Our nation cannot forget the selfless sacrifices our       soldiers and military families make. Brave women and men have       been taking care of this nation for almost 250 years. It's       time we start taking care of them.              LING BUSHEY, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY, FAIRFAX, SENIOR         The sexual health education and curriculum in America is       not adequate to our current society, and should be focused on       immensely to ensure better health in our youth population.       Kids are not educated on the topics revolving around sexual       health, and this leads to struggling mental health effects       and potentially life changing decisions that teens should be       informed on.        Ignorance on sexual orientation, contraceptives, and       diseases leads to a dangerous society, where teens are       unaware of consequences and ignorant to possible solutions of       preventions. According to the USC Department of Nursing,       nearly 750,000 teenagers in the United States will become       pregnant this year; and half of the 20 million new cases of       sexually transmitted diseases will be diagnosed in young       people ages 15 to 24. Being informed about the physical,       mental, and emotional changes in a teenagers' life and       environment will benefit not only the person learning, but       relationships surrounding them for years to come. By starting       to educate kids in middle school will normalize these       discussions to be had later on, and create a more open and       unjudged environment. According to the United Nations,       understanding one's own body is a human right, and the US       needs to address a human's right to learn about their body       and have legislature and youth service providers fund and       educate a coherent and inclusive sexual education across the       nation.        A guaranteed cohesive program or set curriculum addressing       sexual health, will also allow for schools to help inform       kids in the LGBTQ community, what the subject is and how to       respect and support members that are a part. The importance       of educating a positive outlook sexual orientation, and safe       hetero and homosexual activities is crucial. Only 24 states       mandate sex education, which is unacceptable. America needs       to educate  [[Page S1024]]       teens on the opposite sex's changes during puberty, and       normalize these changes as they are inevitable. Mandating       sexual education in schools will give students a coherent       safe space to learn about these topics, which might not be       offered and found from other inaccurate sources which leads       to false information and mis-interpretations.        While this might be a tedious and drawn out process, our       legislature should mandate sexual education across the nation       by making a federal law. This law would teach an all       inclusive comprehensive curriculum across all states. Overall       this would positively affect teens all across America and       would take a step towards a brighter and better future. Along       with this federal mandate we need to make teens and young       adults have access to a planned parenthood or a trusted       medically accurate source to trust and rely on for       information. Especially during these strenuous times during       this pandemic, the availability of these sources are more       crucial than ever.                    FATIMA KHAN, ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR         July 17, 2014: ``I Can't Breathe.'' These were the last       words of Eric Garner. A 43-year-old father of six children. A       man who was known as the ``neighborhood peacemaker.'' Eric       Garner was an unarmed black man, who was choked to death by       Daniel Pantaleo, a New York City police officer, as he       repeatedly pleaded for him to stop.        May 25, 2020: ``I Can't Breathe.'' These were the last       words of George Floyd. A 46-year-old father of one daughter.       A man who wanted to ``touch the world.'' George Floyd was an       unarmed black man, who died when Minneapolis police officer,       Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into his neck, for 8 minutes       and 46 seconds, as he repeatedly pleaded for him to stop.        The murder of Eric Garner, in 2014, ignited fierce emotions       and propelled people into action, all over the country. A       developing project which began as a response to the murder of       Trayvon Martin, was beginning to receive national attention.       It was known as Black Lives Matter. Today, BLM is one of the       most influential social movements today, and among many human       rights issues, it has awakened the eyes of the nation to the       issue of police brutality.        Although we have come a long way in our work against police       brutality since 2014, there is still plenty of work to do.       Black Americans are disproportionately affected by police       violence across the US. According to Harvard T.H. Chan School       of Public Health, black Americans are 3.23 times more likely       than white Americans to be killed by police. In order to       truly combat this issue, there needs to be a reformation of       our police departments.        To do so, the responsibilities of police officers relating       to mental health, homelessness, and drug abuse, needs to be       pared back. According to the US Department of Justice, there       are over 10 million arrests, annually. Only a small fraction       of those are violent crimes. This makes the US the world's       largest jailer, housing about 25 percent of the world's       prisoners. Police departments are overworked and our jails       are overcrowded. Overcriminalization has led to mass       incarceration in our criminal justice system. To address       overcriminalization, policymakers should consider what       offenses result in conviction and prison time, and reduce       arrestable offenses. More resources should be put into       education and training for officers, not arrests.       Additionally, more mental health professionals should be       deployed as first responders.        We also have to hold every police officer accountable to       the law. Too many times, police officers who have broken the       law, haven't faced adequate consequences for their actions,       because of qualified immunity. Qualified immunity has       protected police officers in cases where they have       disgustingly abused their power. Victims whose constitutional       rights have been violated have been denied justice. By       altering this doctrine, we can ensure that nobody is above       the law. Increasing the consequences of misconduct, will weed       out the bad apples in our police departments.        By critically reforming our police departments, we can       ensure a more equitable future for all Americans.                            ____________________
