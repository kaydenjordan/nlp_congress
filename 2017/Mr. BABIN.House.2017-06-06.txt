 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 390, the Iraq  and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act.   For too long, the Middle East--the birth place of Christianity--has  been the place where thousands of Christians have been led to their  deaths. The Pew Research Center reports that Christians are the world's  most persecuted faith community, with Middle Eastern Christians  experiencing this most severely.   In 2012, President Obama declared what is happening to Christians in  the Middle East as ``genocide'', but not much has been done to respond  to this crisis.   This bill will provide the dire supports and safeguards that  Christians and other religious minorities desperately need.  Specifically, it gives prioritized consideration to Christians and  other religious minorities in the Middle East for admission into the  U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, while keeping standard vetting  procedures in place.   This is so important given that less than half of one percent of  Syrians chosen for resettlement between 2011 and 2016 have been  Christians.   H.R. 390 also supports entities that are conducting criminal  investigations into the bad actors perpetrating violence against  Christians and supports groups helping victims of genocide in the  region.   Clearly, persecuted Christians in the Middle East desperately need  our support. As a fellow Christian, I will keep working to bring  attention to the failures of our current refugee program in helping  these individuals, as well as promote efforts to provide resources and  assistance to them in their time of need.   I applaud the passage of H.R. 390 and hope that the Senate will give  it timely consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 390, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to provide  emergency relief for victims of genocide, crimes against humanity, and  war crimes in Iraq and Syria, for accountability for perpetrators of  these crimes, and for other purposes.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
