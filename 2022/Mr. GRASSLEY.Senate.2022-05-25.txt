 Mr. President, farmers across Iowa are finishing their  planting of corn and soybeans. As for the Grassley farm, Robin and Pat  Grassley finished planting last Thursday.   Most people have never stepped foot on a family farm, let alone know  all about the complexities that go into planting, growing, and  harvesting a bountiful crop. That is why I often use my social media to  show my followers what is going on in farming--hashtag ``corn watch,''  hashtag ``soybean watch.'' I like to show how only 2 percent of the  population raises food for the other 98 percent, plus exporting one- third of our production to feed people overseas. Food doesn't just  magically appear on grocery store shelves.   When so few people know what it takes to produce food, we often run  into obstacles at policymaking tables here in Congress and around  Washington, DC. I often quote something Dwight Eisenhower said, and he  said it best:         Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and       you're a thousand miles from the corn field.    There has never been a more important time than right now for farmers  to have a successful year. We are facing a world threatened by food  shortages and food insecurity the likes of which we haven't seen since  the Arab Spring a decade ago, in large part today because of Putin's  unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.   The productivity of the American farmers and ranchers this crop  season will have a big impact on the security and prosperity of  countries around the world, as well as to make sure we don't get into a  devastating shortage of food.   With so much at stake, Washington, DC, must provide farmers across  the country a consistent policy when it comes to regulation of inputs  and crop protection products. One State out of fifty can't go another  direction without bringing harm to food production.   When it comes to the regulation of these products, public policy must  be based on the best science available to make informed decisions.  Science-based decisions shouldn't surprise anybody in this town because  science was the Golden Rule in every coronavirus decision made in the  Trump administration and still being made in the Biden administration.   The best science is why Congress enacted, in 1972, the regulation  that goes by the title of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act or FIFRA for short. Since 1972, FIFRA has expressly  preempted State law, vested the EPA with final authority over pesticide  labeling and the usage of that pesticide. Specifically, FIFRA gave the  EPA authority over pesticide labeling and the usage of that pesticide.  Under FIFRA, it is the EPA's responsibility to undertake very extensive  scientific review of regulated products and then determine what  disclosures, if any, must be on the product labels. FIFRA provides that  EPA conduct studies to determine product safety.   Congress intended that there be a Federal regulatory regime that  would impose warnings, impose disclosures, and impose restrictions on  the use of products under FIFRA. Congress made it very clear that  Congress wanted science-based certainty and predictability for farmers  and the resulting benefit that is to the farm entire economy.   Unfortunately, we have seen politically motivated environmentalists  pushing for restrictions on regulated products that the EPA has  determined are not necessary. This fundamentally undermines trust in  the EPA and trust in Federal regulation of these products used in  farming.   Make no doubt about my stand or anybody's stand here in the U.S.  Senate, we all strongly support thorough vetting of regulated products  to ensure public safety. However, I strongly support ensuring Iowa  farmers have the supplies they need to feed families across America.   I hope President Biden would agree with me. His administration should  be putting forward policies and taking positions that protect public  safety, while ensuring farmers can produce the food that we need here  in America and that we are able to supply one-third of our production  for overseas. As we look at the world with a growing shortage of food-- as I emphasized, partly because of what is going on in Ukraine--we must  then ask ourselves what more we can be doing to support farmers.   Unfortunately, some recent decisions just made by this administration  do just exactly the opposite. I said ``just made by this  administration'' because 2 weeks ago, President Biden's Solicitor  General filed a brief in a case involving widely used pesticides. In  that brief, the Solicitor General flipped the government's long-held  position that FIFRA preempts State law and instead argued against EPA's  authority. So it looks to me like politics overcomes science.   You would think such a significant change would be firmly based on  the law and science, just as I said. However, the Solicitor General  explained this astounding change wasn't based on science because it was  based on politics. Perhaps that is why the EPA general counsel's name  doesn't appear on the brief.   I heard from many constituents about how serious of an impact the  position taken by Biden's Solicitor General would have on the farming  industry at-large. If the Court, meaning the Supreme Court, effectively  adopts the Solicitor General's position and that of the lower court  decision, it will fundamentally disrupt the Federal regulation of use  and of warnings under FIFRA related to substances such as these that  farmers rely on every day in production agriculture.   It is clear that it wasn't the intent of Congress when it enacted  FIFRA for there to be 50 State standards in addition to Federal  standards because we all know the purpose of FIFRA was to create a  uniform regime with authority vested in the EPA to set such standards,  and that has never been questioned until now.   It is shocking that President Biden chose to put forward an argument  that undermines the public trust in the EPA by putting politics ahead  of the longstanding and consistent EPA regulation that enables farmers  to grow the food that we and the world need. This abrupt change in the  administration's position will have serious implications for the farm  economy and our food supply.   Again, there needs to be a consistent regulatory regime to ensure the  public's trust and to support U.S. agriculture so farmers can produce  food, again, I say, that the Nation needs and the world needs.   So I hope the Solicitor General reverses her position, and even if  she doesn't reverse her position, I hope the Supreme Court of the  United States will be willing to hear this case.    I want to now quote Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Peace Prize winner,  I think, in 1970. This winner was born and raised in Iowa:         If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but at the same       time cultivate the fields to produce more bread; otherwise       there will be no peace.    I think what he is referring to there is--at least what I believe and  I have heard--that societies are only nine meals away from revolution.  In other words, if you are a father and a mother and you can't feed  your kids for 3 days, you will go to almost any end to make sure they  get the food. So if you want social cohesion in America and around the  world, we have to have enough food to feed our people.   I yield the floor.
