 Madam Speaker, I would like to address the Build Back  Better bill. Earlier this week the Border Patrol announced that they  had found 557 bodies of people who were trying to get into this country  last year. That is more than double what it was a year ago.   I am shocked that after finding all these bodies, either dehydrating  in the heat, drowning in the Rio Grande, or falling off the 30-foot  high fence, that they still are doing all they can to cause illegal  immigration in this country.   In particular, in this bill, you are still trying to give amnesty to  millions of people, which acts as a magnet for people to come here. You  are still trying to give free college tuition to people who come in  this country illegally, while the middle class in this country--who you  apparently don't care for--goes tens of thousands of dollars in debt to  get that degree.   This is happening all at the time that President Biden is apparently  negotiating giving families, who try to come here illegally, $450,000.   Please, majority party, give up on this horrible Build Back Better  bill, which is just one more effort to transform and change America.
