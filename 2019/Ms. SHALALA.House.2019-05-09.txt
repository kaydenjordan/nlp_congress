Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 357, providing for consideration of  H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act,  under a structured rule.   The rule makes in order 12 amendments. The rule provides 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 2157, the  Supplemental Appropriations Act, under a structured rule. The rule  self-executes a manager's amendment and makes in order 10 amendments to  H.R. 2157.   Finally, the rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on  Appropriations.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the two bills in this rule,  H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of  2019, and H.R. 2157, the Supplemental Appropriations Act.   H.R. 986 will ensure that the patient protections and benefits of the  Affordable Care Act are protected. It will prevent this administration  from doing administratively what they failed to do legislatively, make  health insurance inaccessible for the, at least, 52 million Americans  who live with preexisting conditions.   The administration is trying to coax States, through misuse of the  1332 innovation waivers, to make available plans that don't cover all  of the essential health benefits that the ACA requires, or don't cover  preexisting conditions, possibly with tax credits. This is consumer  fraud. It is a misuse of taxpayer money.   The administration would make it possible for plans to deny coverage  or charge higher premiums based on health status. Under their guidance,  plans could have lifetime or annual limits. They would be able to  charge higher rates to older people than the ACA allows and are not  required is cover essential health benefits.   It will hurt consumers who think they are buying comprehensive health  insurance and then find out that their plan doesn't cover whatever  health crisis they may be facing.   The guidance from the administration is a back door to destroying the  Affordable Care Act. H.R. 986 makes sure that that will not happen.                                time  1230    I also rise to support H.R. 2157. The disaster supplemental will  provide $17.2 billion in disaster relief to communities across America,  including my own State of Florida.   The House passed a similar bill in January, which the Senate failed  to take up. Since January, there have been floods in the Midwest and  tornadoes in Alabama, and we have included additional money to fund  those disasters.   No American should wait for assistance while Congress squabbles.  Seven months have passed since Hurricane Michael devastated the  panhandle in Florida, including completely leveling Tyndall Air Force  Base. It is time to pass both of these bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), the Assistant Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means  Committee.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I am delighted to hear a Member of the  other party defend the Affordable Care Act by defending 1332, the  waivers.   Let me say this: We are not eliminating the waivers. We are simply  objecting to the guidance that was issued by the Department of Health  and Human Services, arguing, essentially, that it is inconsistent with  the congressional intent when the waivers were created.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by 24 health  organizations, including the Cancer Action Network, the American Lung  Association, the American Heart Association, the Susan G. Komen  Foundation, and others, urging Members to support H.R. 986.                                                        May 8, 2019.      Re Letter of Support from 23 Patient and Consumer Advocacy           Organizations for H.R. 986.       Hon. Ann McLane Kuster,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Kuster: Our 24 organizations,       representing the interests of the millions of patients and       consumers who live with serious, acute, and chronic       conditions, have worked together for many months to ensure       that patient voices are reflected in the ongoing       Congressional debate regarding the accessibility of health       coverage for all Americans and families. Today, we write in       strong support of your legislation to protect people with       pre-existing conditions who receive coverage in the       individual marketplace. The Protecting Americans with       Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019, H.R. 986, would require       the Administration to rescind its Section 1332 State Relief       and Empowerment Waivers Guidance, released on October 22,       2018 (1332 guidance). We are concerned about the impact that       this guidance could have on the people we represent and       applaud your introduction of this bill.        In March 2017, we identified three overarching principles       to guide and measure any work to further reform and improve       the nation's health insurance system. Our core principles are       that health insurance coverage must be adequate, affordable,       and accessible. Together, our organizations understand what       individuals and families need to prevent disease, manage       health, and cure illness. Our organizations are deeply       concerned about how the new 1332 guidance will affect the       individual marketplace's stability in states that choose to       pursue some of the policies allowed under this guidance,       including those that promote short term plans and other       substandard coverage. We are pleased that this legislation       represents a significant and meaningful step towards       protecting all Americans from coverage that does not cover       what they need to promote their health and well-being.        As you know, the 1332 guidance substantially erodes the       guardrails governing coverage that people with pre-existing       conditions such as cystic fibrosis, lung disease, cancer,       cardiovascular disease, diabetes, rare disorders, pregnant       women, and many others rely on in the individual marketplace.       Of particular concern, the new guidance would allow states to       let individuals use advanced premium tax credits to purchase       non-compliant short-term, limited duration insurance plans--      which could further draw younger, healthier people out of the       risk pool for comprehensive insurance and drive up premiums       for those who need comprehensive coverage. The guidance also       eliminates protections for vulnerable populations, such as       individuals with low incomes and those with chronic and       serious health issues, by removing the requirement to       safeguard those populations under any waiver. We are deeply       concerned by this as these changes fundamentally alter the       nature of the Section 1332 waiver program and jeopardize       adequate, affordable coverage for people with pre-existing       conditions in the individual market. Halting the       implementation of this guidance will protect people with pre-      existing conditions from the repercussions of these market       destabilizing actions.        H.R. 986 represents a significant step towards protecting       patients and consumers. Yet, we also recognize that there is       much more that needs to be done to improve upon our current       system of care, including making coverage more accessible and       affordable. Up until this year, health insurance enrollment       has steadily increased, and, with it, the promise of a more       diverse risk pool and greater protection for people with       serious health care needs. However, the recent       reinterpretation of the guidelines is jeopardizing       enrollment. Shortened enrollment periods, fewer resources for       outreach and education and less funding for consumer       navigators not only creates confusion for consumers but       directly impacts the number of individuals who enroll in       Marketplace coverage. Without Congressional action, these       trends will make it harder for many to access coverage and       will further contribute to the destabilization of insurance       markets and result in higher premiums for many enrollees.        Making high-quality coverage and care more affordable is       also a high priority for the people that we represent.       Passage of legislation that expands access to and the level  [[Page H3516]]       of advance premium tax credits, fixes the family glitch,       creates a nationwide reinsurance program, and reduces       systemic health care costs could significantly ease the cost       burden for people of all income levels who rely on the       individual marketplace for coverage. We urge Congress to       support legislation that maintains the quality of coverage       while expanding access and affordability.        Again, thank you for your leadership on this critical issue       for people with pre-existing conditions. We support your       efforts to halt the implementation of the 2018 guidance,       ensuring the guidance from 2015 remains intact and promoting       stability in the individual marketplace. We urge members of       Congress to vote for H.R. 986.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Georgia, and I have  enjoyed the opportunity of working with him on the Rules Committee.   We are not objecting to what was done in 1996. We are saying to the  States that they must cover preexisting conditions as part of a waiver,  and they cannot undermine those conditions by imposing annual limits or  charging more. The problem with the guidance is that it gives States  the opportunity to propose cheap plans that, in essence, undermine  preexisting conditions.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It was only 10 years ago that people who lacked employer-provided  insurance and had preexisting conditions could not find health  insurance in many parts of this country, and those who could find  health insurance, too often found that their plans were not  comprehensive. They might not cover the type of cancer some buyers  previously had, or they might have an annual or even a lifetime cap on  coverage.   It was 2 years ago that this body passed a bill that stripped those  protections, a bill that would make comprehensive health insurance out  of reach for many Americans. Thanks to a courageous few, that bill did  not become law.   Now that the administration has lost that battle to destroy the  Affordable Care Act, they are trying to do it through guidance and  through lawsuits.   H.R. 986 prevents the administration from enforcing guidance that  would allow States to use taxpayer money to sell subpar health plans on  the exchange.   The administration is taking the 1332 waivers, which are designed to  allow States flexibility to lower health insurance costs, like through  reinsurance, and using it to take away important consumer protections.  The 1332 waiver requires high-quality, affordable health insurance  while retaining the basic protections of the Affordable Care Act.   As the American Cancer Society notes: This administration guidance  tips the scales in favor of insurance products that are inadequate to  meet the needs of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions.   Madam Speaker, I also support H.R. 2157, which provides disaster  assistance to communities from every nook and corner of this country  who are waiting for our help.   When disaster hits this country, we come together and support each  other. When tornados, and floods, and hurricanes strike, we help people  quickly. It is an embarrassment that a disaster bill has not yet made  it to the President's desk in this Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 357         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 280), protecting the health care of all       Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to adoption       without intervening motion or demand for division of the       question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX       shall not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 280.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
