 Mr. Speaker, feast or famine. California, for 5 years,  had a water famine, and now we have a feast.   I want to shout out to the Army Corps of Engineers, to the local  flood control districts in my district, in Sacramento, the Sutter Butte  District I share with Mr. LaMalfa, and also other flood control  districts. Despite the heavy water flows, the levees have held.  [[Page H950]]    I ask all of my colleagues here in the House and over in the Senate  to keep in mind that we need more flood protection all across this  Nation; otherwise, there will be great suffering.                            ____________________
