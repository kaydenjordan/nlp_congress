 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1502) to amend the Small Business Act to optimize the  operations of the microloan program, lower costs for small business  concerns and intermediary participants in the program, and for other  purposes.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  1502, the Microloan Improvement Act of 2021.   Today, we are considering four bipartisan bills that were approved by  the Small Business Committee and the full House of Representatives last  year. I am proud of the committee's work on behalf of small businesses  and pleased that we worked together to get things done. Our small  businesses deserve nothing less.   I would like to thank the chairwoman, Ms. Velazquez, for giving me  the opportunity to manage time today on these four important small  business bills.   I would also like to thank the ranking member, Mr. Luetkemeyer, who  will be handling the floor proceedings today with me.   Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Subcommittee on Economic Growth,  Tax, and Capital Access, under the leadership of Mr. Kim, held a  hearing on the microloan program, where we heard from a panel of  intermediaries who reported that many of the program's rules, largely  unchanged since 1991, are outdated and restrict them from meeting  today's demand for start-up financing and providing more technical  assistance.   In response, Mr. Kim crafted the Microloan Improvement Act of 2020, a  series of proposals designed to update the program's rules and,  ultimately, help microloan intermediaries extend more affordable  capital to first-time entrepreneurs.   I was proud to support the Microloan Improvement Act last Congress  and was pleased to see some of its provisions become law as part of the  Economic Aid Act last December.   Today's bill, the Microloan Improvement Act of 2021, is virtually the  same as last Congress' version without the policies we have already  enacted into law.   Madam Speaker, we have heard time and again many entrepreneurs lack  the experience needed to demonstrate their creditworthiness to  conventional lenders. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these gaps  in financing, showing the smallest of small businesses, especially  those owned by women and minorities, struggle the most to afford access  to capital.   The microloan program is uniquely suited to address this problem, and  today's bill strengthens the program and is long overdue.   I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As the small business economy starts to recover from the COVID-19  pandemic, entrepreneurs will need as many affordable capital options as  possible. That is why the Economic Aid Act included PPP updates, grants  for hard-hit venues, and other enhancements to SBA's business loan  programs, including the microloan program.   Today's bill takes the next step after that relief effort toward  fully modernizing and optimizing SBA's microloan program. For nearly 30  years, this program has had a strong track record of success and has  helped to launch many successful small businesses, especially those  owned by women and minority entrepreneurs. The record is full of  success stories as the program has grown from a simple pilot program to  a vital lending tool with strong stakeholder and congressional support.   The legislation before us today renews our commitment to startups by  easing access to the program for even more aspiring entrepreneurs and  making the program nimbler for intermediaries and borrowers alike.   Passing this bill will be another step to help lead our Nation out of  this pandemic and build back the economy by embracing America's  entrepreneurial spirit.   I applaud the work by Mr. Kim and Mr. Garbarino for their bipartisan  work on the microloan program. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote  ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1487) to amend the Small Business Act to increase  transparency, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1487         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Microloan Transparency and       Accountability Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. PORTFOLIO RISK ANALYSIS OF MICROLOANS.         Section 7(m)(10) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       636(m)(10)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) through (F) as       clauses (i) through (vi), respectively, and adjusting the       margins accordingly;        (2) by amending clause (iv), as so redesignated, to read as       follows:        ``(vi) the number, amount, and percentage of microloans       made by intermediaries to small business concerns--         ``(I) that went into default in the previous year; and        ``(II) that were charged off in the previous year by such       intermediaries;'';         (3) in clause (vi), as so redesignated, by striking ``and''       at the end;        (4) by redesignating subparagraph (G) as clause (xviii),       and adjusting the margin accordingly;        (5) by striking ``On November 1, 1995,'' and all that       follows through ``the following:'' and inserting the       following:        ``(A) In general.--Beginning on February 1, 2022, and       annually thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to the       Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the       Senate and the Committee on Small Business of the House of       Representatives, and make available to the public on the       website of the Administration, a report on the effectiveness       of the microloan program during the fiscal year preceding the       date of the report. Such report shall include--'';        (6) in subparagraph (A), as so designated, by inserting       after clause (vi) the following new clauses:        ``(vii) the number and type of enforcement actions taken by       the Administrator against noncompliant intermediaries;        ``(viii) an analysis of compliance by intermediaries with       the credit availability requirements of paragraph (3)(E) for       loans in an amount greater than $20,000;        ``(ix) the extent to which microloans are provided to small       business concerns in rural areas;        ``(x) the number of underserved borrowers, as defined by       the Administration, participating in the microloan program;        ``(xi) the average rate of interest for each microloan;        ``(xii) the average amount of fees charged for each       microloan;        ``(xiii) the average size of each microloan, including--         ``(I) the number of loans made in an amount greater than       $20,000; and        ``(II) the average size and charge-off rate of such loans;         ``(xiv) the subsidy cost to the Administration;        ``(xv) the number and percentage of microloans that were       made to refinance other loans;        ``(xvi) the number and percentage of microloans made to new       program participants and the number and percentage of       microloans made to previous program participants;        ``(xvii) the average amount of technical assistance grant       monies spent on each loan; and''; and        (7) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Privacy.--Each report submitted under subparagraph       (A) shall not contain any personally identifiable information       of any borrower.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  1487, the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act, which will  improve SBA's data reporting with respect to the microloan program.   Specifically, the bill would have SBA and microlenders report on the  number, amount, and percentage of microloans that went into default in  the previous year; the extent to which microloans are provided to small  businesses in rural areas; and the average size, interest rate, and  amount of fees charged for each microloan.   These metrics will help Congress and the public better evaluate the  program and its impact on underserved communities and make improvements  as needed.   This program is vital in helping women and minorities obtain much- needed capital. In fiscal year 2020, 47 percent of microloans were made  to women-owned small businesses, and more than 51 percent of microloans  were made to minority-owned small businesses.   This language was approved unanimously last Congress by both the  Small Business Committee and the full House, and I look forward to a  similar vote here today.   The version of the bill from last Congress also included a provision  that would increase the amount of technical assistance grant funding a  rural-serving microlender would receive. I am  [[Page H1768]]  pleased that language was included as part of the Economic Aid Act and  is now law.   However, our work on the microloan program is not done. H.R. 1487  continues the work to keep strengthening the program, and I encourage  all of my colleagues to support it.   I applaud the bipartisanship shown by the sponsors of these bills,  especially the leads, Mr. Burchett and Mr. Kim.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is often said that information is power. H.R. 1487 will greatly  increase the information publicly available about the microloan  program's performance and impact.   If we intend to continue to support the smallest of small businesses,  we need to make sure the programs targeting them are operating at their  best. That starts with improving the data and information available  about where the loans are going, how affordable they are, and where the  gaps in coverage are.   With more data, the public can assess the impact these loans have in  our communities, and Congress will be able to monitor the program and  identify areas for improvement.   I thank the gentlemen from Tennessee and New Jersey for their hard  work and collaboration in bringing this bill to the floor today.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, for over a year now, small businesses in my  district and across the country have struggled to make it through this  public health and economic crisis. As a result of this pandemic,  prospective small business owners face a steeper climb than ever  before.   We must do more to make it easy to start, operate, and expand a small  business in our communities. One of the most important ways that we can  do this is by ensuring that the Small Business Administration's loan  programs are operating as effectively and efficiently as possible.   Today, we have two bills that would do exactly that, including my  bipartisan bill, the 504 Modernization and Small Manufacturer  Enhancement Act. These crucial bipartisan pieces of legislation will  not only increase the amount of capital available to manufacturers, but  will actually ease the process of getting a loan because, in the midst  of a severe economic crisis, our businessowners simply cannot be bogged  down in red tape and legalese.   Taken together, these bills will help to promote the economic  development of small manufacturers, creating good paying jobs in  growing industries all across this country.   To demonstrate just how impactful these loans can be, I want to tell  you about Nate Bry, a lifelong resident of Rosemount, Minnesota.  Thirteen years ago, Nate founded a sports apparel company called Custom  Apparel Inc. in the basement of his home. After years of hard work,  Nate felt that it was finally time to reach a turning point, but he  didn't have the resources he needed to take his business to the next  level. When Nate received a 504 loan, he was immediately able to invest  in his company, building a facility to manufacture his products right  in his hometown, creating good-paying jobs in the very same community  where he grew up.   Nate's story, like so many others, is proof that the 504 loan program  can change the lives of small business owners in this country. This  program ensures that small businesses like Nate's are able to succeed,  bringing home the job growth and economic stability that our  communities are striving for, especially as we emerge from this  devastating economic crisis.   Because these are not simply businesses. These are livelihoods,  family traditions, and priceless contributions to our communities, and  we have an opportunity to support them on a bipartisan basis by taking  action today.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to come together and join  me in supporting these bills and businesses across our Nation.
