 Madam Speaker, on December 5, Minnesotans learned of the  disappearance of a Minnesota National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter  carrying three National Guardsmen during a maintenance test flight.   Unfortunately, this fateful flight, which originated from St. Cloud,  Minnesota, saw the lives of Chief Warrant Officer 2 James A. Rogers,  Jr., Chief Warrant Officer 2 Charles P. Nord, and Sergeant Kort M.  Plantenberg all tragically lost that day.   Today my colleagues and I join together to honor the memories of  these brave Minnesotans and to send our deepest sympathies to their  families and loved ones.   Whether deployed overseas or training here at home, members of our  Armed Forces routinely put their lives at risk to ensure the safety and  security of our Nation.   We pray these families are able to find some peace and comfort during  this tragic time and that they know that their fellow Minnesotans and  their Nation mourn with them.   We are eternally grateful for their loved ones' sacrifice and service  to our great State of Minnesota and to the Nation. Their memories and  legacies will never be forgotten.   In honor of James A. Rogers, Jr., Charles P. Nord, and Kort M.  Plantenberg, I ask that all Members and guests in the gallery rise for  a moment of silence to honor these heroes.                            ____________________
