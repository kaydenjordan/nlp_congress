 Amendment XX, section 1:   ``The terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon  on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and  Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which  such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and  the terms of their successors shall then begin.''   Section 2:   ``The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such  meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall  by law appoint a different day.''   Section 3:   ``If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the  President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President  elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen  before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the  President elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President  elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified;  and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a  President elect nor a Vice President shall have qualified, declaring  who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to  act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a  President or Vice President shall have qualified.''
