 Mr. Speaker, I oppose this highly partisan and divisive  legislation.   In Colorado alone, this bill puts 700,000 acres into the most  restrictive land use category of all--wilderness. I know the intent of  the sponsors is to protect the land, but in practice, the use of land  under wilderness designation is so restrictive, hardly anyone can use  it.   Do you dream of taking your kids or grandkids for a bike ride on  wilderness land someday? Forget about it. Bicycles are prohibited by  BLM in wilderness land as well as motorized vehicles, roads,  wheelbarrows, and carts. The land is locked away from future  generations.   I prefer public lands with many uses, and that is where this bill  fails our children. You can't even take a baby onto wilderness land in  a stroller.   Do you care about the health of our forests? Then don't vote for this  bill. The most basic types of preventive maintenance are illegal under  wilderness designation. You can't take a chain saw and cut away fire  traps, and you can't trim branches or overgrown timber stands and  underbrush.   Colorado has had too many forest fires, and with beetle kill, parts  of Colorado are a tinderbox. Should this become law, with its  restrictions on fire prevention, we are going to see bigger and hotter  fires in Colorado than ever before. I don't want to see Colorado burn  up. That is why I am voting ``no'' on this bill.   Many county commissioners, individual citizens, and even the U.S.  Representative for western Colorado oppose this bill. Like me, they  don't want to see the public lose access to wilderness areas, and they  don't want to see our forests go up in flames. Vote ``no'' on this  bill.                                time  1745
