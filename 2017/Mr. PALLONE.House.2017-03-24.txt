 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague, my chairman, Greg Walden, that  his vote for this bill will result in 64,300 people from his  congressional district in Oregon losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump and congressional Republicans are not  leveling with the American people when they say no one will be worse  off under this repeal bill. TrumpCare dismantles the health and  economic security that millions of hardworking Americans have gained  over the last 7 years, and it should be defeated.   There is a reason this bill was hatched up in the back rooms only to  be finalized last night, and that is because congressional Republicans  did not want the American people to see what was in it.   TrumpCare provides less coverage, fewer protections, and higher  costs.   TrumpCare is Robin Hood in reverse, taking benefits and financial  assistance from hardworking, middle class Americans and our most  vulnerable in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest and the  corporations.   TrumpCare cuts a combined $1 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid.  These cuts are devastating, Mr. Speaker.   TrumpCare will ration care for the 76 million Americans who rely on  Medicaid, including seniors with long-term care needs, Americans with  disabilities, pregnant women, and vulnerable children.   I fear for seniors, Mr. Speaker, those in nursing homes. When States  get less money, what will they do? They will give less money to nursing  homes. We will go back to the days that I remember in New Jersey when  nursing homes were terrible places, where there weren't enough nurses,  where there were fires because of lack of maintenance of the nursing  home.   Working families are going to pay more for less. They will see their  premiums and deductibles skyrocket. My GOP colleagues talk about high  deductibles and copays. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.   You are going to see that this repeal repeals the limits on  deductibles and copays that exist under the current law. Out-of-pocket  costs are going to go through the roof. The deductibles will go even  higher. The copays will go even higher. The out-of-pocket costs will go  even higher.    And the bottom line is Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 will  pay an age tax and be forced to pay premiums five times higher than  what younger people pay for their coverage.   I have heard my colleagues on the other side say, well, that is only  fair. Well, I don't think it is fair that seniors should have to pay a  lot more, that those between 50 and 64 should have to pay a lot more.   Also, TrumpCare leaves the sickest and vulnerable Americans at the  mercy of insurance companies, allowing them to charge a 30 percent  penalty or sick tax to those who are unable to maintain continuous  coverage. So if you fail to pay your insurance for a month and then you  want to get it again, even if you have a preexisting condition, which  is often the case, you are going to pay a 30 percent penalty, or sick  tax. I don't think that is very fair.   Last night, in order to garner votes from the extreme right in their  party, House Republicans added a provision that eliminates protections  for essential health benefits. Now, maybe people don't understand that,  but let me explain it.  [[Page H2416]]    The ACA ensured that, when a consumer purchased health insurance on  the individual market or gained coverage through Medicaid expansion,  their plan would cover 10 critical, essential benefits.   TrumpCare eliminates this guarantee, meaning that unscrupulous  insurance companies can sell skeletal plans, junk insurance, without  benefits for hospitalization, maternity care, mental health, drug  treatment services, and Americans won't even know what they are  getting. They won't realize that they have worthless insurance until  they get sick and it is too late.   The bottom line is this bill should be defeated for so many reasons  because so many more people will not have health insurance, because  their costs are going to go up, and because they won't even know what  insurance they are buying. We are going go to back to the old days of  the Wild West when insurance companies could sell whatever junk  insurance they want and the public won't even know what they are  getting. It is a disaster for the American people.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that, in Mr. Barton's  case, his vote for this bill will result in 64,900 people from his  congressional district in Texas losing health coverage and care.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Michigan that  his vote for this bill will result in 43,500 people from his  congressional district in Michigan losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Mississippi that  his vote for this bill will result in 69,600 people from his  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene  Green), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend from Kentucky that his  vote for this bill will result in 44,000 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.  DeGette).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Indiana that his  vote for this bill will result in 37,800 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Michael F. Doyle).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Texas that his  vote for this bill will result in 61,900 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Indiana that her  vote for this bill will result in 37,700 people from her congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor), the vice ranking member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from New York that  his vote for this bill will result in 58,000 people from his  congressional district losing healthcare coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Michigan that  his vote for this bill will result in 39,500 people from his  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Georgia that his  vote for this bill will result in 62,800 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from North Carolina  that her vote for this bill will result in 80,600 people from her  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray  Lujan).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Pennsylvania  that his vote for this bill will result in 37,100 people from his  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Clarke).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides?    Mr. Speaker, what did the Chair say?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Loebsack).    Mr. Speaker, could we just ask the total because then  maybe we can figure it out on the minority side?    What is the total time remaining currently?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, Chairman Walden is completely  mischaracterizing the bill that was led by Mr. Cardenas.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is very telling that the gentleman from  Oregon has no more speakers on his side for what they claim to be a  very significant bill, and it certainly is significant; but the reason  for that, in my opinion, is because this Republican bill is hurting  real people.  [[Page H2424]]    Don't tell the real people, don't tell the Americans in my district  or the rest of the country who are coming to your doors and going to  your legislative offices and calling you by the thousands to tell you  not to pass this bill, don't tell them your answer that I hear over and  over again: Well, trust us. Trust us.   The problem is we have to look at the bill that is before us today.  This is a terrible bill. Millions of people, 24 million people, are  going to lose their insurance. Many more are going to pay a lot more  out of pocket with higher deductibles and higher copays.   And the worst part of all is you are allowing the insurance companies  to sell junk insurance that doesn't even cover their care; it doesn't  even necessarily provide any coverage.   So I ask my colleagues on the other side, think of the people. Think  about your heart. Think about what this really means. And if you look  at it, you will know that this is a bad bill and should be defeated.   Vote ``no.'' I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 24, 2017, on page H2424, the following appeared: Mr.  Speaker, I yield back the balance      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, I  reserve the balance    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), and I ask unanimous consent  that he be allowed to control that time.
