 Madam Speaker, when we heard of the Muslim ban being  implemented, many New Yorkers, including our chairman, Congressman  Nadler, rushed to JFK Airport to help families. What I witnessed there  in many cases was, in fact, Muslim members of our Armed Forces were  trying to be reunited with their mother, with their spouse, and they  were being denied.   As I entered the space, I was surrounded by Customs and Border Patrol  officers, and we fought to make sure that these folks could unite. And  so we witnessed the pain of a spouse without a husband, a son without a  mother, a father without a child.   Madam Speaker, this is not American. This is not American at all. But  what was witnessed there and across the country was the best of our  Nation, the spirit of our Nation, the fact that we would not be split  along racial, ethnic, or religious lines.    Madam Speaker, I represent the 13th Congressional  District in New York. It has many wonderful neighborhoods in it, the  iconic neighborhood of Harlem, which has given birth to many  luminaries, including the great late Adam Powell and, of course, the  Lion of Lenox Avenue, Charles B. Rangel.   But when I came here, Madam Speaker, there sat John Lewis in his  dignified serenity. He brought to this Chamber and he bore the wounds  and the scars of a struggle over 400 years old, and they could not be  ignored.   Even in his dignified serenity, beyond his great words that were  conciliatory and peaceful in scope, the scars and the wounds of the  struggle that he bore in this august Chamber could not be ignored.                                time  2130    So, Madam Speaker, I say to John Lewis today, that from Harlem, and  from all the Harlems in all the States of this great Union, a very  important message I bring to this floor.   Rest in peace, great warrior.
