 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Randall Edwards, a  veteran of World War II, who this month turns 102 years old.   Edwards enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1935, at 18 years old, and  served as a first class radioman for the USS Canopus in the  Philippines. He then joined Allied ground forces, where he and his unit  were captured and sent to a Japanese prison camp.   He spent 3 years as a prisoner of war, and despite being forced to  work 7 days a week in appalling conditions and becoming nearly deaf due  to abuse, he never allowed his spirit to be broken. In fact, after the  war, he reenlisted in the Navy and was sent to Japan to serve in the  U.S. occupying force. Edwards later became a national service officer  for the American Ex-Prisoners of War organization, helping other  veterans reintegrate.   Warrant Officer Edwards survived some of the worst of World War II,  and he persevered through captivity and returned to bring democracy to  his captors. Mr. Edwards represents the greatest of our Greatest  Generation, and on behalf of a grateful nation, I say thank you.                            ____________________
