 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Joe Allen from Folkston, Georgia, who sadly passed away on  November 13 at the age of 74. After graduating from Charlton County  High School in 1965, Joe earned a bachelor of science in forestry at  the University of Georgia.   Following his graduation, Joe began a successful career in the  forestry and logging industry where he served as a strong advocate for  the industry in southeast Georgia. During his time as the executive  director of Southeastern Wood Producers, Joe played a vital role in  shaping legislation that benefited loggers throughout the United  States. A faithful member of the First Baptist Church of Folkston, Joe  served as head deacon and a dedicated Sunday school teacher.   Known as a reliable friend with exceptional character and unwavering  faith, Joe's service to his community is truly remarkable. I am  grateful for Joe's service, and I know his memory will always be  cherished.   My thoughts and prayers are with all who knew him during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  National Bible Week and in celebration of my faith and of our Lord and  Savior, Jesus Christ, the living God.   Last week, we got to spend time with our families as we celebrated  the Thanksgiving holiday, and I was able to use that time for  reflection. Recently, my family had the privilege of welcoming our  sixth grandchild into the family. On October 28, Mary Emma Carter was  born.   Psalm 127:3 tells us that ``children are a gift from the Lord; they  are reward from Him.''   Spending time with my grandchildren is my opportunity for me to  witness true innocence, untouched by the evils of the world, as well as  unconditional love. In moments such as these, we are reconnected with  the true beauty and splendor of our Lord in His grand design.   In Matthew 19:14, Jesus tells an audience: ``Let the little children  come to me and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to  such as these.''   We are called to love one another as children do, to emulate this  mindset, especially when it is difficult to do so.   This past year has been difficult for many Americans. In this time of  struggle, discourse, and many disagreements, I find comfort in the  Bible, which serves as a reminder of God's love for all of His  children. It is this love that guided our Nation through the darkest  days of the pandemic, where nurses and doctors selflessly sacrificed  their own safety for their neighbor's health and protection.   It is this love that drives our men and women in blue to risk their  lives to defend, to protect ourselves and others. And it is this love  that will fill our homes this Christmas as we gather to celebrate the  Savior of the world and His ultimate sacrifice for our salvation. Mary  Margaret, Adalay, Christopher, Bennett, Catherine, and Mary Emma, I  love you, your Mamie loves you, and God loves you.
