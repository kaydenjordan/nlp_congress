 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill is unnecessary because the Department of Energy is  aggressively approving liquefied natural gas exports. DOE currently  conducts a public interest review of all applications to export LNG to  a country without a free trade agreement with the United States, and  this process is working just fine.   To date, DOE has granted final approval for 29 applications to export  LNG. Over the past few years, the U.S. has emerged as one of the  largest exporters in the world.   There is no backlog of applications or delay at DOE to speak of, and  the Trump administration has taken every opportunity to promote U.S.  natural gas abroad.   In July, the Department of Energy finalized a rule to automatically  approve applications to export less than 0.14 billion cubic feet per  day of LNG. It declares in this rule that all small-scale exports are  always in the public interest, removes longstanding consumer  protections of the Natural Gas Act, prevents the public from having the  opportunity to know about or provide input on export proposals, and  violates the public hearing requirements of the Natural Gas Act.   Rather than stand up for American consumers and manufacturers who  benefit from low natural gas prices, the Trump administration is  boosting the profits of oil and gas special interests by allowing them  to export LNG without any regard for domestic impacts.   This bill is intended to codify DOE's small-scale LNG rule, but  proponents have not justified the need for swift congressional action  on a rule that was just finalized.   There are drawbacks to codifying the rule with such a prescriptive  volume requirement. For example, should the circumstances arise where  exporting this amount of LNG is no longer in the public interest,  Congress would then have to enact a new law to make any necessary  changes.   In addition, Madam Chair, an unrestricted export policy could lead to  even higher levels of LNG exports, which could have significant impacts  [[Page H7888]]  on domestic natural gas prices and adversely affect American consumers  and manufacturers.   Unfettered exports would also exacerbate climate change by  encouraging more fossil fuel extraction and displacing carbon-free  sources of power. High methane leak rates and increased demand for LNG  exports would likely offset any climate benefits associated with  natural gas use.   For Congress and the Trump administration to prioritize such a policy  at a time when methane pollution from U.S. oil and gas operation is  expected to warm the planet as much as coal is, in my opinion,  completely reckless.   Madam Chair, beyond that, the use of floor time on such an  unnecessary bill is just the latest example of our current reality.  Republicans are running a government of, by, and for the corporate  interests, not a government for the people.   This bill will not create a single new job.   Madam Chair, the House has just 16 legislative days remaining before  the election and just 8 legislative days before the end of the fiscal  year. The farm bill expires this month. So does authorization for FAA  and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We also need to fund the  government to prevent another Trump shutdown.   We should be focusing our limited time on legislation that would fix  our crumbling infrastructure, create jobs that pay a livable wage, and  move America toward a smarter, greener energy future.   We need a practical balance and sustainable energy policy. What we do  not need are bills like this that target problems that don't exist. We  don't need to be throwing more bones to the fossil fuel industry.   I will be opposing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gene Green).    Madam Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Madam Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the  Energy Subcommittee.                                time  1415     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I understand the previous speaker, my colleague from  Arizona's interests in helping our friends and neighbors in the  Caribbean, but nothing in this bill or the rule requires small-scale  shipments to go to the Caribbean area. And, in fact, Puerto Rico is the  largest importer of LNG in the region, and the problems associated with  getting them natural gas are due to Jones Act restrictions, not DOE  approval of export applications.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no additional speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, LNG exports are clearly a priority for this  administration, and I see no indication that this trajectory is  changing, so we don't need this bill to enshrine the prescriptive and  problematic small-scale LNG rule into law.   Passing this bill will not create new jobs or approve any small-scale  LNG applications. It is solely a political win for the fossil fuel  industry at the expense of American consumers and manufacturers.   Those who are against unrestricted export of natural gas argue that  cheap, domestic natural gas prices are providing a big boost and  competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing. They are worried that  exporting large volumes of LNG will drive up domestic natural gas  prices, harming American manufacturers and consumers.   Madam Chair, I believe it is reasonable to question the wisdom of  exporting too much of our natural gas and to consider whether such an  approach will hurt our domestic manufacturing base, and giving the  fossil fuel industry a green light to extract and export unlimited  amounts of natural gas will only lead to greater methane leaks and the  displacement of carbon-free energy sources. So I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, one of my biggest concerns with this bill, and DOE's  Small-Scale LNG rule, is the removal of public hearing requirements for  LNG export applications. This is drastic change in the approval  process, and my amendment seeks to restore the ability for public input  through a public hearing.   Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act requires DOE to grant an application  to export natural gas to a non-Free Trade Agreement country, unless it  finds that the proposed export is not consistent with the public  interest. And typically, notices of non-FTA applications are posted in  the Federal Register for public comment, which ultimately informs DOE's  evaluation of an application's consistence with the public interest.   DOE evaluates a range of factors when performing a public interest  review, including economic impacts, international considerations, U.S.  energy security, and environmental considerations. And these are  important considerations that are unique to each export application,  and the public plays a key role in DOE's decisionmaking process.                                time  1430    But DOE recently turned this process on its head for small-scale  exports.   Hidden in its small-scale LNG proposed rule, DOE proclaimed that:  ``This proposed rule, and the 45-day comment period for this proposed  rule, would constitute the notice and opportunity for hearing on all  prospective small-scale natural gas export applications.''   What that means, Madam Chair, is that all qualifying small-scale  export applications would be approved without any public notice or  comment, or need for a unique public interest determination, in  perpetuity.   I think that is pretty outrageous, and I would argue it violates the  public hearing requirements of the Natural Gas Act.   DOE failed to justify the sweeping change to the existing approval  process. Congress should avoid the same mistake.   Congress should not be in the business of limiting the participation  of the American public in such a debate, but that is exactly what H.R.  4606 does.   By codifying the DOE rule, this legislation reduces the ability of  communities directly impacted by these projects to give meaningful  input during the review process.   Exporting America's resources to foreign nations while creating  domestic environmental and public health impacts is not in the public  interest, nor is cutting the public out of the process by which we  express our interest.   Congress should not create laws to export our natural resources  wealth at the expense of our environment and our manufacturers while  simultaneously limiting the rights of Americans to comment on natural  gas export projects in their communities.   My amendment is a commonsense proposal to fix this problem in the  underlying bill. It is good government. It is in the public interest  that consumers and communities have the ability to provide input on  export applications, no matter how small.   Madam Chair, for these reasons, I urge adoption of my amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I just wanted to read some parts of a letter from the  Industrial Energy Consumers of America in support of the amendment.   Let me just say to my colleagues on the other side, the purpose of  the amendment is not delay, but public input for the public interest.   The Industrial Energy Consumers write: ``In behalf of the Industrial  Energy Consumers of America, IECA, we support your amendment to provide  consumers of natural gas an `opportunity for hearing and public input'  for small-scale LNG export applications, in advance of final approval  by the U.S. Department of Energy. It is good government and in the  public interest that consumers have the ability to provide input.   ``Every study conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy on the  potential economic impacts of LNG exports concludes that exports of LNG  increase the price of natural gas and electricity. Although we do not  anticipate this being a significant problem in the short term, public  policy must consider longer term potential impacts. It is for this  reason that it is wise to provide for public input. Consumers of  natural gas deserve that option.   ``The manufacturing sector consumes about 25 percent of all U.S.  natural gas and demand is increasing annually. IECA members are mostly  energy intensive trade exposed, EITE, companies, which means that  relatively small changes to the price of natural gas and electricity  can have relatively large impacts to competitiveness and jobs. For the  majority of our applications, there is no substitute for natural gas.''   And then it is signed by the president, Paul Cicio.   Again, Madam Chair, I would urge support of my amendment. There is  nothing wrong with public input. It is part of the democratic process.   I do think we need to be concerned about the increased price of  natural gas from LNG exports and what it might mean not only for  consumers, but for manufacturing. If manufacturing is decreased because  of the increase, then that means fewer jobs for Americans.  [[Page H7893]]    So I appreciate the support from the Industrial Energy Consumers.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
