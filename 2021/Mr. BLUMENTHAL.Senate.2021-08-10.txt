 Mr. President.    Mr. President, the stated purpose of this amendment  is a pretext. It is a pretext for restricting reproductive rights and  interfering with women's decisions about whether to have an abortion.   For all of us who care about people with Down syndrome, we ought to  listen to the National Down Syndrome Society and devote more resources  to research at NIH, to funding better settings and care for people with  Down syndrome, and better opportunities for their employment. There are  ways to serve that community without this pretextual restriction of  reproductive rights.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3331
