 Mr. Chair, our national parks are among our most  universally supported and treasured institutions, and they cannot  survive in an atmosphere of incredible popularity. We simply must find  accommodations to protect the basic principles and qualities of those  parks for which we treasure them so much.   One of the areas where we have significant problems is in overuse of  our parks by commercial air tour operations, which severely degrade  some of our parks and have the risk of degrading all of our parks for a  number of different reasons, whether they be environmental, whether  they be protection of our natural resources, or whether they be visitor  enjoyment. Fundamentally, commercial air tours overflying a national  park with noise and other disruption on the ground does degrade the  park experience for the many who enjoy them in that way.   There is no right to overfly our parks. Now, I concede and agree that  there is some reasonable area and use for commercial air tours. I  certainly want those that cannot experience our parks to experience  them in this way, and I certainly believe that they have a place in our  parks, but not where they are today and not where they are going.   We recognized this challenge 23 years ago in this Congress by passing  a law which essentially required air tour management plans, which  accommodated all interests, and those plans are now coming to fruition.  This amendment is on the floor because the sponsor and others do not  like the results, which accommodate air tour operations in the vast  majority of our parks.                                time  1445    This process has been a good one, a difficult one, one in which the  operators have participated. They will continue to have a place under  these plans, a reasoned place. The fact that some of them don't like  the outcome does not mean that the process is not a valid process.   This process should be continued to its conclusion. It should be  accommodated. It should be implemented in a way that is reasonable to  all.   This amendment destroys that process and would degrade our parks to  the detriment of the vast majority of the people who enjoy our parks.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
