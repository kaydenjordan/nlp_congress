 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 269, the  PAHPA OTC legislation, which includes a bill I authored last Congress,  the Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act.   More than 240 million Americans use over-the-counter medications for  relief of common ailments, such as headaches, colds, and seasonal  allergies. We trust and depend on these affordable remedies to get us  well and stay well.   Despite the success and high utilization of these medicines, the Food  and Drug Administration's regulatory structure for oversight of OTC  products, referred to as the monograph system, is outdated and  incomplete. The system was created more than 45 years ago, yet movement  on unfinished items has ground to a halt due to cumbersome notice and  comment rulemaking processes.   Without process modernization, it is nearly impossible for  manufacturers to address safety concerns and offers little incentive to  develop new products. This bill would provide meaningful and long  overdue reform to the FDA's monograph system. The reform will create a  more flexible framework that accounts for advances in science, allows  timely updates to safety label changes, and creates a workable process  for completing unfinished monographs.   This bill would also create a pathway to market for new and  innovative products, which would help to reduce strain on our  healthcare system by giving consumers more options to treat common  ailments at home. Furthermore, this legislation will improve regulatory  certainty for manufacturers. Over time, we would see increase  investment in research and development, leading to new OTC medicines on  our shelves, and providing greater self-care options to consumers.   Again, I thank my colleagues--Ms. DeGette, Mr. Guthrie, Mrs. Dingell,  Dr. Burgess, and former Member Mr. Gene Green from Texas--the FDA, and  stakeholders for working so closely with me over the last 3 years to  ensure that this modernization effort appropriately addresses and  resolves this complex issue.                                time  1630    I believe modernization of the broken monograph system will  strengthen consumer protections, spur innovation, and expand consumer  choice. It is long overdue to fix this regulatory framework that  oversees 60 percent of the medicines sold in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of our  bipartisan bill, H.R. 269, PAHPA OTC.
