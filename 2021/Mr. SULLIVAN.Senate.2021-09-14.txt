 Mr. President, I wish today to honor Marcus Earl  Gamble, a member of my Senate staff who has departed to explore  exciting opportunities in the great State of Wisconsin.   Marcus, who is from Eagle River, AK, has been an invaluable member of  my Senate staff since May of 2018. Marcus is the son of Tonya and Brad  Gamble, who recently left Alaska for sunny Arizona. After attending  Chugiak High School, Marcus graduated from the University of Montana in  2018 with bachelor of arts degree in political science.   I first met Marcus in the summer of 2016, when he served as an intern  in my Washington, DC office. He immediately distinguished himself with  his incredible positive attitude and his ever-present smile. He lit up  every room he entered and he soon became a staple of the front office  and was lauded by many Alaskan visitors for his friendly, informative  banter during tours of the U.S. Capitol.   Following his graduation from the University of Montana, Marcus  joined my Senate staff as a staff assistant. He quickly became a staff  favorite, seeming to never have a bad day as he took calls and greeted  visitors to the office. Marcus quickly earned additional  responsibility, eventually becoming the internship coordinator and  systems administrator.   The COVID-19 pandemic showed us all how vital Marcus is to my office.  In a matter of hours, he had every staff member outfitted with  equipment and made sure everyone was connected and ready to work.  Thanks to Marcus, my office didn't miss a beat and was able to continue  to serve Alaska.   In addition to being an effective member of my staff, Marcus is a  trusted colleague. His high regard for his fellow Alaskans is evident  in the excellent service he has provided to my staff and the public.  His can-do, positive attitude and his know-how for all things big and  small is greatly missed.   My staff and I will miss Marcus greatly, but are sure he will  continue to be a brilliant example of Alaska's indomitable spirit.  Thank you, Marcus, for your outstanding service and best of luck as you  start this new chapter in life.                            ____________________
