 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in  morning business.    Mr. President, it was December 7, 1941, a young African- American man from the South Side of Chicago was celebrating his 23rd  birthday. He was in a neighborhood tavern, and somebody bolted through  the front door and cried out that the Japanese had attacked Pearl  Harbor.   In 1943, that same young man was inducted into the U.S. Army, a  segregated institution at the time. He landed in Normandy within days  of D-day. He fought across France in the Battle of the Bulge. While his  unit regrouped, they heard rumors--horrible rumors--about a camp near  Weimar, Germany. This young soldier and his commanding officer hopped  into a jeep to see for themselves. What he witnessed at Buchenwald, the  Nazi death camp, changed this man forever.   As he recalled in his memoir, his first thought was ``this is what  happened to my ancestors.'' This is what happens when human beings see  others as less than human.   Then he made a vow to himself. He said:         I made an emotional decision that when I returned from the       Army, the rest of my life would be spent trying to make [the       place] where I live, and the bigger world, a place where all       people could have peace and justice.    That soldier's name was Timuel Black. He kept that vow faithfully for  76 years. Tim Black was a foot soldier for justice. He died last week  at the age of 102, living in the neighborhood that had been his home  nearly all his life, a place that he personally called a ``Sacred  Ground,'' the South Side of Chicago.   His passing is our loss--to our city, our State, and our Nation. If  you are not from Chicago, you may not know his name, but we all live in  an America that is better because Timuel Black helped shape it. He was  a living link to some of our Nation's worst sins and our greatest  achievements.   All four of Tim Black's grandparents were born into slavery. When he  was a year old, Tim Black and his parents left Alabama and the  terrorism of Jim Crow and headed to Chicago, part of the first wave of  America's Great Migration. They settled on the South Side in a then- segregated neighborhood now known as Bronzeville.   After he served in World War II, Tim Black returned to Chicago. He  graduated from Roosevelt University, earned a master's degree in  history from the University of Chicago. He was teaching history in  Chicago public schools in 1955 when he heard a young minister speaking  on television, he was so moved that he decided, at his own expense, to  fly to Montgomery, AL, to meet this man, a man by the name of Martin  Luther King, Jr.   In 1963, Dr. King and the great African-American labor leader A.  Philip Randolph called on Tim Black. They asked him to organize  Chicago's contingent to come to Washington for the great March on  Washington. Three years later, Tim Black asked them to return the favor  and he persuaded Dr. King to bring his campaign for racial justice to  Chicago. Together, they pressed for an end to discriminatory housing  laws that squeezed many of the city's Black residents into overpriced,  ramshackle apartments in unsafe, segregated neighborhoods with few jobs  and failing schools.   In 1975, after decades working at high schools, Tim Black became a  professor of sociology, anthropology, and Black history at what is now  known as Harold Washington College. He was the Griot of Chicago, who  preserved the rich history of the Great Migration and Bronzeville. He  was also a brilliant political strategist who understood how to use his  power to help others.   So, in 1982, Harold Washington, who had been his friend since they  were children, was representing their neighborhood in the U.S. House of  Representatives. Professor Black and a few others went to Harold  Washington and said: You have to run for mayor of Chicago.   Washington replied: ``Sure. If you get 50,000 new Black voters and  raise $100,000, then I'll consider it.''   Washington figured that was the end of it; they would never reach  those goals. But Professor Tim Black started a fundraising drive and  helped organize a voter registration campaign that ultimately  registered not 100,000, not 50,000, but 263,000 new voters in Chicago,  and he raised more than $1 million for the Harold Washington campaign.   In 1983, with the support from voters from all backgrounds--Black,  White, and Brown--Harold Washington became Chicago's first Black mayor.   A decade later, a young lawyer by the name of Barack Obama sought out  [[Page S7040]]  Professor Tim Black's guidance when he first considered running for  office. Last month, President Obama returned to the South Side to break  ground on the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson. Although Professor  Black's failing health didn't allow him to attend in person, it is a  good bet that ceremony couldn't have happened without him.   Mr. President, I was blessed to know Tim Black. When Barack Obama, my  Senate colleague from Illinois, was elected President, I was given a  handful of tickets to the inauguration. The first name that came to my  mind was Tim Black. He had to be there, and his wife Zenobia Johnson- Black, a personal friend who volunteered to drive me in my first Senate  campaign. Zenobia is a wonderful person. She is an exciting driver, and  we had many escapades together.    So I invited Tim and Zenobia to come and sit in the best seats that I  had for the inauguration of Barack Obama, the first African-American  President from the South Side of Chicago.   I was fortunate I knew Tim Black. I counted him as a friend. I was  there sitting next to him at his 100th birthday party. It was a great  night, and the man still had it all together and a great sense of  humor.   Loretta and I send our condolences to his beloved wife of 40 years,  Zenobia Johnson-Black, his daughter Ermetra, and his countless friends  and students. A great man has left us. He will be missed.    Madam President, this week, the Senate will consider  Christine O'Hearn's nomination for the U.S. District Court for the  District of New Jersey.   Ms. O'Hearn is eminently qualified to be a district court judge.   She has nearly 30 years of experience as a litigator in private  practice. During that time, she has tried numerous cases to verdict and  has completed more than 150 trial days as lead counsel.   Ms. O'Hearn has worked on both the plaintiff and defense sides of  complex civil litigation matters, with her core focus being employment  law.   In addition to representing individual clients, Ms. O'Hearn has  represented both private and public entities, including a number of  county and municipal governments.  [[Page S7063]]    Throughout her career, Ms. O'Hearn has also given back to the legal  community. For example, she has served on the New Jersey Supreme  Court's Committee on the Unauthorized Practice of Law; the U.S.  Magistrate Judge Selection Committee for Camden, NJ; and the New Jersey  Supreme Court District IV Ethics Committee.   While serving on the New Jersey Supreme Court's Ethics Committee, Ms.  O'Hearn devoted hundreds of hours--pro bono--to prosecuting an attorney  for violating the New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct. After a 15- day trial before a Special Master, the attorney was found to have  violated multiple Rules of Professional Conduct. Ms. O'Hearn also  briefed and argued the case on appeal, where the ruling was affirmed.   Numerous groups and individuals have written letters of support for  Ms. O'Hearn's nomination, including: the New Jersey State Bar  Association, the Camden County Bar Association, and dozens of New  Jersey Fellows with the American College of Trial Lawyers.   With her extensive experience, it is no surprise that Ms. O'Hearn was  unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association.   Ms. O'Hearn has the strong support of her home state Senators,  Senators Menendez and Booker, and she received bipartisan support in  the Judiciary Committee.   With decades of legal experience on behalf of plaintiffs and  defendants alike, Ms. O'Hearn is well prepared to serve with  distinction in the District of New Jersey.   I urge my colleagues to join me voting in support of her nomination.                            ____________________
