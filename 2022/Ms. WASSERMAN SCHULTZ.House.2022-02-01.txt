 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5577) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 3900 Crown Road Southwest in Atlanta,  Georgia, as the `John R. Lewis Post Office Building'.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5577         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JOHN R. LEWIS POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 3900 Crown Road Southwest in Atlanta,       Georgia, shall be known and designated as the ``John R. Lewis       Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``John R. Lewis Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5577 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3900 Crown Road  Southwest in Atlanta, Georgia, as the ``John R. Lewis Post Office  Building''.   John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, in Troy, Alabama, to Willie  Mae and Eddie Lewis.   Inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he attended the American  Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee. Lewis then went  on to earn his bachelor's degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk  University.  [[Page H313]]    As a college student in Nashville, Congressman Lewis was a founder  and chairman of the national civil rights organization, Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC.   In 1963, John Lewis was involved in planning the March on Washington  for Jobs and Freedom. As a part of the event, Lewis delivered a keynote  address at the Lincoln Memorial in which he called on an army of  movement activists to ``march through the South'' in a sustained  campaign of nonviolent resistance to produce effective civil rights  legislation and destroy Jim Crow.   His fight for Federal civil rights legislation continued in 1965, as  Congressman Lewis participated in new voter registration drives and  peaceful demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, where he sustained a  fractured skull as a result of being beaten during what is now known as  Bloody Sunday.   President Jimmy Carter appointed Lewis as the associate director of  the Federal volunteer agency, ACTION, where he worked to build  connections to local volunteer groups and diversify the agency's  workforce.   From 1981 to 1986, Congressman Lewis held a seat on the Atlanta City  Council, where he tackled local issues, such as public funding for  infrastructure, zoning laws, and homelessness.   As a Representative of Georgia, Lewis made monumental strides as he  focused on backing or introducing legislation advancing civil rights,  environmental justice, education, and healthcare.   In 1991, Lewis proposed legislation to establish the museum of  African American history and worked to gather support for the proposal  until George W. Bush signed into law a bill creating the National  Museum of African American History and Culture.   Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest honors of my professional life, and  really my life, was the opportunity to get to know and serve with the  great John Lewis in this body, and I think if you asked most Members  who had the privilege of getting to know him and serve with him in the  U.S. House of Representatives, that they would count among their finest  honors to be able to have that privilege as well.   Sadly, we lost Congressman Lewis, our beloved John, who died on July  17, 2020, and I encourage all of my colleagues to honor the memory of  Congressman John Lewis's legacy and his fight for civil rights through  the dedication of the post office at 3900 Crown Road Southwest as the  ``John R. Lewis Post Office Building'', and may his memory be for a  blessing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams), who has the privilege of not  having stepped in the shoes, but to have succeeded the great former  Congressman John Lewis.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a member of  the Judiciary Committee who chairs the Antitrust, Commercial, and  Administrative Law Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, as I have said, nearly all the  Members of this body who had the privilege to get to know Congressman  Lewis would count among their finest honors the chance to serve in this  esteemed institution with him.   John was really the embodiment of goodness. John Lewis was someone  who I never heard cast aspersions, who I never saw angry or directed  anger at someone else. He certainly had anger toward injustice and  really channeled that energy and his passion to make sure that everyone  in the United States had an opportunity to live and experience justice  as his life's work.   There were so many times that John's rallying cry for Members of this  institution was that we needed to stand up and speak out and make sure  that we did not remain silent. That is absolutely essential and is as  important today as it was back in the 1960s and before that when he was  walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and leading the fight for  voting rights. We carry on that fight for him to this day in his  memory.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the United States House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, it is an incredible privilege to  be able to manage the time on this legislation to name the main post  office in the city of Atlanta after the great and late Honorable John  R. Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 583) to promote innovative acquisition techniques and  procurement strategies, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 583         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 583, the Promoting Rigorous and  Innovative Cost Efficiencies for Federal Procurement and Acquisitions  Act, or the PRICE Act.   This bipartisan bill was introduced by Chairman Gary Peters of the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along with  Senators Ernst and Carper. I commend them for their bipartisan  leadership, as well as   Joe Neguse for leading the House companion  bill.   Mr. Speaker, to meet its complex and critical missions in service of  the American people, the Federal Government must ensure that its  procurement practices make use of innovative approaches that maximize  the ingenuity and opportunity of American small business.   These small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and  the breeding ground for cutting edge solutions that can be  transformative in government operations. Recognizing that the  Department of Homeland Security has been a leader in small business  utilization, the PRICE Act requires it to publish an annual report on  the projects of its Procurement Innovation Lab.   Dedicated to improving the acquisition process within the construct  of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the lab is a proving ground for  innovative ideas and a forum for developing and sharing lessons learned  and best practices.   Under the bill, the Department would be required to develop guidance  and training on innovative procurement techniques for contracting and  program management personnel, and to make these best practices  available to other Federal agencies.   The bill would also convene the Chief Acquisition Officers Council to  examine and report on best practices in acquisition innovation in  Federal contracting, including through small business engagement, which  is vital to keeping our industrial base strong and vibrant.   The report would include a review of the practices and technology  applications with the greatest success in improving program outcomes,  enhancing customer experience, and meeting the Federal Government's  small business contracting goals. These goals cannot be a check-the-box  exercise that provides opportunity to only a handful of companies.  Rather, they must be about opening the doors of Federal contracting to  as many small businesses as possible to expand our industrial base.   The PRICE Act will pave the way for more cohesive and widespread  adoption of modernized business practices and advanced technologies  across the Federal Government. It also has the power to advance the  goals of the Small Business Act by creating greater opportunity for  small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 583, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 566) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 42 Main Street in Slatersville, Rhode Island,  as the ``Specialist Matthew R. Turcotte Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.

I rise today in support of S. 566, to designate the facility of the  United States Postal Service located at 42 Main Street in Slatersville,  Rhode Island, as the Specialist Matthew R. Turcotte Post Office.   Specialist Matthew R. Turcotte was from North Smithfield, Rhode  Island, and a graduate of North Smithfield High School where he was  cocaptain of the football team. Specialist Turcotte served with 2nd  Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division in Kosovo.   Over the course of his military career, Specialist Turcotte earned  numerous medals and commendations, including the Army Achievement  Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service  Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the  NATO Medal. Specialist Turcotte was deeply committed to our Nation and  served the country with distinction.   In 2017, he was killed during a live-fire training exercise at Fort  Carson, Colorado. He is survived by his wife, parents, and two sisters.  I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in honoring his legacy by  naming the post office at 42 Main Street as the Specialist Matthew R.  Turcotte Post Office.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), in whose district the post  office resides.    Mr. Speaker, may the memory of Matthew R.  Turcotte be for a blessing, and I urge passage of S. 566, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2324) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 2800 South Adams Street in  Tallahassee, Florida, as the ``D. Edwina Stephens Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2324         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``D.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2324, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2800 South  Adams Street in Tallahassee, Florida, as the D. Edwina Stephens Post  Office.   Edwina Stephens is remembered as a unique and influential community  activist who touched people's lives in numerous roles for over 50  years.   Born in Rocky Ford, Georgia, Edwina spent the majority of her adult  life as a member of the Tallahassee community. Professionally, she was  known as a fabulous nurse who pioneered changes in Tallahassee's local  healthcare industry at Florida A&M University and Tallahassee Memorial  Hospital.   In the community, she was recognized for being an acclaimed  environmentalist and tireless activist who successfully campaigned  against cases of environmental disenfranchisement and fought inequality  of neighborhood services in underserved communities.   Ms. Stephens' achievements in Tallahassee include facilitating the  hiring of Black cashiers at Winn-Dixie stores, leading the successful  crusade to shut down the Medical Waste Facility on the southside, and  spearheading the infrastructure revitalization for the Southside. These  activities improved the quality of life not only for Southside  residents, but for all the people of Tallahassee.   In addition to her mission of advocating for positive change, Edwina  was a historian and visionary for many ongoing projects. Ms. Stephens  is also remembered as a warm, caring woman who possessed political grit  and organizational skills needed to foster enduring relationships  between government, media, and the community.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring a pioneer in the  healthcare community by naming the post office at 2800 South Adams  Street as the D. Edwina Stephens Post Office.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Florida  delegation, I am proud to help honor a daughter of the State of  Florida, and I urge passage of H.R. 2324, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 735) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 502 East Cotati Avenue in Cotati, California,  as the ``Arthur Luis Ibleto Post Office Building'', as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 735, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 502 East Cotati  Avenue in Cotati, California, as the Arthur L. Ibleto Post Office  Building.   Mr. Ibleto reigned in the Sonoma County food and wine community for  nearly 50 years as its one and only ``Pasta King.'' His Italian  catering and frozen food business is an institution and his award- winning grapes can be found in numerous Sonoma Valley wines.   Mr. Ibleto was known for his generosity and he lent considerable time  and resources to charitable, educational, and civic causes. He  continued working full-time until his passing on November 24, 2020, at  age 94.   But his accomplishments are not limited to food, wine, and the  building of his community. At just 17, Mr. Ibleto deserted Mussolini's  fascist army to join the Italian resistance and fought behind enemy  lines to help the Allies defeat Nazi Germany during World War II.   In 1949, he left Italy for Petaluma, California, where he met and  married Victoria Eleanor Ghirardelli. The two settled in Cotati,  California, in 1951.  [[Page H319]]    A proud immigrant, Mr. Ibleto cofounded the North Bay Italian  Cultural Foundation and served as State president of the Order Sons and  Daughters of Italy in America.   Mr. Ibleto lived the American Dream and helped countless people on  his journey.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in honoring his legacy by  naming the post office at 502 East Cotati Avenue as the Arthur L.  Ibleto Post Office Building.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and  urge passage of H.R. 735. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3539) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 223 West Chalan Santo Papa in Hagatna,  Guam, as the ``Atanasio Taitano Perez Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3539         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ATANASIO TAITANO PEREZ POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 223 West Chalan Santo Papa in Hagatna,       Guam, shall be known and designated as the ``Atanasio Taitano       Perez Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Atanasio Taitano Perez Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3539, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 223 West Chalan  Santo Papa in Hagatna, Guam, as the Atanasio Taitano Perez Post Office.   Mr. Atanasio Taitano Perez was a life-long public servant to Guam and  the United States.   Over the course of his 36-year career he not only served as the first  postmaster of Guam, but also served in the Guam judicial system serving  as chief clerk, and later associate justice in the Guam High Court of  Equity.   Mr. Perez was also involved in petitioning Congress to establish  Guam's permanent civilian government, which its citizens enjoy today.   Unfortunately, he did not live long enough to see his efforts  through, as he passed away on April 23, 1950. President Truman signed  the Guam Organic Act into law 3 months later on August 1, 1950.   To this day, Mr. Perez is revered for his efforts not only in civil  service, but also for advocacy on behalf of the Chamorro and Guamanian  people of Guam.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in honoring  Mr. Perez' legacy by naming the post office at 223 West Chalan Santo  Papa as the Atanasio Taitano Perez Post Office.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3539, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2842) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 120 4th Street in Petaluma,  California, as the ``Lynn C. Woolsey Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2842         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LYNN C. WOOLSEY POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 120 4th Street in Petaluma, California,       shall be known and designated as the ``Lynn C.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Lynn C. Woolsey Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H320]]    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 2842 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 120 4th Street in Petaluma, California, as the Lynn C.  Woolsey Post Office Building.   Lynn Woolsey was born Lynn Carol Robinson in Seattle, Washington, on  November 3, 1937. A graduate of Seattle's Lincoln High School, Woolsey  attended the University of Washington from 1955 to 1957. She left  school to marry Terry J. Critchett in 1958, and they eventually settled  in Marin County, California. They had three children, Joseph, Ed, and  Amy.   After working as a secretary at a technology company and relying  partly on welfare assistance, Woolsey opened a personnel services firm  and returned to college at the University of San Francisco to earn her  bachelor's degree in 1980.   In 1984, Woolsey won a seat on the Petaluma City Council, where she  served until 1992, including as vice mayor in her final year. When  California Representative Barbara Boxer ran for the Senate in 1992,  Woolsey ran to replace her and was elected in 1993 with 65 percent of  the vote.   Congresswoman Woolsey served on the House Budget Committee, the  Government Operations Committee, and the Education and Labor Committee.  As subcommittee chair of the Workforce Protections Subcommittee, she  led a measure to provide job-protected leave for family members of  injured soldiers.   Among other successes, Congresswoman Woolsey fought legislation that  threatened to reduce the scope of welfare programs; advocated for  expanding school breakfast programs; and sponsored legislation to  encourage young girls to study math and science, her ``Go, Girl''  initiative.   As co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congresswoman  Woolsey advocated for a budget proposal to lower the deficit while  supporting the social safety net.   A prominent member of the Out of Iraq Caucus, Woolsey criticized the  George W. Bush administration's prosecution of the war, voted  consistently to suspend funding for the war, and introduced a bill to  redirect $60 billion in Pentagon funds toward domestic civilian  programs.   Throughout her congressional career, Woolsey tended to her northern  California district. She delivered hundreds of millions of dollars back  home for a variety of capital-intensive projects, including $9 million  for a Petaluma River flood control project and $52 million for a  seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge.   Naming a post office for Lynn C. Woolsey is entirely appropriate  given her distinguished career and contributions to her State and  country, and I urge all Members to support this bill.   I will just add what a privilege it was to have a chance to get to  know and serve with Lynn Woolsey. She was a fierce advocate for her  point of view. She spent every single day on the floor of this body  during the Iraq war and spoke out against it every single day without  fail. She is a woman of her convictions and someone who fiercely  defended making sure that her constituents' voices were heard.   Mr. Speaker, it was a privilege to serve with her, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), who succeeded Congresswoman  Woolsey.    Mr. Speaker, what a gift to be able to help  name this post office and give this well-deserved honor to a remarkable  woman, who I hope is watching right now, because she deserves every  ounce of the respect that this naming represents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2842, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H321]]         Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3579) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 200 East Main Street in Maroa,  Illinois, as the ``Jeremy L. Ridlen Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3579         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JEREMY L. RIDLEN POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 200 East Main Street in Maroa, Illinois,       shall be known and designated as the ``Jeremy L. Ridlen Post       Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Jeremy L. Ridlen Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3579 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 200 East Main  Street in Maroa, Illinois, as the Jeremy L. Ridlen Post Office.   Army National Guard Specialist Jeremy L. Ridlen was born in Maroa,  Illinois, where he attended Maroa-Forsyth High School with his twin  brother, Jason. Jeremy and Jason were students at Illinois State  University, where they joined the National Guard and were assigned to  the 1544th Transportation Company. In 2003, the National Guard  activated their unit and deployed them to Fallujah, Iraq, where Jeremy  served as postal clerk.   On May 23, 2004, Jeremy was killed after a truck rigged with  explosives detonated next to his convoy. He was 23 years old.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring Jeremy  L. Ridlen, who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, by naming  the post office at 200 East Main Street after him, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from  Illinois that as a fellow parent of twins--mine are 22--I send deepest  condolences. Although I know his passing was back in 2004, I know the  pain is fresh for his family. It is an honor to be able to join my  colleagues in helping to name this post office.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3579, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3613) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 202 Trumbull Street in Saint Clair,  Michigan, as the ``Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3613         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CORPORAL JEFFREY ROBERT STANDFEST POST OFFICE                     BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 202 Trumbull Street in Saint Clair,       Michigan, shall be known and designated as the ``Corporal       Jeffrey Robert Standfest Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other  [[Page H322]]       record of the United States to the facility referred to in       subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the       ``Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3613 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 202 Trumbull  Street in Saint Clair, Michigan, as the Corporal Jeffrey Robert  Standfest Post Office Building.   Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest was born on April 24, 1987. He was  a 2005 graduate of Saint Clair High School where, during his senior  year, he won 12 of his 14 cross-country races and was named the Times  Herald newspaper's Runner of the Year. He also ran cross-country during  his tenure at Oakland University and helped lead his team to a  conference championship.   Described as an all-American kid, he joined the military because his  grandfather had served in the Marines during World War II. Due to his  constant demonstration of maturity and leadership, Corporal Standfest  was selected to become one of his unit's few dog handlers, in addition  to his role as a combat engineer.   In Afghanistan, he had been operating alongside his fellow engineers  as a dog handler to detect IEDs and assist the route clearance platoon.  Sadly, while attempting to clear a building on June 16, 2010, tragedy  struck in the Helmand province of Afghanistan when Corporal Standfest,  along with his bomb-sniffing dog, Sergeant Ruppert, was killed by an  IED. Corporal Standfest was only 23 years old.   In the aftermath of his death, then-Governor Granholm lowered flags  to halfstaff. Corporal Standfest was posthumously awarded the Purple  Heart. He was previously awarded the Combat Action Ribbon, National  Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on  Terrorism Medal, and the NATO medal.   Naming a post office after Corporal Standfest is appropriate, given  his dedication to his country. I urge my colleagues to join me in  honoring Corporal Standfest.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage and yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4168) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 6223 Maple Street, in Omaha, Nebraska,  as the ``Petty Officer 1st Class Charles Jackson French Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4168         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

[[Page H323]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4168 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 6223 Maple  Street as the Petty Officer 1st Class Charles Jackson French Post  Office.   Petty Officer Charles Jackson French was born in Arkansas in 1919 and  first enlisted in the United States Navy in 1937. In 1941, Petty  Officer French completed his first enlistment but decided to reenlist  after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor that December.   Petty Officer French served as a mess attendant on the USS Gregory  when the military was racially segregated, but that did not stop him  from rescuing 15 of his fellow injured sailors when their ship was  attacked and sunk by Japanese gunfire.   Petty Officer French helped his crewmates into a life raft and tied  it to himself, swimming for nearly 8 hours through nightfall and  swarming sharks, until they were finally identified and rescued. For  this, he received a letter of commendation from Admiral William F.  Halsey, Jr., in May of 1943.   After retiring from the military, Petty Officer French moved to Omaha  before moving to San Diego where he passed away at the age of 37.   Mr. Speaker, naming a post office after Petty Officer 1st Class  Charles Jackson French is a way to honor his dedication to his country.  I encourage my colleagues to join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers as  well. I am prepared to close.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1298) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 1233 North Cedar Street in Owasso,  Oklahoma, as the ``Staff Sergeant Marshal Roberts Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

At the age of 28, Technical Sergeant Marshal D.

He died as a result of a rocket attack from an Iran-backed militia  group at Camp Taji on March 11, 2020. Technical Sergeant Roberts was  the first member in the history of the Oklahoma Air National Guard to  be killed in combat.   Technical Sergeant Roberts gave the ultimate sacrifice for this  country, and his service will never be forgotten. He is survived by his  wife and fellow member of the Tulsa-based 138th Fighter Wing, Kristie  Roberts, and their 8-year-old daughter, Paityn.
