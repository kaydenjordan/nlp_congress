 Mr. Speaker, President Joe Biden has done an awesome job  creating jobs. He is a jobs President.   Last year, 6.6 million jobs were created. In the last 14 months  working with congressional Democrats 7.4 million jobs were created, the  most in United States history.   Democrats are building a better America for the future and for the  people.   What are Republicans doing? I don't know.   Last week, Republican Congressman Madison Cawthorn bragged about  being invited to cocaine-fueled sex orgies by senior Republicans. Don't  believe me? Search for ``Madison Cawthorn Republican Caucus'' on the  internet.                            ____________________
