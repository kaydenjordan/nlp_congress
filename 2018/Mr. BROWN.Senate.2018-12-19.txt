 Mr. President, 10 years ago this summer, we lost a  longtime friend of mine and colleague, a remarkable public servant,  Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones.   When Marcia Fudge, then the mayor of Warrensville Heights, a  Cleveland suburb, won the special election to Stephanie's seat to  represent the 11th Congressional District, including Cleveland and the  home where Connie and I live, she had big shoes to fill, but Marcia  rose to the occasion. For the past decade, she has been a fighter for  my hometown of Cleveland and the east side suburbs into Akron and all  the Ohioans she serves.   On the Education and Workforce Committee, she has become a senior  leader who knows how to get things done. She stands up for Ohio's  teachers, students, and families.   Marcia also joined the Agriculture Committee, perhaps not initially  seen as a natural fit for someone with an urban district like hers, but  she understands that farm bills are not just about crops. They are food  bills, economic development bills, conservation bills, research bills,  and nutrition bills. She and I--and I am the first Senator in half a  century to be on the Ag Committee for some of the same reasons  Congressman Fudge is on this committee. We have worked together to  write two farm bills.   This year, we both served on the bill's conference committee, and we  fought House Republican efforts to erect more bureaucracy to gut  nutrition programs in Ohio that families rely on. These are programs  for people making $8, $10, $12 an hour who don't have quite enough  income to feed their families. We won that fight.   Tomorrow the President is scheduled to sign the bipartisan farm bill  we passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both Houses.  Congresswoman Fudge and I worked to right a century-old wrong and get  Central State University the 1890 land grant status they deserve. That  designation isn't just a rhetorical honor; it means more opportunities  for funding and research in partnerships with industry--the sort of  results that Marcia delivers for her district.   She is a leader among her colleagues. As head of the Congressional  Black Caucus, she led the fight on so many issues, including working to  ensure that all Americans have a voice in their government.   A few years ago, we held a field hearing on barriers too many Ohioans  face exercising their most fundamental right--the right to vote. Marcia  was a star in that hearing. It came in the wake of a despicable Ohio  law and, frankly, years of attempts at voter suppression by Ohio  Republicans--a despicable Ohio law that cut the number of early voting  days in half.   We know exactly whom these laws are aimed at. Marcia testified about  how these suppression tactics hurt communities of color. Unfortunately,  it has gotten worse--limiting absentee balloting, restricting  provisional balloting--and the Supreme Court, a Court that puts its  thumb on the scale of justice in support of corporations over workers,  a Court that puts its thumb on the scale of justice to support Wall  Street over consumers, and a Court that rubberstamps all these  restrictions on voting.   I look forward to continuing our fight alongside Marcia against these  tactics straight out of the Jim Crow era. I know Marcia will continue  to be a leader. There is no doubt, even before her election to  Congress, that Marcia was a force to be reckoned with: a former mayor,  a former congressional chief of staff, and former national president-- as important as anything she has done, I think in her mind--of Delta  Sigma Theta. She still helps lead efforts to bring Deltas from around  the country to the Hill each year for Delta Days. Hundreds of driven,  ambitious, smart, committed, empathetic talented Black women come to  our Nation's Capitol to meet with Members of Congress and make their  voices heard. They have an incredible role model in Marcia Fudge.   I am grateful, Congresswoman Fudge, to have you as my Congresswoman.  I am proud to call you a colleague and a friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I noticed today news reports from Bloomberg  that the year 2017 is shaping up to be or likely was the most  profitable year in Wall Street history. So what is Congress's reaction  to that? What happens in the majority leader's office? More special  interest legislation, more breaks for Wall Street, more tax cuts. So  this Congress--this Congress has decided that Wall Street never quite  has enough; that the richest people in this country are never rich  enough; that the most powerful people in this country are not powerful  enough.   So what happens down the hall in the majority leader's office? What  happens way down the hall in the Speaker's office, although voters this  year decided this year to eject him and his staff and his cohorts and  his fellow travelers--if I can use a phrase like that--from that office  and elect a whole different group of people.   What they have done is meet behind closed doors to help the oil  companies, the drug companies, the gun lobby, and help especially Wall  Street. In fact, not only are there all kinds of Wall Street lobbyists  day in and day out--tobacco lobbyists, gun lobbyists, and others, but  the White House itself looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives.   We know that. That is why, I guess, Wall Street had such a great year  in 2017.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to honor the career of Patricia  Rogala, who has been with my office our entire 12 years in the Senate  and my 14 years in the House before that. Pat is the model of a  dedicated public servant. After more than 25 years serving the people  of Ohio, Pat is retiring at the end of the year.   Her first day on the job in Cleveland, Congress was in the middle of  a fight--sounds familiar--over healthcare. Some local activists sent an  Elvis impersonator to the office singing a healthcare song to the tune  of ``It's Now or Never.'' Pat said at the time, ``What am I getting  myself into?''   Fortunately, she stayed. As our Ohio scheduler, she has sent me all  over my State. She has helped me put more road miles on our made-in- Toledo Jeep Cherokee than any travel agent ever could.   She has made sure I am able to serve Ohioans through meetings and  roundtables and plant visits. She juggles a Senate schedule that  changes--as we see tonight--always at the last minute. She ensures that  this  [[Page S7886]]  office serves every corner of Ohio. She works directly in concert and  coordination with Diana Baron in our Washington office. It is a tough  job, but Pat makes it look easy.   One of our colleagues in our office wrote this week that Pat has been  a true friend and wonderful coworker. What a loss we will feel come  Monday when she is not sitting in her office hard at work. It is a loss  to all of us.   We will miss you, Pat. You have had an incredible impact on your  colleagues. You made such a difference serving Ohio for the people of  Ohio, but after a quarter of a century, you have earned a long and  happy retirement. Your family needs you, and your family loves you so.   Thank you, Pat.   (Mr. RUBIO assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to honor the career of Margaret  Molnar, a dedicated public servant who has made a difference in the  lives of thousands of Ohioans and who is retiring soon after 12 years  with my office.   She joined my Ohio staff the very first year I came to the Senate  after a long career at Legal Aid. Her entire life has been dedicated to  helping those people in need. In the past 12 years, Margaret has worked  on more than 10,000 cases. Those are 10,000 Ohioans whose lives she has  touched. Many of these were seniors trying to navigate bureaucracy and  get the Social Security and Medicare benefits they have earned.  Margaret went above and beyond the call of duty for them.   She worked on one case for 5 years. It was a complicated one, helping  an Ohioan who was taken as a baby from Lithuania, brought to a  displaced persons camp in Germany after World War II, and then finally  brought to America.   They were having trouble finding the documents he needed to prove his  eligibility for Social Security and Medicare, two Federal programs for  which he had paid in. The case at times seemed hopeless, but Margaret  never gave up. This year she was finally able to track down the  documents this Ohioan needed to secure the benefits he earned. That was  par for the course.   She worked on another case for a constituent who had been trying to  get someone to intervene regarding her mother's Medicare coverage. The  woman's daughter wrote that Margaret's ``caring, expertise, and  knowledge of the medical system and Federal programs cut through all  the gobbledygook I was facing, and pointed us in the direction of help  when not one other agency or politician would.''   Our office has received so many letters of praise and thanks like  that for Margaret.   One Ohioan wrote to Margaret:         You and Senator Brown have accomplished what I was       beginning to believe was impossible--the Social Security       backpay was indeed transferred to my account yesterday. I       cannot thank your office enough. I cannot even begin to       explain what a Christmas gift this is. I truly was beginning       to wonder and worry about how I was going to make ends meet       for the next several months.    Again, it is par for the course for Margaret Molnar.   Another woman wrote after her brother passed away, who Margaret  helped in the last years of his life:         I will never forget how much you have helped enrich       Robert's life while he was with us. Forever, we will be       grateful. You immediately responded to my email and got the       ball rolling and never gave up on Robert. You are like       family.    Another woman wrote:         I did not know how to fight this type of issue, it seemed       bigger than life to me. You truly have done a wonderful job.       I appreciate you stepping in for me . . . your office truly       cares about people.    In a last note, another couple wrote: ``I hope Senator Brown knows  how fortunate he is to have you on his staff.''   I know that, and Ohio knows that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to honor the career of an  indispensable member of my staff, Elizabeth Thames. Beth has been with  my office for over 20 years--all 12 years in the Senate and about a  decade in the House before that.   Now, after serving the people of Ohio for these 20-plus years, Beth  retires at the end of the year. She joined our office after working as  an editor at the Elyria Chronicle-Telegram. Far from being the enemy of  the people, Beth knew what journalism was, knew how important it is,  and knew to tell stories to help people, to afflict the comfortable,  and to comfort the afflicted.   Beth brought that same spirit to our office. She helped our office to  connect with the community in Northeast Ohio and around the State. She  writes down the name of every single Ohioan we meet together so we can  better serve them. Her work has had an amazing impact on the people of  Ohio.   At meetings, at roundtables, and at community events, she listens and  she learns about problems. She understands what Lincoln was talking  about when he said: Go out and get your public opinion. She listens to  people who don't often get listened to, and she is a voice for people  whose voices are often not heard.   In 2012 and 2013, she began hearing more and more about infant  mortality--a huge problem in our State, particularly for African- American babies. Frankly, State government didn't seem to give a damn.  Constituents would bring up this issue over and over, but no one was  doing anything about it. She started calling around. She met with  anyone who would talk to her about what the State and Federal  Government could do.   She called Arthur James, a doctor on the faculty at Ohio State and at  the Nationwide Children's Hospital. He was sounding that alarm. He met  with Beth and told her how bad things were. A crisis at the time,  Ohio--a generally wealthy State, which could do so much better were it  not for corrupt State government--had the third highest infant  mortality rate in the country, and ranked last for African-American  babies.   Beth started this conversation before many people were paying  attention. She pushed every level of government to take this seriously.  She talked with public health departments, with home visiting programs,  with hospitals, with nurses, with doctors. She started conversations  with legislators and legislative staff about what we could do on the  Federal level, the State level, and the local level.   It is because of her that we passed and President Obama signed the  bipartisan Sudden Unexpected Death Data Enhancement and Awareness Act.  It is because of Beth that we wrote to the Consumer Product Safety  Commission and got them to add warnings to crib bumpers to promote safe  sleep.   It is because of Beth's hard work that then-Secretary of HHS Sylvia  Mathews Burwell visited my hometown of Mansfield, OH, to see the great  work that the Doctors Redding--husband and wife, two doctors in  Mansfield, OH, my hometown--were doing and to see the great work they  and community health workers were doing to help moms have healthy  pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. The change was dramatic in the  number of healthy babies who were born as a result of the work of all  of them.   We have more to do, but all of Beth's efforts have given our State  important tools to pay attention to monitor this problem and to figure  out how to solve it.   For Beth, of course, it wasn't just infant mortality. Any time she  heard about an issue in a meeting or roundtable, any time she heard  about how our office could look and search for and find problems and  find ways to be helpful, she was. She called agencies and offices. She  talked with legislative staff. She always tried to find a solution.   She heard from veterans about the challenges using GI education  benefits. This year she spearheaded our first student veterans  conference. We spread around the State to help student veterans,  soldiers, sailors, air men and women, and marines who come back after  serving to integrate into classrooms in a difficult situation, where  they are around college students who are usually younger than they and  didn't have their life experience. She connects those student veterans  with resources that allow them to the get the most out of the benefits.   For all of her efforts, Beth never sought recognition. She is  generally quiet as a person. I can imagine her right now telling me to  stop. She doesn't need all this fuss.   This fall, the Elyria NAACP gave her an award--something she probably  [[Page S7887]]  hoped I wasn't going to talk about--called the ``Unsung Hero Award.''   That is Beth. By the end of a long career that touched so many lives,  I can't let her go without giving her the recognition she reserves.   Beth Thames, thank you for what you have done for our State. Thank  you for what you have done for our country.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, these are  not Mick Mulvaney's decisions to make--or whatever job Mick Mulvaney  happens to be in this week. These are not Alex Azar's decisions to  make. Congress needs to do its job. On behalf of the minority leader, I  object.
