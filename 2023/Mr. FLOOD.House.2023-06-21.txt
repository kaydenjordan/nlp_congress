 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Nebraska's  finest journalists, Don Walton.  [[Page H3002]]    Don has long been a trusted source of political news across Nebraska.  He has a unique approach to his craft. He quietly builds relationships  with people as he listens and grows trust.   During my time in the legislature and in Congress, I have worked with  Don. He believes that people are never a means to a story, and he  faithfully covers politics without engaging in them.   Over a week ago, Don surprised us all with his retirement  announcement in his weekly column. He had shown no signs of stepping  back, true to form. He did not make a spectacle of his farewell. In a  brief open letter, he thanked his readers and encouraged and challenged  them to be their best. He has had a 67-year career.   On behalf of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I honor Don for  his service and his work. The way he treated people as he wrote about  them will long stand as a testament to the value of local journalism.                            ____________________
