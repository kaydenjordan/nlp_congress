 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Connolly for his  help and his partnership in the SECRET Act. Today, I rise in support of  this straightforward bipartisan legislation, the SECRET Act, or  Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act.   I am proud to say that this bill originated from concerns voiced by  my constituents. California's 25th District serves as a hub for many  national security programs, and by extension, requires a highly  skilled, security-cleared industrial base and workforce. But this  doesn't just affect southern California. This is a national issue and  must be addressed now.   Many employers are either unable to recruit workers due to excessive  backlog of security clearance investigations or are forced to place  employees in unfulfilling positions while they wait unacceptable  amounts of time for their investigations to be completed.                                time  1415    Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate to live in a country with selfless  citizens who seek to serve our Nation in critical national security  positions and work towards safety at home and abroad. We need these  bright minds to solve incredibly difficult problems and develop the  next generation of American-made technology. We should reward them for  choosing to work toward something greater than themselves, not punish  them with jobs they don't want just because our bureaucracies can't  move fast enough.   I introduced the SECRET Act so Congress can do its job of oversight  better. The transparency afforded in this bill will better inform us of  how substantial the security clearance backlog is and how long it takes  for investigations to be completed. Equipped with that information, we  will hold the executive branch accountable and keep our country safe.   I thank Chairman Gowdy and his committee staff for the diligent work  on this bill, and I urge my colleagues for their support.
