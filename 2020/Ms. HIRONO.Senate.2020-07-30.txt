 Mr. President, I would say that the views expressed by  the good Senator from Missouri are not views widely shared by people in  this country. And to compare the decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson and  the Dred Scott decisions with the Roe decision dishonors the memory of  Congressman John Lewis, who only today was buried, put to rest in  Georgia.                                 Coronavirus    Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the systemic  racial inequities, inequalities in our healthcare system.   While the virus has touched Americans of every race and nationality,  it disproportionately impacts people of color. We all know that. People  of color make up just 40 percent of our country's population but  account for over 60 percent of all coronavirus cases and 50 percent of  deaths from coronavirus.   These inequities manifest themselves differently in each of our  States. In Hawaii, for example, we are seeing pronounced disparities  among our Pacific Islander community and particularly among citizens of  the Freely Associated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and  Palau. I am focusing my remarks on this vibrant community today because  our country has rarely done right by them. Let me give you some  background.   After liberating their territory in World War II, the United States  administered the Trust Territory of the Pacific--which includes what  are now the Freely Associated States--for nearly 40 years. Even in the  most generous characterization, the United States failed to live up to  its trust obligations to promote the political, social, and economic  development of the region.    In addition to chronically underfunding social programs like  healthcare and education, the United States used the Marshall Islands  as a base for dozens of nuclear tests over a 12-year period, from 1946  to 1958, including the 15-megaton Castle Bravo--the largest  thermonuclear device ever detonated by the United States. Decades  later, the citizens of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands continued to  suffer generational health consequences with substantially increased  rates of cancer, birth defects, and miscarriages.   In 1986, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the  Marshall Islands achieved independence and formally entered into  Compacts of Free Association, COFA, with the United States. Palau  followed in 1994. Under the terms of these compacts, these three  countries provide the U.S. military with exclusive access to their  strategically situated lands in exchange for security guarantees,  economic and financial assistance, and the right of their citizens to  travel, work, and live in the United States without having visas.   It is difficult to overstate the importance of the compacts to our  strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. In a Senate Armed  Services Committee hearing last year, U.S. INDOPACOM Commander ADM  Philip Davidson succinctly noted how the compact nations ``contribute  way out of proportion to their population in our defense.'' This is  particularly true with respect to China, wherein our compacts with  these island nations enable us to literally hold the line against  aggressive Chinese economic and military expansion throughout Oceania.   If we are to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, we must treat the  compact nations with the respect they deserve. First and foremost, this  means keeping the promises we have made to these partners, especially  on healthcare. Our initial compact agreements stipulated that COFA  citizens were eligible for a range of Federal programs as ``permanently  residing under color of law,'' including Medicaid coverage. The so- called welfare reform law of 1996, however, resulted in COFA citizens'  suddenly becoming ineligible for Medicaid and other Federal programs  even as they may live in the United States legally and indefinitely.   I have done some research as to what happened in the welfare reform  law, and there is absolutely nothing in the legislative history of that  law to indicate why, suddenly, COFA citizens were not eligible for  Medicaid coverage. According to a report from the University of Hawaii  Economic Research Organization, the exclusion of COFA citizens from  Medicaid increased the mortality rate of COFA citizens by 20 percent  and contributed to significant public health issues in my home State of  Hawaii.   I have led the fight to pass bipartisan legislation to restore  Medicaid eligibility for COFA citizens throughout my time in the  Senate, and we have come close to righting this wrong on several  occasions, including in the bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill  that the Senate passed in 2013.   The COVID-19 pandemic injects a new urgency into this effort. All  across the country, COFA citizens work in essential industries like  meat processing, food service, and custodial services. These jobs put  COFA citizens at an increased risk, and they are suffering  disproportionately from COVID-19 as a result.   In Hawaii, Pacific Islanders make up about 4 percent of our  population but account for nearly a quarter of our COVID-19 cases. In  northwest Arkansas, the Marshallese make up no more than 3 percent of  the population but have suffered half the deaths. In Dubuque, IA, the  Marshallese community accounts for more than a third of the city's  COVID-19 deaths despite their making up only about 1 percent of the  city's population.   A number of factors drives these disparities, but reduced access to  healthcare certainly isn't helping. In fact, it is hurting a lot. The  Government Accountability Office estimates that 14 percent of COFA  citizens in Hawaii lack health insurance--nearly three times the  State's average. Nationwide, 22 percent of COFA citizens are uninsured.   In the absence of restored Medicaid eligibility, which would  certainly lower the number of uninsured COFA citizens, our community  health centers are, once again, stepping up. My conversations earlier  this month with representatives from Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive  Family Services and West Hawaii Community Health Center reinforced the  crucial role these community health centers play in building reciprocal  trust with the communities they serve. Both community health centers  have been working closely with COFA citizens to combat stigma and fear  by reaching out directly to the community to encourage them to seek  care. This includes providing testing and outreach services in multiple  languages. They have also been coordinating food deliveries to  families, including to COFA citizens who are quarantining at home, and  assisting some families with alternate housing arrangements so they can  isolate away from healthy family members.   Our health centers are doing exceptional work with COFA citizens, and  I strongly support providing them robust funding in the next COVID-19  relief bill.   Most importantly, we need to uphold our commitment to the compact  nations and restore Medicaid eligibility for COFA citizens who are  legally in our country. We can do that by including my Covering our FAS  Allies Act to restore Medicaid eligibility for COFA citizens in the  next COVID relief bill. In the Heroes Act, the House has already  restored eligibility to this population, and it is time for the Senate  to join them in righting an historic wrong.   I yield the floor.
