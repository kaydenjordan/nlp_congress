 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of getting the  American people the help they need and getting it to them fast.   The budget resolution before us today is simple. It allows Congress  to act quickly to deliver much-needed assistance to the American people  so that we can defeat this pandemic. That means more survival checks,  enhanced unemployment benefits, new grants and loans for small  businesses, State and local aid, education funding, faster  vaccinations, and much more.   This winter has been the most challenging period of the COVID-19  crisis. People have been driven to desperation with skyrocketing cases,  hospitalizations, and 440,000 deaths nationwide. But now we see the  light at the end of the tunnel.   Every day, over a million more Americans receive safe and effective  vaccines, and that rate is increasing. That means that it is absolutely  crucial for Congress to act now to provide enough stimulus and support  so that our economy, healthcare facilities, local governments, and  schools have the resources needed to survive and begin to recover.   The urgency can't be overstated. Last year, Republicans allowed  unemployment benefits to expire and pushed 8 million Americans into  poverty. By acting now, we can avert a repeat of this disaster when  benefits expire again in just 6 short weeks. We can make substantial  improvements to make sure that we have a more inclusive recovery that  includes low-wage workers and immigrant families.   Let's pass this bill and truly help the American people.
