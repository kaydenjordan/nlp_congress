 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our Speaker,  Kevin McCarthy.   Let's be very clear here. We would not have a House Republican  majority without the relentless efforts of this man, our Speaker.   Under his leadership, Joe Biden's policies have had a check and  balance. His policies have created a horrific border crisis--10,000  illegal immigrants a day surging across our border. Under Speaker  McCarthy, Republicans have passed legislation to secure our border.   Joe Biden has done everything to squash American energy, selling our  oil reserves to China. Under Speaker McCarthy, Republicans have passed  legislation to unleash American energy dominance.   Joe Biden has spent taxpayer dollars like there is no tomorrow. Under  Speaker McCarthy, we have returned to passing single-subject  appropriations bills and ending the status quo of omnibus spending.   One of the most valuable pieces of advice that I received was from  Kevin McCarthy when I got here to D.C. He told me to separate the  signal from the noise. The noise is those who are causing chaos for  their own personal benefit while ignoring the needs of their  constituents and this country, grinding our work here to a halt. The  signal is the many accomplishments that we have delivered for the  American people with Speaker McCarthy at the helm. The signal is the  failures coming out of the White House time and time again. The signal  is the work that we must do today and going forward to save our country  for my kids and yours.    My colleagues here today have a choice: Be a chaos agent or get back  to work. I call on my colleagues: Let's separate the signal from the  noise. Let's support our Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, so we can get back to  work for the American people.
