 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and colleague  for arranging this conversation.   I want to join my colleagues and a mourning nation today as we  continue to honor the legacy of President George H.W. Bush, a giant of  a man that we should all aspire to be.   He was also a man of integrity who focused on his family and his  faith. He was a loving and caring husband, father, grandfather, and  great-grandfather who treated his friends and his foes with kindness,  civility, and respect.   I will be forever grateful that he fell in love with Texas A&M  University, my alma mater, because that is where I had the opportunity  of meeting and becoming friends with the late President.   He encouraged me to join the CIA and had a lasting impact on me and  many of my peers to answer the call to service and work toward causes  greater than ourselves. I will be forever grateful for him instilling  this spirit in me.   Forty-one was the epitome of a public servant and a beacon of light  in this world embodying America at its best.   Rest in peace, Mr. President. Thank you for your selfless service,  and thank you for being an example to us all.                                time  2000
