 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2460, the  first piece of legislation I have introduced as a Member of Congress  and one that reduces the regulatory burden on the hardworking men and  women of Indiana and America's transportation and agriculture  community.   The Modernizing Agricultural Transportation Act of 2019 will ensure  our truckers, farmers, and producers have the flexibility needed to  keep America's agriculture industry moving.   The bill ensures that transportation and agriculture stakeholders are  included in the rulemaking process so that relevant stakeholders can  share their experiences and knowledge.   I am proud to lead this bipartisan effort with House Agriculture  Committee Chairman Collin Peterson of Minnesota.   Improving our infrastructure is not a partisan issue, and it is time  that we act. Sixth District Hoosiers sent me to Washington to get  things done, and that is exactly what I am doing.   I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2460.                            ____________________
