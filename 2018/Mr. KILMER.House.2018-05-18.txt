 Mr. Speaker, the farm bill is supposed to be about  people, but this bill is not. It doesn't help the farmer I met in  Chimacum, who said he  [[Page H4212]]  knows there is a whole lot for big corporations in this bill but not  enough for family farmers like him who want to plant something in their  ground other than a for sale sign.   This bill is a step backward for the families that I met a few weeks  ago who stand in line at St. Leo emergency food pantry in Tacoma and  sometimes wait for hours so that they can feed their kids and make ends  meet while they look for jobs.   This bill cuts the safety net that helps dairy farmers I met with in  Grays Harbor when our changing climate floods their fields and turns  acres of soil to dust.   The majority claims they want to rebuild our rural economies, but  this bill cuts rural development grants that help business owners in  Forks and Sequim keep the lights on.   You know, I haven't received one letter of support for what we are  voting on today. The only people I have heard from are D.C. insiders  who have misguided notions about real families struggling to make ends  meet. This bill doesn't care enough about real farmers counting on this  bill, and the families in St. Leo and the 1.5 million veterans and  22,000 servicemembers who feed their families with nutrition  assistance.   It is wrong, Mr. Speaker, and it is another example why so many  people are losing their faith in government. Let's vote this down and  put together a bipartisan farm bill that does more to help people.                            ____________________
