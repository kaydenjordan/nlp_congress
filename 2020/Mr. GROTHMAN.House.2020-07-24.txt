 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address what I guess I  will refer to as the statue bill that we passed a couple days ago in  this House.   It was well known all the statues that were supposed to be removed  there. And to be honest, I always bristle a little bit when I hear Mr.  Stephens from Georgia, the former vice president of the Confederacy,  getting a statue in this building.   However, I don't think enough people knew that in that bill, we are  also going to require a statue or bust of Thurgood Marshall.   In 1973, during Roe v. Wade, Justice Marshall was one of seven  Justices who found a right to abortion, after it was illegal in this  country for years and years, found a right to abortion in the  Constitution put together by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison.   Worse, in the deliberations, there originally was going to be  abortion allowed in the first 3 months. Justice Marshall, along with  Justice Brennan, weighed in to make it until viability. So the United  States is, right now, one of only seven countries in the world to allow  abortions this late, which is really just a horrific thing.   I will say, if his bust is ever put in the Capitol, or a statue, I  will always remember in 1973 when Justice Marshall was one of the ones  who weighed in to legalize abortion in the country as well as weighed  in to make sure we were one of seven countries to allow abortion up to  viability.                            ____________________
