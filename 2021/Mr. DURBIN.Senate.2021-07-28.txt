 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess from 1:10 p.m. until 1:55 p.m. today. I further ask  that all postcloture time on the Wilcox nomination expire at 2:45 p.m.  today.    Mr. President, yesterday, Congressman Bennie Thompson  called to order the first hearing of the special committee that most of  our Republican colleagues have tried to block, the Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.   It continues to amaze me that an independent, bipartisan committee to  investigate the worst assault on our democracy since the War of 1812,  an assault that left one police officer dead and more than 140 injured,  was filibustered and stopped in its tracks by the Republican leader of  the Senate, Mitch McConnell.   That is exactly what he did. He tried to conceal the truth about what  happened on January 6. He tried to hide it from the American people and  to do this without police officers in this building noticing, many of  whom risked their lives on that day. Well, we saw yesterday that he  failed. Senator McConnell failed to stop the investigation. We are  going to learn what  [[Page S5120]]  happened on January 6, despite his effort to stop it.   During the first hearing of the select committee yesterday, we heard  testimony from four police officers who battled the mob for hours on  January 6. Many of us witnessed it. Two members of the Capitol Police  Force and two from the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington,  DC, testified. These officers were brutalized in hand-to-hand combat.  Some thought they were going to die. And they are still grappling with  the physical and emotional trauma they suffered.   Officer Harry Dunn recounted yesterday how the mob of the former  President's supporters chanted the N-word in his face.   Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone testified that members of  the mob attempted to steal his service weapon and kill him with it. He  was dragged into the mob, tasered repeatedly, and beaten unconscious.  He suffered a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury. This is what  Officer Fanone said yesterday: ``My fellow citizens, including so many  of the people I put my life at risk to defend, are downplaying or  outright denying what happened. I feel like I went to hell'' he said,  ``and [came] back to protect them and the people in this room. But too  many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell wasn't  exactly that bad.''   Is that how we are going to treat police officers in the Capitol? I  ask that of the Senators and the House Members.   They risk their lives every day to defend us, to defend this  building, to defend what it stands for. Instead of thanking them, are  some of my colleagues going to deny the brutality that they faced? That  cannot be. These brave officers deserve better. At the very least, they  deserve that the truth be told.   One of the most searing images from January 6 was that of a police  officer screaming in agony as he was pinned against the metal door and  beaten by this insurrectionist mob.   Yesterday, that man, Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, told  the select committee: ``There can be no moving on without  accountability. There can be no healing without making sure this will  never happen again.''   To all of the police officers who held the line on January 6, let me  say clearly: You defended the American democracy. You didn't just  defend this building and the Members of Congress. And if not for your  heroism and sacrifice, the terrible toll of that day would have been  far worse. Take solace in the fact that you did your duty.   But there are Members of the Senate and the House who are failing to  do theirs. Right now, this Senate has a chance to finally do right by  our police officers.   Yesterday, Chairman Leahy and Vice Chairman Shelby announced a  bipartisan $2.1 billion security supplemental funding package that will  not only pay the salaries of our Capitol Police officers, it will  increase security at the Capitol. It will reimburse the National  Guardsmen who were deployed to defend this building after January 6--a  great sacrifice.   That package would also provide relief to another group of heroes who  risked their lives for America and who did so on foreign soil: our  civilian partners in Afghanistan. This package would provide an  additional 8,000 special immigrant visas to Afghan interpreters who  supported our diplomats and troops on the frontlines of America's  longest war.   As we begin to finally bring our troops home from Afghanistan, let's  not forget the heroes who supported them and risked their lives to help  them. Many of these individuals and their families are no longer safe  if the Taliban takes control. We need to give them a new home in  America. I am glad this bill provides the means to do so.   I thank Senator Leahy for leading the negotiations. I hope every  Senator will support it.   Yesterday, Officer Harry Dunn told the Select Committee about the  anxiety he and other officers felt when the remaining security fence  around the Capitol was taken down, but little else has been done to  protect this building from another mob insurrection.   Officer Dunn said: ``When that fence came down--when we lost that  last layer of protection--that was hard. . . . The fence came down and  still nothing has changed. Everything is different, but still nothing  has changed.''   This is the time to show the officers who protected us and the world  that when you defend America in our time of need, we will stand by you.  I urge all my colleagues to support the security supplemental bill. It  is the least that we can do.   Mr. President, there is one other thing I would like to say. It is  just too close to call. I thought about it long and hard, and it is  just too close to call.   In an effort to plumb the depths of political meanness and  irresponsibility, it is just hard to choose between Tucker Carlson and  Laura Ingraham. First, they became our Nation's leading anti-vax  quacks, making their specious arguments against lifesaving COVID-19  vaccines and sowing doubt among their viewers, who were literally  putting their lives at risk because of the lies that these two  individuals are spouting. And now--and now--they are creating a braying  chorus focused on defaming the police who defended this building on  January 6.   Their mockery of the bravery of the Capitol and DC police, who risked  and some lost their lives on the January 6 attack on the Capitol  Building, is cowardly and shameful.   It took courage for the police to face the Trump mob. It takes no  courage for these FOX talking-heads to belittle these officers. It  takes no courage to practice their well-worn smirks reacting to the  bravery of these policemen.   It is hard to imagine reading a press account of what they said  yesterday and last night about the hearing that took place, the things  that they did. Ingraham gave the ``best performance in an action role''  to Washington Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who, during  the testimony, recalled fearing he would be shot with his own gun.   Ingraham said: ``Well, there was certainly a lot of violence that  day, but it was not a terrorist attack. It wasn't 9/11. It wasn't the  worst thing that ever happened to America. It wasn't an insurrection.''   And then Tucker Carlson responded with a smirk to the footage of  Fanone telling the hearing he had experienced post-traumatic stress  disorder.   Throughout the monologue, Carlson piled onto his previous claims  about the violence just being a ``political protest that got out of  hand.''   First the vaccines and now defaming the police--this is irresponsible  from start to finish. I would ask those at FOX network, not exactly my  friends and allies in politics, to show common decency and common  sense--common sense when it comes to these vaccines, which we know if  more people were vaccinated we wouldn't be facing this resurgent need  for masks and fear of this new variant. And common decency when it  comes to the men and women in uniform when it comes to risking their  lives for this Capitol, this democracy, and this government. Certainly,  there is freedom of speech, but let's hope that good sense will  dominate this discussion over at the FOX network as to whether these  two ought to be allowed to continue their rant.
