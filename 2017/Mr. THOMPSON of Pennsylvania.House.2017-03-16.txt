 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend  the efforts of Penn State Extension, which is an educational network  that gives the people in Pennsylvania's 67 counties access to the  university's resources and expertise, especially its agricultural  resources as a land-grant university.   Cooperative extension services began in 1914. The Smith-Lever Act  established a system of cooperative extension services connected to the  land-grant universities in order to inform people about the current  developments in agriculture, home economics, public policy and  government, leadership,  4-H, economic development, coastal issues, and many other related  subjects. It helped farmers learn new agricultural techniques by the  introduction of home instruction.   Since its inception, it has been focused on informal, noncredit adult  continuing education. Thus, cooperative extension is not a service, but  a scholarly content-driven educational mission of the university. This  program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, State, and  county governments. Through these county-based partnerships, Penn State  Extension educators, faculty, and local volunteers work together to  share unbiased, research-based information with local residents.   Penn State Extension can help you become a master gardener. It helps  teach families how to prepare and preserve food safely. It can help you  learn about how to start a home-based business or how to properly  prepare tax forms. Penn State Extension helps individuals, families,  businesses, and communities throughout Pennsylvania with information  and a broad range of educational programs.   Everyone in the community can tap into the assets and information of  our major research university, and there are numerous ways to learn.  You can attend an educational event, take an online course, read a  publication, or speak face-to-face with an extension educator. There is  no shortage of learning opportunities with Penn State Extension.   Mr. Speaker, this is just one way that Penn State is extending  knowledge and improving the quality of life for all Pennsylvanians. The  programs are very localized and touch every county in the State through  21 separate districts. Extension is particularly helpful to farmers and  those involved in the agriculture industry, which is Pennsylvania's  number one economic driver.   Whether you are a beginning farmer or you have a few years under your  belt, it is good to know you are not in the farming world alone.  Extension activities can help connect you with others to share ideas,  trials, and tribulations. In fact, Federal cooperative extension  programs have helped more than 137,000 farmers stay in business just  since 1985. Without cooperative extension and the underlying research,  researchers have estimated that the country would have lost 28 percent  more farmers than those who actually left agriculture.   Who would feed us? Who would provide that food, fiber, building  materials, even forms of energy that our farmers and farm families do  today?   By design, extension is locally directed and responsive to the needs  of local communities. I am grateful that Penn State is one of those  land-grant universities and can offer this service to the public. It  helps keep our local farmers abreast of the most up-to-date information  that impacts the industry and impacts the lives of families. It helps  promote lifelong learning and provides invaluable support and  assistance to our communities. That is something for which we can all  be very proud.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, a healthy diet for many  Americans may have nothing to do with commitment, but, rather,  accessibility.   Limited access to supermarkets and grocery stores with fresh  nutritional food can be a challenge in both rural and urban  communities. These are often called food deserts.   This is a particular concern for the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, or SNAP, which intends to provide nutrition to  millions of Americans.   According to the USDA, to qualify as a low-access community, at least  500 people and/or at least 33 percent of the population must reside  more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store. For rural  areas, the distance is more than 10 miles.   It is difficult to eat healthy when the easiest store to get to  primarily provides packaged and processed food. SNAP recipients may  find a local market convenient, but it often offers high-calorie foods  with minimal nutritional value. These foods can often be a staple for  families with limited resources.   It is my hope that we can increase access to fresh food for  communities throughout the country. Our families deserve no less.   I look forward to working with the Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee  to continue to look at the SNAP program so that it serves those it is  intended to serve.                            ____________________
