 I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Massachusetts  (Ms. Warren), and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, we have seen too many Trump judicial  nominees in recent years who don't know their way around a courtroom. I  suspect some of these nominees never even made it through a ``Law and  Order'' episode.   The majority leader is now rushing a floor vote on Justin Walker,  nominated to be a district court judge in Kentucky. Mr. Walker was just  reported out of committee last week. The Walker nomination is  leapfrogging a dozen other judicial nominees who have been on the  calendar longer.   The American Bar Association, which does peer review evaluations of  nominees, concluded that--Mr. Walker is not qualified to be a Federal  trial judge. This is the eighth Trump judicial nominee to be rated  ``not qualified'' by the ABA.   Mr. Walker is 37 years old and has been out of law school for only 10  years. He has never tried a case as lead or cocounsel, whether civil or  criminal. He has only conducted a single deposition.   The ABA said that with Walker, ``it was challenging to determine how  much of his ten years since graduation from law school has been spent  in the practice of law.''   I find it hard to believe that there is a shortage of experienced,  qualified attorneys or State court judges in Kentucky who could hit the  ground running as a Federal trial judge. In fact, there is an  experienced Kentucky State court judge sitting on the Senate Executive  Calendar right now--David Tapp, whose nomination to the Court of  Federal Claims I supported in the Judiciary Committee. Why can't we get  district court nominees who actually know what they are doing in the  courtroom, like Judge Tapp?   Rather than gaining actual courtroom experience, Mr. Walker has spent  much of his time in recent years making media appearances. In 2018  alone, he appeared on TV or radio 127 times. That is not what we need  on the Federal bench.   I will oppose the Walker nomination. He simply lacks the litigation  and trial experience to serve as a district court judge.                            ____________________
