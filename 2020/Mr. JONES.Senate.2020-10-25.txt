 Madam President, I rise today to remember Col.  Duane A. Kuhlmann, a longtime resident of Spanish Fort, AL, who died on  September 23, 2020. It is with humility and sadness that we pause to  mark the passing of yet another member of the ``greatest generation,''  a brave and dedicated patriot, a leader, and a beloved husband and  father.   Born to first-generation Americans in Iowa and raised in Byron, MN,  Duane volunteered for the Army Air Corps at age 19, soon after the  Pearl Harbor bombing. After a medical issue delayed his training, Duane  joined the fight in the Pacific in 1944 flying the P-40, before closing  out the war in the P-51. After the Japanese surrender, he spent the  next year as part of the U.S. occupation of Japan. Soon after returning  stateside, Duane married Dorothy Guenther, and together they had seven  children, two of whom served their country as officers in the U.S.  Navy. After the war, Duane continued to fly the P-51 and was a  demonstration pilot for his squadron. Later he and his squadron  transitioned to jets, flying the F-84. His squadron was ordered to join  the Korean conflict, but after prepositioning in Japan they were  ordered back to Turner Air Force Base in Georgia. Duane's Air Force  career took the family to Albany, GA; Ephrata, WA; Wiesbaden, Germany;  Montgomery, AL; Sumter, SC; San Antonio, TX; and finally Dayton, OH.   During the Vietnam conflict, Duane led his squadron of RB-66 aircraft  across the Pacific to provide electronic and reconnaissance support for  our troops. Two years later, he led the same squadron to Vietnam for a  second tour of duty, this time providing `recce' support flying the RF- 4 phantom over Hanoi and Haiphong harbor.   Colonel Kuhlmann retired from the Air Force in 1974 in Dayton, OH, as  vice commander of Defense Electronics Systems Command. He was awarded  the Legion of Merit in 1974 and accumulated numerous air medals  throughout his distinguished career.   My wife Louise and I extend our gratitude for Colonel Kulhmann's  service, as well as our condolences for his loss to his children John  Kuhlmann and his wife Rosie, Jenny Kuhlmann Zinn and her husband Bob,  Tom Kuhlmann, Karen Sher and her husband Andy, Fritzie Kuhlmann Bassel  and her husband Steve, Greg Kuhlmann and his wife Stephanie, Chris  Kuhlmann and his wife Dani, and to his 19 grandchildren an 24 great  grandchildren.   Though not a native son, Duane chose to spend the last years of his  life in Alabama, joining the roughly 400,000 other veterans living  there whose service and sacrifices have brought honor to our great  State.   Colonel Kuhlmann, after a life well-lived, may you rest in  peace.                            ____________________
