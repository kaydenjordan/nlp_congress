 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1532.   Some studies suggest that small-dollar mortgages, which are amounts  less than $70,000, may be disproportionately denied compared to loans  of higher amounts, even when credit profiles are similar.   If true, this could be an issue for families in my district and  across the country who are trying to buy their first home, particularly  in rural America.   H.R. 1532 is a bipartisan bill reported last Congress by the House  Financial Services Committee that seeks to understand the challenges  associated with small-dollar lending and why.   This bill asks the fundamental questions: Why not have the FHA review  its own policies? Why shouldn't the FHA look to determine whether there  are borrowers who would otherwise qualify for a mortgage and who are  being left out of the market as an unintended consequence of the FHA's  own regulations?   After all, the FHA's mission is to serve creditworthy borrowers who  are underserved by the private market. This includes serving without  bias as to how small a loan seeking insurance should be or might be.   Moreover, the FHA should understand whether its own regulations are  hurting borrowers' access to credit and remedy the problem without  affecting the health of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which is at  issue.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues on the  subcommittee, in particular Mr. Cleaver and Ranking Member Stivers, for  bringing this issue to our attention and for their work on this  important bill.   H.R. 1532 is a positive example of Congress identifying a problem and  working together in a bipartisan way to understand the causes and to  identify a reasonable solution.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I do not.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1491, the Fair Debt  Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act.   I thank Representative Dean for offering this legislation.   Madam Speaker, our servicemembers put their lives on the line for us  every day. To that end, we must ensure they are adequately protected  from abuse or harassment related to outstanding debt. I am pleased that  we were able to work in a bipartisan fashion to meet this goal.   H.R. 1491 prohibits debt collectors from using threats against a  servicemember's rank or security clearance, or threats of prosecution  under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Not only are such practices  unfair, they also create the risk of harm to military readiness.   Last Congress, during the committee markup of H.R. 1491, Republicans  expressed concerns that there were too many unanswered questions about  how this bill could impact military readiness. The gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Stivers), who has had a distinguished career in our military,  offered an amendment, which directs the Comptroller General of the  United States to conduct a study on the impact this bill has on  readiness with servicemembers regarding debts in collection, as well as  military readiness and national security. This commonsense approach  ensures that Congress understands and is able to account for the  connection between national security and the protection of  servicemembers from unfair practices.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Democrat majority for accepting this  amendment, and I am glad that it continues to be included in this bill  we are considering today. This makes this a far more lasting bill, I  believe, and more impactful on the people that the author and this  Congress want to ensure are taken care of, and those are the folks who  serve and protect us each and every day.   As a reminder, this bill passed the House unanimously in March of  last year.   All Americans deserve to be treated with dignity and respect when  faced with repaying a debt. This is especially true for our  servicemembers, who fight for our freedoms every day.   Madam Speaker, this bill contains important safeguards. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty) for all of her hard work on H.R. 1395, the Housing Financial  Literacy Act of 2021.   The Federal Housing Administration, FHA, currently provides  government-backed mortgage insurance to more than $1.3 trillion in  loans. FHA insurance allows a wide array of borrowers to qualify for  mortgages. This includes many low- and moderate-income families who  might not otherwise have access to credit through traditional  underwriting.   In fiscal year 2020, the FHA insured over 800,000 forward mortgage  purchase loans, with more than 83 percent going to first-time home  buyers. Given the large population of first-time home buyers using FHA,  it makes sense to encourage those individuals to seek out ways to  strengthen their financial knowledge and better prepare them for the  challenges of homeownership.   Right now, current law states that FHA has the ability to provide  first-time homeowners with a discount on their FHA upfront premiums.  However, the homeowner must complete an approved homeownership  financial counseling course.   Yet, the statute is drafted in such a way that the provision only  applies in particular circumstances. This includes when FHA upfront  premiums exceed 2.75 percent. Since FHA upfront premiums are currently  set at 1.75 percent, the rate has not been exceeded in a decade. Thus,  FHA does not currently provide an upfront premium discount to first- time home buyers who complete a financial counseling course.   H.R. 1395 would amend current law to require FHA to provide a one- quarter percent upfront premium discount, from the prevailing rate, in  order to help those first-time home buyers get financial literacy and  then get the discount. This equates to about $625 of savings off the  current premium structure on a $250,000 mortgage. This is not an  insignificant amount.   Given the nature of this, I think it is great to have a financial  benefit for people understanding financial consequences. I think there  are many other areas in our government that would benefit from this  type of thinking.   The hope is that by making such a discount mandatory, more first-time  home buyers will seek out financial literacy counseling which, in turn,  will produce better outcomes for a traditionally at-risk group of home  buyers.   The bottom line is that FHA is a valuable tool to help expand the  universe of mortgage credit in our housing system. We ought to be doing  all that we can to ensure that we are using our limited public  resources to encourage all borrowers to be well-prepared for the  commitments of homeownership through financial counseling or through  other effective means of creating more stable and reliable borrowers.   So I think this is a very good bill thoughtfully done by Mrs. Beatty,  and it is bipartisan, coming out of committee last Congress.   Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers. I urge its adoption, I ask my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1565, the Senior Security  Act.  [[Page H1912]]    I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr. Hollingsworth of Indiana and  Mr. Gottheimer of New Jersey for their work on this important piece of  bipartisan legislation that will strengthen current efforts to protect  senior investors.   Madam Speaker, American capital markets provide every mom-and-pop  investor with the opportunity to realize the American Dream. Our  capital markets allow individuals and families to grow their nest egg  for retirement, their children to have an opportunity for college  tuition, or to save and purchase a home.   Moreover, as Americans age, they are an important part of the success  and vibrancy of the U.S. capital markets. In fact, Americans over the  age of 50 already account for roughly 77 percent of financial assets in  the United States. To that end, fraud and exploitation of any kind in  our capital markets threatens the integrity of our markets and harm  investors seeking to build their nest eggs.   It is especially problematic when the fraud targets senior investors.  Protecting senior investors and preventing such predatory behavior  within our financial markets is a goal that we all share, regardless of  party. This bill will support the Securities and Exchange Commission's  current efforts to protect against increasing instances of financial  exploitation against senior investors.   H.R. 1565 creates an interdivisional task force at the Securities and  Exchange Commission to examine and identify challenges faced by senior  investors.   We already have some data on senior citizens who are targeted by  financial exploitation. These statistics are alarming. Older Americans  lose up to $36 billion each year to financial scams and abuse. One in  five seniors have reported being victims of exploitation, and only a  small number of cases of financial abuse are even reported. The rates  of exploitation are only rising. In fact, The New England Journal of  Medicine calls elder financial exploitation a virtual epidemic.   There are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated  the trend. In addition to Congress, many States are already taking  action, and that is a good thing.   This bipartisan bill is an important step for the Federal Government.  The bill requires the SEC to identify current issues and challenges  facing senior investors and to make policy recommendations for  addressing these issues harming senior investors.   Madam Speaker, protecting senior investors and safeguarding the  integrity of our financial markets are objectives I believe we can get  behind. In our duty to protect our constituents, especially those most  vulnerable who contribute so much to society, we need to be helpful and  supportive. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), the coauthor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1528, the Promoting  Transparent Standards for Corporate Insiders Act.   As my colleague stated, this is bipartisan legislation that strikes  an important balance. It protects retail investors in the market from  illicit insider trading while, at the same time, ensuring that the  rules governing insider trading are clear, fair, and not prohibitively  onerous.   I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill last Congress, and I  think they should do so this Congress. Thwarting and punishing fraud  and abuse within our financial markets is not a Republican or Democrat  issue. This includes illegal insider trading. When a corporate insider  gains an unfair advantage by violating current insider trading rules  and trading on material nonpublic information, that illegal behavior  harms Main Street investors.                                time  1615    It harms those who diligently put their hard-earned money aside for  retirement.   It is important to note that not every corporate insider or executive  trading in the stock of his or her company is a bad actor. The  Securities and Exchange Commission's current rules and guidelines allow  corporate insiders to purchase and sell securities of their company  without fear of insider trading liability. Most corporate insiders  carefully follow this rule called rule 10b5-1, and they follow it to  the letter of the law.   Moreover, this rule ensures that insider trading guidelines are fair  tools when properly followed. These rules are designed to allow  corporate insiders to liquidate their stock options when needed, such  as when trying to pay for a child's education, buying a house, or  paying medical expenses.   Furthermore, allowing insiders to purchase and sell securities at a  predetermined time on a scheduled basis under rule 10b5-1 ensures  market stability.   This rule also decreases the risk of volatility by preventing  fraudulent behavior, such as the so-called pump-and-dump schemes that  some have tried to take advantage of.   This bill requires the SEC to study whether this current rule should  be amended. In studying the rule, the SEC is directed to consider how  any amendments would clarify and enhance existing prohibitions against  insider trading. Importantly, though, the bill also requires the SEC to  weigh any potential amendments against the important benefits of this  rule.   The SEC is also directed to consider what effects amending the rules  would have on attracting qualified candidates for open insider  positions, such as capital formation, and a company's willingness to go  public.   I am pleased that this is a bipartisan legislation that thoughtfully  balances the meaningful goals of protecting everyday investors with  facilitating economic growth opportunities, and I think that ensures  that we keep a healthy capital markets function here in the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on my side, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1996.   I want to begin by commending my colleague from Colorado, Mr.  Perlmutter, for the way that he has approached this legislation. He is  incorporating a lot of ideas from Members all across this Chamber and  from across the country. He has doggedly pursued this legislation for  many years, and I want to commend him for that.   I also want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Stivers and Mr. Joyce of  Ohio, for the way they have approached this bill. I think this is a  testament to constructive criticism of a bill and it becoming better as  a result of it.   Let me say, regardless of your position on this bill, I do think the  fact remains that cannabis is a prohibited substance under schedule I  of the Controlled Substances Act.   Let me further state that, by enacting this legislation, we are  effectively kneecapping law enforcement in legalizing money laundering.  These are concerns that I have, that still remain.   By effectively legalizing money laundering, we are inserting a new  level of risk in our financial system. We are preventing our legal  entities from doing their jobs. We are encouraging bad actors and  placing our financial institutions at risk.   Rather than dealing with the issues of cannabis and the question of  its Federal legalization, we are dealing with a component of the  challenge, which is the banking of it, and it is a challenge. I think  we are adding a new risk to our banking system and our anti-money  laundering reforms that we passed just in January of this year. That  seems counterintuitive to me.   For years, Congress has worked to reform our anti-money laundering  laws. Now, in one fell swoop, we are undoing a lot of that hard work  and we are going to make it easier for money launderers.   If you want to help the system, if you want to give financial  institutions the certainty and security they want and need to do the  job with the cannabis industry, where it is legalized in these  [[Page H1919]]  States, we should debate the merits of cannabis remaining a schedule I  substance, not pass a bill that skirts around the substance of the  issue.   This bill we are considering today is one of the biggest changes to  U.S. drug policy, yet it was done with little debate this Congress.  There has been a lot of debate overall in this Congress, far more than  the Senate has even had, on the question of cannabis.   This bill, which is really the first step in legalizing cannabis at  the Federal level, was reported out of the Financial Services Committee  last Congress, and it is a committee that really has no jurisdiction  over the Controlled Substances Act. We only had one hearing featuring  one panel of witnesses. We haven't had a hearing this Congress to  discuss changes over the last 2 years, let alone a markup to discuss  any changes that might strengthen or impact the bill.   For example, late last year, Congress passed a sweeping bipartisan  anti-money laundering piece of legislation. These reforms include  prohibitions on the concealment of sources of assets in monetary  transactions; a prohibition, I will add, that comes with a steep  penalty of up to 10 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines.   If we were doing our due diligence, we would have done a deeper  discussion on how these new AML Act changes would impact banks working  with cannabis industries as clients instead of me raising this issue at  the eleventh hour on the floor, which is what I have got to resort to.   In addition to this concern, I believe I have voiced many other  concerns, including our need to better comprehend and address the  supervisory and regulatory issues that would result from enactment of  H.R. 1996.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Ranking Member  Luetkemeyer of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial  Institutions and myself as ranking member of the full Committee on  Financial Services.                                          House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                     Washington, DC, March 21, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC.      Hon. Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial           Institutions, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Meeks: We write today       to seek your agreement to delay consideration of H.R. 1595,       the SAFE Act, currently scheduled to be marked up on March       26, 2019, until the Committee has a better understanding of       the full range of consequences that enacting such legislation       may trigger. As you know, marijuana is a schedule I       controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. Sec. 802. The       impact that many state laws, which have legalized marijuana,       have on the federal laws governing the manufacturing, use,       and sale of marijuana, including proceeds, raise many       questions and concerns. Any change to these statutes, or       those that impact them, has the potential to divide the       Congress and the country. We must ensure that Congress has       done its due diligence, including conducting thorough       oversight and review, before moving such legislation.        The hearing at the Committee on Financial Services on       February 13, 2019, made clear that we need to better       comprehend and address the supervisory and regulatory issues       that would result from enactment of H.R. 1595. Many       outstanding questions remain, which include but are not       limited to the following:        1. What changes to our banking laws are necessary to       implement the SAFE Banking Act or other legislation creating       a safe harbor for cannabis-related businesses?        2. How would individual agencies enforce Bank Secrecy Act       (BSA) requirements following enactment of the SAFE Banking       Act? What changes would be required of BSA requirements?        3. How would individual agencies enforce anti-money       laundering (AML) regulations following enactment of the SAFE       Banking Act? Would AML reforms be necessary?        4. How would individual agencies enforce Know Your Customer       (KYC) rules following enactment of the SAFE Banking Act? What       changes would be required of KYC rules?        5. How would individual agencies enforce Suspicious       Activity Report (SAR) filing requirements and guidelines       following passage of the SAFE Banking Act? What changes would       be required of SAR filing requirements and guidelines to       ensure illicit financial activities were not being financed?        6. How would individual agencies enforce Currency       Transaction Report (CTR) filing requirements and guidelines       following enactment of the SAFE Banking Act? What changes       would be required of CTR filing requirements and guidelines?        7. In what ways are agencies working with state       counterparts, including state banking and securities       supervisors, under the existing regime? How would those       cooperative relationships change with enactment of H.R. 1595?        8. Would H.R. 1595 require conforming changes to any of the       statues, rules, and requirements previously listed to ensure       there are no unintended consequences, such as cartels and       other bad actors gaining access to our financial system?        9. Would the safe harbor require any changes to the rules       or processes governing federal deposit insurance systems?        10. What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on nonbank       financial firms, including insurers and investment companies?        11. What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on third       parties, including payment processors?        12, What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on individual       and institutional investors of cannibis-related businesses?        13. What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on federal,       state, and local law enforcement, including the Department of       Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency?        14. How are the proceeds from state licensed growers and       distributers taxed under federal law? Relatedly, what       conforming changes to our tax code are necessary?        15. What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on other       products and services offered by financial institutions,       including but not limited to mortgage products, deposit       advance products or general commercial lending?        As Members of Congress, and the Committee of primary       jurisdiction, we owe it to our constituents and to the public       to fully understand the implications of any legislation       before supporting or opposing it. We urge you to hold H.R.       1595 and any related legislation until we have a full       understanding of the consequences of this bill.            Sincerely,      Patrick McHenry        Ranking Member.      Blaine Luetkemeyer,        Ranking Member.    Mr. Speaker, this letter raises a number of concerns,  including:   What changes to our banking laws are necessary to implement the SAFE  Banking Act, a number of questions that I have;   What agencies are going to be necessary for this working group to  actually ensure that the letter of this law is adhered to by the  executive branch, that they actually follow it as the writer of the  legislation intends;   How the executive branch will interpret the ``know your customer''  rules enacted in the SAFE Banking Act, compared to what we enacted just  2 months ago, 3 months ago;   How we would deal with suspicious activity reporting requirements  under the new guidelines of the SAFE Banking Act, compared to what we  enacted at the end of last year;   How we deal with currency transaction reports under this law,  compared to what we just passed; and   What are the implications on nonbank financial firms as well, such as  insurers and investment companies.   Mr. Speaker, I think the author of the bill intends for insurers and  investment companies and banks to have the same qualifications when  they are handling money that has touched the cannabis industry. I think  that is the intent.                                time  1630    Mr. Speaker, I think we need to understand whether or not the  administration would follow that intent that the author has stated  clearly in debates here on the House floor last Congress and this  Congress and, furthermore, whether or not Federal, State, and local law  enforcement will have a similar interpretation that the writer of this  bill says is his intent, that Federal law enforcement should hear the  voice of Congress and hear this step to legalization which is part of  this bill.   I do not think it is the author of the bill's idea to get into sort  of the broader conversation about legalization at the State level and  what we should do at the Federal level in this bill. However, that is a  part of it.   In March of 2019, the National Sheriffs' Association voiced concern  with this bill, saying that it could easily be exploited. They echoed  my concerns that ``allowing banking access for a Schedule 1 drug gives  money laundering access to international drug cartels, which are  already using the cover of legalization.''   Mr. Speaker, I include that letter in the Record.  [[Page H1920]]                                 National Sheriffs' Association,                                                     March 19, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, House of Representatives, Committee on Financial           Services, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Committee on           Financial Services, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: On       behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) and more       than 3,080 sheriffs nationwide, I write to express our deep       concern and opposition to H.R. 1595, The SAFE Banking Act.       This bill creates protections for depository institutions       that provide financial services to cannabis-related       businesses and service providers for such businesses.        H.R. 1595 will increase the legalization of marijuana       across the Nation, which we understand is an intended       consequence of this bill. Furthermore, allowing banking       access for a Schedule 1 drug gives money laundering access to       international drug cartels, which are already using the cover       of legalization. This will inevitably open the door to other       criminal activity!        NSA is concerned with the welfare and safety of citizens       and works to preserve their rights to live and work in       communities where drug abuse is not accepted and they are not       subjected to the adverse effects of drug abuse. The dangers       of illegal drugs, including marijuana, and the threat to       public safety caused by their use in terms of highway safety,       criminal activity, and domestic violence are well-documented.        NSA believes that any legislation regarding national       legalization must engage the nation's law enforcement       agencies in order to have a comprehensive discussion       regarding the potential implications this bill could have on       our communities. We urge The House of Representatives to       defeat this dangerous bill.            Sincerely,                                              Jonathan F. Thompson,                                        Executive Director and CEO.    Furthermore, we see cannabis-legal States like  California, Washington, and Colorado, as the subject of recent news  reports that cartels have found that it is easier to grow and process  marijuana in legal States like Colorado and ship it throughout the  United States than it is to bring it from Mexico or Cuba. I include  that article in the Record, Mr. Speaker.                     [From Global Power, May 29, 2018]      Foreign Cartels Embrace Home-Grown Marijuana in Pot-Legal States  (By Dennis Romero, Gabe Gutierrez, Andrew Blankstein and Robert Powell)         Los Angeles.--General Jeff Sessions called it ``one of the       largest residential forfeiture actions in American history.''        In early April, local and federal authorities descended       upon 74 marijuana grow houses in the Sacramento area they say       were underwritten by Chinese organized crime. They filed       court paperwork to seize the properties, worth millions of       dollars.        Federal officials allege that legal recreational marijuana       states like California, Colorado and Washington, where       enforcement of growing regulations is hit-or-miss, have been       providing cover for transnational criminal organizations       willing to invest big money to buy or rent property to       achieve even bigger returns.        Chinese, Cuban and Mexican drug rings have purchased or       rented hundreds of homes and use human trafficking to bring       inexperienced growers to the United States to tend them,       federal and local officials say.        The suspects are targeting states that have already       legalized marijuana ``in an attempt to shroud their       operations in our legal environment here and then take the       marijuana outside of the state,'' said Mike Hartman,       executive director of the Colorado Department of Revenue,       which regulates and licenses the cannabis industry.       Authorities say they've seen an increase in these ``home       grows'' since the launch of recreational pot sales in       Colorado.        While California and Washington have mainly seen organized       criminals from China buying homes and converting them into       grow houses, Colorado has largely been grappling with Cuban       and Mexican-led cartels, said Sheriff Bill Elder of the El       Paso County Sheriffs Office in Colorado.        ``They have found that it's easier to grow and process       marijuana in Colorado, ship it throughout the United States,       than it is to bring it from Mexico or Cuba,'' Elder said.                        A `MASSIVE' MARIJUANA NETWORK         In El Paso County, NBC News witnessed firsthand the damage       a commercial-scale cannabis grow can do to a home otherwise       built for an average American family. Growers pose as       legitimate renters, and by the time authorities disrupt their       operation, homes have been gutted and trashed.        ``We've fallen through floors,'' U.S. Drug Enforcement       Agency Special Agent Randy Ladd said. ``The electrical       damage, they draw so much current that you'll see, in some       places, the wires are fused inside of the electrical box.       And--a lot of people--they don't wanna pay the high electric       bills. So what they do is they take jackhammers and pickaxes       and they cut through the foundation of the house, so that       they could steal the power.''        One of the biggest busts so far came last June, when the       Colorado attorney general's office announced that ``a massive       illegal interstate marijuana distribution and cultivation       network stretching from Colorado to Texas'' had been       dismantled. It was allegedly Chinese-connected, Ladd said.        Authorities said the network was responsible for securities       fraud, millions of dollars of laundered cash, 2,600       ``illegally cultivated'' marijuana plants and 4,000 pounds of       harvested cannabis, according to the Colorado attorney       general's statement.        The operation took place in 18 warehouses and storage units       and 33 homes, mostly in the Denver area, authorities said.       ``These seizures are believed to only scratch the surface,''       the office said.        Ladd alleged that some Chinese crews cover immigrants'       costs of traveling to America in exchange for work in the       grow houses. ``It's like indentured servitude,'' he said.       ``It is a form of human trafficking.''        The workers often fly from China to Belgium, and from       Belgium to Mexico, before making asylum claims at the border       and then disappearing by the time they're scheduled to tell       their stories in court, Ladd said. Often when grow houses are       raided, immigration fugitives are discovered, he said.        The grow homes are usually purchased by shell property       management companies, Ladd said. ``These growers can hide in       plain sight,'' he said.                   HOW FOREIGN CARTELS OPERATE IN THE U.S.         The Sacramento-area raids, which also struck Calaveras,       Placer, San Joaquin, El Dorado, Yuba and Amador counties,       shed some light on how many of the foreign rings operate.        Northern California-based DEA Special Agent Casey Rettig       said suspects send cash to the United States in $9,999       increments, just below the mandated reporting threshold, and       receive funds from China that fly under that nation's $50,000       foreign spending limit. They then purchase homes with the       help of cash lenders instead of traditional mortgage firms.        Last fall, a scenario fitting that pattern unfolded in       Grays Harbor County, Washington, southwest of Seattle, as a       drug task force busted an alleged cultivation ring funded by       organized crime in China.        More than 40 suspects were arrested and $80 million worth       of cannabis was seized, the Grays Harbor County Sheriff's       Office said. ``The majority of these homes were purchased       with cash, and information was developed that these purchases       were conducted by Chinese nationals involved in organized       crime,'' according to a statement from the Sheriff's Office.        And just this month, search warrants were served at 19       locations in the Puget Sound area of Washington state, a       federal official who did not want her name used said. The       ring was allegedly run by three Chinese nationals who       produced thousands of pounds of cannabis destined for greater       New York, the U.S. attorney's office in Seattle alleges.        The suspects, who face drug conspiracy charges, purchased       homes with the help of multiple wire transfers from China       that included dollar figures--$2,000 to $5,900--they believed       would fly under the radar, according to a federal complaint.        Ultimately it was the houses' exorbitant electricity use--      up to 38,477 kilowatt hours in one day versus the American       average of just 30--that made them targets of a federal       investigation, according to the filing.        Even a single grow house can contain a large marijuana       operation. In April, police in Pomona, California, an exurb       in Los Angeles County, announced they discovered a 23-room       grow house allegedly run by Chinese nationals. Fifty-five-      hundred marijuana products, including 2,900 plants and nearly       21 pounds of cannabis, were seized, police said.        ``The grow operation used advanced systems of lighting, air       conditioning, fans, exhaust blowers and air-filtering systems       to control the climate inside the buildings and the odor of       marijuana,'' according to a Pomona police statement.        Pomona police spokeswoman Aly Mejia said a gun and $6,900       in cash were also found.        The DEA's Rettig, speaking from her base in San Francisco,       said the Chinese operations are ``illegal under state law.''       In California, marijuana growers, producers and retailers       need state and local licenses. Cities can opt out and ban       such businesses altogether.        Rettig said even with the Golden State's sky-high housing       market--the median price of a home is $535,100, according       listings site Zillow--overseas criminals know that       ``marijuana can fetch three times as much out of state.''        ``There's a great profit motive in it,'' the DEA's Ladd       said. ``In Colorado, marijuana legalization has magnified the       black market. The standard price per pound here is $2,000,       but they can get $3,500 to $4,500 by shipping it back East.       The profits are great there.''    Furthermore, because of this patchwork at the State  level, I think you are seeing additional concerns at the southern  border right now, and I will include for the Record a letter that the  former Border Patrol chief submitted that in February alone there was  nearly $14 million a day of marijuana caught at the southern border.   Despite these many issues I still have with the SAFE Banking Act, I  do appreciate the work that my colleagues  [[Page H1921]]  have put into this legislative effort, but considering that the larger  issue of cannabis legalization has not yet been debated here on the  House floor, I think it is premature for the Financial Services  Committee to do the full work of this Congress on the question of  cannabis legalization at the Federal level. I think that would be  better left to the Judiciary Committee, with a wider debate here on the  House floor, and I would encourage that wider debate.   Notwithstanding that, I would like to thank my colleagues for the  hard work that they have put into this legislation. Even if I have  concerns, I know that there is more than sufficient support to pass  this under the suspension calendar, and that would not happen were it  not for the good legislative work of my colleague and friend from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).   I do believe that my colleague was quite intentional about the date  that he wanted to actually have the vote here on the House floor. With  that, for those of you who don't know, tomorrow is 4/20/21, 4/20 being  the operative date.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Stivers), the subcommittee chair on Housing, Community  Development, and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations of the House Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would say that if we are going to have  legalization of cannabis, let's have legalization of cannabis and do it  in regular order in the House of Representatives, not have it come  through the Financial Services Committee. I wanted to be clear, and I  wanted to make sure my colleague heard that.   But I do commend my colleague, Mr. Perlmutter, for taking every bit  of the jurisdiction that we currently have and using it smartly for the  best outcome possible.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce), my  colleague and good friend.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to repeat this from my earlier remarks. This bill represents  one of the biggest changes to U.S. drug policy. If we want banks to  provide services risk-free, then we should do it thoughtfully and  address the legality of cannabis instead of this workaround. This bill  represents a yeoman's task of a legal framework so that funds from  cannabis in those legalized States can be legally banked.   But that is not a holistic approach to this issue, nor should it be  the Financial Services Committee leading the debate, which we have had  one hearing on in the last 3 years in this committee--actually, you  could say probably one hearing in the last decade on the Financial  Services Committee. Yet, we have this bill, which, frankly, on its face  is a very well-balanced bill to fix a glaring problem that is happening  across the country.   This bill will legalize the banking of a federally illegal product. I  am sure the irony of this is not at all lost on the American public.   The drug cartels, frankly, are keen to this, and other bad actors are  keen to this. They will attempt to take advantage of this if it is not  well-implemented, if it is not thoughtfully implemented, especially if  those things are not the case.   No matter how we spin what is happening right now, we currently have  a crisis at the southern border, and human trafficking is certainly a  part of that; a desire to come to the United States is certainly a part  of that; and the movement of illegal drugs into the United States is  certainly a part of that. This doesn't help with that crisis at the  southern border.   Again, we are the House Financial Services Committee. We are not the  Homeland Security Committee, and we are not the Appropriations  Committee, so we can't fix all things within our jurisdiction.   Let me close with this. I do not support this bill because it  represents a workaround to a much bigger debate that we need to have in  the United States, and that is whether or not cannabis should remain a  schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This fact is  the bigger issue that I think this Congress should wrestle with, and I  would welcome it. In fact, I think we can have a much more nuanced  debate here.   But I do want to close by thanking my colleagues for creating a very  thoughtful product. This legislative text is much improved upon from  where it was originally. I thank my colleague, Mr. Perlmutter, for  leading that conversation and leading that set of negotiations.   It has taken years to produce this product. It is strong legislative  text. It is a strong legal framework. Even though I have pointed out a  number of its deficiencies and challenges, I do see on its face how  this would resolve a huge problem in a large number of States.   I understand that, and I am inviting the larger discussion about  cannabis, as well. I think we need to have that conversation.   But I do thank my colleague, Mr. Perlmutter, for his leadership  there, and I thank my colleagues, Mr. Stivers, Mr. Davidson, and Mr.  Joyce, on our side of the aisle for engaging in that, as well as Mr.  Luetkemeyer and Mr. Barr who dealt with particular issues in their  States and their jurisdictions, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' but I understand if  they do vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Eliminate Barriers to  Innovation Act. This a bipartisan bill that addresses the much-needed  collaboration between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the  Securities and Exchange Commission.   What we have is a regulation of commodities through one entity of our  Federal Government here in the United States and regulation of  securities by another entity of our government. What we need is  conversation between those two entities about the nature of digital  assets and cryptocurrencies.   We have neither a security nor a commodity in what is a new creation  of digital assets. Now what we see with the CFTC is that everything is  a commodity in their worldview, and the Securities Exchange Commission  thinks: Well, you are close. Everything is actually a security.   They each want to regulate something that is not in their nature to  regulate or not in the substance of their capacity to regulate. We have  neither fish nor fowl, neither security nor what the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission wants to regulate in their world. So, you have  neither fish nor fowl when it comes to this new creation of  cryptocurrencies.   The fact is that the ``Bitcoin Whitepaper,'' written by Satoshi  Nakamoto, as they call themselves, is more than a decade old. What we  have seen in that time period is the valuation of bitcoin, and then  things that are like bitcoin that use an encrypted ledger system in the  blockchain and tokenization to open up the value of that new creation  of a blockchain, that new creation of cryptocurrencies is now valued  over $2 trillion globally.   Most of that innovation has happened outside of the United States  because we don't have a legal and regulatory framework that is  permissive of the raising of capital in order to develop those  technologies. So, people in the United States, American citizens, are  missing out on innovation and the potential economic upside of those  innovations.   I would say this is one of the few pieces of technology in the last  100 years that Americans have not been the drivers of. In fact, we are  reacting a lot to what is happening globally.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Lynch, for his thoughtful engagement on  this bill and his important structural changes to make sure this can be  a bipartisan bill. Those conversations really are that balance between  economic opportunity and growth that a lot of us on the Republican side  want to emphasize at all costs, frankly, and then the protection of our  citizens that some on the left want to have at all costs.   Mr. Speaker, striking that balance is really necessary for us as  legislators. Let's just be pragmatic and honest about it. Mr. Lynch has  brought some nice changes to this bill that actually will enable it to  be a bipartisan vote, I hope.   Mr. Speaker, what this bill does, with our colleagues from the House  Committee on Agriculture, is it requires the Securities and Exchange  Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish a  working group focused on digital assets. This is the first step to  opening the dialogue between our regulators and market participants and  will move to much-needed clarity.    The fact is that this working group will produce a report within a  year that includes an analysis of the domestic regulatory framework  necessary for the development of cryptocurrencies and digital assets  here in the United States. It is really important that we get our act  together, that we be technology-permissive, that we ensure that it is  legitimate money raised here, that our existing laws are adhered to,  but that we adapt and change and don't allow the debate between the  CFTC, which sees everything as fish, and the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which sees everything as fowl.   When we look at this new entity, which is neither fish nor fowl, we  have to have a small regulatory framework for that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I concur that our colleague, Mr. Heck, was  instrumental in these debates. I miss his lively debates in committee  markup, but, frankly, given the sick burns he has given me there, I  think I am better off with him as Lieutenant Governor. But I concur  with the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson), the ranking member of the Committee on Agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), a member of the House Agriculture Committee  and a leader on agriculture issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Lynch, for his leadership on  this important issue and the issues of financial technology.   Frankly, one of the healthier conversations we get to have on the  Financial Services Committee is on the nature and the deployment of the  technology. It is neither the pure conversation of less or more  regulation. It is a completely different scope of what we are doing in  terms of laws that ensure that we have financial inclusion and allow  offers for products to be cheaper, more affordable, and more widely  distributed across the country. So I think this is a healthy thing for  us to have this conversation on the Financial Services Committee.   This bill today is an important working group between the CFTC and  the Security and Exchange Commission. That conversation between these  two agencies, I hope, will bring us a new permissive regulatory  framework for digital assets here in the United States and allow for  the wider deployment and development of cryptocurrencies and all the  technologies that are underlying those cryptocurrencies, those huge  opportunity sets for American consumers in the development of these new  assets in this first generation, but also the wire deployment of these  technologies, whether it is in driverless vehicles or in the nature of  how we interact with each other in the financial markets.   There are huge opportunities around digital assets, and this is the  first step in Congress having a smart regulatory framework here in the  United States for digital assets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
