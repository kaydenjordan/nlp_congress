 Mr. Speaker, for my final Maui minute this year, I rise  on behalf of my constituents to offer a heartfelt ``mahalo,'' ``thank  you,'' to everyone who has played a role in our recovery so far:   To the first responders on that dreadful day who fought the fires and  brought people to safety;   To the countless Federal workers, disaster personnel and volunteers,  and everyday citizens who have worked tirelessly each day since August  8 to ensure our people get the help they need and deserve;   To the people of Hawaii and from all 50 States and over 100 countries  for their outpouring of support and aloha, including raising hundreds  of millions of dollars for our Maui community;   To my colleagues here, who have joined me on the ground and reached  out since, mahalo.   For too many Maui survivors, this holiday season will be the first  without a loved one, without a home they have known their whole lives,  and with an uncertain future.   The road ahead to recovery will continue to be long and tough, but we  will be there.   From the depths of my heart, mahalo.                            ____________________
