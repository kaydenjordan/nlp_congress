 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with  my friend Senator Enzi, the ``Breast Cancer Research Stamp  Reauthorization Act.''   Breast cancer remains one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in  women. One in eight women will receive a diagnosis during her  lifetime--and more than 40,000 women will die from the disease this  year.   The Breast Cancer Research Stamp was first issued in 1998 and has  since raised almost $90 million for research into new, innovative  treatments for breast cancer.   A 2018 study that was partially funded by revenue from stamp sales  found that most women diagnosed with a common early-stage breast cancer  do not actually need chemotherapy as a part of their cancer treatment.  Results from this study are expected to spare up to 70,000 U.S.  patients a year from the cost and side effects associated with  chemotherapy without it hurting their chances of beating the disease.   Think about it. Simply purchasing a stamp could help spare thousands  of women the pain they may experience when undergoing chemotherapy and  side effects that range from hair loss to long-term organ damage. Not  to mention the expense, with one basic round of chemo costing anywhere  from $10,000 to $100,000. The stamp's ability to fund critical research  like this study helps us take big steps forward in treating breast  cancer for only a few more cents over the standard price of sending a  letter.   As we come back to work after Mother's Day, I invite the Senate to  pause and remember all the women who have faced a diagnosis of breast  cancer, not knowing what the outcome would be. I applaud as well the  family and friends who have tirelessly supported them.   The Breast Cancer Stamp currently costs 65 cents, 10 cents more than  a traditional Forever stamp. The additional 10 cents helps support  breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and the  Department of Defense's Medical Research Program. Our bill would  reauthorize the stamp for 8 more years through 2027.   For these women and their families, this stamp is as meaningful to  them as it is impactful to how we combat the disease now and in the  future.   I am honored to be joined by Senators Baldwin, Barrasso, Capito,  Casey, Cramer, Collins, Daines, Duckworth, Durbin, Grassley, Hassan,  Hirono, Hyde-Smith, Klobuchar, Rosen, Schatz, Shaheen, Stabenow, and  Tester.   I am very grateful for supporters of this bill, including the  American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American College of  Surgeons, Susan G. Komen, the American Association for Cancer Research,  the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, the Breast Cancer  Research Foundation, and Are You Dense, Inc.   As we celebrate the mothers in our lives this week, I urge my  colleagues to join us in taking meaningful action to improve women's  health.   Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CRUZ (for himself and Mr. Jones):   S. 1442. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  of 1965 to strengthen school security; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Prevent  Foreign Interference with Elections Act of 2019. This bill provides  enhanced criminal penalties and additional safeguards to prevent  foreign interference in our elections.   To be clear, there are already laws on the books to prosecute those  who interfere in U.S. elections. Indeed, Special Counsel Mueller  charged Russian intelligence officers who hacked into U.S. computers  and stole documents, for the purpose of interfering in the 2016  presidential elections.   Special Counsel Mueller also charged the Russian Internet Research  Agency and several of its employees for their role in the social media  campaign that was designed to manipulate American voters.   This bill, however, makes election interference a separate criminal  offense. It makes clear that those who conspire with foreign actors to  interfere in U.S. elections will be punished appropriately for striking  at the bedrock of our democracy,   This bill does five main things.   First, it explicitly makes it a crime to conspire with foreign  nationals to interfere in U.S. elections.   Interference can be accomplished through breaking a federal criminal  law, such as committing fraud, or by hacking into someone's computer,  or by violating federal, state, or local election laws.   As I mentioned, this bill simply leaves no doubt that working with a  foreign actor to commit these offenses with the goal of interfering in  a U.S. election is a crime.   And it requires that those who break this law will be sentenced  separately, and in addition to any other laws that were broken.   Second, it makes it so that people convicted of interfering in our  elections would be inadmissible into the United States.   There is, however, an important exception. Those who cooperate with  law enforcement to help catch those responsible for interference would  be eligible for an S visa.   Third, it creates a civil action, allowing the Attorney General to  immediately address foreign interference once U.S. law enforcement  learns of it.   This is important because foreign interference can then be stopped as  soon as it is discovered.   Fourth, it prohibits foreign-financed elections ads, including  foreign-financed issue ads and foreign-financed digital ads.   These expansions will help protect the integrity of our electoral  process.   Fifth and finally, it prohibits providing ``substantial assistance''  to foreign nationals trying to interfere in our elections.   It is important that we also hold ourselves accountable by not  providing aid to those wishing to do us harm.   To be clear, there was foreign interference in the 2016 Presidential  election.   The Intelligence Community unanimously concluded that the Russian  government interfered by ``blend[ing] covert intelligence operations-- such as cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian government  agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid  social media users or `trolls.' '' After a nearly two-year  investigation, Special Counsel Mueller confirmed these core  conclusions.   Along the way, his office indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers  in connection with Russian hacking operations and three companies,  including the Internet Research Agency and 13 of its employees for  their role in the social media campaign to influence American voters.   Unless we do something, this interference will happen again. And to  stop it, we need to not only make clear that interference will result  in criminal punishment, we must also update our election laws so that  they can combat these new cyber-attacks. This bill does both.   I am introducing this bill today with strong Democratic support, and  I would particularly like to thank Senator Blumenthal for his  leadership on this issue.   It is my sincere hope, however, that my Republican colleagues will  join us in this important effort as well.   The issue I speak about today is one that goes to the core of our  democracy. It is a bi-partisan issue that I hope both Democrats and  Republicans can join in addressing.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with  my friend Senator Enzi, the ``Breast Cancer Research Stamp  Reauthorization Act.''
