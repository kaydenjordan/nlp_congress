 Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening, first,  wanting to take a moment to join Senator Braun in remembering a good  friend to each of us, our colleague Congresswoman Jackie Walorski. She  tragically passed away in a horrible car accident earlier today.   I, for one, am truly devastated. I know that Jackie loved the State  of Indiana. She loved the Hoosiers throughout the State. She had an  incredible sense of humor, incredibly smart, and was so talented in  many ways. And she will be missed.   I join countless Hoosiers, and I know that Senator Braun is, in  praying for her husband Dean, for her entire family, and for all those  who came to love and respect Jackie.   I know that so many throughout the State are mourning her passing  this evening, and so many will have important things to say about their  interaction with her and how fond they were of her.   It also should be said that two other Hoosiers passed in this  horrible accident, members of her dedicated staff: Emma Thomson and  Zach Potts. We pray for all of them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, we are also on the floor to talk  about a different tragedy in the State of Indiana. On July 17, there  was a terrible shooting that occurred at the Greenwood Park Mall, just  miles from my home, which resulted in the death of three innocent  victims.   Now, it could have easily been one of my neighbors or our friend, or,  I remind myself, it could have been a member of my family who passed  away there in the food court on that very day.   As this resolution that we are introducing today states, the U.S.  Senate condemns this shooting and any violent action that seeks to  bring harm to other individuals. We grieve the loss of fellow Hoosiers  Victor Gomez and Pedro and Rosa Pineda, and we pray for their families.  But we are also grateful for the heroes on the scene that day, for the  first responders, our healthcare workers, as well as a young man named  Eli Dicken.   Eli was in the food court that evening. He was legally carrying his  own firearm, and when the shooting began, he used his weapon to bring  down the shooter. Were it not for his poise during those brief moments,  his brave and selfless actions, this shooting would have been far  worse. So I ask all my fellow Americans to remember the victims and the  heroes of this tragedy, and I urge passage of this resolution.
