 Mr. President, on the way over to the floor, I received  a CNN news alert, and the headline is: ``Biden dramatically scales up  the pressure on Netanyahu.''   So I come to the floor to tell you and to tell the Nation that I  stand with Israel. Like millions of Americans, I have been disturbed to  see the Biden administration make a false equivalence between Israel  and the terrorist group Hamas. There is no equivalence here.   Hamas is a terrorist group funded by Iran. These terrorists have  fired over 3,000 missiles into population centers in Israel. Israel has  every right to defend itself. If Hamas stopped fighting, there would be  peace. If Israel stopped fighting, there would be no peace. Hamas would  continue to attack Israel.   President Biden's readout of his call this morning with Prime  Minister Netanyahu stated:         The president conveyed to the prime minister that he       expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a       ceasefire.    President Biden doesn't get to tell Israel what to do. We all want  peace. We all want a cease-fire. A cease-fire happens when Hamas stops  its terrorist campaign. Until then, Israel has every right to the  proportional response it is making right now. Israel has every right to  take out the terrorist leaders that are directing the attacks on its  citizens                              Economic Recovery    Mr. President, I would like to move now to a separate topic, and the  one for which I originally came to the floor, and I came to the floor  to talk about our economy.   In April, the unemployment rate went up. Surprisingly, it went up. It  was supposed to go down. It went up, and so are prices all around the  country. The experts in the White House actually thought that we were  going to add 1 million new workers in America last month. In reality,  only about 266,000 Americans went back to work. So the so-called  experts at the White House were wrong, and they were wrong by three- quarters of a million workers.   Now, 40,000 of those people who went back to work went to government  jobs, which means the cost of government continues to grow. The private  sector was able to only hire 220,000 people rather than 1 million. It  was the most disappointing jobs report in over 20 years.   There has also been a slowdown in the middle of a recovery, which is  surprising to many. You know, before Joe Biden took office, we saw a  fantastic economic recovery, and it was the fastest one in American  history. We were bouncing back from the coronavirus shutdown. It is a  very different story now. It is no coincidence that this is a direct  result of President Biden's policies.   And the policies--the Democrats all voted for this, and the  Republicans all voted against it. The Democrats and President Biden,  party-line vote, voted to extend a bonus payment for workers to stay  home, paying people more to stay at home than they could make at work,  in many cases. People aren't lazy. They are logical, and it is a  perfectly logical thing to do; that they took up the President on his  offer to stay home when they were paid more to stay home than they  could make at work.   So, as a result, job openings right now are at an alltime high.  Businesses can't find workers. Everywhere I go in Wyoming, I see ``Help  Wanted'' signs. The president of Delta Airlines reported they canceled  100 flights last month because they couldn't find enough people to  work. They had people ready to fly. They didn't have people who were  ready to work.   People want to work. People want to hire others. The incentives  coming from government are absolutely wrong. Joe Biden and Big  Government are getting in the way of people returning to work.   There is another big problem I heard about. I heard about it this  past weekend in Wyoming. The business owners I heard can't find workers  because of incentives coming out of this administration--``Help  Wanted'' signs up--and from other people asking me: Why are prices  going up? Why is inflation back?   You know, under the Obama-Biden administration, we saw the same  thing. It is called the middle-class squeeze, where prices are going up  faster than wages are going up. April was the worst month for inflation  since the great recession 13 years ago.   In effect, inflation means that the money in your wallet buys less.  So, in a sense, you have a pay cut. Inflation is a regressive tax. It  means the poorer you are, the more it hurts and the fewer things you  can buy for the money you have. The big donors in the Democratic  league, they are going to be just fine. They won't even notice rising  prices. They don't notice when gas prices go up. The Silicon Valley  hotshots and the masters of the universe in Manhattan, they are going  to be just fine.   It is families--working families in Wyoming and New Mexico and across  the country who are struggling to get by. They are the ones who are  going to get hurt the most. Just look at the cost of a trip to the  grocery store. First, you have to go to the grocery store, and to you  get there, you have to drive. Well, the price of gasoline is going up.  Across the Nation now, the price of a gallon of gasoline is over $3 a  gallon. A year ago, it was about $2 a gallon.   Since Joe Biden took office, it has gone up nearly 70 cents a gallon.  That hits people when they fill up because they have to drive getting  back to work. In Wyoming and New Mexico, people drive long distances,  and we use more gas than most. So people in our States are paying more  than many other places.   And I don't think it is a coincidence that the price of gas has gone  up. Joe Biden's first action in office was to draw a target on the back  of American energy and pull the trigger. He shut down the Keystone XL  Pipeline. He banned new oil and gas leases on Federal lands. He has  restricted the production of American energy. We need energy. We need  it now.   Gas prices affect the price of everything else. It costs more and  more to transport things across the country, and that is why we are  seeing prices go up at the grocery store. Working families are getting  squeezed. And this is a direct result of the policies of the Biden  administration.   One reason this is happening is because President Biden is flooding  the country with so-called easy money. We are finding out it is not too  easy. In the month of March, President Biden signed into law a $2  trillion slush fund for basically liberal spending. It was described as  a coronavirus relief package but, in fact, when you take a look at it,  less than 9 percent of the money, a very small percentage of the money,  actually went for medical care.   He crammed it through Congress--party-line vote, absolutely no  Republican support--put the bill on the Nation's credit card, and the  Federal Reserve started to print more money. Now, money doesn't grow on  trees, doesn't come from a printer, and you  [[Page S2752]]  cannot print your way to prosperity. The money has to come from  somewhere.   History shows that this is a strategy that eventually backfires.  Nations try to print free money, and they end up poorer than ever. Get- rich schemes don't work, never have, and they aren't going to this time  either. Inflation is going up every single month since the election.   Now, the White House experts tell us not to worry. These are the same  experts that predicted there would be 1 million new jobs and people  working last month and that the unemployment rate would drop. But much  of the $2 trillion that President Biden signed into law hasn't even  gone out the door yet, and the President is asking for trillions and  trillions more.   The House of Representatives, the other night, put out a proposal  related to the infrastructure bill, one that I am trying to work with  the administration on. They are requesting $7.1 trillion, an  astonishingly high amount of money. If the President gets his way and  we keep spending like this at the request from the House, inflation is  only beginning.   You don't have to take my word for it. Listen to the liberal  economist Larry Summers. He was in the Clinton administration as well  as the Obama administration. He was Clinton's Secretary of the Treasury  and played an economic role in the Obama administration.   He warned against President Biden's spending spree. He called that $2  trillion slush fund the least responsible spending bill he has seen in  four decades--the least responsible spending bill in four decades. That  is before all this additional spending may be coming.   Well, this is what he said after April's inflation numbers came out.  He said:         I was . . . worried . . . about inflation . . . [yet] it's       . . . moved much faster, much sooner than [even] I . . .       predicted.    That is Larry Summers--Clinton administration and Obama  administration--commenting on the Biden policies.   People who save money their whole lives for retirement are now  watching their hard-earned savings go down with a stroke of Joe Biden's  pen. Their buying ability is shrinking. People who did the right thing,  who worked hard, and saved their money are now being punished by Biden  policies.   Under President Biden, we are seeing more government, more taxes,  more spending, and, as a result, the American people are suffering.  They are seeing flat wages, higher prices, and disappointing job  creation. We see gas lines. We see people hoarding gasoline. It sounds  like it was in the 1970s. And President Biden should remember those  times because he was still a Member of the Senate back then.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue and finish my  remarks with an additional 60 seconds.    Thank you, Mr. President.   President Biden should remember that by 1980, the American people had  had enough. We changed course. We thought it was enough of Jimmy  Carter, and we elected Ronald Reagan President.   It is time to change course again. Let's create more American energy.  Let's set down the taxpayer's credit card. Put it away. Cut up the  credit card. Stop the reckless spending.   American families have been paying the price. The people in the  middle are being squeezed. The American people expect and deserve  better.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 13     Madam President, first, I would like to associate  myself with the fine remarks of the Senator from Mississippi, who sees  every day, when he is home traveling in his State, the same things I am  seeing in Wyoming--``Help Wanted'' signs all around our home States, as  businesses are looking for people to hire, and the government's  incentives are making it that much harder to find workers.   Job openings right now are at a record high in America. There were 8  million jobs available going into April. Yet in that month, only about  one-quarter of a million people actually were hired. The unemployment  rate actually went up.   We lost manufacturing. We lost retail. We lost healthcare jobs last  month. Construction jobs were flat. Ten million people are unemployed  right now, even though there are 8 million job openings.   Every Senator I talk to says that there are ``Help Wanted'' signs all  around their home State. Nearly every American who wants a job should  be able to find one. Yet it is really not happening.   The question has been asked and answered on this floor by various  Members of the Republican Party: Why can't small businesses find  workers? Why are so many of these jobs unfilled? Because something like  this doesn't just happen on its own. Oh, no. This happens as a direct  result of the President's policies.   President Biden and Democrats are paying people to stay home. That is  why so many people are staying home. They are being paid more to not  work than to work. According to one analysis, nearly half of all people  on unemployment benefits with the unemployment benefit bonus payment-- the extra check--are making more money by staying at home than they  would make if they go to work.   These people aren't lazy. Oh, no. When the President and Democrats  offer people free money to stay home, it is perfectly logical--people  take them up on the offer.   I believe the American people want to work. That is what I see at  home in Wyoming. That is who we are. That is the fiber of the American  people. We are the hardest working people in the world. American  businesses want to hire. Yet Joe Biden and Big Government are getting  in the way.   President Biden has actually extended bonus payments until September.  We are now in May. May, June, July, August, September--month after  month, after month, after month of more of this. This is a grave danger  to small businesses across America. If they can't find workers, they  might have to close again. Then those job openings will no longer be  there, and they will be gone forever.   President Biden appears to be, in my opinion, in denial on this. He  held a press conference recently, and this is what he said: It is all  ``loose talk.''   This is not loose talk. This is basic arithmetic. Job openings are  going up; hiring is slowing down; and nearly half of workers make more  money by staying at home.   ``Loose talk'' is when the President of the United States tells us  everything is just fine when it is not. April was the most  disappointing jobs report in more than 20 years--two decades. Yet  President Biden says the jobs report ``shows we're on the right  track.''   No, it doesn't. Hiring has slowed down. Some say people aren't  returning to work because of coronavirus.   Madam President, let me tell you, it is very unlikely. We are  vaccinating 2 million people a day. One in three Americans is now-- these are adults--fully vaccinated already. We are getting the virus  behind us. We have been very successful with Operation Warp Speed.   We should be filling the 8 million jobs available right now. Yet what  are President Biden and the Democrats doing to fix the problem?  Nothing, nothing at all. I believe they are making it worse by  extending these bonus payments. It is time the President and Democrats  worked for a solution.   You know, I am proud that the people of Wyoming and the Governor of  Wyoming have done just that. Wyoming has taken a leadership role, along  with approximately 20 other States, in ending these bonus payments. It  is going to give our economy a boost. It is going to lead to more  hiring.   It is time for President Biden and the Democrats to follow the  successful lead of the people of Wyoming. Stop paying people a bonus to  stay home. Reward the hard work that is a part of America and  Americans' DNA.   I yield the floor    Mr. President, I stand today to recognize the 75th  anniversary of Casper College, a community, regional, and State pillar  of education. Casper College is one of Wyoming's great educational  institutions, with the mission of ``Education for a Lifetime.''   Casper College was the first community college in Wyoming. The idea  for the college began following World War I. After 19 years of study  and debate, a measure to establish the college was passed by the  Wyoming Legislature. It was signed into law in February 1945 by then- Governor Lester C. Hunt. Casper Junior College opened in 1945 on the  third floor of the Natrona County High School building. Timing was ripe  for Casper College to meet the demands of the ``greatest generation''  of service men and women who were eligible for the newly offered GI  bill. Since that time, Casper College has continued that same spirited  mission. The college is an incredible success story, growing into one  of the largest and most comprehensive community colleges in the Rocky  Mountain West.   In 1955, the rapidly expanding 2-year school moved to its present  location on the hills below Casper Mountain. Today, the campus  comprises 28 buildings on more than 200 acres. Casper College offers  more than 140 academic transfer and technical and career programs.  Eleven universities offer advanced degrees through university  partnership programs. There are 40 University of Wyoming programs  through the Casper College 2+2 Degree plan.   Casper College has received numerous awards and national recognition.  In 2020, the College Consensus named Casper College one of the Fifty  Best Community Colleges in the United States. The school was also named  the ninth-best community college in the Nation in a recent study  conducted by the personal finance outlet WalletHub. This study  recognizes where students can receive the best education at the lowest  price. In 2021, Great Value Colleges named Casper College as one of  America's most beautiful community college campuses.   Casper College's core values are integrity, people, diversity,  forward-thinking, and community. Alumni leaders include former Vice  President of the United States Dick Cheney, the late country singer and  rodeo cowboy Chris LeDoux, artist Chris Navarro, renowned entomoligist  Wayne Hunter, and Marlan Scully, American physicist best known for his  work in theoretical quantum optics. The alumni list also includes  former professional athletes Earle Higgins, Bob Lackey, and Flynn  Robinson. With over 4,000 students each semester, Casper college will  continue to produce outstanding artists, athletes, academics, and  professionals.   Under the direction and guidance of President Darren Divine, staff,  and faculty, Casper College continues a tradition of excellence started  by the founders 75 years ago. They are educating, teaching, and  training the next generation of leaders and professionals. The college  board of trustees are Chair Steve Degenfelder, Vice Chair Tim Kugle,  Secretary Sue Schilling, and Trustees Kathy Dolan, Liz Batton, Scott  Bennion, and Susan D. Miller.   Student Senate leaders for this anniversary year are President  Anastacia Slack, School of Business & Industry; Bre Long and Dylan  Cornelius, School of Fine Arts & Humanities; Tierra Price and Jakob  Duncan, School of Health Science; Madelyn Polys and Morgan Bundy,  School of Science; Emma Mercer and Abby Hudman, School of Social &  Behavioral Science; Logan MacKearney and Charissa Parker, Freshman  Representatives; and members Paige Noble and Dani Warner.  [[Page S2776]]    Casper College is supported by the Casper College Foundation and  Alumni Assocation. These organizations work with the community, donors,  faculty, and staff to assist the college in fulfilling its mission.  Together they invest in the legacy of Casper College.   In honor of the 75th-anniversary, the Casper College Alumni  Association named 25 former students and graduates as exemplary alumni.
