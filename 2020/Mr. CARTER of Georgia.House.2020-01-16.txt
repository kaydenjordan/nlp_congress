 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Ms. Debbie Johnson, who passed away from complications due to an  illness on Monday, January 13.   At the time of her passing, Ms. Johnson was serving as mayor pro tem  of Port Wentworth in the First Congressional District of Georgia. Mayor  pro tem Johnson's colleagues remember her as a larger-than-life figure,  who served the city with the utmost dedication to the people she  represented.   For 17 years she worked at Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police  Department before becoming one of the first African American women ever  elected to the Port Wentworth City Council.   While mayor pro tem, she fought for the voices of the unheard and  made fundamental rights and equality a top priority. One of her most  important projects included coordinating events to feed the hungry  during Thanksgiving and Christmas.   Mr. Speaker, Mayor pro tem Johnson's work and presence will be deeply  missed in Port Wentworth. Her family and friends will be in my thoughts  and prayers during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
