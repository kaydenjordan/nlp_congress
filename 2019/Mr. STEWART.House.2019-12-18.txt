 Madam Speaker, I discovered something recently. It is  shocking, I know, but it turns out that some people don't like  President Trump. They think he is loud, they think he can be arrogant,  they think sometimes he says bad words, and sometimes he is rude to  people; and their sensitive natures have been offended. I get that. I  really do.   But let's be clear. This vote this day has nothing to do with  Ukraine, it has nothing to do with abuse of power, and it has nothing  to do with obstruction of Congress.   This vote this day is about one thing and one thing only: They hate  this President, and they hate those of us who voted for him. They think  we are stupid, and they think we made a mistake. They think Hillary  Clinton should be the President, and they want to fix that. That is  what this vote is about.   They want to take away my vote and throw it in the trash. They want  to take away my President and delegitimize him so that he cannot be  reelected. That is what this vote is about.   For those who think this started with this investigation, what  nonsense. You have been trying to impeach this President since before  he was sworn into office.                                time  1330    Some of you introduced Articles of Impeachment before he was sworn  into office. This isn't something you are approaching prayerfully and  mournfully and sadly: Oh, the chaos. Oh, the sadness.   This is something you are gleeful about, and you have been trying to  do it for 3 years. And it is very clear. You don't have to go back and  Google very much to find out that is the absolute truth. I could give  you pages of examples of things you have said for 3 years about this  President. That is what this is about.   If this impeachment is successful, the next President, I promise you,  is going to be impeached, and the next President after that.   If you set this bar as being impeachable, every President in our  future will be impeached. It erodes our Republic in ways that our  Founding Fathers recognized. They got it right, high crimes and  misdemeanors. Other than that, settle it at the ballot box.   I look forward to that day. Let the American people decide.
