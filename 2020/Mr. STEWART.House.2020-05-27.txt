 Madam Speaker, I recently had an experience with a group  of, maybe, 50 people, and I asked them: How many of you have been  impacted by suicide or an attempted suicide, someone in your family,  someone that you love and care about? Nearly every hand went up.   We are experiencing a crisis among our youth, a crisis among our  veterans, and now with COVID-19, a crisis among the general population  as we go into our social isolation. It is worse now than it was, and it  has been a crisis for a long time.   There is a tool that will help. The Suicide Prevention Hotline number  that creates a national hotline number, 988. No matter where you are in  the country, if you are in the middle of a mental health crisis you can  get help.   We have been working on this for 3 years. It is bipartisan, it is  bicameral, it will save thousands of lives, especially now in the midst  of this other crisis that is creating so much emotional stress on so  many Americans.   Madam Speaker, I am asking the leadership, bring it up, finish it,  give us unanimous consent today. Let's make this tool available to help  Americans who need the help, please.                            ____________________
