 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory  and the legacy of Gloria Melnick, one of Bay Ridge's most beloved and  respected community leaders.   As a New York City public school teacher and president of the Bay  Ridge Community Council, she worked for decades to bring positive  change to her community. When Gloria took on a project, whether it was  the community council's Halloween art contest, the Ragamuffin  Children's Parade, or her work with the Bay Ridge Women's Club, she  gave it her all, even if that meant she had to work with people she  disagreed with.   Gloria's tireless and heartfelt service for her community didn't come  from a place of selfishness. She didn't care if she got any credit. She  didn't care who got the credit or attention. She was more than happy to  keep a low profile and work behind the scenes, so long as it was making  people's lives better.   At a time when productive dialogue and selfless leadership often seem  to be in short supply, people like Gloria are a source of hope and  inspiration for us all. We owe our teachers, our public servants, and  our community leaders a huge debt of gratitude, and we all send  Gloria's family and the entire Bay Ridge community our condolences for  their loss.                            ____________________
