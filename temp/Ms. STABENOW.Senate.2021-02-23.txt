 Madam President, I am very pleased today to rise to  support the nomination of our former Secretary of Agriculture, Tom  Vilsack. We are very lucky that he is willing to serve again. He is  certainly no stranger to all of us, and we are very fortunate that he  is willing to once again be part of public service. In serving as  Agriculture Secretary during all 8 years of the Obama administration,  Secretary Vilsack presided over the USDA with decisive, effective  leadership. It was a pleasure to work with him.   The Agriculture Committee held a bipartisan hearing earlier this  month, and mere hours later, we voted to advance his nomination without  any objection. His deep knowledge of agriculture and rural America is  needed now more than ever, for our farmers, our families, and our rural  communities have so many challenges right now.   The COVID-19 crisis is continuing to disrupt our food supply chain  for farmers, food processors, and essential workers. Tens of millions  of families still don't have enough to eat and are lining up at food  banks in order to put food on the table. The climate crisis is posing  an extremely grave threat to the long-term viability of our economy and  our food supply. Farmers of color, who have long faced civil rights  abuses and systemic racism, continue to experience economic  disparities.   On top of all of this, there is a lot of work to be done to rebuild  the USDA workforce so that the Department can fulfill its very  important mission.   American farmers, families, and rural communities need strong,  effective leadership now more than ever. When it comes to strengthening  our food and farm economy, I am very confident that soon-to-be- confirmed Secretary Tom Vilsack will be more than up to the task. He  has a proven track record and will embrace new ideas in a new era at  the Department.   I know he is committed to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, and I  know he is committed to focusing on feeding our families in need. We  have more than 50 million Americans today who are in a hunger crisis,  themselves and their families. I know he cares deeply and is committed  to making sure they are able to feed their families.   I know he is very focused on tackling the climate crisis and has done  a lot of work, since leaving as the Secretary of Agriculture a few  years ago, focusing on voluntary, producer-led, farmer-friendly efforts  that can make a real difference and allow agriculture to lead in  addressing the climate crisis.   I also know he is very focused and committed on addressing the racial  discrimination that we have seen systemically over the years in  agriculture and addressing those issues in a very fair and equitable  way. I look forward to partnering with him on these issues.   Senator Boozman and I enjoyed our first hearing, which was his  confirmation hearing. I look forward to partnering with Senator Boozman  and our entire committee to be able to move forward on a whole range of  issues that are important for all of us, for everybody in our country.  To do that, we need a great partner and an effective partner in the  Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, and I know with great  confidence that this person is Tom Vilsack.   I yield the floor    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  remaining time be yielded back.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the terrible  events of January 6, the impeachment vote, and the need to hold people  accountable for their actions.   While the U.S. Senate did not achieve the two-thirds vote necessary  to convict former President Donald Trump, this will go down in history  as the largest bipartisan vote ever to hold a President accountable for  high crimes and misdemeanors under our Constitution.   Former President Donald Trump spent months pushing a big lie--that  the November election was stolen from him. He inspired, encouraged, and  incited a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in order to stop the  certification of the electoral college vote, and then he did nothing to  stop the violence, which caused massive injury and loss of life.   I wish to convey my personal and deep gratitude to all of the Capitol  Police officers who courageously put their lives on the line to protect  all of us that day, and I join with my colleagues in grieving the loss  of life and injuries that so many suffered as a result of this violent  insurrection.   This wasn't just an attack on a building. It was an attack on all of  the people who work there. It was an attack on our form of government.  It was an attack on our Constitution. It was an attack on ``We the  People.''   This bipartisan vote sent an important message: In America, no  President is above the law. And inciting violence against our  government is illegal and dangerous.   Now, as a nation, we must move forward. We must do everything we can  to bring down the temperature of our debates, find common ground on  issues we care about, and reduce the divide in our families and  communities. And we must continue to strive for accountability and  justice. Our democracy demands no less.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
