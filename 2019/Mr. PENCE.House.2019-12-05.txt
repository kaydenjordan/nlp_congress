 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the New  Palestine High School football team for winning the Indiana high school  Class A football state championship. This marks the second year in a  row the Dragons have gone undefeated.   I applaud Coach Kyle Ralph, who now has an 88-4 record in his 7- season tenure at New Pal.   I also congratulate the whole team for their hard work in this  fantastic accomplishment. Congratulations to all the Dragon nation.                       Congratulating EHHS Cheerleading     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Eastern  Hancock High School cheerleading squad for winning the Indiana Cheer  Championship Varsity D division.   After placing fourth at the semi-State competition, the Royals  returned to the State competition for a victorious first place win.   The Royal cheerleading squad has displayed dedication, hard work, and  sheer talent. They have made the Sixth District very proud.               Recognizing Greensburg Ag Teacher Greg Schneider     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Greensburg  Community High School agriculture teacher and FFA adviser Greg  Schneider.   Greg Schneider was recently awarded the honorary American FFA degree  through his commitment to the advancement of ag education. The degree  recognizes those who have gone beyond valuable daily contributions to  make a positive difference in the lives of their students.   Congratulations to Greg, who has inspired confidence in a new  generation of farmers.             Recognizing Shelbyville Central School's Kris Baker     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Shelbyville  Central Schools' special education coordinator, Kris Baker, for winning  a prestigious education award.   Kris' work has earned her the 2019 Early Career Special Education  Administrator Award. Ms. Baker won the award for her dedication to  autism education and assistive technology at Earlywood Educational  Services.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Kris for the work she has done for those in  need, and I congratulate her on this honor.   Congratulating Analytical Engineering on Gold HIRE Vets Medallion Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Analytical  Engineering of Columbus and the May family for receiving the Gold HIRE  Vets Medallion  [[Page H9263]]  Award from the U.S. Department of Labor.   This marks the second year in a row that Analytical Engineering,  Inc., has earned this esteemed award. They were 1 of only 12 companies  in Indiana to win this award by hiring and retaining veterans.   As a Beirut veteran myself, I appreciate companies like Analytical  Engineering for taking care of those who have served our country.                            Send NDAA to President     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my Democratic colleagues  to stop playing political games and send the NDAA to President Trump's  desk.   The NDAA has been a bipartisan piece of legislation that we, as  Congress, have passed for 58 straight years. The NDAA is essential for  our men and women in uniform and for our National Defense Strategy.   Now, in the final hour, House Democrats want to wedge partisan  policies into this bill. As Democrats continue to divide Congress over  nondefense issues, they play right into the hands of our enemies.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stop indulging in this political  theater and pass the NDAA.                            ____________________
