 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics, which prepared this statement for me in  acknowledgement of Black History Month.   Minority populations, especially the African American population,  continue to remain in relatively poor health when compared to the  majority population and also continue to be underserved by the  healthcare delivery system.   One of the biggest health challenges facing our country today is  obesity, and the African American community is especially at risk. In a  2015-2016 study by the CDC, the report found non-Hispanic Black adults,  at 46.8 percent, had a higher prevalence of obesity than non-Hispanic  White adults, which was 37.9 percent.   Compared to other States, Illinois' obesity rate is a significant  area of concern, with 31 percent of adults having obesity. This  statistic is higher than the U.S. median.   Illinois has the 27th highest adult obesity rate in the Nation and  the 7th highest obesity rate for youth ages 10 to 17. Chicago's African  American community is the demographic with the highest obesity rate at  39.8 percent.   With such a high percentage of the African American community falling  in the obese category, this demographic runs a higher risk for obesity- related conditions, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes,  and certain types of cancer that are some of the leading causes of  preventable, premature death.   Compared to the general population, African Americans are  disproportionately affected by diabetes. African Americans constitute  more than 35 percent of all patients receiving dialysis treatment for  kidney failure but only represent 13.2 percent of the overall U.S.  population.   High blood pressure is the second leading cause of kidney failure  among African Americans and remains the leading cause of death due to  its link with heart attacks and strokes.   With these troubling statistics, where do we go from here? Awareness,  education, and access are the keys to changing our Nation's health, and  food and nutrition practitioners play a very important role in leading  the health revolution.    Obesity is partially attributed to poor nutritional intake and has  been implicated as a contributor to cancer, heart disease, stroke, and  diabetes.   Food and nutrition practitioners have an opportunity and an ethical  obligation to positively influence the healthcare experience of  individuals. These experts have the power to influence factors  affecting health disparities at the individual and the population  levels, including programs such as SNAP, WIC, adult care food programs,  and other nutrition programs.   By connecting with individuals who are most at risk, food and  nutrition practitioners can make a huge change when it comes to the  health of African Americans, as well as the health of all Americans.   I thank the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for preparing this  information for me.                            ____________________
