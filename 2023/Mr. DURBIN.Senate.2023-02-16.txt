Mr. President, I have two separate statements here. The  first I would like to put on the record, just over a week ago, a  devastating earthquake rocked southern Turkey and parts of Syria. The  devastation and loss have been heartbreaking.   I am glad that the Biden administration immediately offered American  assistance and our help to rescue and discover the victims and  survivors. That is what powerful and confident nations do in times of  need.   Turkish people are resilient, and we will help them rebuild from this  tragedy.    Mr. President, today, the Senate voted on the nomination  of Judge Daniel Calabretta, who has been nominated to the U.S. District  Court for the Eastern District of California. Born in Union City, TN,  Judge Calabretta received his bachelor's degree, summa cum laude, from  Princeton University, and his J.D, magna cum laude, from the University  of Chicago.   After clerking for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul  Stevens and working in private practice for 3 years, Judge Calabretta  spent the majority of his legal career--15 years in public service in  California. As the Deputy Legal Affairs Secretary for California  Governor Jerry Brown, Judge Calabretta advised officials on executive  orders following emergency declarations. He then went on to work for  the California Department of Justice, where he defended the Attorney  General and other State officials in litigation on a variety of matters  in Federal and State court. In 2019, Judge Calabretta was appointed to  the California Superior Court as a Juvenile Court judge, where he has  presided over approximately 200 bench trials.   The American Bar Association rated Judge Calabretta as unanimously  ``well qualified,'' and he has the strong support of Senators Feinstein  and Padilla.   In addition to his qualifications and deep ties to the California  legal community, Judge Calabretta will be the first openly LGBTQ+  person to serve on U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  California.   I thank my colleagues for confirming him.                            ____________________
