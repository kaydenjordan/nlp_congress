 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 100th  anniversary of the Rotary Club of Lewiston-Auburn, ME. There are over  35,000 Rotary Clubs worldwide, with the LA Rotary being the 291st.  Since 1917, the LA Rotary has demonstrated a commitment to community  and global service by supporting local organizations, awarding  scholarships to local students, and providing clean water to  communities in Haiti. In their 100 years of service, this exceptional  organization has gained members who represent the unique and diverse  business community of the Lewiston-Auburn area.   The LA Rotary was founded by Captain Frank W. Hulett, who gave his  life during WWI on June 6, 1918, at the Battle of Belleau Wood in  France. Since Captain Hulett signed the application for membership of  Rotary International on March 21, 1917, the LA Rotary has made great  contributions to the worldwide Rotary organization of business and  professional leaders. The LA Rotary has upheld an international  presence by providing humanitarian service, encouraging high ethical  standards in all vocations, and helping to build and maintain goodwill  and peace throughout the world.   I applaud the LA Rotary's emphasis on local and global charity and  giving back to their local communities. The LA Rotary is sponsored by  the many donors who attend their successful fundraisers, including one  that takes place at the famous Lewiston Hot Air Balloon Festival. The  money raised from these fundraisers has gone towards several valuable  projects like the Autism Movie Events, an ongoing project in  partnership with a local movie theatre and the Autism Society of Maine.  The LA Rotary has sustained their all-inclusive pattern by donating to  the construction of the Lewiston Universally Accessible Playground  Project. The playground will be barrier free, with smooth and level  surfaces to make it easier for those with physical limitations, and is  meant to provide an attractive and meaningful space for all, regardless  of physical or sensory development. Another example of their excellent  charity work is that, each May, the LA Rotary also gives back to local  students by choosing seven high school seniors throughout the State to  award $1,000 college scholarships.   I wish to join the communities of Lewiston and Auburn, as well as the  State of Maine, in congratulating the LA Rotary for this remarkable  achievement. I look forward to following their continued growth and  service, and I thank them for their commitment to bettering Maine and  the world.                            ____________________
