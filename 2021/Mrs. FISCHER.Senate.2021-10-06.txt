 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on August 16, as everything was  collapsing in Afghanistan, President Biden said:         We have developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon       capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed       on any direct threats to the United States in the region and       to act quickly and decisively if needed.    He was stating that we don't have to have an on-the-ground presence  in Afghanistan to keep Americans safe and that we can rely instead on  over-the-horizon strikes, where we use drones and other assets to take  out terrorists from hundreds or even thousands of miles away.   Since then, we have learned that the President wasn't being truthful.   At the Senate Armed Services Committee's open hearing on  Afghanistan's disaster, CENTCOM Commander General Kenneth McKenzie  testified on the immense challenges we face in preventing terrorist  groups, like al-Qaida and ISIS, from using Afghanistan as a launching  pad to attack us here at home.  [[Page S6934]]    What President Biden seems to conveniently ignore is that a  successful over-the-horizon counterterrorism strategy requires more  than just the ability to hit targets across long distances. We also  have to be able to identify targets; we have to be able to locate  targets; and we have to be able to reach those targets.   To do this effectively, we first need a U.S. presence in the region  or at least a reliable on-the-ground partner there. Without that, our  ability to gather the intelligence necessary to pick the right targets  is severely degraded.   We saw the tragic consequences of acting on incomplete intelligence  on August 29, when a drone strike mistakenly killed 10 innocent  Afghans, including 7 children and an aid worker with ties to the United  States.   Second, we need a reliable way to actually get to the target.   President Biden likes comparing Afghanistan to countries like Yemen  and Syria, but there is a huge difference between these countries.  Afghanistan is landlocked, and our drones can't just fly over the ocean  to get there, like they can to Syria and to Yemen.   When it comes to Afghanistan, our drones have to cross over other  countries on the way, and those countries are not obligated to allow us  to use their airspace.   General McKenzie confirmed to me during our hearing that, because we  have withdrawn from Afghanistan, we need to rely on Pakistan's airspace  if we want to reach targets like ISIS-K or al-Qaida, and that should  concern every American.   Pakistan, historically, is the Taliban's fiercest international  supporter, and they could revoke our access at any point. And if they  do, we would need to ask China, Iran, or Central Asian nations with  close ties to Russia for permission to use their airspace or even their  bases in order to conduct counterterrorism operations.   When I asked about this during the SASC hearing, Secretary Austin  confirmed recent reports that the U.S. military--the finest fighting  force in the world--has had conversations with Russia about using their  bases in Central Asian nations on Afghanistan's northern border.   Secretary Austin insisted that we haven't asked for Russia's  permission to use these bases; we are simply considering an offer that  they made. But if we have to consider an offer from the Kremlin just to  keep al-Qaida from surging back in Afghanistan, President Biden hasn't  put America on a very strong footing.   The bottom line is that our chaotic exit from Afghanistan has made it  much harder for the U.S. military to keep the American people safe from  terrorists.   Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Milley said during last week's  hearing that Presidents are elected to make strategic decisions. He  also told us that the Afghanistan withdrawal was a strategic failure.   And he was right. The way things stand today, we are at risk of  recreating the same conditions that existed before 9/11. The Taliban is  running things in Kabul, and given their longstanding partnership with  al-Qaida, it is naive to expect that they would prevent these  terrorists from operating freely.   Anyone who says that we are safer today than we were 20 years ago is  getting ahead of themselves, and that goes for President Biden too. He  needs to be more honest about what his decision to leave Afghanistan,  no matter the cost, means for our Nation's security.   Real leaders take responsibility for their mistakes; they do not make  excuses for them. And, unfortunately, that is all we have heard from  the President so far.   I yield the floor.
