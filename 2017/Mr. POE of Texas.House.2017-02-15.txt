 Mr. Speaker, on a recent flight, flight attendant  Shelia Fedrick of Alaska Airlines noticed a young girl, 14 or 15 years  old, with blonde hair. Shelia approached two individuals, but the young  girl refused to speak or make contact with her. The man next to the  girl was defensive as she tried to make conversation.   Something was just not right. Shelia quickly devised a plan. She  convinced the girl to go to the bathroom where Shelia had left a note  stuck to the mirror. The girl wrote back on the note, and she needed  help.   The flight crew quickly alerted the police on the ground. Shelia  Fedrick ended up saving a victim of human trafficking.   Traffickers often ship their victims across the country like baggage.  The Department of Homeland Security and flight attendants are working  together through training to spot warning signs of modern-day slavery.   Thanks to Shelia Fedrick and other flight attendants for their work  in rescuing victims of trafficking. We must continue to stop  traffickers in their tracks.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
