 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3352,  the Department of State Authorization Act.   I would like to first take a moment to thank Chairman Engel and  Ranking Member McCaul for their leadership on this authorization, the  first in more than a decade. Truly, we are overdue.   As a former intelligence officer who has served abroad, I can attest  to the vital contributions of the State Department and its workforce in  keeping our American families safe and secure.   We need to give our diplomatic corps, civil service officers, and  support staff the tools, resources, and training they deserve as they  protect and uphold U.S. interests and values around the world.   Among this bill's strong provisions, I am proud to see my amendment  pass committee to keep the State Department workforce safe from sexual  harassment and assault.   Additionally, I urge my colleagues to approve my amendment to approve  the security assistance coordination between the Department of State  and the Department of Defense. This amendment would help Congress and  the American people better understand how our military deployments  support our diplomatic priorities.   I encourage my colleagues to support this important bill and to  recognize and reinforce our appreciation for the tireless work of our  diplomatic and civil service corps.
