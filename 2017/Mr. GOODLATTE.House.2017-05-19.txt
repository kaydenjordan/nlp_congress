 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 324, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1039) to amend section 3606 of title 18, United  States Code, to grant probation officers authority to arrest hostile  third parties who obstruct or impede a probation officer in the  performance of official duties, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I asked unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1039.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the question  of adopting the amendment to H.R. 1039 may be subject to postponement  as though under clause 8 of rule XX.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Before I address the bill under consideration today, I would like to  take a few minutes to honor a very special  [[Page H4363]]  member of my staff, Burak Guvensoylar, who lost his courageous battle  with cancer this past weekend.   Burak was a valued member of the Judiciary Committee team and worked  on a variety of issues, including digital privacy and intellectual  property. His vast knowledge and grasp of the issues impacting the  technology community was a tremendous asset to the committee.   Most recently, Burak's work included the development of the  committee's Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda; and his steadfast  work and tenacious attitude were not only essential in making this  initiative a success, but were also a testament to his character. In  fact, while he was undergoing intensive cancer treatments, he was  actively working and sending follow-up emails from his hospital bed.  And just days before Burak passed away, he met with FCC Commissioner  Ajit Pai to discuss a number of Judiciary Committee priorities. For  Burak, nothing could prevent him from an opportunity to discuss and  advance the policies he was so passionate about.   Burak was a true technology policy enthusiast. Prior to joining the  staff of the Judiciary Committee, Burak served as a legislative adviser  for Congressman Randy Forbes. While working for Congressman Forbes,  Burak handled the diverse range of issues that fall under the  jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, but it was always evident that  technology policy was his first love.   He cofounded the Congressional Tech Staff Association and served as  an executive officer responsible for the professional development  program.   Prior to his career on Capitol Hill, Burak worked at TechAmerica and  CompTIA, focusing on international trade policy.   Burak has many friends here in the Halls of Congress on both sides of  the aisle. I know all of my colleagues join me in extending our deepest  sympathies to his mother, Filiz; his sister, Aylin Forbes; his  girlfriend, Ashley Newsome; and all of his loved ones.   Burak will be deeply missed.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1039, the Probation  Officer Protection Act of 2017, and urge my colleagues to do the same.   I want to thank the primary author of the bill, the gentleman from  Washington, Congressman Reichert, for his leadership on this and many  other law enforcement issues.   Under current law, a Federal probation officer may arrest a  probationer or an offender on supervised released if the officer has  probable cause to believe that the offender has violated a condition of  his or her probation or release. The officer may make the arrest with  or without a warrant.   Unfortunately, current law does not grant probation officers arrest  authority in situations where a third party attempts to physically  obstruct an officer or inflict physical harm on the officer. Despite  the fact that interfering with a probation officer in the performance  of his or her official duties is in itself a crime, Federal probation  officers lack the authority to correct or restrain a physically  interfering third party.   In fact, a probation officer's only course of action is to retreat  from the situation. This not only exposes these officers to a  heightened risk of harm, as they are not permitted to subdue the  assailant, it also allows the probationer to conceal evidence that he  has violated terms of his probation or supervised release or any other  criminal activity.   H.R. 1039 is a reasonable and responsible remedy to this very real  problem. This bill, which has the support of the Judicial Conference of  the United States and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association,  will protect probation officers and enhance their ability to do their  job by giving them authority to arrest a third party who forcibly  interferes with an officer's performance of his or her official duties.                                time  0915    This bill would not give probation officers general arrest authority.  Rather, as noted, it grants them the very limited authority to arrest a  third party who is interfering with the duties of the officer, which is  already a Federal crime.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure to ensure  that these dedicated men and women have the necessary authority to  undertake their duties safely and effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert), the chief sponsor of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard many arguments in opposition to this  legislation. We have carefully explained how each of these arguments is  unfounded.   I simply want to again urge my colleagues to vote for this very  simple, yet much-needed, piece of bipartisan legislation. Support the  men and women of law enforcement with your vote. Support the Fraternal  Order of Police who wrote a letter supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I enter in the Record the FOP letter.                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                   Washington, DC, 15 February 2017.      Hon. David G. Reichert,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Reichert: I am writing on behalf of the       members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our       support for H.R. 1039, the ``Probation Officer Protection       Act.'' This legislation will amend  [[Page H4367]]       section 3606 of Title 18, United States Code, to grant       probation officers authority to arrest hostile third parties       who obstruct or impede a probation officer in the performance       of official duties.        Probation officers supervise men, women and juveniles who       are convicted of a crime. Instead of a judge sentencing these       offenders to prison, the judge sentences them to close       supervision while continuing to live and work with the       general public. A probation officer's job title comes with an       inherent element of danger due to the supervision of       offenders such as drug addicts, sexual offenders and domestic       violence offenders who could turn violent at any time.       Offenders are often intimidated by the amount of power a       probation officer has over their freedom. If they feel the       officer will recommend a prison sentence or report illegal       activity, which may lead to a prison sentence, they may try       to eliminate this threat by harming the officer.        When probation officers are accosted by a violent third       party, they are forced to retreat because they have no third-      party arrest authority. They also cannot assist any police       officer at the scene who may have been called to assist. This       subjects everyone involved in the situation to greater risk       and can result in the loss of evidence, the escape of an       offender, or harm to an individual.        In the past, offenders typically reported to the probation       officer's office for scheduled visits. Now many probation       officers are required to make home visits where the offender       may have easy access to weapons. While the officer may carry       a gun, and have armed back up in some cases, often he or she       will go into the home or workplace alone without knowing       anything about other persons at the site.        For these reasons, this authority is needed and we are       proud to support your bill and look forward to working with       you on it.        On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to thank you for introducing this       legislation and amendment. If I can be of further help,       please do not hesitate to contact me or my Senior Advisor,       Jim Pasco, in my Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,                                                National President.     Mr. Speaker, support the Federal Law Enforcement  Officers Association, who called H.R. 1039 a ``critical officer safety  measure'' in their letter of endorsement.   Support the National Association of Police Organizations, who said  H.R. 1039 is a ``sensible solution that ensures the safety of the  officer, the probationer, and the community.''   Mr. Speaker, I enter in the Record these letters.                                                         Federal Law                                Enforcement Officers Association,                                       Cabin John, MD, May 17, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf       of the nearly 27,000 members of the Federal Law Enforcement       Officers Association to advise you of our strong support for       H.R. 1039, the ``Probation Officer Protection Act,'' and to       express our appreciation for the Congress's consideration of       this important officer safety measure during National Police       Week. FLEOA opposes the amendment that will be offered on the       floor to sunset the authority provided by the bill, as you       cannot put a stopwatch on critical law enforcement officer       protection measures such as H.R. 1039.        The ``Probation Officer Protection Act'' is a critical       officer safety measure. At a time when U.S. Probation       Officers have seen their workloads increase due to changes in       sentencing policy and are being asked to ``do more with the       same,'' ensuring that they have the means to protect       themselves when placed in harm's way is paramount. H.R. 1039       will fully authorize a U.S. Probation Officer to arrest any       third party who violates 18 USC 111. This statute has been on       the books since the 1940s and makes it a crime for any person       to forcibly assault, resist, intimidate, or interfere with       any federal officer in the performance of their official       duties. Current law, however, only allows Probation Officers       to make arrests of individuals on probation or under       supervised release who violate 18 USC 111. This authority       does not extend to ``third parties,'' which could include a       former associate of the offender or an unidentified member of       the community. In many instances third parties are well aware       that a federal officer's authority is limited to individuals       on supervision, and when a third party does impede or assault       a U.S. Probation Officer, the Officer's only recourse is to       retreat and call for local law enforcement. While in major       cities local law enforcement may respond depending on       availability, the same is not true for U.S. Probation       Officers who work in rural communities where response by       local law enforcement may be a single officer or none. This       places Probation Officers at even greater risk, particularly       in those situations where retreat is not even a reasonably       safe alternative.        During the forthcoming debate on this bill, there will       undoubtedly be those who go to great lengths to demean U.S.       Probation Officers as something less than ``real'' law       enforcement officers or to diminish the hazards that they       face. Some may also raise inchoate objections about the       constitutionality of H.R. 1039. For example, you will hear       that Congress cannot extend Executive Branch police powers to       the Judicial Branch, despite the fact that it was Congress       that established the U.S. Supreme Court Police that resides       directly across the street from the U.S. Capitol. Not only       are such statements factually inaccurate, they display a       basic lack of understanding about those who serve our nation       as U.S. Probation Officers and the purposes behind the       ``Probation Officer Protection Act.''        Make no mistake: U.S. Probation Officers are fully trained       federal law enforcement officers. They attend basic training       at the National Training Academy at the Federal Law       Enforcement Training Center in Charleston, SC, and receive       ongoing in-service training throughout the year. Their       training covers everything from firearms regulation and       safety and defensive tactics to handcuffing, the use of       force, de-escalation training, and reality-based scenario       training. It may be difficult for some to acknowledge, but       there is an inherent risk to the work U.S. Probation Officers       do--a risk that often outweighs that of traditional law       enforcement. They do not enter into sterile offices, but       often into environments that are uncertain. They are required       to have frequent and regular contacts in the home and       community and knowingly come into daily contact with       individuals who have a history of violence, mental health       issues, problems with authority, and troubles with substance       abuse. U.S. Probation Officers are not able to anticipate       what is going to occur during all contacts. There are and       have been occasions when U.S. Probation Officers are       threatened and/or attacked by third parties and they need the       ability to take an affirmative step to protect themselves.        U.S. Probation Officers are a unique profession. They have       a knowledge base in law and human behavior, and a mix of       skills in investigation, communication, and analysis. They       strive to make our communities safer, to make a positive       difference in the lives of those they serve, and promote       fairness in process and excellence in service. But as the       volume of approved searches they must conduct has markedly       increased over the past year due to changes in sentencing       policy, the absence of any authority to restrain or direct       the movements of third parties places U.S. Probation Officers       at a greater and unnecessary risk of physical harm. H.R. 1039       provides a modest expansion of U.S. Probation Officers'       existing arrest authority to cover only violations of 18 USC       111. It does not in any way provide them ``peace officer''       status or grant them the same general arrest authority that       state-level probation officers enjoy in many jurisdictions.       Granting U.S. Probation Officers the authority to arrest       third parties would not change who they are and what they are       seeking. Nor will it interfere with or otherwise diminish       U.S. Probation Officers' use of the de-escalation techniques       that are the hallmark of their profession. It would simply       afford them another tool, another avenue, if ever needed.        In the end, this legislation will enhance officer safety       while also protecting probationers and third parties by       preventing obstruction from escalating to actual violence.       Thank you in advance for your consideration of this       legislation and for helping U.S. Probation Officers do their       job more safely by passing H.R. 1039, the ``Probation Officer       Protection Act.''            Sincerely,                                                  Nathan R. Catura,      National President.                                   ____                                              National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                       Alexandria, VA, May 17, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the National Association of       Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to advise you of       our support for H.R. 1039, the Probation Officer Protection       Act.        NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from       across the United States that serves to advance the interests       of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal       advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,       NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and       associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and       more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to       fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.        Probation officers in the United States have experienced a       significant increase in their workloads due to the recent       changes in federal sentencing guidelines, but they are being       asked to do more with the same amount of resources. With       these officers spread thin, it is important that they have       every means available to protect themselves when put in       harm's way. The Probation Officer Protection Act narrowly       expands current law to grant federal probation officers the       authority to arrest any third party who forcibly assaults,       resists, intimidates, or interferes with the officer in the       performance of his or her official duties.        Currently, when a federal probation officer is assaulted or       threatened by a third party, they must retreat and call local       law enforcement. This not only places the probation officer       in danger, particularly if there is no way to withdraw from       the situation, but it is a strain on local law enforcement       agencies,  [[Page H4368]]       many of which do not have enough officers just to patrol       their communities. The Probation Officer Protection Act is a       sensible solution that ensures the safety of the officer, the       probationer and the community.        We appreciate Congress considering this important officer       safety bill during National Police Week. If we can provide       any assistance, please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                William J. Johnson,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, collectively, these organizations  represent over half a million sworn law enforcement officers. On this  last day of National Police Week, let's join them in supporting this  bill.   In this body, Members tend to frequently use the term ``common  sense'' to describe a piece of legislation. I don't think many more  pieces of legislation are as common sense as this bill.   It really boils down to this question: Should a law enforcement  officer be able to arrest the individual who forcibly assaulted,  resisted, opposed, impeded, intimidated, or interfered with that  officer?   That is it. That is all we are talking about today. Common sense  tells us that the answer is a resounding ``yes.''   It has been insinuated that probation officers aren't real law  enforcement and lack the training to make arrests. I think the brave  men and women who serve as Federal probation officers, who have  received extensive training, and have ongoing training requirements as  part of their jobs, might disagree with that insinuation.   Further, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and  its Federal Probation and Pretrial Academy offer nationally  standardized training programs and advanced training programs targeting  specialized areas of supervision. Common sense tells us that these  officers are qualified to make arrests.   Opponents of this bill would prefer to have these law enforcement  officers retreat when confronted by third parties. Let's think about  what some of the consequences of retreat might mean. If forced to  retreat, that officer is forced to terminate interaction with a  probationer who may urgently require services, such as substance abuse  or mental health treatment. It also means contraband, such as firearms  or narcotics, which could have been removed by the parole officer,  remains in the community.   In short, the consequences of retreat place public safety in  jeopardy. Common sense tells us that retreat is not a viable option.   There is nothing revolutionary going on here. There is no new Federal  crime being added. This bill simply says that when someone forcibly  assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with a  probation officer, that probation officer can arrest that individual.   It is already a crime to engage in the behavior I just described. An  individual who commits that act is going to get arrested. All we are  debating today is who puts the handcuffs on the arrestee. Common sense  tells us that the officer who was assaulted should have the authority  to make the arrest.   Use common sense. Support H.R. 1039, the Probation Officer Protection  Act of 2017, so that Federal probation officers can do their jobs  safely and effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
