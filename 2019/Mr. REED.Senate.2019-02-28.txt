 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity  Disclosure Act along with two members of the Select Committee on  Intelligence, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator Warner,  in addition to Senator Kennedy and Senator Jones, who also serve with  me on the Senate Banking Committee. In response to data breaches of  various companies that exposed the personal information of millions of  customers, our legislation asks each publicly traded company to  include--in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures to  investors--information on whether any member of the board of directors  is a cybersecurity expert, and if not, why having this expertise on the  board of directors is not necessary because of other cybersecurity  steps taken by the publicly traded company. To be clear, the  legislation does not require companies to take any actions other than  to provide this disclosure to its investors.   In Deloitte's 11th Global Risk Management Survey of financial  services institutions, published last month, ``sixty-seven percent of  respondents named cybersecurity as one of the three risks that would  increase the most in importance for their business over the next two  years, far more than for any other risk. Yet, only about one-half of  the respondents felt their institutions were extremely or very  effective in managing this risk.'' According to the 2018-2019 National  Association of Corporate Directors Public Company Governance Survey,  only 52 percent of directors ``are confident that they sufficiently  understand cyber risks to provide effective cyber-risk oversight,'' and  58 percent ``believe their boards collectively know enough about cyber  risk to provide effective oversight.'' Indeed, Yahoo, in its 2016  annual report, disclosed, ``the Independent Committee found that  failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting  contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the  2014 Security Incident. The Independent Committee also found that the  Audit and Finance Committee and the full board were not adequately  informed of the full severity, risks, and potential impacts of the 2014  Security Incident and related matters.'' The 2014 Security Incident  here refers to the fact that ``a copy of certain user account  information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from  Yahoo's network in late 2014.''   This is particularly troubling given that data breaches expose more  and more records containing personally identifiable information.  Indeed, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of  these types of records exposed by data breaches in the business  industry grew from 181,630,520 in 2017 to 415,233,143 in 2018 and in  the medical and healthcare industry from 5,302,846 in 2017 to 9,927,798  last year. Across all industries, the number of records containing  personally identifiable information exposed by data breaches rose 126  percent, from 197,612,748 in 2017 to 446,515,334 in 2018.   Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether  publicly traded companies are prioritizing cybersecurity and have the  capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber related attacks.  Our legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues  through improved SEC disclosure.   In testimony given to the Senate Banking Committee last June, Harvard  Law Professor John Coates, who also practiced securities law as a  partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, expressed support for our  legislation by stating that ``[the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act] is  well designed. It does not attempt to second-guess SEC guidance and  rules regarding disclosures generally, or even as to cyber-risk  overall. The bill simply asks publicly traded companies to disclose  whether a cybersecurity expert is on the board of directors, and if  not, why one is not necessary. To be clear, the bill does not require  every publicly traded company to have a cybersecurity expert on its  board. Publicly traded companies will still decide for themselves how  to tailor their resources to their cybersecurity needs and disclose  what they have decided. Some companies may choose to hire outside cyber  consultants. Some may choose to boost cybersecurity expertise on staff.  And some may decide to have a cybersecurity expert on the board of  directors. The disclosure required would typically amount to a sentence  or two.''   While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking  Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my  service on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on  Intelligence. Through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence  perspective, I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our  national security, and this is particularly the case as our economy  becomes ever more dependent on technology and the internet.   Indeed, General Darren W. McDew, the former commander of U.S.  Transportation Command, which is charged with moving our military  assets to meet our national security objectives in partnership with the  private sector, offered several sobering assessments during an April  10, 2018 hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He stated  that ``cyber is the number one threat to U.S. Transportation Command,  but I believe it is the number one threat to the nation . . . in our  headquarters, cyber is the commander's business, but not everywhere  across our country is cyber a CEO's business . . . in our cyber  roundtables, which is one of the things we are doing to raise our level  of awareness, some of the CEO's chief security officers cannot even get  to the see the board, they cannot even . . . see the CEO. So that is a  problem.''   In my view, this is a real problem because, if we are attacked, the  first strike will likely not be a physical one against the military but  a cyber strike against the infrastructure of movement, logistics, and  other critical assets in the civilian space.   With growing cyber threats, we all need to be more proactive in  ensuring our Nation's cybersecurity before there are additional serious  breaches. This legislation seeks to take one step towards that goal by  encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to their  investors and customers on whether and how their boards of directors  and senior management are prioritizing cybersecurity.   I thank the bill's supporters, including the North American  Securities Administrators Association, the Council of Institutional  Investors, the National Association of State Treasurers, the California  Public Employees' Retirement System, the Bipartisan Policy Center, MIT  Professor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law Professor Jack Coffee, Harvard  Law Professor John Coates, K&L Gates LLP, and the Consumer Federation  of America, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins, Senator  Warner, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jones, and me in supporting this  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Brown, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Barrasso,          Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Collins, Ms.          Cortez Masto, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cruz, Ms. Ernst, Ms. Hassan, Mr.          Hoeven, Mr. Isakson, Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mrs.          Murray, Mr. Portman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schatz, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr.          Tillis, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wicker,          Mrs. Hyde-Smith, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Peters, Mr. Risch, and Mr.          Lee):   S. 604. A bill to limit the authority of States to tax certain income  of employees for employment duties performed in other States; to the  Committee on Finance.
