 Mr. Chairman, the NDAA is laser-focused on one thing,  national security. It shuts down woke programs and protects America's  men and women in uniform.   Since 2021, the DOD has spent $47 million per year to store and  secure unused southern border wall construction material. It is  shameful to waste over $300 million just to prove a point.   This spring, I went to the border and saw miles worth of border wall  material rusting on the ground.   During the NDAA markup, I championed a provision that directs the  Secretary of Defense to submit a plan to use, transfer, or donate  unused border wall material to border States.   My amendment, No. 1495, expedites the plan's due date and mandates  its execution. This saves taxpayer funds and keeps the DOD on mission.   I am proud to have worked on this effort with SASC Ranking Member  Roger Wicker, and I thank HASC Chairman   Mike Rogers for his support.  Together, we will make sure the DOD spends its money wisely and  provides for its servicemembers and installations like Redstone Arsenal  in north Alabama and Huntsville, Alabama.
