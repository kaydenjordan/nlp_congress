 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  Mr. Willie Belton, a political leader, successful businessman, and  decorated war veteran who passed away on January 8, 2020.   Born and raised in Basile, Louisiana, Mr. Belton went on to serve in  the United States Army and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple  Heart for his heroic acts of sacrifice. Later, he received the  Louisiana Veterans Honor Medal in gratitude for his faithful service.   Mr. Belton was also a monumental figure within the civil rights  movement. In 1960, he was chosen to lead a local NAACP chapter and  worked alongside some of history's heroes, including Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., to put an end to racial discrimination and ensure equal  opportunity for all.   Mr. Belton was the first African American in Evangeline Parish to run  for State representative in a predominantly white district. Even though  he didn't end up winning that election, he made an enormous impact on  the State of Louisiana by breaking down barriers, extinguishing fear,  and paving the way for those who followed.   Our prayers are with the Belton family as they grieve the loss of an  American hero. His service to this country and his active commitment to  social justice will never be forgotten.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
