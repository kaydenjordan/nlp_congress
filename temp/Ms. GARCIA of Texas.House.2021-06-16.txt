 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues  to invest in an inclusive care economy to help our families recover  from the devastating effects of this pandemic.   As the price of childcare and eldercare increases, many mothers and  women in my district had to leave the workforce. In a country like  ours, this is totally unacceptable. Mothers are the backbone of our  society and the pillar of my district.   This is why, during our week of action last week, I visited a  childcare center run by a constituent in Deer Park servicing children  with special needs; and I also visited an eldercare center in Pasadena,  in my district.   I witnessed firsthand the lifesaving, life-changing benefits out of  an inclusive care economy for our children and our seniors.   Investing in an inclusive care economy could benefit my district and  communities of color that lack resources to overcome the impacts of  this pandemic.   Let's invest in our most vulnerable with the American Families Plan.   We can recover. ``We can do it,'' ``Si se puede.''                            ____________________
