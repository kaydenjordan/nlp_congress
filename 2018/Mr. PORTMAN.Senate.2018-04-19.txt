 Mr. President, today I wish to honor North  Central State College in recognition of its 50th anniversary of  providing quality higher education to the citizens of Ohio. Chartered  by the Ohio Board of Regents and certified by the Ohio Secretary of  State in May 1969, North Central State College moved to its current  Mansfield location in 1970. North Central State is a regional economic  and innovation leader where the community as a whole benefits from the  increased occupational and investment opportunities of students  remaining in Ohio after their graduation. More than 4,300 students  enroll each year.   North Central State offers more than 70 associate degrees and  certificate programs in public services, health sciences, business, and  engineering technologies. The mission of North Central State College is  to provide individuals with the knowledge, skills, and inspiration to  succeed in their chosen path. During this year's commencement ceremony,  North Central State will present a degree to its 14,000th graduate.   I am here to honor North Central State College and to congratulate  everyone who was involved in making its first 50 years a  success.                            ____________________
