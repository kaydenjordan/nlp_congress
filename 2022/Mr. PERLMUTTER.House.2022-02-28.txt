 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 321) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the members of the  Women's Army Corps who were assigned to the 6888th Central Postal  Directory Battalion, known as the ``Six Triple Eight''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 321         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the `` `Six Triple Eight'       Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed       into law legislation that established the Women's Army Corps       (referred to in this section as the ``WAC'') as a component       in the Army. The WAC was converted from the Women's Army       Auxiliary Corps (referred to in this section as the       ``WAAC''), which had been created in 1942 without official       military status. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod       Bethune, the founder of the National Council of Negro Women,       advocated for the admittance of African-American women into       the newly formed WAC to serve as officers and enlisted       personnel.        (2) Dubbed ``10 percenters'', the recruitment of African-      American women to the WAAC was limited to 10 percent of the       population of the WAAC to match the proportion of African-      Americans in the national population. Despite an Executive       order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941       banning racial discrimination in civilian defense industries,       the Armed Forces remained segregated. Enlisted women served       in segregated units, participated in segregated training,       lived in separate quarters, ate at separate tables in mess       halls, and used segregated recreational facilities. Officers       received their officer candidate training in integrated units       but lived under segregated conditions. Specialist and       technical training schools were integrated in 1943. During       World War II, a total of 6,520 African-American women served       in the WAAC and the WAC.        (3) After several units of White women were sent to serve       in the European Theater of Operations (referred to in this       section as the ``ETO'') during World War II, African-American       organizations advocated for the War Department to extend the       opportunity to serve overseas to African-American WAC units.        (4) In November 1944, the War Department approved sending       African-American women to serve in Europe. A battalion of all       African-American women drawn from the WAC, the Army Service       Forces, and the Army Air Forces was created and designated as       the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion (referred to in       this section as the ``6888th''), which was nicknamed the       ``Six Triple Eight''.        (5) Army officials reported a shortage of qualified postal       officers within the ETO, which resulted in a backlog of       undelivered mail. As Allied forces drove across Europe, the       ever-changing locations of servicemembers hampered the       delivery of mail to those servicemembers. Because 7,000,000       civilians and military personnel from the United States       served in the ETO, many of those individuals had identical       names. For example, 7,500 such individuals were named Robert       Smith. One general predicted that the backlog in Birmingham,       England, would take 6 months to process and the lack of       reliable mail service was hurting morale.        (6) In February 1945, the 6888th arrived in Birmingham.       Upon their arrival, the 6888th found warehouses filled with       millions of pieces of mail intended for members of the Armed       Forces, United States Government personnel, and Red Cross       workers serving in the ETO.        (7) The 6888th created effective processes and filing       systems to track individual servicemembers, organize       ``undeliverable'' mail, determine the intended recipient for       insufficiently addressed mail, and handle mail addressed to       servicemembers who had died. Adhering to their motto of ``No       mail, low morale'', the women processed an average of 65,000       pieces of mail per shift and cleared the 6-month backlog of       mail within 3 months.        (8) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France, in May 1945 and       worked through a separate  [[Page H1153]]       backlog of undelivered mail dating back as far as 3 years.        (9) At the completion of their mission, the unit returned       to the United States. The 6888th was discontinued on March 9,       1946, at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.        (10) The accomplishments of the 6888th in Europe encouraged       the General Board, United States Forces, European Theater of       Operations to adopt the following premise in their study of       the WAC issued in December 1945: ``[T]he national security       program is the joint responsibility of all Americans       irrespective of color or sex'' and ``the continued use of       colored, along with white, female military personnel is       required in such strength as is proportionately appropriate       to the relative population distribution between colored and       white races''.        (11) With the exception of smaller units of African-      American nurses who served in Africa, Australia, and England,       the 6888th was the only African-American Women's Army Corps       unit to serve overseas during World War II.        (12) The members of the ``Six Triple Eight'' received the       European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the Women's       Army Corps Service Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal       for their service.        (13) In 2019, the Army awarded the 6888th the Meritorious       Unit Commendation.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in       honor of the women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory       Battalion (commonly known as the ``Six Triple Eight'') in       recognition of--        (1) the pioneering military service of those women;        (2) the devotion to duty of those women; and        (3) the contributions made by those women to increase the       morale of all United States personnel stationed in the       European Theater of Operations during World War II.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       described in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike       the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.

(a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to       be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise       Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of       the medals struck under this Act.        (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of       duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 4 shall be       deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The 855 women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion,  better known as the Six Triple Eight, were given a mission to sort a 2- year backlog of mail consisting of millions of letters. But these women  did more than just sort and distribute this backlog in record time. As  the largest contingent of African-American women to serve overseas  during World War II, the Six Triple Eight demonstrated successfully  that African-American women could and should be included in the ranks  of the military.   Throughout their time overseas, the Six Triple Eight had a motto:  ``No mail, low morale.'' Beginning in February 1945, with their arrival  in Birmingham, England, the Six Triple Eight perfected their sorting  processes, setting up three 8-hour shifts running 7 days a week. At  peak efficiency, they processed for delivery 65,000 pieces of mail per  shift.   Army leadership estimated it would take between 6 months and a year  to clear the backlog of mail. The women of the Six Triple Eight did it  in 3 months.   The Six Triple Eight were then moved to Rouen, France, where they  continued their mission, often working in cold, dark, and damp  conditions and alongside German prisoners of war and French civilians.   Finally, this group of women was moved to Paris, where they remained,  sorting and distributing mail to American troops through May 1946. In  all, the Six Triple Eight were estimated to have distributed 17 million  pieces of mail.   Yet, despite their important contributions to boosting troop morale  and their work to dispel racist stereotypes within the military of the  value and dedication of African-American women in the armed services,  the accomplishments of the women of the Six Triple Eight went  unrecognized for decades. This bill is small, but it is a significant  step toward ensuring the Six Triple Eight's contributions are  acknowledged and widely celebrated.   The bill directs the United States Mint to strike a Congressional  Gold Medal in honor of the women of the Six Triple Eight Central Postal  Directory Battalion in recognition of their pioneering military service  and contributions to increasing the morale of all American personnel  stationed in Europe by ensuring no mail from loved ones was left  undelivered.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my friend from Ohio--and I thank  him for his remarks--if he has any other speakers. If not, I was hoping  Ms. Moore would be here, but I am prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his personal  remarks about how important the mail--receiving mail and receiving  communication--is.   There were 7 million people in the European theater during World War  II, and there were many names that were exactly the same that these  women had to sort through. In fact, there were some 7,500 individuals  named ``Robert Smith,'' and they had to figure out precisely who was to  receive what mail. They did this, and they did this in very difficult  environments and were able to provide the morale that was so key to all  of these soldiers, sailors, and airmen and -women in their service.   So I suggest to my friend from Ohio that we close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Mfume).                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio  because I thought we were all finished, but obviously there are other  speakers and there is time on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  thank the sponsor of this bill and the passion she always brings to  this floor. I also thank the sponsor of the bill in the Senate, Senator  Moran from Kansas. I thank everybody for their hard work in ensuring  the women of the Six Triple Eight receive the recognition they so  richly deserve.   As Drexel University historian Gregory S. Cooke notes: They knew what  they did would reflect on all other Black people. The Tuskegee Airmen,  the Six Triple Eight, represented all Black people. Had they failed,  all Black people would be seen to have failed. That was part of the  thinking going into the war. The Black battalions had the burden that  their role in the war was about something much bigger than themselves.   The women of the Six Triple Eight fought a battle indeed greater than  the warehouses stacked to the ceiling with bags and bags of undelivered  mail and ensuring our Nation's soldiers received letters from back  home. It was also a battle for equality and for recognition and respect  from their fellow Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
