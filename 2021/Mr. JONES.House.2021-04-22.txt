 Mr. Speaker, I have had enough of my colleagues' * * *  insinuations that somehow the people of Washington, D.C., are incapable  or even unworthy of our democracy. One Senate Republican said that D.C.  wouldn't be a ``well-rounded, working-class State.'' I had no idea  there were so many syllables in the word ``white.''   One of my House Republican colleagues said that D.C. shouldn't be a  State because the District doesn't have a landfill. * * * *   The truth is there is no good-faith argument for disenfranchising  over 700,000 people, Mr. Speaker, most of whom are people of color.    Mr. Speaker, there is no good-faith argument.    Mr. Speaker, that is fine. You have my consent to  withdraw.    Mr. Speaker, the truth is, there is no good-faith argument  for disenfranchising over 700,000 people, most of whom are people of  color.   These desperate objections are about fear--fear that, in D.C., their  white supremacist politics will no longer play; fear that, soon enough,  white supremacist politics won't work anywhere in America; fear that,  if they don't rig our democracy, they will not win.   Today, Democrats are standing up for a multiracial democracy, to  democratize all 51 States in this country.
