 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  amendments offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis) and the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).   As we all know, North Korea has targeted the United States with cyber  attacks, and they are well on their way to being able to strike the  United States with conventional and nuclear weapons. These two  amendments would prohibit the Department of Defense from contracting  with telecom companies found to be complicit with North Korean cyber  attacks or Chinese companies found to be providing support for the  North Korean regime. There is no reason that we should be contracting  with countries that are enemies of the United States.   I also support the amendment offered by my friend from Michigan (Mr.  Bishop). Without a doubt, NATO is the greatest military alliance in the  world, but that alliance works most effectively when the members of  those various countries are pulling their weight and fulfilling their  commitments in regard to their own defense budgets. This amendment  calls on the President to encourage NATO allies to fulfill their  commitments and to recognize those who are currently doing so.   I wholeheartedly agree with these amendments, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
