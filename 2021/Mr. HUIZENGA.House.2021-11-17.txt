 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a symbol of  true bilateral relations and collaboration between the Kingdom of the  Netherlands and the United States.   One hundred years ago, a group of Dutch Americans, including Franklin  D. Roosevelt, established the Netherland-America Foundation. The  creation of this foundation, commonly known as NAF, has spurred  innovation and cooperation between our two nations through engagement  with the arts, business, and public policy.   NAF works alongside the Caucus on the Kingdom of the Netherlands,  which I am proud to co-chair, to strengthen the existing relationship  between the United States and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.   The Dutch-American network has established deep connections  throughout both of our nations, which is evident by the many NAF  chapters spread from coast to coast here in the United States,  including in my home area of west Michigan, as well as the Netherlands.   One of the greatest examples of exchanges between our nations is the  prestigious NAF-Fulbright Fellowships that enable the foundation to  offer awards to Dutch and American scholars pursuing graduate study  degrees.   I am honored to recognize the Netherland-America Foundation and its  100-year record of success in celebrating our shared heritage and  enhancing our cultural exchange. These strong bonds will continue to  build on our past successes and develop a more prosperous and mutually  beneficial relationship in the future.                            ____________________
