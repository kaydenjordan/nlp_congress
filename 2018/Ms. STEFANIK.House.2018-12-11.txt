 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th  anniversary of the Adirondack Forty-Sixers, an organization in my  district whose 10,000-plus members have climbed all 46 peaks of the  Adirondack Mountains.   Since their founding by brothers Bob and George Marshall, the Forty- Sixers have been central to promoting environmental stewardship,  protecting our natural resources, and encouraging younger generations  to enjoy the great outdoors.   The Adirondacks are an essential component of our tourism economy.  The Forty-Sixers have done important work giving back to the mountains  they love and making the peaks more accessible. They have also  prioritized community outreach and volunteerism. Their all-volunteer  trail maintenance program is critical to keeping trails available to  hikers from across the world and, in turn, protecting our environment.   For the past century, young hikers have been mentored and trained by  this dedicated group of environmental stewards, and I know that over  the next 100 years, many more will be inspired to experience the  Adirondack Mountains.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Adirondack Forty- Sixers on this incredible milestone.                            ____________________
