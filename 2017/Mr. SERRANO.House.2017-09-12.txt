 Mr. Chairman, I am in support of the en bloc amendments.  We have worked on it jointly, and I support all of the amendments that  are included in the en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Rosen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to take a moment to say  to my friend that my prayers and my thoughts are with him, his family,  his constituents, Texas, Florida, the Caribbean, South Carolina, my  birthplace of Puerto Rico, and all the other folks who have been  through this very difficult time.   I intend to use my vote on appropriations in whatever way it can to  serve to help those communities as they get back on the road to  recovery.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and I  commend the authors for offering it.   This effective program funds a series of centers that help small- and  medium-sized manufacturers to develop new products, attract new  customers, and reduce protection costs.   Because this bill received an inadequate allocation, the chairman was  forced to partially agree with the President's efforts to undermine our  manufacturing sector, and the bill currently contains a cut of $30  million from the MEP program. This amendment provides an important  downpayment in restoring funding for this important program. We will  have to do better down the line, but this is a good start.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I feel comfortable with Mr. Cohen withdrawing his  amendment because I know the chairman, Mr. Culberson, is very  supportive of this program.   It is interesting to note that this program was born in a bipartisan  fashion, with President Nixon, at that time, being the main supporter  of it.   The bill only provides $300 million for Legal Services, which is a  cut of $85 million from fiscal year 2017. This amendment provides a  downpayment towards restoring these cuts, and I commend the authors for  offering it.   We should not be cutting LSC funding at a time when more people than  ever qualify for these services. Legal aid providers always must turn  away more than half of eligible applicants. They already do that, and  these cuts would only create a bigger problem.   Very briefly, in closing, there are a lot of issues that we can  discuss that make America great. One of them is the right to legal  representation. If you can't afford it, then this is where programs  like Legal Services come in and support.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This reduction would have a significant impact on public safety. The  ATF would be investigating fewer firearm traffickers and violent gangs.  They would be unable to respond effectively to theft burglaries from  Federal firearms licensees. These cuts would weaken the ATF's ability  to do its primary responsibilities: combat violent crime and regulate  the firearms and explosive industries.   Not surprisingly, a reduction of this magnitude would result in  approximately 400 employees being laid off. According to the ATF, that  means they would have to eliminate approximately 200 special agents, 65  industry operations investigators, and 135 professional technical  positions. The elimination of these positions at ATF directly degrades  the Department's capacity to combat violent firearm crimes and regulate  the firearms and explosives industries.   I just think that this is not a proper amendment at this time or, for  that matter, at any time, and I join the chairman in agreeing on this.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this very  misguided amendment. This amendment would allow felons and other  dangerous individuals to try to regain the ability to own guns by  sending an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives.   I am not sure why the Member would offer an amendment that makes it  easier for felons to get guns. Most Americans would be shocked by such  a proposal. Each year since 1993, Congress has prohibited ATF from  processing applications from felons seeking to have their gun rights  restored, and with good reason.   Prior to 1993, there were numerous examples of felons who had their  gun rights restored by ATF only to go on to commit further crimes  later. For example, in 1977, Michael Paul Dahnert of Wisconsin was  convicted of burglary. In 1986, he was granted relief and allowed to,  once again, own firearms. Two months later, he was rearrested and  charged with first degree sexual assault and four counts of second  degree sexual assault, for which he received 5 years in prison.   In 1977, James Morgan was convicted of perjury to a grand jury. In  1988, he was granted relief and allowed to gain and own firearms. He  was arrested that same year for first degree wanton endangerment and  later sentenced to 6 months confinement and 2 years probation.   These are only a few examples. It is important to point out that the  gentleman's amendment makes no distinction as far as the seriousness of  the offense for which the individual was initially denied a firearm,  and ATF would need to investigate all applications for gun rights  restoration. Furthermore, simply processing these applications would  require significant ATF agent resources and would divert ATF away from  its core law enforcement mission of fighting firearm offenses.   Since 1998, when the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System was put in use, well over 1 million firearm transfers have been  denied after background checks established that the individuals  attempting to purchase the firearms were prohibited from processing  firearms.   Even if only 20 percent of the denied individuals file an application  with ATF to have their gun rights restored, this would require the  efforts of hundreds of full-time ATF agents to perform background  checks of these individuals. The agents would be diverted  [[Page H7261]]  from their primary law enforcement investigation.   Even though ATF is legally required to ensure that the applicant  ``will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety,''  we know that this process is not perfect, as evidenced by the examples  I just gave.   The bottom line is that this amendment would give guns back to felons  and, at the same time, sharply reduce ATF's resources for pursuing  violent crime investigations. Both of these outcomes would seriously  harm public safety, and for these reasons, I strongly urge my  colleagues to reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, if you hear the opposition to this  amendment, you would think that discrimination does not exist in this  country any longer. Oh, how I wish that were the case.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment. This amendment would strike  the harmful EEOC rider which blocks the EEOC from collecting data on  the expanded EEO-1 form. This data collection would allow EEOC to  better examine pay patterns by industry and/or geographic region and/or  employer or establishment, conduct comprehensive statistical analysis,  and evaluate the context of the discrimination allegations.                                time  1530    The EEOC will use the data primarily for early assessment of  allegations of discrimination based on sex, ethnicity, or race. In  short, the newly expanded form will be critical to closing gender and  racial wage gaps. Preventing the collection of this information will  result in less oversight and more wage discrimination.   Mr. Chair, I strongly support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chair, if the gentleman had brought some cooked  fish, I probably wouldn't read this.   Mr. Chair, this is not an appropriate amendment for inclusion in an  annual spending bill. Congress should not be in the business of  micromanaging fish conservation in this manner.   The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is an interstate  compact that was established in 1942 as a mechanism to allow Atlantic  coastal States to join forces in managing their shared fishery  resources.   For over 75 years, this Commission has served as a body for the  Atlantic coastal States, coordinating the conservation and management  of 27 nearshore fish species. Each State is represented on the  Commission by three commissioners who participate in deliberations and  interstate fisheries management, fisheries science, habitat  conservation, and law enforcement.   Through these activities, the States collectively ensure the sound  conservation of management of their shared coastal fishery resources.  We should allow the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to do  its job in managing fish stocks. We must not allow the House to be in  the business of second-guessing them and micromanaging fish regulations  in particular locations.   There is a process currently in place for addressing these issues at  the regional level, and we should allow that process to work. A stock  assessment for striped bass is planned for next year. The Atlantic  States Marine Fisheries Commission can make a determination as to  whether it intends to ask the Federal Government to open up the Block  Island Transit Zone to striped bass fishing.   Currently, the consensus position of the Atlantic States Marine  Fisheries Commission is that the fishing restrictions should remain in  place. I believe that this is a bad precedent for Congress to interfere  with this State-driven process.   For that reason, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    I rise in opposition to the amendment, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. This amendment is very inappropriate for this bill and sets  a bad precedent. We should not be tying the hands of the ATF as it  attempts to keep our law enforcement officers safe.   The Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act established a process to  ensure that police officers do not face a threat of armor-piercing  bullets capable of being fired from concealable semiautomatic handguns.  This law passed the House of Representatives in 1985 by a vote of 400- 21. Then it later passed the Senate by a vote of 97-1.   For far too long we have dealt with irresponsible riders on  appropriations bills that put limits on our ability to keep our  communities and our law enforcement officers safe. This is just one  more example.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the defeat of this amendment.   I may say to my colleagues that this is one of the issues that  baffles me the  [[Page H7268]]  most. I don't hunt, but I respect people who do. I don't target  practice and target shoot, but I respect people who do. But it seems  that more and more every day, as we have more and more violence, we  want more and more stronger weapons because otherwise we are going to  lose our rights if we don't do so.   Mr. Chairman, our rights are at the ballot box and many other places,  not just in our holster. I think if we continue to do this, first of  all, this is the wrong place to do it, and, secondly, it is the wrong  thing to do.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just very briefly, I usually don't get up  a second time, but to my friend--and he is my friend--it is a confusion  in this country. This is not about protecting the Second Amendment. We  all do. Everybody does.   It is about common sense and asking: Where does it stop? How do we  keep it from growing? How violent can we get? How many people can we  shoot?   That is what this is about. It is not about the Second Amendment. The  Second Amendment is well protected. Trust me.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It  would prohibit funds allocated in the bill from being used on the  construction and operation of private, for-profit prisons.  [[Page H7269]]    The use of private prisons in our country is a crisis. More and more  Americans are being locked up in facilities that don't respect basic  human rights. One in four people behind bars worldwide is in a United  States jail. That is right. A country with less than 5 percent of the  world's population accounts for a quarter of all the world's prisoners.  In fact, our prison population has continued to increase over the past  few decades, even as statistics have shown a decrease in crime.   According to the FBI, violent and major property crimes are at  historic lows. Nevertheless, more and more Americans are getting locked  up. There are several reasons for this: from overly punitive mandatory  minimum sentences to the cycle of poverty in the school-to-prison  pipeline.   But one thing is for sure: so long as there is an incentive to build  prison cells for profit, there will be more Americans unnecessarily  behind bars. So long as we perpetuate the prison industrial complex, we  will find it harder and harder to reduce our bloated prison population  and make meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system.   Last year, an investigative reporter for The Nation uncovered  horrible conditions at private correction facilities. Inmates were not  receiving basic medical care, even items required by the Bureau of  Prisons. In one case, they were kept in rows of bunk beds in un-air- conditioned domes, baking in the heat and the sun. In another case, the  poor conditions sparked riots by the inmates.   Now, don't get me wrong. I feel no sympathy for violent criminals who  have no remorse for what they did and deserve to be locked away for  their crimes. But our Founders knew that we have an obligation to  maintain respect for human life, and they enshrined it in our  Constitution by protecting against cruel and unusual punishment.   When this report came to light, President Obama's Attorney General,  Loretta Lynch, chose to act. The President issued a memorandum saying  that we would phase out the use of private prisons, partially by  seeking to reduce our prison population.   But in February, in keeping with this administration's policy of  simply reversing everything President Obama did, Attorney General Jeff  Sessions rescinded the order. He has since indicated that we won't  continue to use private prisons.   We will use more of them, and we will lock up more people to fill  them. What a disgrace. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars and a waste of  countless American lives that could be turned around and made into  successful citizens.   I am proud that in my home city of New York we have decided to divest  our pension system from the for-profit prison industry. But now it is  time for the Federal Government to divest itself as well.   We must continue to work on comprehensive criminal justice reform  that seeks to reform mandatory minimum sentences and curb the failed  war on drugs and focus on reentry and reintegration so that those who  serve time can become productive members of society, rather than  lifelong inmates.   Tonight, we can start with this amendment and send a message to the  Trump administration. Tonight, we can tell him not to reverse the  progress made under President Obama and Attorney General Loretta Lynch.  Tonight, we can say that making money off of incarcerating individuals  is simply inconsistent with American values.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   This executive order was signed by President Obama in July 2010. The  National Ocean Policy is designed to improve stewardship of our oceans,  coasts, islands, and Great Lakes by directing government agencies with  differing mandates to coordinate and work together. The National Ocean  Policy creates no new authorities.   The result of increased coordination is better stewardship of our  national heritage through improved government efficiency, better  development and use of data and information, and a process of open and  transparent stakeholder engagement that informs decisionmaking. This  increased coordination between agencies needs to take place on a  Federal level to reduce inefficiency, waste, and redundancy between  agencies.   The National Ocean Council brings together State, local, and Tribal  governments and all of the oceans uses, including recreational and  commercial fishermen, boaters, industries, scientists, and the public,  to better plan for, manage, harmonize, and sustain uses of ocean and  coastal resources.   The bottom line is that the National Ocean Policy offers an avenue  for thoughtful planning around issues affecting ocean, coastal, and  Great Lakes areas. It is the best choice for stakeholders looking to be  involved in the process.   For all of these reasons, I urge the defeat of this amendment.   Before I reserve the balance of my time, on a personal note, it is  amazing how much work we have done in the south Bronx with what little  bodies of water and green space we have, how much we cherish it, and  how much we feel that it has been a gift that we continue to work on.  We no longer have earmarks, but when we did, it did a great job in  restoring a lot of areas.   I see how, in other parts of the country and at the Federal level, we  want to undo years and years of progress. I keep thinking of Republican  leaders who took a different view. Teddy Roosevelt would be so upset at  so much of what we are doing today because he saw the world in a  different way. Thank God that he was our President for that period of  time when we needed him for that particular issue.   Just on a personal note, I understand that a lot of people see the  world differently than I do. Where I come from, tonight people know  they now have places where they can row a boat, where they can  eventually swim, where they can fish, and where a beaver named Jose has  returned.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this unnecessary amendment. All  this amendment does is prohibit use of funding to violate current law.   As we all know, Federal grant recipients of the State Criminal Alien  Assistance Program, or SCAAP, are not using Federal funds in  contravention of Federal law.   The amendment is really about so-called sanctuary cities. This and  other amendments like this seek to effectively overthrow community  policing by diverting State and local police from their core mission of  protecting public safety. Imposing this one-size-fits-all approach  would degrade trust between immigrant communities and local police,  thereby undermining public safety in all communities and for all  residents.   We should not be attempting by word or deed to turn our local law  enforcement into an arm of Federal immigration efforts. I live in a  sanctuary city, and I can tell you with great certainty that amendments  like this one will make my hometown less safe. People will be less  likely to report crimes and cooperate with investigations simply  because of the concern that they will be deported for interacting with  local law enforcement.   What we need is broad and humane immigration reform which would place  undocumented immigrants on a workable and earned path to citizenship,  thereby allowing them to contribute even more to their families,  communities, and our country.   Our immigration system is broken, but this amendment does nothing to  fix it. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.   And I must say, the sanctuary cities, as they are called, have a lot  of support from law enforcement throughout the Nation because they know  that they need to speak to people in the community and get information  on who the bad guys are or who the bad gals are, number one.   Number two, this is going to be a boom for the legal profession  because just about every city and every State is going to sue if this  ever became law. And we actually started holding moneys back because  they know how much help is brought to their community and how much they  want to keep it in place.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
