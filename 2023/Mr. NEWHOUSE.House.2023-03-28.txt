 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on  this important issue.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to talk about something that affects every  single person, not only in this room but in our entire country. You  need it to turn on the lights. You need it to drive your car. For my  folks back home in central Washington, it is how you run your farm,  your business, and your home.   Recently, the cost of that energy has gone through the roof. For  years now, the Biden administration has been telling the Nation that  global markets are complex and that there are dynamics that are out of  our control that contributed to the highest gas prices since 2008 and  spiking global oil prices.   We know better. This administration has effectively shut down all  future energy and resource development, has created one of the most  hostile environments for energy and resource producers, and continues  to take actions  [[Page H1507]]  every single day to further their Green New Deal agenda. They should  absolutely be held responsible for the burden now placed on the  American people, who are struggling to make ends meet.   While it is very clear to me, just as I know it is clear to my  constituents, that President Biden and this administration are failing  to display the leadership America needs and deserves, there is a silver  lining here. That is H.R. 1.   The Lower Energy Costs Act will finally get government out of the way  of the American people. It will put an end to serial litigants stopping  energy projects. It will cut through the endless red tape our producers  face. It will unleash American energy to lower the cost for every  American.    This is what we need, and it is what the American people deserve.    Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor and remember the  life of a dear friend and an inspiration to central Washington  communities, Valerie ``Val'' McCain, who unexpectedly passed away this  past Sunday.   Val was an incredible leader with over 30 years of industry  experience across several continents. At the time of her death, she  served as the project director of the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and  Immobilization Plant and as senior vice president of Bechtel.   Val was an inspiration to workers across the Hanford site and in the  Tri-Cities communities. She also served our local and government  communities on boards of the Energy Facility Contractors Group, TRIDEC,  The STEM Foundation, and Columbia Industries.   Val's death is a loss for our community, but her leadership and  contributions to central Washington will never be forgotten. We should  all strive to emulate her engagement and selfless citizenship.   May she rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, throughout the month of March, the Western  Caucus has been highlighting the need for permitting reform in almost  every aspect of the Federal Government.   Permitting and regulatory reform have long been a priority for the  Western Caucus and it has become even more important in recent months.   As our Nation fights to reestablish energy independence, we need  certainty for American energy producers and a reliable process for  increased critical mineral mining.    As catastrophic wildfires threaten the West year after year, we need  permitting processes that empower State and local land managers to  effectively manage our forests and our grasslands.   As rural communities are faced with more and more Federal overreach  from the Biden administration, they deserve certainty and transparency.  That is why we must reform our broken permitting processes to unlock  American investment and unleash the potential of rural America.   Landmark environmental protection laws like NEPA and the ESA have  truly gotten out of control. While well intentioned they are, they are  now used by serial litigants to stall critical infrastructure and  management projects.   These far-left environmental groups use these statutes to drive  political wedges and ensure America is dependent on her adversaries.  Endless cycles of litigation tie the hands of project developers, of  land managers, and of private conservationists, all while posing a  serious threat to both our local economies as well as our environment.   As a farmer from the central part of the State of Washington and as  chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, I see how regulations  from the Federal Government have disproportionately negatively impacted  our rural communities. This is unfair for so many reasons, but the main  one being that these are exactly the men and women that we should be  empowering.   In rural America, our livelihoods depend on a healthy environment and  on our natural resources. We truly have a vested interest in and a  storied history of protecting our lands and our waters. We just need  the Federal Government to literally get out of our way.   That is why House Republicans have introduced H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act, to deliver on our promise to unleash American energy  and lower prices for all consumers, regardless of what industry they  are engaged in.   H.R. 1 updates our broken permitting process to actually let  Americans mine, let Americans farm, let Americans manufacture, to  process, and to build so that our country can grow and thrive once  more.   Today, I am joined by Western Caucus members from across our country  who will shed light on how broke permitting processes throughout the  Federal Government have kneecapped  [[Page H1518]]  rural communities and how H.R. 1 can help resolve many of these  challenges.   In order to truly unleash American potential, we must reform our  permitting processes and we will continue to advocate for commonsense  policies that will do just that.   As the preeminent voice for rural America on Capitol Hill, we have an  expansive membership who have been on the front lines of the crafting  of H.R. 1, our top legislative priority. We will continue to highlight  the need for permitting reform to get more energy projects online and  lower the cost to battle the inflation caused by the Biden  administration's reckless agenda. This evening, many of our members of  the Western Caucus will be here participating.   I ask the Speaker's indulgence that Mr. Stauber from Minnesota  actually manage the time for our Special Order tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
