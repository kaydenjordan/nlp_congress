 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the  ongoing economic crisis our Nation is facing.   Study after study has found that the Democrats' budget proposals  attack every part of our economy, from gas prices to groceries to  middle-class workers and small businesses. Americans are struggling to  make a living.   Gas prices have skyrocketed to $3.15 per gallon, the highest price  for a gallon of gasoline since 2014 and a 42 percent increase from last  year. As we continue to fall back into pre-pandemic routines, families  hoping to travel this summer can't afford the rising prices for fuel.   I am also deeply concerned by the rising costs of everyday  necessities. Over the past year, consumer prices have shot up 5.4  percent, reflecting the biggest increase since 2008, which was the last  economic crisis the United States faced.   The bottom line is that hardworking American families cannot  withstand the negative impacts of rising inflation. As long as this  administration continues to spend trillions of dollars on failed  policies, Americans will be left to foot the bill. I will continue to  fight to ensure Oklahoma families and businesses do not suffer more in  this economic crisis.                            ____________________
