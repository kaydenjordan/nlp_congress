 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I commend and thank my  colleague from Virginia for organizing this Special Order.   I am pleased to join with all of my colleagues who have spoken  strongly in favor of revitalizing, reenergizing, making sure that the  340B program is implemented in a very serious way.   I welcomed a young intern to my office this afternoon, and he was  coming from Tufts University. I shared with him the fact that it was  Tufts University in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, that started the first of  the federally qualified health centers and that he was in  [[Page H5328]]  a good place. I worked with 2 of them personally, and there were only  10 in the country at the time. Now, of course, we have more than 2,000,  and they are practically in every State, every community, wherever you  are.   I represent a large, urban, low-income community with 23 hospitals,  many of which are safety net. I think I may have more hospitals than  any single area. A discount for the individuals who use these  institutions will be more than helpful to them, so I urge that we  continue the program, but I really urge that we enforce and make sure  that they do what they were designed to do.
