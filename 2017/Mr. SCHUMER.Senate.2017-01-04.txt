Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.                             Affordable Care Act     Mr. President, I apologize to my good friend the  Republican leader. I couldn't be here for his remarks. I intended to  be, but our President stayed longer and then I was meeting with the  Vice President-elect. I apologize for that.   I also wish to recognize the distinguished majority leader and  reiterate what I said yesterday: I sincerely hope, just as I heard he  hopes, that we can find common ground in the Senate. While we at all  times inevitably disagree on the right way forward for our country, I  know he is a patriot who cares deeply about this institution. That  matters a lot to me. I learned that through a meeting set up by my  friend from Tennessee. We had a dinner, and I walked away convinced  that Leader McConnell cares a lot about making the institution  function. That matters, and that can maybe help us through some of the  rougher times. We know it has grand principles, grand practices, and a  grand tradition in our national life, something we both want to  preserve.   Yesterday, in my opening remarks as a Senate leader, I did remind our  Republican majority and the President-elect that there would indeed be  places where we can work together, and I named a few of them, but let  me be perfectly clear, kicking millions of Americans off their health  care and throwing the entire health care system into chaos is not one  of them.   I am deeply troubled that the Republican majority and seemingly the  President-elect are plotting, as one of their first campaigns in the  new Congress, a full-scale assault on the American health care system,  not just the Affordable Care Act but Medicare and Medicaid as well  because they are inextricably bound. Those are the pillars that support  the American health care system, but as its first order of legislative  business, the Republican majority has decided to put forward a budget  resolution to repeal health care reform. Although he promised not to  cut Medicare in the campaign, the President-elect has nominated a man  who spent his career strategizing health care's demise, and he chose  him to be Secretary of HHS. I don't think that is something a vast  majority of Americans or even Republicans believe in.   It is too clear that President-Elect Trump and the Republican  Congress are intent on making America sick again. Republicans seem  determined to create chaos, not affordable care, for the American  people.   Today, I would like to focus on the budget resolution on the  Affordable Care Act. I understand why the majority thinks they have to  do it. Over the past 8 years, they promised every group--conservative  group and audience in the country, they would repeal the law, ``root  and branch.''   For a long time, it has been only a conservative fever dream.  Republicans knew they could make extreme promises about replacing it  with something better without ever having to consider the consequences  or even come up with a reasonable plan to replace it because they knew  the Democrats or President Obama would ultimately block their attempts  to roll back the law.   Now things are different. The consequences of repealing the  Affordable Care Act are real. I sincerely urge my colleagues to deeply  consider the consequences. It is no longer just a game or a political  line to say ``repeal'' because now you have to replace. So far, it has  been 5 years of repeal, repeal, repeal; not one replace plan has  garnered  [[Page S31]]  a lot of support even on the Republican side of the aisle, let alone in  America.   What will it mean for average Americans if you repeal the law without  any viable replacement? Not just the 30 million who might lose coverage  right away--that is a staggering number, many of them in very red and  poor States and rural areas. What will happen to the overall  marketplace if you rip away all the safeguards of the ACA and have put  nothing in its place?   It doesn't matter if you repeal and delay, as some of my friends on  the other side of the aisle call it, for 1 year or 2 years--however  long. Folks will lose a lot of benefits, and the insurance marketplace  could fall apart long before repeal goes into place. As insurers raise  their prices because they have to with repeal, costs to the average  American who has employer insurance will go up as well. My colleagues  will own that, just as we owned everything that happened previous to  this election.   Let me tell you, if Republicans pull the plug on health reform, on  Medicaid, and privatize Medicare, it could mean absolute chaos, not  affordable care. It would likely increase prescription drug costs,  premiums, and out-of-pocket costs to American families--not, as I said,  just for the families that got coverage on the exchanges but for all  American families, even if you get insurance through your employer. I  repeat that to America. Everyone who has employer-based insurance and  is not part of the ACA should worry about this repeal with no replace  because their costs will go up, sure as we are here together. It would  put insurance companies back in charge. It would allow them to  discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions.   We all know of people. Parents--their kid has cancer. They would look  for an insurance company. Oh, no, your son has cancer, your daughter  has cancer, you can't get it. What are our colleagues going to do about  that one? No answers yet. I doubt they have good ones. It would cause  premiums to skyrocket. It would unravel the insurance market.   I would ask my colleagues before they jump into this repeal to talk  to their local rural hospitals. In my State, rural hospitals are a  mainstay of our rural economy. They are the largest employer in many of  our towns and villages. Remember, New York has New York City, but we  are the third largest rural State in the Nation, only behind  Pennsylvania and North Carolina. In those areas, merely repealing the  ACA and not doing anything else is going to hurt those hospitals  dramatically. In fact, today, in 11 State capitals, rural hospitals-- many of them in red States--protested a repeal of the ACA.   It could also exacerbate--I don't want to forget--the opioid epidemic  by ripping away coverage from 1.6 million newly insured individuals  struggling with substance abuse disorders. We worked so hard in the  Cures Act to cover people. Far more would be undone by this act of  repeal in terms of fighting opioid abuse.   For all my deficit-hawk friends, your proposal causes a trillion- dollar hole in the budget--at least a trillion. My colleague from  Washington thinks it might be even higher, and I rarely doubt her. What  are you going to do, deficit hawks, once you repeal and that hole in  the budget becomes enormous?   This is not conjecture. My Republican colleagues would be wise to  remember how the American health care system operated before health  care reform. Health care costs were growing at a much faster rate than  they are today, eating into workers' paychecks and dissuading them from  taking risks and changing jobs lest they lose a good coverage plan. A  debilitating illness could wipe out a lifetime of hard-earned savings  because there was no cap on health care costs. Women were charged more  than men for the same health coverage. It was outrageous. We will go  back to those days with repeal.   Many couldn't get insurance if they had a preexisting condition. Some  insurance companies would simply delete you from their rolls if you got  sick. You want to go back to those ``good old days''?   Today, because of health care reform, those things are no longer  true. Health care costs are rising much more slowly than before, and  the uninsured rate is the lowest it has ever been. I don't think any  American would want to go back to the health care world of yesteryear  where insurance companies wrote the rules and costs spiraled up  unchecked, but Republicans seem all too eager to dial back the clock  and make America sick again.   Democrats are united in our opposition to cutting Medicare, to  cutting Medicaid, and to repealing health care reform, and we will hold  the Republican majority and the President-elect accountable for the  consequences of repealing health care reform.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs  on agreeing to the motion to proceed.   The yeas and nays have been ordered.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
