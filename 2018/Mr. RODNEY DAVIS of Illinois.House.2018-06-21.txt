 Mr. Speaker, I wish I could use that  picture that my colleagues had up because we are debating a solution to  an issue that Congresses for decades have not addressed.   Immigration is a difficult issue. It invokes strong feelings on both  sides. But it is an issue that is long overdue. This vote today is  important for showing the American people that we can govern.   The President supports it because it is strong on border security,  provides a permanent solution for the DACA population, supports merit- based legal immigration, and codifies the law to allow families to stay  together.   Frankly, these are all issues I have heard Republicans and Democrats  talk about fixing. I hope some of my friends on the other side of the  aisle will vote for this bill, and I think, if we were in a different  time, many would.   But I am not sure that is going to happen. That is why we need every  Republican to be with us.   It is not an easy issue, but we were elected to lead. By passing this  bill, which has the best chance of making it through the Senate and  being signed by the President, we could be the leaders who finally  secure our borders, provide certainty for people who were brought here  as children through no fault of their own, move our legal immigration  system to a merit-based process, and keep families together--all issues  that both sides have talked about solving, but today, with this vote,  we could be the ones who solve these problems for decades.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' because it is a vote to govern.  Governing is hard, but I am confident that we can get it done.
