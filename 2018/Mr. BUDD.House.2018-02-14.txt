 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and my friend and  colleague from North Carolina, the deputy whip, for his leadership on  this very important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan  legislation, the Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, we are on the verge of something special in the  financial services space with financial technology  [[Page H1154]]  opening the industry up to amazing innovation. However, as many of us  gathered here today know, the Second Circuit's decision in the Madden  v. Midland Funding case has put this innovation and movement in  jeopardy. It has done so by undermining a long-held principle which has  left fintech lenders and the secondary credit market with issues that  need to be addressed.   Luckily, Mr. McHenry's legislation provides a much-needed fix to the  Second Circuit's decision by codifying the valid-when-made legal  doctrine. This common law principle has been around and accepted in the  financial services space for some time now. This bill will ensure that  innovative lending practices remain intact, allowing creative and  innovative sources of capital to reach the consumer and small  businesses. This is important because it will help to preserve the  relationship between banks and fintech firms.   I am thankful this legislation is coming up for a vote today because  it is greatly needed and, if enacted, will help our economy continue to  grow. This body must continue to serve as an advocate for innovation in  the credit and financial technology space because, ultimately, it will  benefit community development, job creation, and, most importantly, the  consumer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bipartisan and commonsense piece  of legislation.
