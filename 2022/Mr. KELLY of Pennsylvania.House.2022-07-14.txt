 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the  2,500 unborn lives we lose to abortion each day who cannot stand for  themselves. That is nearly half a million little boys and little girls  in the United States alone this year. These numbers don't reflect,  though, and take into consideration self-administered chemical  abortions.   Last month, the Supreme Court announced what the pro-life movement  was waiting half a century to hear: Roe v. Wade is overturned. As a  proud pro-life grandfather of 10, I enthusiastically applaud the  Justices for recognizing that this terrible relic from 1973 has no  place in 2022.   Roe was both a legal and moral abomination from the beginning. It  mocked our Nation's Constitution and paved the way for the abortion of  more than 63 million innocent babies in the years since.   The men who first decided Roe invented the right to abortion out of  thin air. By adding an extra line to our Constitution, they ignored one  of the first sentences of the Declaration of Independence, which holds  that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights,  that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   With Roe in the dustbin of history, the abortion question returns to  the democratic arena where it belongs. The most contentious of issues  can now be properly debated and deliberated at both the Federal and  State levels, where, ideally, the most logical and persuasive arguments  can triumph and translate into new law.   Let us have clear eyes to see exactly what science shows us, that  fetuses in the womb are human beings who develop with each passing  second. These innocent children have their own DNA and soon develop  hands, feet, eyes, and lips. They can also feel pain. Just as  importantly, they have the potential to grow up, flourish, and achieve  amazing dreams. Let us have the compassion to give them that chance.   For those of us in elected office who sincerely believe that human  life is a sacred gift from God in need of society's protection, our  position is no  [[Page H6614]]  longer theoretical. We now have a pressing responsibility to examine  how public policy can best be crafted to adequately accomplish our  stated goal.   I believe we already have an answer. When an expectant mother visits  a doctor for an ultrasound, the image of a beating heart is the first  confirmation that a child has been conceived. When someone is involved  in a severe accident, a medic will check right away to see if there is  a pulse to make sure the victim is alive. In short, a heartbeat means a  life.   Now, to legislate consistently with this truth, I introduced the  Heartbeat Protection Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. This  bill would legally prohibit future abortions from being performed if a  preborn child's heartbeat can be detected, with the exception for when  a mother's life is in danger. It is a science-based, humanity- respecting solution suited to the new landscape in which we find  ourselves.    The post-Roe world is here. As legislators in each State determine  the extent to which they wish to defend life, pro-life Members of  Congress can simultaneously take action to make our beloved country a  place where both children waiting to be born and their mothers are  acknowledged and safeguarded.   Mr. Speaker, tonight, we have a very distinguished group of Members  with us who will also speak on this subject. This doesn't have to turn  into an angry debate. This doesn't have to turn into something that  people get so upset with each other about that they can't even sit down  and talk intelligently about what is going on.   If we cannot see the value of life every day in every single person,  then what have we witnessed this year, just this summer--the horror  that has taken place in our own cities, the loss of life that we have  experienced, the sincere sorrow that this country feels. Yet, we have a  blind eye and a deaf ear to the cries of the unborn.   Do they not deserve that same type of consideration that every human  being deserves?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. McClain).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), another member of the fantastic Pennsylvania  conference group and a strong defender of life.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Republican leadership group.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).  I think we came into Congress in 2011 and it has been a pleasure  serving with you. I appreciate your comments tonight on this very  important issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my friend and a strong defender of life.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Grothman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), a  great consistent defender of life.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann), another  great defender of pro-life and consistent member of pro-life.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert), somebody who has been a friend of mine since way  back in 2011, and who has never stopped fighting for life since he got  here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  the great State of Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is another great defender  of life.   We have been defending life for so long with such great patience and  such great prayer. It has always been done in a peaceful manner.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  the great State of Georgia (Mr. Allen). Again, I thank the  Representative for  [[Page H6617]]  being with us tonight. He is a great defender of life.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Representative  for his remarks. Tomorrow is a big day for all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Mississippi (Mr. Guest). As we all ponder tonight what tomorrow will  bring, I thank Mr. Guest for being with us and defending life in every  step of the way.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Representative  for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Representative  Rose's being here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I will use some of the time we have remaining. I know  that we always want to debate this proposed legislation about what is  good about it and what is bad about it. Oftentimes, we use languages to  actually disguise what it is that we are actually talking about.   Tomorrow as we will debate and vote on the Women's Health Protection  Act, abortion is the only medical procedure where two people go into  the doctor's office and only one comes out alive. I know that in this  people's House we have had heavy debate, and I know that both sides are  divided on it and sometimes the language gets out of hand. It gets too  hateful.   My colleagues on the other side have often said to me:         Look, we believe like you believe. We believe that life is       sacred. We believe that every--every--child has a chance, and       that unborn child is waiting to be born and waiting to       experience all that life has to offer. But, you see, the       Supreme Court took that option away from me. My personal       preference would be life, but the Supreme Court took that       option away from me.    So tomorrow, as we debate the Women's Health Protection Act and we  hear a lot of discussion that goes back and forth and defending and  then tearing apart and people adding to and subtracting from, we come  to a lot of different things.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to share with you that last weekend while we  were home, I had the opportunity to visit in Erie, Pennsylvania, in the  district that I represent, I visited a women's care center. This is a  center where too often they are described as people who are trying to  discourage pregnant mothers from actually giving birth. They are trying  to lead them into a different direction.   I just want to say this: the people who man these agencies give up a  day of their life to come in and help counsel women who are going  probably through some of the most difficult times of their life. Maybe  it is not the right time for them to have that child. Maybe there is a  financial problem, and it is just not right right now.   Maybe there is something else that stands in their way, and they are  saying: Well, I am so alone. I am by myself. I don't know how I would  handle this.   To those ladies who go through that, I would say that there are  options available to you. The adoption option is there. We have  thousands upon thousands of people who would love to adopt a child and  to give it a loving home and to help nurture it as it goes through its  lifecycles. We also have foster care that is available.   I know that I have talked to too many women who have experienced the  [[Page H6618]]  anguish of going through an abortion and then later on thinking that  they made the biggest mistake of their life and holding that guilt  feeling in their life.   I would just like to suggest that we are a very forgiving society. We  are a people who say:         Look, don't let that ruin your life. Don't let that ruin       your life. There is forgiveness, there is grace, and there is       mercy.    We know that. But as we stand here tonight in the people's House--in  the people's House--how did we ever get to this point?   How did we ever in the United States of America decide that all life  is not precious?   I mentioned earlier some of the horrific instances that have taken  place just in the last few weeks, in the last few months, and in the  last few years.                                time  2000    I know that, on Wednesdays, a lot of Representatives wear red, and  that is to bring about the remembrance of the Boko Haram and the little  girls who were kidnapped and never returned. It is always about ``we  need to get our girls back.''   We have such open hearts, and we have such understanding in some  cases. Then in other cases, we just close our eyes. We plug our ears.  We say: No, no. You don't understand. In this situation, the conception  of that child was not what we were looking for. That is not what we  wanted, but it happened, and now we have a problem. What are we going  to do with this little girl or this little boy?   I know people look away. They look to the sky, and they look to the  walls, and they look to the floor, and they say: Look, my personal  preference would be--but the Supreme Court made a decision. The Supreme  Court has just righted a very wrong decision.   I hope that, at some point, the greatest defender of life in the  history of the world, the greatest defender of liberty and freedom in  the history of the world, the United States of America, would take a  look at the course and the direction it has been taking for the last 50  years.   Millions upon millions upon millions of little boys and little girls  have been denied the right to life. Where in our history did we ever  come up with this idea that abortion is okay?   Look, I said earlier, I understand there are times in your life--I  can just tell you this: As a father of four and a grandfather of 10,  between our firstborn child and our second-born child, there was a  pregnancy that took place. It was an ectopic pregnancy. My wife has  wondered forever what that child would have been like had she gone full  term.   I want to take a moment, Mr. Speaker, as we close now. In this  building, in this room, in this town, tomorrow, we will have a chance  to look at what it is we are doing and where we are going. I would just  ask it all to be prayerful, peaceful, and understand that this is an  issue that we can no longer close our eyes to.   If it is your personal preference, if it is something that you think  is right for life, then, please, walk away from any political bend that  you may have and look at the policies.   We are here for the best interests of the United States and the best  interests of our American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you so much for your indulgence. I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________
