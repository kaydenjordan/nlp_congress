 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, soon to be chair,  for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for Mental Health  and Well-Being Act.   After years of lockdowns and social isolation, the mental health of  our Nation's citizens, and especially our youth, is at an all-time low.  But H.R. 7666 begins to return us to a better path, so I thank the  chairman and ranking member for all their hard work to make this a  reality.   I am especially pleased that portions of two bills that I had the  pleasure of working on with my colleague from Maryland were included in  this legislation. One such provision would amend the Medicaid Inmate  Exclusion Policy to allow incarcerated juveniles who have been detained  pending trial to continue to receive Medicaid coverage. Pretrial  detainees are, by definition, presumed innocent. As a matter of due  process, we should not be denying critical health benefits to anyone  who has not been convicted of a crime.   From a practical standpoint, reforms to the Medicaid Inmates  Exclusion Policy will help our local law enforcement better manage the  shockingly high percentage of inmates who suffer from mental illness.   H.R. 7666 also includes language to create a behavioral health  coordinating office, another issue that I have had the pleasure of  working on. Many Federal programs to address the mental health crisis  currently lack clear, unified direction and coordination, which is a  recipe for redundancy and waste.                                time  1415    The reforms in today's bill will bring all the major agencies into  the room, including the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Health  and Human Services, and the Director of National Drug Control Policy to  develop a unified approach to addressing topics ranging from substance  abuse care to delivery of better telehealth.   There is always more work to be done to improve the mental health of  our Nation, but H.R. 7666 is an important step, and one we need now  more than ever.   Madam Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this  critical legislation.
