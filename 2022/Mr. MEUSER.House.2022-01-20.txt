 Mr. Speaker, in business, a 1-year review is customary.  So let's review the Biden administration's first year by the numbers.  As we tend to say in business, the numbers don't lie.   Regarding the economy, there are 6 million Americans unemployed while  10 million jobs remain unfilled. The vast majority of small businesses  are hiring, yet 95 percent report few applications. Inflation, Mr.  Speaker, is at a 40-year high of 7 percent. Gas is up 50 percent, and  it costs about $100 to fill up the gas tank on a pickup truck.   Regarding national security, it is really no better. Two million  illegals have crossed our border. Twice as much fentanyl is coming in;  we have over 100,000--sadly--fatalities throughout the United States.  And we have 125,000 troops preparing to invade Ukraine.   We have 2-mile long lines for COVID testing in my district.   Mr. Speaker, we are not going to hold our breath for corrective  action to be taken by the Biden administration; they have stated how  they plan to double down. It will be up to the American people to solve  this problem come November.                            ____________________
