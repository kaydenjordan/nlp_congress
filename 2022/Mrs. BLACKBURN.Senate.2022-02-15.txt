 Madam President, over the past year, the Biden  administration has put out some truly absurd propaganda, but last week,  they released something that was so over the top that I had to double- check to make sure that it was real. Yes, of course, it has up here  that it was issued February 7, 2 p.m., and it is going to expire June 7  of this year at 2 p.m. It had all the markings of something that was  legitimate, but it is so outrageous that I confirmed that it was  actually a government-issued document.   Of course, I am referring to the Homeland Security memo that is  summarizing the current terror threat to the United States. Under  normal circumstances, you would expect a threat assessment to be a  helpful document. That is what we have come to expect. But in this  case, it wasn't obvious before, but now it is so obvious. It is crystal  clear that conventional definitions of the word ``normal'' no longer  apply to this administration.   If you have not read this, you will not believe your eyes. What makes  it so uniquely infuriating is the ease with which DHS used an official  document to equate violent terrorists with Americans who refuse to fall  in line with the Biden administration's narrative of the day. They did  it so easily, just laying out their case of threat assessments to the  United States.   Alongside descriptions of actual violence and threats against  churches and schools, DHS warns of ``the proliferation of false or  misleading narratives, which sow discord or undermine public trust in  U.S. Government institutions.'' The bulletin specifically identifies  ``widespread online proliferation of false or misleading narratives  regarding unsubstantiated widespread election fraud and COVID-19'' as  ``[k]ey factors . . . contributing to the current heightened threat  environment.''   Yes, you heard me correct. They identify widespread online  proliferation of false and misleading narratives regarding  unsubstantiated widespread election fraud and COVID-19.   So let's decode this. They are not just talking about acts of  violence committed to achieve a political or an ideological goal; they  are talking about dissent. What does DHS suggest someone do if they  find themselves menaced in the court of public opinion? They want you  to report the offender to law enforcement. That is right--report the  offender to law enforcement.   I have come to the floor time and again to detail just how frightened  the American people are of Joe Biden's radical agenda, but this  bulletin is the best evidence I have seen to date of just how  frightened Joe Biden is of the American people. They must be scared to  death over there in that White House. How dare anybody question them?  How dare anybody call them into question for the agenda that they have?  I would even go so far as to suggest that this betrays his  administration's desire to police the speech,  [[Page S695]]  thoughts, and opinions of American citizens and to deputize the public  to help keep dissenters in line.   The Biden administration is as close as they ever have been to  declaring that expressing public disagreement with their agenda is akin  to an act of domestic terrorism. Think about this. It isn't just an  outrage; it is dangerous for a few different reasons, the most  important of which is that it ignores the line differentiating violence  and threats from constitutionally protected speech. The former have no  place in public discourse. Let me be very clear about that. The former  have no place in public discourse. The latter is essential to the  functioning of our democracy.   Indeed, this Nation's democracy--one of the reasons we have stayed  free and have stayed a democratic republic is because we share respect  for robust, respectful political debate. But it appears, with this  administration, they have thrown that out the window to say: It is our  way or it is the highway. We don't want to hear any dissent. We don't  want to hear a point, a counterpoint. We don't want to entertain an  objection. We are busy. We are busy pushing our socialist agenda. We  don't have time for free-thinking, independent individuals to raise  their hands and ask a question. It is ``get in line'' time. We have a  short window. We have to make this happen.   I would suggest also that it cheapens the horrors of actual terrorism  and dilutes the perceived danger of violent extremism. It is an insult  to the memories of those who died in the September 11 attacks and the  Oklahoma City bombing and to those who were at gunpoint at a  Colleyville, TX, synagogue. But lastly and most despicably, it suggests  that Americans will never be safe until we consent to live in a  constant state of fear. According to this bulletin, security is  impossible in the face of dissent. It betrays a nightmarish and  completely un-American end game.   Today, I sent a letter to Secretary Mayorkas urging him to make it  clear that this is just sloppy communication on their part.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  February 15, 2022.      Hon. Alejandro Mayorkas,      Secretary of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Homeland           Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Mayorkas: On February 7, 2022, the       Department of Homeland Security (``the Department'') issued a       National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin (``the       Bulletin'') that summarizes the current terrorism threat to       the United States. Among other terrorism threats, the       Bulletin warns of ``[t]he proliferation of false or       misleading narratives, which sow discord or undermine public       trust in U.S. government institutions.'' The Bulletin       specifically identifies ``widespread online proliferation of       false or misleading narratives regarding unsubstantiated       widespread election fraud and COVID-19'' as ``[k]ey factors       contributing to the current heightened threat environment.''       To combat these threats, the Bulletin recommends that       Americans report ``potential threats'' and ``maintain digital       and media literacy to recognize and build resilience to false       or misleading narratives.''        I am concerned about the appearance of the Department of       Homeland Security policing the speech, thoughts, and opinions       of American citizens. In issuing this Bulletin, the       Department of Homeland Security appears to endorse particular       narratives regarding controversial issues that are at the       center of our national political conversation. By identifying       dissenting beliefs as ``[k]ey factors contributing to the       current heightened threat environment,'' the Department comes       dangerously close to suggesting that publicly disagreeing       with the current administration is akin to domestic       terrorism. And by associating opinions that deviate from this       administration's chosen narrative with terrorism threats--and       asking the public to report these ``threats''--the Department       of Homeland Security is chilling public discourse across the       country.        I urge you to make very clear to the American public that       the Department of Homeland Security does not consider those       who disagree with this administration to be domestic       terrorists. I further urge you to clarify that the Department       will not interfere with the rights of all Americans to speak       publicly about their political views, including any views       that might conflict with the policies and political talking       points of this administration.        As the Secretary of Homeland Security, you took an oath to       uphold our Constitution. Enshrined in the Constitution is the       freedom of speech, and that includes the right to question       the government and its preferred narrative. Speech that       questions the President's position regarding issues like the       COVID-19 pandemic and election law reform falls within the       heart of the First Amendment's protections. In fact, the       Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that this kind of       ``core political speech'' is ``the primary object of First       Amendment protection.'' It is your duty as the Secretary of       Homeland Security to ensure that your Department does not       interfere with this core protected speech in any way.        To be clear, violence and true threats of violence are not       constitutionally protected speech and have no place in our       public discourse. There are real threats to the United       States, our homeland. and our citizens from malign foreign       governments and terrorists. The Bulletin correctly recognized       this fact and aptly referenced the January 15, 2022 attack on       a synagogue in Colleyville. Texas as an example of the       continuing threat of violence that our nation faces. The       Department of Homeland Security is charged with protecting       Americans from these true threats. The Department should not,       however, police the public discourse of American citizens       simply because that discourse might ``sow discord or       undermine public trust in U.S. government institutions.''       Indeed, robust public debate--including debate that questions       the government and its policies--is central to any       functioning democracy.        Many Americans have expressed doubts regarding topics like       COVID-19 mask mandates and the origins of the COVID-19       pandemic. Many others have voiced frustration regarding state       and federal election laws. Whether this administration agrees       with these views is irrelevant; the First Amendment protects       all of them from government interference. I urge you to       revise the Bulletin to make clear to the American public that       it is decidedly not the role of the Department of Homeland       Security to enforce particular narratives or to quash the       speech of those who disagree with this administration.            Sincerely,                                                  Marsha Blackburn,                                             United States Senator.     Madam President, I would also like to briefly quote  for the record precisely what I asked him to do:         I urge you to make very clear to the American public that       the Department of Homeland Security does not consider those       who disagree with this administration to be domestic       terrorists. I further urge you to clarify that the Department       will not interfere with the rights of all Americans to speak       publicly about their political views, including any views       that might conflict with the policies and political talking       points of this administration. . . . I urge you to revise the       Bulletin to make clear to the American public that it is       decidedly not the role of the Department of Homeland Security       to enforce particular narratives or to quash the speech of       those who disagree with this administration.    This is a very simple request. My hope is that Secretary Mayorkas  recognizes his obligation to put everyone at ease by fulfilling it.   I can guarantee there are people in my beloved Tennessee who are very  upset, as they have read this bulletin, because they treasure their  free speech. They treasure the ability to have robust political debate.  They like talking with their friends and neighbors and having those  discussions and seeing if they can pull them to their side of an issue,  whether it is a local, State, or a Federal issue. They want to preserve  that freedom.   This memo says that freedom does go away, that it overrides the  Constitution, that it overrides the rule of law. If you do it, somebody  can report you, and it will be considered something not tolerated by  this administration.   The Biden administration put out this bulletin to highlight a  particular danger, but the real danger lies in the document's subtext.   Even if Secretary Mayorkas makes good on his oath to defend the  Constitution and if he moves forward to revise the bulletin, I fear  much damage has already been done. Through this document, the Biden  administration has made it abundantly clear that they view dissent as a  threat and that punishing dissent is the cost of maintaining public  safety.   I wish I could dismiss this as yet another political spat, but the  White House is the world's biggest and most powerful bully pulpit. When  the Biden administration talks, people listen, and they take them  seriously.   If what I have laid out today is not the position of the Biden  administration, it is their obligation to speak up and to correct the  record. If it is their position, it is our obligation as elected  representatives to put ourselves between the American people and any  official who would dare tolerate such a dystopian power grab.  [[Page S696]]    Also, we should remind those officials that how they feel about our  constitutional right to dissent is absolutely irrelevant.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
