 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate  Cincinnati State Technical and Community College for 50 years of  service to the greater Cincinnati community.   I have been privileged to visit Cincinnati State many times, most  recently the Evendale campus to see firsthand the opportunities they  provide to so many students. With four campuses, small class sizes, and  over 100 associate degree programs, Cincinnati State is truly an  excellent college.   Perhaps most notably, Cincinnati State plays a critical role in  developing our region's workforce. Through extensive co-op programs and  relationships with the University of Cincinnati and 600 industry  partners, Cincinnati State paves many career paths, especially for  nontraditional students.   Finally, I thank Dr. Monica Posey for her dedication to making  Cincinnati State an even greater asset to our community.   Congratulations to Cincinnati State on its 50th anniversary. We look  forward to many more.                            ____________________
