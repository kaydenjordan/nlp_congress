 Mr. Chairman, I rise to thank the gentlewoman from  Utah for offering this very important amendment at this time in  American history. A lot of us have received threats, and I think this  is a good amendment. I would like to thank the gentleman from Louisiana  for stepping up to support it as well.   I would like to reiterate the point that this amendment could save  lives, and it doesn't add a single penny to the budget, to the debt, to  the deficit. This doesn't add a single penny, and yet it could be  responsible for saving the lives of our colleagues.   So I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Utah for offering it  and the gentleman from Louisiana for supporting it.   I would urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.
