 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time to speak on this important bill and also for his tremendous and  strong leadership on our committee.    H.R. 4296 would set reasonable standards for regulators that are  based primarily on the risk posed by a banking organization's current  activities and businesses, not on past activities, as you have heard.   Operational risk standards were created and are a product of the  European Basel Committee and have been amended twice, actually, since  that time. But their adaptation still doesn't hit the mark, and that is  why, though the Basel Committee's proposal is well intentioned, this  bill and this proposal will amend that to tailor it to the needs and to  the effectiveness and efficiency of our banks.   The current framework is based on past activity and will hold  operational capital on discontinued products, products that banks don't  even have in their portfolios. This bill will correct those errors by  allowing our U.S.-based financial regulators to tailor the capital  requirements they need based on their unique business model.   H.R. 4296 limits the burden of operational risk capital requirements  to a bank's current activities and businesses, gives the bank the  ability to determine risk under forward-looking assessment, and would  permit adjustment on risk-mitigating factors.   This bill, as you have heard over and over, does not eliminate the  Federal Government's ability to assess operational risk or alter the  regulators' authority to set capital requirements when doing business  on high-risk customers.   Mr. Luetkemeyer's bipartisan legislation would create a commonsense  reform to the Basel standards, and I urge all Members to support it.   I also want to thank Congressman Meeks, a fellow New Yorker, for  cosponsoring this legislation.   Again, I want to thank Mr. Chairman for his great work on our  committee and also Mr. Luetkemeyer for his hard work, his bipartisan  work on this bill, for a person who is a banker, a business person from  a rural area of our country who really understands the need to protect  consumers.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alan Williamson  from Greene, New York, in New York's 22nd District.   Alan Williamson is a true craftsman who keeps history and tradition  alive through his business ventures in Greene. Each of his businesses  is inspired by trades that are slowly becoming a lost art in our  country.   Alan runs an antique sawmill, a shingle machine, a shoelace business,  a rope-making business, and a broom-making business.   Alan recently created a one-of-a-kind broom for President Trump. It  is alternating red and white, with stars wrapped up the handle. The  ``Presidential Broom'' is fitted perfectly inside a wooden and glass  case that Alan also crafted.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Alan the best of luck and hope that his  beautiful, patriotic, and handcrafted broom makes it to the White  House.                            ____________________
