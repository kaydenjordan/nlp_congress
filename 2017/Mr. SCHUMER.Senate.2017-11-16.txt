 Mr. President, as the Senate Finance Committee continues  to mark up the Senate Republican tax bill, the House will take a vote  this afternoon on their version of the bill.   There are plenty of reasons for House Republicans to vote against  this bill. For those who care about deficits, you should vote no  because the bill increases deficits by over $1.5 trillion, likely more.  Any deficit hawk should be against this increase.   Any defense hawk should be wary of this bill for the same reason.  High deficits make it harder to fund important priorities like the  military. This morning, three former Defense Secretaries--Leon Panetta,  Chuck Hagel, and Ash Carter--penned a letter warning that the  Republican tax plan could result, in their words, in a ``hollowed-out  military force'' wracked by cuts to training, maintenance, flight  missions, and other vital military programs.   I spoke to General Mattis yesterday. He is definitely afraid of a CR  because a CR is at sequestration levels. If we pass this tax bill with  its huge deficit, we will have no choice but to go back to  sequestration, and the fears of our defense leaders that they cannot  fund the military adequately will be very real. So my shout-out is to  all of those who care about defense, particularly our defense hawks: If  you vote for this bill, you are going to be voting for a ``hollowed out  military force,'' as three former defense secretaries have written to  us this morning.   For those House Republicans who represent middle and upper class  suburban districts, you should vote no because this bill will raise  taxes on a  [[Page S7271]]  high number of your constituents. Members of Congress from New York,  New Jersey, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Virginia know that  State and local deductibility is crucial to working families in their  districts. Today, House Republicans in many districts will take a vote  to raise taxes on their constituents. And the compromise--the first  three-quarters of the break is rescinded even with the compromise over  in the House, but, second, the Senate, so desperate for money, has not  even included the compromise here. You can be sure when it comes back,  that compromise will not be in the bill--certainly not as generous as  it is now. It was not very generous to begin with.   According to the New York Times, the House bill would raise taxes on  a third of middle-class taxpayers next year and almost half by 2027.  The rich, meanwhile, will do just fine.   The Senate bill, similarly, would raise taxes on 20 million middle- class Americans by 2027. Meanwhile, folks making over $1 million will  get an average cut of $50,000. People say: Well, they have more money;  they should get a bigger tax cut. No. The wealthy are doing great. They  don't need any tax cut. Give the money to the middle class.   The number of middle-class families who would lose money from this  bill may even be higher now, considering the 10-percent increase in  premiums that will occur as a result of the Republican plan to repeal  the individual mandate. That 10-percent increase in health premiums  could more than wipe out the tax cuts received by some folks in the  middle. All the while, 13 million fewer Americans get health insurance.   My friend, Senator Graham, recently said: ``I hope every Republican  knows that when you pass a repeal of the individual mandate . . .  [healthcare] becomes your problem.'' Lindsey Graham is very politically  pressured. He is telling his Republican colleagues that if they do  this, every problem in healthcare will be on their backs.   The whole idea of taking money from the pockets of hard-working  Americans, of taking money out of their healthcare and giving it to big  corporations and those at the very top is so backward, so wrong, that  the American people will reject it, and the blame will fall on  Republican shoulders. If the Republican tax bill should pass, it would  make our economy, so unfairly tilted toward the top as it already is,  even more unbalanced and unfair.   Over the past three decades, as technology has changed our economy  and our world has become ever more interdependent, our economy has  grown. Yes, it has grown; there is a lot of growth. But that growth,  more than at any time in history, has been captured entirely, almost,  by big corporations and the top 1 percent and particularly the top 0.1  percent of our country. We don't begrudge them. We are glad people work  hard. With new ideas and hard work, people should become wealthy, but  they don't need a tax break.   At the same time, middle-class families have muddled along. Median  income has barely nudged up in three decades. The costs of college,  healthcare, prescription drugs, cable, and the internet have  skyrocketed as corporations have consolidated in their industries,  reducing competition and driving up prices.   For the middle-class families in the suburbs, for the working parent  in the city, for the young millennials just setting off into the  workforce after college, for the single mom raising two children, it is  about as hard as ever to balance your income with ever-rising costs. In  such an economy, tax reform could really matter to those folks, but  only if it is done right.   Instead of focusing all their efforts on improving the condition of  those working Americans, Republicans have directed the lion's share of  the benefits to the already wealthy, the already powerful--corporate  America and the very rich.   There is perhaps no better example than President Trump and his  family, for whom this bill would be an express mail gift from Heaven:  Repealing the estate tax, they have a big one; repealing the  alternative minimum tax--the Trumps pay a lot of alternative minimum  tax; dropping the rate on passthrough entities like the Trump  Organization, a huge tax break for Donald Trump.   So scrapping middle-class deductions while maintaining loopholes for  real estate businesses, golf course owners--who do you think came up  with this plan? Not the average middle-class guy or gal. All of these  things contained in the House Republican bill would likely pile more on  top of President Trump's fortune while millions and millions of middle- class families end up paying more.   I am not sure any family in America feels it is right to subsidize  tax cuts for folks like President Trump and his family, and their  voices will be heard during the debate on this bill and afterward.   This bill will be a huge burden for Republicans to carry on their  backs over the next year, make no mistake about it. So we hope they  will vote down the bill in the House and in the Senate. I want to  assure my friends in the Senate on the other side of the aisle that if  the bill goes down, Democrats are ready, willing, able, and eager to  work with Republicans on a bipartisan reform.                                     DACA    Mr. President, before I yield the floor, seeing my friend Senator  Durbin here, I would like to address one final issue--the Dreamers.   My dear friend Senator Durbin has an uncommon eloquence. He speaks  with eloquence and yet with Midwestern common sense. He speaks with  persuasiveness and ease on a great number of subjects. He is a great  asset to our Democratic caucus and to the Senate as a whole, but there  is no doubt that the Dreamers are at the top of his list. They are near  and dear to his heart. He is one of the chief architects of DACA and  has labored on their behalf for as long as I can remember.   Every Dreamer should thank Senator Durbin. He is their sponsor, their  champion, and their staunchest advocate.   This morning I would like to join him in recognizing the  contributions of a Dreamer in my State--a reminder of the glaring need  to pass the Dream Act, since President Trump so misguidedly terminated  the program a few months ago.   Zuleima Dominguez is a DACA recipient who lives in the Bronx. Zuleima  was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was 7 years old.  She has grown up in the United States and has gone to school here; she  went to her first dance in the United States and knows no other country  as her home.   Like so many other Americans, Zuleima is working her way through  college--Hunter College, part of City University on the Upper East  Side--but because of her legal status, she has been unable to access  enough help to afford her tuition. So what does Zuleima do? She works  45 hours a week at a homeless shelter, giving back to her fellow New  Yorkers while saving up for her next semester.   She is studying to be a social worker. Isn't Zuleima what we hope an  American citizen would be like? Wouldn't we all be proud to call her  our neighbor, our friend, our daughter?   She is someone who works hard and feels a calling to give back to her  community. Zuleima has the quintessential American spirit, as had  millions who came to this country before her, through the centuries.   She is part of that long and grand tradition of immigration in this  country, of folks coming from all over the world to find a better life  here, build strong families and communities, and make indelible  contributions to our society, our economy, and our culture.   Zuleima and her two children are part of that American tradition.  They, with all of us, are what makes America great.   There are many more Dreamers just like Zuleima who came to this  country through no fault of their own as very young kids. They study at  our schools; they work in our companies; they serve in our military.  They are American in every single way but one--their paperwork.   We must fix that now and forever by passing the Dream Act through  Congress and giving folks like Zuleima and her kids a chance to live  and thrive in the only country they have ever known.   I know my entire caucus supports the bill. I know how many of my  friends on the other side of the aisle support it as well. So what are  we waiting for? Let's put the bill on the floor and pass it.  [[Page S7272]]    I yield to my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader.
