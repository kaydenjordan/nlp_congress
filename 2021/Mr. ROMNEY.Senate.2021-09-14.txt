 Madam President, this past weekend, we gathered to  reflect on the anniversary of a national tragedy. The visible and  invisible wounds incurred on that day continue to impact the lives of  all of us.   In the last two decades since 9/11, our Nation has demonstrated  enormous resilience, imponderable sacrifice, and pursued justice in  dangerous lands, often under perilous conditions. We have asked our  servicemembers to do so very much to keep us safe, and they have  responded with uncommon courage. Last month, 13 of our Nation's finest  upheld their sacred oath at the cost of their lives.   They were struck down by the cowardice of terrorists while, at the  same time, they were helping innocent Afghan civilians reach a better  life. Over 100 Afghan civilians were also killed on August 26 in that  terrorist attack at the Kabul airport, and many more were grievously  wounded. We also hold in our hearts the American servicemembers who  suffered those terrible injuries that day.   On September 11, 2001, Taylor Hoover, from Sandy, UT, was just 11  years old. Nine years later, he was a staff sergeant in the Marine  Corps. He would go on to serve three tours of duty in Afghanistan and  earned both the respect of his fellow soldiers abroad and the  admiration of those who knew him well and loved him here at home.   As we recently gathered in Salt Lake City to mourn the life of Staff  Sergeant Hoover, it was clear that this deep admiration was shared by  thousands of the people of Utah. While our hearts were heavy with grief  as his family shared their memories of Staff Sergeant Hoover, they were  embraced by the crowd one by one as the ceremony concluded, and our  communal bonds emerged ever stronger.
