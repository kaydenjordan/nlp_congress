 Madam Speaker, healthcare is a human right. The Affordable  Care Act helped us live up to that value by giving over 20 million  American people healthcare coverage, including millions with  preexisting conditions.   But still, too many Americans don't have access to good, affordable  healthcare, and drug prices are through the roof.   One of those Americans is Suzette from Germantown, Maryland. Suzette  told me that her insulin prices have skyrocketed over the last year,  making it hard to afford a drug that she needs to survive. As Elijah  Cummings said: We are better than that.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act will cut  premiums in half; allow negotiations for drug prices; and expand  Medicaid, a lifeline for many who need support for mental health and  addiction treatment services.   During a global pandemic, we should be acting with compassion for the  most vulnerable in our country. This bill does just that. I urge a  ``yes'' vote.
