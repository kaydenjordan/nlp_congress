 Mr. Speaker, today, we send the CARES Act to the  President to provide the people in my community with needed relief from  the devastation of this pandemic.   I am here for the first responders, the healthcare workers, and all  of those who are risking their lives. They are our heroes.   Mr. Speaker, we need to support this bill now because we must. The  virus has left us with no choice.   But my hope is that after we have starved this virus, we will make a  national commitment to permanently rebuild our public health  infrastructure.
