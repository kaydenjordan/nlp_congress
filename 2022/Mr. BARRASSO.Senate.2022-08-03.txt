 Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of the  leadership and accomplishments of Wyoming Rancher and Public Lands  Council President Niels Hansen.   This is Niels' final year as a member of the Public Lands Council  executive council. He will be honored on Friday, August 26 at their  2022 Annual Meeting Banquet hosted in Cody, WY. Niels has served on the  PLC's executive council since 2016. He also served as Wyoming's  delegate to the PLC's sage grouse task force. Niels is a consistent and  strong voice for ranching and the western way of life. His work has had  a tremendous impact on public land policy, both nationally and in  Wyoming.   Niels is the third generation operator of PH Livestock. Located in  the high desert near Rawlins, WY, the ranch's need for proper  management and resource conservation is paramount. Niels' great uncles,  Peter and Jim Hansen, came to Rawlins from Denmark in the early 1900s  to start their own ranches. His father joined them in 1927 and later  took over for Jim. Niels and his sister Anna, were the first born in  the United States and continue the legacy of their family and their  land.   As Niels describes, ``We do not try to maximize anything, but we try  to optimize everything. We work to operate in balance with nature by  making any adjustments needed to keep the ranch producing a consistent,  predictable manner while protecting the land where we live.''   Niels built a reputation as someone who brings stakeholders together  to find the best possible solutions. PH Livestock operates on the  Bureau of Land Management checkerboard that is spread throughout  southern Wyoming. He brought the agriculture industry, energy industry,  and Federal and State agencies to the same table to address the  challenges of maintaining and improving the land.   Niels has worked with the University of Wyoming and the BLM for over  20 years to monitor and collect data on his land. This data builds the  foundation to develop the best practices for the rangeland. Niels  constantly shares his dedication and knowledge to advocate for sound  policy. He served as chairman of the Wyoming State Grazing Board and  president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. Niels has testified  in front of congressional committees many times. He testified in 2018,  during my time as chairman of the Environment and Public Works  Committee. Niels promotes cooperation between Federal agencies and  landowners. He gives a firsthand perspective of the effects of  regulations on the people it impacts the most.   Niels' ability to build relationships and success in conservation was  recognized in 2011 when he was inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture  Hall of Fame. PH Livestock received the BLM Rangeland Management  Stewardship award in 2000. In 2004, the ranch was a cowinner of the  Wyoming Stock Growers Association Stewardship Award.   Niels understands the importance of family and tradition to a  successful ranch. He has two children with his wife, Barbara. Their  daughter Stephanie is married to Reese Irvine, and they have two sons,  Eli and Caleb. Their son John and his wife Tawsha Lubbers have two  sons, Niels Kai and Jep. Niels' sister, Anna Helms, is his business  partner and helps manage the ranch with her two children, Travis and  Heidi, along with Travis' son Dane. Niels instilled in his family a  love of the land to ensure future generations will enjoy their ranch.   It is a great honor to recognize this exceptional member of our  Wyoming community. As I mentioned upon his induction to the Wyoming  Agriculture Hall of Fame, ``Wyoming lands--both public and private--are  better because of his service.'' My wife Bobbi joins me in extending  our gratitude and well wishes to Niels Hansen on his future endeavors.                            ____________________
