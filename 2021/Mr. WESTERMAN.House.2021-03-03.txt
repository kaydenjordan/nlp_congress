 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of Hot Springs National Park.   Nearly 5,500 acres of forested hills settle just above historic  downtown Hot Springs, Arkansas, protecting 47 thermal water springs.  Hot Springs National Park attracts millions of tourists each year with  its rich multigenerational legacy of preserving history and conserving  natural resources for public health, wellness, and enjoyment.   First named Hot Springs Reservation in 1832, the land was one of the  first federally protected parcels of land in the country. Its official  National Park designation on March 4, 1921, led to the park quickly  becoming a source of national intrigue. Bathhouse Row drew millions of  people seeking health remedies in the thermal spring waters. Many of  these bathhouses still stand today, offering visitors a glimpse into  local history, art, and culture.   I take this time to honor the National Park Service's century of  caretaking of one of Arkansas' most valuable natural treasures. I look  forward to the next 100 years, and I invite the world to come to  experience my home, beautiful Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas.                            ____________________
