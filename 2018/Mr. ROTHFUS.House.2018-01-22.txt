 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I said, at this podium, that the  resolution to the Schumer shutdown is simple: Senate Democrats need to  vote ``yes'' on the short-term funding bill, and the government  reopens, paychecks get processed for our troops, and the Children's  Health Insurance Program is up and running. It is that simple.   Understand this: the Senate Democrats chose to shut down the  government because they have more interest in creating a false deadline  to address the DACA issues. The fact is the legislative process is  already underway to address DACA.   I'm cosponsoring the Securing America's Future Act which not only  addresses DACA but actually takes measures to make sure we actually  solve the problem in the long term, including securing our borders,  which is a big part of addressing the heroin crisis we have in our  country.   Let's end the Schumer shutdown, reopen the government, and continue  our work to address the critical issues facing our country.                            ____________________
