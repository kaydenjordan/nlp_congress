 Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for  the nomination of James O'Brien to be Coordinator of Sanctions Policy  at the U.S. Department of State.   At a time when we must keep the pressure on Putin to end his  unprovoked, brutal, and illegal war against Ukraine, we need  experienced officials at the helm to ensure that we are using every  sanctions tool against Russia. As the power of our sanctions has been  amplified by working closely with our allies and partners around the  world, the long-term success of those efforts will be greatly enhanced  by having a Senate-confirmed official in place to ensure that those  coordination efforts continue and that we maximize the costs on  Russia's economy.   Mr. O'Brien is exactly the type of leader that the Office of  Sanctions Coordination needs. And he brings impressive substantive  expertise and professional background to this role.   Mr. O'Brien is a former career employee of the State Department and  recipient of numerous performance awards. He has served two U.S.  administrations as a special envoy, for Hostage Affairs, and for the  Balkans. Over the course of his career at the State Department, he has  led a large and successful sanctions program and advised on a range of  issues, including peace negotiations in Europe, scientific and  environmental agreements, and initiatives to investigate and prosecute  persons responsible for war crimes.   In addition, Mr. O'Brien has negotiated agreements protecting  intellectual property rights for scientific cooperation with China,  promoted environmentally sound international trade regulations for  hazardous and recyclable materials, and worked to make public-private  partnerships and corporate social responsibility an important element  in American foreign policy. As the first Presidential Envoy for Hostage  Affairs, he helped establish the office and worked for the safe return  of 100 American citizens.   I have no doubt that he will bring the same dedication and rigor to  advancing and coordinating U.S. sanctions policy as he has his prior  roles.   I strongly support confirming Mr. O'Brien. His confirmation will be  critical to enhancing our sanctions efforts at this critical time. I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination, along with  all of the foreign affairs nominations pending before this body, to  advance our national security interests and improve our representation  abroad.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
