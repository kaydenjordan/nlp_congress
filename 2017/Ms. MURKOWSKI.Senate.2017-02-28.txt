 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we have the nomination of  Representative Ryan Zinke to be the Secretary of the Interior as the  business before the body today, and I wish to spend a few moments this  afternoon speaking about him, his qualifications, and why I believe he  will be a strong Secretary of the Interior.   Of all the Cabinet-level nominations that have an impact on my home  State of Alaska, the Secretary of the Interior is almost certainly the  most important and the most consequential. Two-  [[Page S1472]]  thirds of Alaska--nearly 224 million acres--is under Federal  management. To put that into perspective, that is more land than is  occupied by the entire State of Texas, and it is an area about 177  times larger than the State of Delaware. The vast majority of that land  is controlled by agencies within the Department of the Interior, from  the Bureau of Land Management, to the National Park Service, to the  Fish and Wildlife Service. Again, significant parts of Alaska--more  land than is occupied by the State of Texas--are held under Federal  management. It is for this reason we in Alaska call the Interior  Secretary our ``landlord.'' He might not necessarily like that fact,  but that is what he is effectively.   While it might sound strange if you are from an Eastern State such as  Massachusetts or New York, which have hardly any Federal lands within  their borders, the decisions that are made by the Department of the  Interior literally determine the livelihoods of thousands of Alaskans,  as well as the stability and the success of our State. When the  Department of the Interior chooses to work with us, Alaska is able to  grow and prosper, even as our lands and our waters remain protected  under the most stringent environmental standards in the world. When the  Department chooses not to work with us, as was all too often the case  in the last administration, the people of Alaska suffered. Our State's  economy, our budget, and our future are all threatened at the same  time. I start with that context to help the Senate understand why I  take this confirmation process so seriously whenever a new Interior  Secretary is nominated.   I consider whether the nominee is right for the job and whether he or  she will do right by the people of Alaska, as well as other western  states. I talk with the nominee and ask him or her questions about  everything from ANCSA and ANILCA to wilderness and wildlife management.  When I make a decision, I am making it as a Senator for Alaska and as  the chairman of both the authorizing committee and the Appropriations  subcommittee for the Department of Interior.   Today, after a great deal of review and careful consideration, I am  very pleased to be here to speak in strong support of our new  President's nominee for this position, Representative Ryan Zinke. I  believe Representative Zinke is an excellent choice to be our next  Secretary of the Interior. Maybe I am a little bit partial here, but  the fact that he is a fellow westerner, hailing from the Treasure State  of Montana--that helps with my decision. He is a lifelong sportsman. He  loves to hunt and fish. That also resonates with me. I also understand  he is a pretty good downhill skier, and I like that too. He is a  trained geologist. He has worked as an energy consultant. Even more  notably, he has dedicated his life to the service of our Nation,  including more than two decades as a Navy SEAL, a term in the Montana  Senate, and most recently as the sole U.S. Congressman for his home  State.   Representative Zinke's life and career have prepared him well to  serve as Secretary of the Interior. He was born in the West. He lives  in the West. He understands it. He understands its people. He has  substantive knowledge of the challenges facing the Department and truly  a firsthand experience in trying to solve them. He has also shown that  he understands the need for the Department to be a partner for Alaska  and other western states, which contain the vast majority of our  nation's Federal lands.   We had an opportunity in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  to hold a hearing to consider Representative Zinke's nomination on  January 17. It seems like an eternity ago now, but what I remember very  clearly from that morning is the positive and very compelling vision he  shared with us.   Representative Zinke told us he grew up in a ``small timber and  railroad town next to Glacier National Park.'' He explained that he  believes the Secretary is responsible for being ``the steward of  majestic public lands, the champion of our great Indian nations, and  the manager and voice of our diverse wildlife.'' He did show us--and  spoke to it in the committee hearing--that he understands the purpose  and the value of Federal lands, invoking Teddy Roosevelt and pledging  to follow the multiple-use doctrine.   As other colleagues have come to the floor today to speak about  Representative Zinke's nomination, several have spoken to the issue of  the Antiquities Act, speaking more directly than to the issue of  multiple-use as it relates to our public lands. Yet, in outlining the  concept of multiple-use that Representative Zinke believes and follows,  it is probably best to look to his own words that he said when he was  before us in the committee. On multiple-use, Representative Zinke said  the following:         In multiple-use, in the spirit of Roosevelt, it means you       can use it for multiple purposes. I am particularly concerned       about public access. I am a hunter, a fisherman. But multiple       uses are also making sure what you're going to do, you know,       and you go in with both eyes open, that means sustainability.       That means that it doesn't have to be in conflict if you have       recreation over mining.        You just have to make sure that you understand what the       consequences of each of those uses are. It's our public land.       What I have seen most recently is our access is being shut       off, roads are being shut off, and we're all getting older.       And when you don't have access to hunting areas, traditional       fishing areas, it makes it an elite sport.        And I'm particularly concerned about the elitism of our       traditional hunting, fishing, and snowmobiling. Making our       public lands accessible in the spirit of multiple-use. Single       use, if you look at the Muir model of some of our national       parks and some of our areas, I agree. There are some areas       that need to be set aside that are absolutely appropriate for       man to be an observer.        There are special places in our country that deserve that       recognition. But a lot of it is traditional uses of what we       find in North Dakota and Montana where you can hunt and       fish, you can drill an oil well. Make sure there is a       reclamation project. Make sure there is a permit, make       sure there's NEPA. If you are doing something that's more       intrusive, make sure you monitor the water. Everyone       enjoys clean water and we should. I don't think       necessarily they are in conflict. I think you have to do       it right.    I think it is important to put those comments of Representative Zinke  on the record because it is clear that, again, he recognizes the  multiple uses of our public lands--recognizing there are certain places  that are special but ensuring, again, that the doctrine of multiple-use  is respected as initially intended.   Representative Zinke also told us that he would have three main tasks  if he is confirmed as Secretary of the Interior. The first, he said, is  to ``restore trust by working with rather than against local  communities and states.'' The second is to address the multibillion  dollar maintenance backlog at the National Park Service so that we  preserve the crown jewels of our public lands for future generations.  And the third is to ``ensure the professionals on the front line, our  rangers and field managers, have the right tools, right resources, and  flexibility to make the right decisions that give a voice to the people  they serve.''   So those were the three priorities as outlined by Representative  Zinke, and I believe all three of those missions are necessary. I am  hardly alone in supporting Representative Zinke as the right choice to  fulfill them. Within the committee, he drew bipartisan support when we  reported his nomination to the full Senate on January 31. He has drawn  widespread support from dozens and dozens of stakeholder groups all  across the country: from the Alaska Federation of Natives, the  Blackfeet Tribe, the Choctaw Nation, the National Congress of American  Indians, Safari Club International, Ducks Unlimited, the Congressional  Sportsmen's Foundation, the National Rifle Association, the Public  Lands Council, and the American Exploration & Mining Association. These  are just a few of the many stakeholders that have praised or endorsed  Representative Zinke to be our next Secretary of the Interior.   I am glad we are finally here today on the verge of confirming  Representative Zinke to this position. I would remind the Senate that  despite many substantive differences, we confirmed President Obama's  first nominee for Interior Secretary on inauguration day back in 2009-- not so with Representative Zinke. It has now been 6 weeks since we held  his nomination hearing and almost a full month since we reported his  nomination from our committee--again on a strong bipartisan basis. I am  disappointed, of course, that it has taken this long to get to this  point, particularly with regard to a nominee who I think, by all  accounts, is not controversial or unqualified.   Now we need to confirm Representative Zinke without any further  delay,  [[Page S1473]]  so that he can select his team and get to work addressing the range of  issues that he will inherit. From the maintenance backlog of the Nation  Park Service, to the need for greater balance in Federal land  management, to life-and-death issues in remote Alaska communities, and  from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to U.S.-affiliated islands,  Representative Zinke really has his work cut out for him, and he needs  to be allowed to get started as soon as he can.   Again, I will repeat that I believe Representative Zinke is a solid  choice for this demanding and critical position. While we may not agree  on every issue, I believe he will work with us in a thoughtful manner  that is reflective of a true partnership. I believe he understands what  the job requires, he has the experience necessary to succeed in it, and  he will show that the Department of the Interior can still work with  local stakeholders to achieve positive results.   I thank Representative Zinke for his willingness to continue his  service to our Nation and for his patience during this process. On  behalf of Alaskans, I look forward to working with him after he is  confirmed with bipartisan support, and I urge every Member of the  Senate to support his nomination.   With that, I see the other Senator from the great State of Alaska is  here with us today.   I yield the floor.
