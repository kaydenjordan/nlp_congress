 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1164, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 1153) condemning unwanted, unnecessary  medical procedures on individuals without their full, informed consent,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H. Res. 1154.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, imagine this: You are an immigrant woman detained in a  detention center. Perhaps you have been  [[Page H5646]]  asking for help for months about a painful medical condition or perhaps  you have had no medical complaints at all.   You are suddenly woken up early in the morning. You are put in  shackles and taken not to a general practitioner, but to a  gynecologist.   That gynecologist performs ultrasounds, inserts tools, even his own  hands into your body without any consent or any lubrication. You are in  pain. You do not know what is being done to you. You feel violently  sexually assaulted.   The doctor tells you that you have a major problem, cysts that must  be operated on, from that simple examination he did. You don't want  surgery and you even say so. He says: Okay, I will give you a shot  instead.   And because you are scared, you take the shot, but you don't know  what it is. You haven't been told what it is. You certainly have no  idea that, in fact, this is a shot that is an injectable contraceptive  that temporarily prevents you from having children and can have other  serious side effects, including bleeding.   Now you are bleeding. You are scared, and you don't know what is  happening. You go back to see the gynecologist, and he tells you this  is why he said you must have surgery.   You have doubts. You want a second opinion. But you are told you  cannot have a second opinion, and it is either this or you will never  get any care again--after all, you are in detention.   You finally, perhaps in some cases, agree to the surgery thinking  that you are just having cysts removed, but you wake up and you find  out that you have had a full or partial hysterectomy, one of your  fallopian tubes has been removed or perhaps some other surgery that you  weren't expecting.   Imagine that someone has just taken away or severely compromised your  ability to have children without ever telling you or asking your  consent for what they are doing.   Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here today, to vote on House  Resolution 1153, to condemn unwanted, unnecessary medical procedures  conducted on women without their full, informed consent, to ensure the  safety, health, and presence of the women at the Irwin County Detention  Center, and to mandate full compliance of ICE with the requirements of  the ongoing investigation.   The story I just described is just one of the many stories we have  now heard from women who are either currently or were formerly detained  at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia.   Please understand that 90 percent of the people detained at this  facility are completely unrepresented by any attorney. Moreover, like  all detention facilities, Irwin has been plagued with COVID. People  detained here report not receiving adequate PPE, and there have been  multiple cases of COVID.   Since this horrific story emerged through a whistleblower report 2  weeks ago, a few attorneys who are representing some of the women have  brought forward more stories.   Independent gynecologists have reviewed the available medical  records.   The New York Times launched an independent investigation, asking  independent gynecologists to review the records of seven women who were  able to obtain their medical files. What they found is deeply  disturbing.   The doctors noted that the gynecologist ``seemed to consistently  recommended surgical intervention, even when it did not seem medically  necessary at the time and nonsurgical treatment options were  available.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a September 29 New York Times  article, titled: ``Immigrants Say They Were Pressured Into Unneeded  Surgeries.''                 [From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 2020]         Immigrants Say They Were Pressured Into Unneeded Surgeries    Immigrants detained at an ICE-contracted center in Georgia said they   had invasive gynecology procedures that they later learned might have                              been unnecessary        (By Caitlin Dickerson, Seth Freed Wessler and Miriam Jordan)         Wendy Dowe was startled awake early one morning in January       2019, when guards called her out of her cellblock in the       Irwin County immigration detention center in rural Georgia,       where she had been held for four months. She would be having       surgery that day, they said.        Still groggy, the 48-year-old immigrant from Jamaica, who       had been living without legal status in the United States for       two decades before she was picked up by immigration       authorities, felt a swell of dread come over her. An outside       gynecologist who saw patients in immigration custody told her       that the menstrual cramping she had was caused by large cysts       and masses that needed to be removed, but she was skeptical.       The doctor insisted, she said, and as a detainee--brought to       the hospital in handcuffs and shackles--she felt pressured to       consent.        It was only after she was deported to Jamaica and had her       medical files reviewed by several other doctors that she knew       she had been right to raise questions.        A radiologist's report, based on images of her internal       organs from her time at Irwin, described her uterus as being       a healthy size, not swollen with enlarged masses and cysts,       as the doctor had written in his notes. The cysts she had       were small, and the kind that occur naturally and do not       usually require surgical intervention.        ``I didn't have to do any of it,'' Ms. Dowe said.        The Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Ga., drew       national attention this month after a nurse, Dawn Wooten,       filed a whistle-blower complaint claiming that detainees had       told her they had had their uteruses removed without their       full understanding or consent.        Since then, both ICE and the hospital in Irwin County have       released data that show that two full hysterectomies have       been performed on women detained at Irwin in the past three       years. But firsthand accounts are now emerging from       detainees, including Ms. Dowe, who underwent other invasive       gynecological procedures that they did not fully understand       and, in some cases, may not have been medically necessary.        At least one lawyer brought the complaints about       gynecological care to the attention of the center's top       officials in 2018, according to emails obtained by The New       York Times, but the outside referrals continued.        The Times interviewed 16 women who were concerned about the       gynecological care they received while at the center, and       conducted a detailed review of the medical files of seven       women who were able to obtain their records. All 16 were       treated by Dr. Mahendra Amin, who practices gynecology in the       nearby town of Douglas and has been described by ICE       officials as the detention center's ``primary gynecologist.''        The cases were reviewed by five gynecologists--four of them       board-certified and all with medical school affiliations--who       found that Dr. Amin consistently overstated the size or risks       associated with cysts or masses attached to his patients'       reproductive organs. Small or benign cysts do not typically       call for surgical intervention, where large or otherwise       troubling ones sometimes do, the experts said.        The doctors stressed that in some cases the medical files       might not have been complete and that additional information       could potentially shift their analyses. But they noted that       Dr. Amin seemed to consistently recommend surgical       intervention, even when it did not seem medically necessary       at the time and nonsurgical treatment options were available.        In almost every woman's chart, Dr. Amin listed symptoms       such as heavy bleeding with clots and chronic pelvic pain,       which could justify surgery. But some of the women said they       never experienced or reported those symptoms to him.        Both the reviewing doctors and all of the women interviewed       by The Times raised concerns about whether Dr. Amin had       adequately explained the procedures he performed or provided       his patients with less invasive alternatives. Spanish-      speaking women said a nurse who spoke Spanish was only       sporadically present during their exams.        The diagnoses and procedures are ``poorly supported'' and       ``not well documented,'' said Dr. Sara Imershein, a clinical       professor at George Washington University and the Washington,       DC, chair of the American College of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists.        Even if the patients had reported the symptoms recorded by       Dr. Amin, ``there would have been many avenues to pursue       before rushing to surgery,'' she said. ``Advil for one.''        ``He is overly aggressive in his treatment and does not       explore appropriate medical management before turning to       procedures or surgical intervention,'' said Dr. Deborah       Ottenheimer, a forensic evaluator and instructor at the Weill       Cornell Medical School Human Rights Clinic.        But the doctors who reviewed the cases noted that       aggressive overtreatment is all too common among doctors--      especially with patients who do not have the resources to       seek a second opinion.        Dr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service       Corps, said in a statement that the whistle-blower's       allegations ``raise some very serious concerns that deserve       to be investigated quickly and thoroughly.'' She added, ``If       there is any truth to these allegations, it is my commitment       to make the corrections necessary to ensure we continue to       prioritize the health, welfare and safety of ICE detainees.''        Dr. Amin's lawyer, Scott Grubman, said in a statement that       the physician ``strongly disputes any allegations that he       treated any patient with anything other than the utmost care       and respect.''  [[Page H5647]]         ``Dr. Amin also strongly disputes that any patient was       treated without full informed consent,'' the statement       continued. Mr. Grubman said that patient privacy laws       prevented him from discussing any specific patient's       treatment, but in each case it ``was medically necessary,       performed within the standard of care, and done only after       obtaining full informed consent.''        The statement added that Dr. Amin always uses an       interpreter when treating patients who do not speak English       and ``always attempts to treat his patients with more       conservative treatment, including medicine and less invasive       procedures, before even recommending surgery,'' which he       views as a last resort.        Independent doctors that provide treatment for ICE       detainees are paid for the procedures they perform with       Department of Homeland Security funds. Procedures like the       ones that Dr. Amin performed are normally billed at thousands       of dollars each.        Dr. Amin's billings had previously come to the attention of       federal authorities. In 2013, the Justice Department named       him in a civil case alleging that he and several other       doctors had overbilled Medicare and Medicaid by, among other       things, performing unnecessary procedures on terminal       patients and leaving the emergency room staffed by nurses       while billing for diagnoses and treatments as if they had       been performed by doctors. The case was settled for $520,000       with no admission of fault on the part of the defendants.                       `I could not ask any questions'         In many cases, Dr. Amin's patients said they were confused       about why they ended up being sent to his office in the first       place--some after raising medical issues that had nothing to       do with gynecology.        Yuridia, a 36-year-old immigrant from Mexico, sought out a       nurse at the center soon after she arrived because she was       having pain in her rib after a fight with her abusive ex-      partner just before she was picked up by ICE. She asked to be       identified by her first name because she feared for her       safety.        She was sent for a medical exam at Dr. Amin's office, where       she said he began to prepare an ultrasound machine. ``I was       assuming they were going to check my rib,'' she said. ``The       next thing I know, he's doing a vaginal exam.''        Dr. Amin recorded in his notes that Yuridia had cysts in       her ovaries and scheduled a surgery to remove them. He also       wrote that she had complained of heavy menstruation and       pelvic pain. She said that she never experienced or reported       those conditions and that she had not asked to see a       gynecologist.        Weeks later, she underwent surgery. Pathology reports show       that she did not have dangerous cysts, but small ones of the       kind that occur naturally in most women and do not call for       surgical intervention.        Yuridia said she had expected only a minor procedure that       would be performed vaginally, but she was surprised when she       woke up to find three incisions on her abdomen and a piece of       skin missing from her genital area.        ``I woke up and I was alone, and I was in pain and everyone       spoke English so I could not ask any questions,'' Yuridia       said. Three days later, still sore and recovering, she was       deported.        Yuridia's case bears striking similarities to others that       the panel of doctors reviewed. Many of them led to two       surgical procedures performed simultaneously: ``dilation and       curettage,'' often referred to as a ``D & C,'' which involves       inserting tools into a woman's vagina and scraping tissue       from the uterus, and laparoscopy, in which three incisions       are made to insert a camera into the abdominal cavity to       examine or perform procedures on the reproductive organs.        The cases suggest a pattern of ``excessively aggressive       surgical intervention without adequate trial of medical       remedies,'' Dr. Ottenheimer said.                   A report reveals longstanding complaints         It was the Irwin County center's handling of the       coronavirus pandemic that inspired Ms. Wooten, the nurse       whose whistle-blower complaint was first reported by The       Intercept, to come forward about another issue that troubled       her: Dr. Amin's surgeries. She said in an interview that she       had for years noticed that an inordinate number of women were       being referred to Dr. Amin. She said she would hear reports       that they had undergone surgeries but that they had no idea       why the surgeries were performed.        ``After they get up from general anesthesia,'' Ms. Wooten       said, the women would ask, ``Why'd I have this surgery?''        ``And I don't have an answer for why,'' she said. ``I am       just as shocked as they are. Nobody explained it to them.''        Data from ICE inspection reports show that the center,       which is operated by a private prison company, Lasalle       Corrections, refers more than 1,000 detainees a year for       outside medical care, far more than most other immigration       detention centers of the same size. It is not clear how many       of these referrals are for gynecological care. Lasalle       Corrections did not respond to requests for comment.        Concerns from women detained at Irwin emerged long before       Ms. Wooten came forward.        Ms. Dowe, after being told by Dr. Amin that she had a mass       the size of a ``cantaloupe'' on her uterus, had reached out       in early 2019 to Donald Anthonyson, an immigrant advocate she       had met through a fellow detainee. She was asking for help,       Mr. Anthonyson said.        ``She expressed real concerns about going to that doctor,''       he said. ``She was concerned about what was happening to her       and what she was hearing from other women.''        Unlike some of the women who had no gynecological       complaints, Ms. Dowe was experiencing intense menstrual       cramping, which the doctors who reviewed her case said could       sometimes justify the procedure she underwent--but only if       the patient understands the options and elects to move       forward. Even then, the doctors raised questions about       several seemingly healthy and naturally occurring cysts that       Dr. Amin might have removed unnecessarily while he was       operating on her.        After the procedure, Dr. Amin wrote in his notes that Ms.       Dowe requested a second surgery--a full abdominal       hysterectomy and removal of her ovaries.        But Ms. Dowe insists she never made any such request. A       note in her medical records from the detention center appears       to corroborate her denial. ``Detainee is requesting a second       opinion to have a hysterectomy,'' it reads, ``OB/GYN       scheduled hysterectomy and patient refused.''        Complaints about Dr. Amin had also been raised with senior       officials long before Ms. Dowe's case.        In November 2018, a woman named Nancy Gonzalez Hidalgo was       left shaken after several visits with the physician, during       which she said he performed rough vaginal ultrasounds and       ignored her when she cried out in pain. Ms. Gonzalez       Hidalgo's lawyers sent an email to the warden of the center,       David Paulk.        In the email, Erin Argueta, a lawyer at the Southern       Poverty Law Center, explained that Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo's       health was worsening because of complications she was       experiencing from an earlier miscarriage.        ``Nancy hesitated to seek medical attention because her       last experience with Dr. Amin was so painful and traumatic       that she did not want to be sent back to him,'' Ms. Argueta       wrote.        She referred in her email to several previous verbal       complaints about Dr. Amin that lawyers had taken to the       center's inmates services director, Marteka George. ``Ms.       George stated that this was not the first time someone       complained about Dr. Amin, and she said that she would look       into whether Nancy could see a different provider,'' the       lawyer wrote.        The warden responded twice, stating on Nov. 30 that Ms.       Gonzalez Hidalgo had been scheduled for an appointment with       an outside provider ``that is unassociated with Dr. Amin.''       The other doctor, Warden Paulk said, was ``reportedly well       thought of by his patients.''        Warden Paulk did not respond to requests for comment.        Other women who questioned Dr. Amin's care in the past said       they had also faced challenges when they tried to seek       answers.        On the morning of Aug. 14, Mileidy Cardentey Fernandez       said, there was no interpreter present at the Irwin County       Hospital when she was presented with consent forms in English       to sign for a procedure she was undergoing that day.        She asked the technician, ``Spanish, please? Little       English.'' The woman urged her to sign the forms--and so she       did.        Afterward, she said, she filled out a form on numerous       occasions at the detention center requesting her medical       records but got no response.        ``I wanted to know everything they had done,'' she said.       ``I made requests for the biopsy, analyses, and they don't       want to give them to me. They said they don't have the       results. How can they not have the results?''        When she was released from detention on Sept. 21, she       called her daughter in Virginia and then headed straight to       Dr. Amin's clinic with her lawyer to demand her records,       which she received.        Some women said they had managed to avoid surgeries by Dr.       Amin but not without facing resistance.    Mr. Speaker, this is about full or partial sterilization  and a total lack of consent from the patient. And let's be very clear:  Even if a procedure or test is medically necessary, a doctor must have  informed consent from their patient. This is the most basic tenet of  medical ethics.   Last weekend, 10 Members of Congress visited the detention center and  we spoke directly to the women. We saw their pain and shock and horror  about the irreparable damage that has been done to them and their  futures.   I have here letters from dozens of women at the center detailing some  of these things that they have seen and experienced, including these  unnecessary medical procedures. To bring their voices directly into  this Chamber, let me read from one of them.   A woman married to a U.S. citizen and with children of her own:   My experience here has been full of fear and terror. It began when I  asked for medication for my abdomen. My surprise when I was taken to  the gynecologist, he didn't explain nothing and just told me to lay  down and inserted something and said I had a cyst the  [[Page H5648]]  size of a nail. I was injected and didn't say for what, and said the  results would be here in 3 weeks; if not, I would come back. When  everything that's been happening has come to light, I was never taken  back thanks to God because, if not, I would have had surgery.   This resolution is simple. It mandates that a real investigation must  happen. Even just this morning we had to once again ensure that a woman  who had this surgery done to her was not once again arrested. We need  to allow these women to heal as we get this investigation done in the  speediest of manners.   Passing this resolution also sends a clear message to doctors  contracted by the private for-profit incarceration facilities  everywhere: We will not stand by and allow you to treat people this  way. We will not stand by and allow history to repeat itself, a  shameful history of medical abuse targeting Black people, indigenous  people, people of color, immigrants, poor people, and people with  disabilities for medical procedures without consent.   To the women at Irwin, those lucky enough to have been released and  those who have already been deported: You are brave and resilient. You  should know that the United States Congress, with the passage of this  resolution, is saying to you: We see you; we hear you; and we will not  stop fighting for you.   I thank my colleagues and coleads of this resolution, Representatives  Annie Kuster, Sheila Jackson Lee, Sylvia Garcia, and Lois Frankel, for  introducing this resolution with me that now has the support of 225  Members of Congress and, also, the Women's Caucus for their tremendous  attention to this resolution, as well as the Congressional Hispanic  Caucus that helped lead the codel with the Judiciary Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my good colleague on the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson), my good colleague, who was on the delegation  with us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia), my distinguished co-lead on this resolution, a  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Espaillat), my good colleague, who was also on the codel with  us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), who is a doctor himself and  provided very, very important feedback on the codel as he came with us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my distinguished and wonderful colleague who  has been on the front lines of this issue since it started and has  already provided so much to the women who have been detained at Irwin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying to my good colleague across the  aisle that, when he says that first reports are always wrong, let me  ask, is that like the first reports of family separation or kids in  cages?   When my colleague says to let the investigation continue, that is  exactly what this resolution does. It specifically defines the ability  to keep these women who will be witnesses in this investigation in the  United States. In fact, just last week we had to, once again, make sure  that a woman was not deported who had her left fallopian tube removed,  and it was confirmed by independent gynecologists.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I really believe that we crafted this resolution in  a way that it could truly be a bipartisan resolution and that protects  the ability for this investigation to continue with all the facts on  the table, and we are grateful that there is an investigation going.   But in order to have a proper investigation, we need to have these  witnesses here. We need to make sure that the women who have had these  procedures are actually able to get care. And we need to make sure that  this House says very clearly, in any situation, that these unnecessary,  unwanted medical procedures, if true, done without consent and  knowledge, are wrong.   That is all this resolution does.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on the other side will vote ``yes''  with us on this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1164, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 1154) condemning QAnon and rejecting the  conspiracy theories it promotes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H. Res. 1154.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, QAnon is a movement promoting a collection of unfounded  conspiracy theories that have spread on the internet over the last  several years. These conspiracy theories undermine public trust in our  democratic institutions and our election process, and that is why I am  pleased to support this important, bipartisan resolution by  Representatives Malinowski and Riggleman.   QAnon initially alleged that prominent Americans are engaged in a  secret plot to control the world while using their power to exploit  children. It now extends to a range of dangerous conspiracy theories.  The FBI has assessed with high confidence that ``fringe political  conspiracy theories,'' including QAnon, ``very likely to motivate some  domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to engage in criminal or  violent activity and that these conspiracy theories very likely  encourage the targeting of specific people, places, and organizations,  thereby increasing the likelihood of violence against these targets.''   Mr. Speaker, as the Members may know, the resolution's lead sponsor,  Representative Malinowski, has himself faced threats from QAnon  supporters after he was falsely accused of lobbying to protect sexual  predators.   According to the Combating Terrorism Center at the West Point  Military Academy: ``QAnon is arguably no longer simply a fringe  conspiracy theory but an ideology that has demonstrated its capacity to  radicalize to violence individuals at an alarming speed.''   Fortunately, a growing number of political leaders recognize the  threat that QAnon poses, and that includes Republican House Minority  Leader Kevin McCarthy, who recently said that ``there is no place for  QAnon in the Republican Party.''   The Malinowski-Riggleman resolution does several things:   It condemns QAnon and rejects the conspiracy theories that it  promotes;   It encourages the FBI and all Federal law enforcement agencies to  continue to strengthen their focus on preventing violence, threats,  harassment, and other criminal activity by extremists motivated by  fringe political conspiracy theories;   And, finally, it urges all Americans, regardless of our beliefs or  partisan affiliation, to seek information from authoritative sources  and to engage in political debate from a common, factual foundation.   I would hope that these are principles we could all agree with on a  bipartisan basis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski), the sponsor of this legislation and a leader  in our caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), my good friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Let  me start by thanking Mr. Malinowski and Mr. Riggleman for this  bipartisan resolution, such an important statement. And I do hope all  of my colleagues in this Chamber vote for the resolution. I am troubled  that some might try to take this bipartisan resolution and introduce  other aspects that include calling out cities like mine, the city of  Seattle, and other baseless comments.   But the most important thing is to return to the context of this  resolution. The context is that it is sad that, in the year 2020, a  baseless, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory has infected  [[Page H5657]]  the political discourse of our great democracy.   This body should not be giving such an unhinged internet hoax the  time of day. Frankly, it is sad that in the past few weeks, the House  has had to pass several resolutions, including a resolution calling for  a peaceful transfer of power after this year's Presidential election,  to publicly reinforce democratic customs and norms that until recently  were beyond question. But circumstances, yet again, require this body  to make a statement.   Through social media, this internet hoax has become so widespread  that it has inspired threats and even acts of violence across the  country, including against our Members on both sides of the aisle.  Unfortunately, rather than condemn this hoax, rhetoric that comes from  the White House has instead given comfort to QAnon followers and  credence to their belief in fabricated and fantastical theories.   Under these circumstances, it is so good to be doing a bipartisan  resolution in this House. It is imperative that the House of  Representatives make it clear to the American people that QAnon is a  hoax and that we absolutely and completely condemn the violence  perpetrated by its adherence.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
