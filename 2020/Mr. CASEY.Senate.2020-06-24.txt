 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the  bill that we voted on earlier today and the debate that has ensued  prior to that vote and I am sure afterwards.   This is a moral moment for the country. I believe most would agree  with that. The question is, How will our Nation respond at this moral  moment?   The brutal murder of George Floyd by a police officer ``shames us  before the world.'' I am quoting an NAACP official who said it for all  of us. His murder did shame us before the world, so did the murder of  Rayshard Brooks and Breonna Taylor, and we can go on from there, with  so many names that we haven't heard before, and many that we will hear  over and over.   A lot of us feel that shame. Countless millions of Americans feel  that shame. They feel that sadness and they feel that anger all these  weeks since that terrible moment that we all witnessed, and so many  other moments before and after that. As they feel that shame and  express anger and frustration, and as they protest and proclaim, as  they march and mobilize, as they use their voice and cast their votes,  they demand change, but not simply change in and of itself, a certain  kind of change--the kind of change we see rarely in Washington these  days and, frankly, rarely over the course of American history, but I  think we might be in one of those moments now.   They demand transformative change. They demand, and appropriately so,  systemic change to a criminal justice system that is infused with  racism. Their righteous demand for change is, in fact, a petition for  justice.   In the 1950s and 1960s, Martin Luther King said it well, among many  things he said well, about where we were then and, unfortunately, where  we are now. His words still ring true. He said: ``Injustice anywhere is  a threat to justice everywhere.'' It is still true today in the context  of this debate.   But you can go back even further than what Dr. King said. You can go  back hundreds of years. St. Augustine said it well, about justice. He  said: ``Without justice, what are kingdoms but great bands of  robbers?''   Kingdoms as bands of robbers. There has been a lot of robbery over  many, many years--even generations--when it comes to Black Americans.  For hundreds of years, Black Americans have been robbed of the equal  protection of the law.   The U.S. Supreme Court has emblazoned on the front portico of that  building, just yards from here, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' So many  Black Americans have been robbed of equal justice under law. They have  been robbed of opportunity--the opportunity to advance in a country  that would not hold the color of their skin against them. They have  been robbed of that. They have been robbed of their dignity over and  over, in grave ways and in other ways that people never saw--all the  indignities, all the insults, and all the mistreatment. Not to mention,  worse than that, Black Americans have been robbed of the chance to  truly pursue the American dream.   They have been robbed of peace of mind, something that those of us  who are White should think about a lot more. I should think about more,  as a White male, of the peace of mind that a parent has. A father or a  mother should have the peace of mind in America when their son or  daughter--but often it is their son--leaves the house in the morning:  Will he be mistreated walking through a neighborhood by an official of  our government law enforcement or otherwise? Will he be pulled over and  have his rights violated because of the color of his skin? Black  Americans have been robbed of that peace of mind, in addition to so  many other kinds of robbery that have impacted their lives.    So what do we do? Do we simply march and protest and express outrage?  All of that is important. All of that is vital. In fact, all of that is  one of the reasons we are even here talking about it on the Senate  floor--people in both parties talking about it. In my home State of  Pennsylvania, there are very few counties--just a handful of counties-- that have not had one or two or many more protests in a State with 67  counties.   Part of what we have to do as legislators, as Members of this  legislative body called the U.S. Senate, is to, in fact, legislate. Let  me start with the bill that was introduced about 2 weeks ago, the  Justice in Policing Act, S. 3912.   If I had to describe the bill in one word, it would be  accountability. I think there is a big difference between that bill,  the Justice in Policing Act, and the bill offered by the majority.  Accountability is vital. It is essential. We cannot move forward and  say that we have done something substantial to bring about justice and  to advance the  [[Page S3187]]  cause of justice unless there is accountability. The bill also has very  strong transparency provisions, as well as a long menu of actions we  can take to improve police practices in a meaningful way. Let me start  with accountability.   When we talk about accountability, we are talking about  constitutional violations--preventing those violations and holding  those accountable that engage in constitutional violations. We could,  for example, revise 18 U.S. Code, section 242. It is, right now, as a  matter of law, a violation of law for any law enforcement officer to  willfully deprive a person of any right protected by the Constitution.  But it is almost impossible for prosecutors to prove willfulness, and  the Department of Justice doesn't prosecute very many cases in a Nation  of 18,000 law enforcement agencies.   This bill would revise the intent standard, known by the Latin ``mens  rea''--the intent standard--to knowingly or with reckless disregard. So  the change of that standard under law would make it more likely that  successful prosecutions can be brought when constitutional rights are  violated in a criminal manner.   The second constitutional violation provision speaks to civil  liability. Reforming our civil liability laws are often referred to by  a particular doctrine, qualified immunity. In cases where a citizen is  a victim of police misconduct, this is a constitutional violation when  it happens. Currently, a police officer who violates an American's  constitutional rights is often protected by a liability shield we know  as qualified immunity. This doctrine has been questioned by many. There  are at least two Supreme Court Justices, who don't usually agree on  much, that questioned it. Members of the U.S. Senate in both parties  here have questioned this doctrine. Basically, the doctrine holds that  police cannot be liable unless the conduct violates ``clearly  established'' standards or a standard set forth in prior cases, and  most courts dismiss such cases. The bill would reform that doctrine of  qualified immunity to ensure that Americans can recover damages in a  case where their constitutional rights are violated by the actions of  law enforcement.   There are two provisions that speak to accountability. There is a  third, as well, and I will not go through all of them. Accountability  also means strengthening pattern-or-practice investigations by granting  subpoena power to the Civil Rights Division at the Department of  Justice, and also providing grants and funding to State attorneys  general to conduct these pattern-or-practice investigations at the  State level. The focus here, again, is on constitutional violations  that are systemic in a local jurisdiction or systemic in a State  agency.   What results from these kinds of investigations often are consent  decrees. These consent decrees by courts are, of course, supposed to be  judicially enforced. These decrees can often ensure that a police  department implements reforms. Here is one of the problems. The Trump  administration has virtually abandoned this practice of bringing these  pattern-or-practice investigations. The Obama administration opened 25  such cases. But even under the Obama administration, there was a  constraint because of the lack of subpoena power. That should be  changed.   I will just mention two more provisions. It is a long list, but I  will just mention two more. The Justice in Policing Act bans choke  holds and bans carotid holds. And No. 5, it bans no-knock warrants in  Federal drug cases.   Now, what about the bill offered by the Republicans, the majority  here in the Senate? The Republican bill does not, in my judgment,  respond to this moral moment. It does not substantially advance the  cause of justice because it is devoid of provisions that would impose  accountability--real accountability--on law enforcement, and especially  on a particular law enforcement officer who is sworn to protect  Americans. He is not sworn to violate their constitutional rights. So  when a law enforcement officer engages in that conduct, there must be  accountability. The bill does not speak to that in a fashion that I  think would bring about change.   The bill also doesn't even explicitly ban choke holds and carotid  holds, meaning a choke hold that cuts off your air flow, which we know  can kill someone, and also the carotid hold, which cuts off your blood  flow. We know that both can be dangerous. Both can be, in fact, lethal.  The bill doesn't ban them. That is the only reason, potentially, we are  even here debating this, because the American people--God only knows,  tens of millions--watched a police officer choke the life out of a  human being, George Floyd. Without that video, I am not sure we would  be here debating this bill or any bill. But the idea that this practice  is not banned under this bill makes the bill woefully deficient, and I  think that is an understatement.    The bill fails to ban no-knock warrants, even in the context-- frankly, a limited context--of Federal drug cases. It doesn't do that.  That kind of a ban might have saved the life of Breonna Taylor, for  example. The Republican bill doesn't prohibit racial profiling, and it  provides no change--no substantial change--in the militarization of  police forces.   In the end, we are here not just to debate and to focus on bills and  policy in language, but we are here to talk about justice. There is a  great hymn I heard in church over many years. It is rooted in the  Scriptures. One of the refrains or one of the parts of the refrain of  that hymn is this: ``We are called to act with justice.'' Those are the  exact words of that hymn. The first couple of lines of the hymn are:  ``Come! Live in the light!'' And then it goes on to say: ``We are  called to act with justice.''   If we are going to act with justice here by way of legislation, we  should listen not just to the Scriptures or to Dr. King or to St.  Augustine. We should also listen to a more recent Dr. King. He just  happens to be the former Education Secretary, Dr. John B. King. He just  testified a couple of weeks ago in our Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, the committee that Senator Alexander was talking  about.   Former Secretary of Education King said the following regarding  students returning to school this year, and I think it bears directly  not just on these justice issues but also on the broader agenda that we  should push forward to advance the interests of Black Americans and  communities of color.   Dr. King, in this testimony just recently, said the following.         When our students return to school buildings, they will       need additional supports as they grapple with the continued       reality of racism in America and the legacy of over 400 years       of anti-Blackness. The murders of George Floyd--    And then he lists some others--         [Those murders] have once again sent the message to Black       students that their lives are devalued.    He goes on in his testimony to talk about the moment we are in--the  moment I have called the moral moment, as have others.   Dr. John King said:         [We face a moment where] our nation's students of color and       their families also find themselves enduring a pandemic that       disproportionately impacts their health and safety, mired in       an economic crisis that disproportionately affects their       financial well-being, and living in a country that too often       still struggles to recognize their humanity.    As Dr. Martin Luther King and Dr. John King, the former Secretary of  Education, and others have told us, we have to make sure this is a  moment we can act with justice, as the hymn tells us.   All of us, no matter where we are from and no matter what party we  are in--all of us--are called to act with justice. So let us not fail  to act with justice in this moral moment. Let us embrace this moment.  Pass the Justice in Policing Act or something very close to that, and  bring the warm light of justice to millions of Americans, especially  Black Americans.   I yield the floor.
