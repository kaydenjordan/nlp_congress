 Mr. Speaker, I am disgusted and appalled with the latest  news about President Trump's behavior. He has repeatedly threatened the  sanctity of our elections with his behavior. His latest call to the  President of Ukraine is just par for the course with this  administration.   This is not the country I grew up in where the rules and law have to  apply to everyone. No one man is above the law.   This is not the way our elected officials should behave. The  institutions of our country are meant for the people of this country,  not for personal gain.
