 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the  unimaginable amount of dangerous fentanyl and related substances that  are crossing our southern border, enough to kill every American seven  times over.   Criminal drug cartels are capitalizing on the lack of security due to  Biden's open-border policies. Since these large amounts of fentanyl are  flooding in, the DEA issued its first public safety alert in 6 years,  warning the public about fake pills laced with lethal doses of  fentanyl, and we are seeing the devastating effects.   Synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, account for nearly two-thirds  of the overdose deaths, including American teenagers. Many parents  across our country, and including my home State of Oklahoma, have  tragically lost their children to accidental fentanyl overdoses. No one  should ever have to experience that sort of pain.   In February, we have the chance to respond. The emergency class-wide  scheduling order for fentanyl-related substances is set to expire.  Democrats want to enact only temporary extensions, while Republicans  are fighting to make it permanent.   Madam Speaker, there are deadly consequences to the lack of security  at the border. We must ensure law enforcement has the resources to  protect our country and keep those drugs out of American hands.                            ____________________
