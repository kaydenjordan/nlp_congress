 Madam President, I would like to speak in support  of confirming Denis McDonough to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Mr.  McDonough has demonstrated his dedication to public service over the  last 25 years and has assured me that he will bring that same  dedication to the Department of Veterans Affairs in its mission to  serve our veterans.   He has experience leading and implementing policy across the Federal  Government and has earned a reputation for being able to make  government work better. Although he is not a veteran, he has made his  case that he is personally devoted to serving veterans and seeing them  achieve success, and it is my belief that he is sincere in that  assertion.   Mr. McDonough testified that he appreciates the clear roles of  Congress in passing law and of the executive branch in executing them.  He has committed to me and to our committee that he will faithfully  implement critical VA reforms in line with congressional intent, and I  intend to hold him accountable for the decisions and actions he makes  as Secretary.   We have made significant progress with the VA to provide permanent  veterans' choice in access to care, mental health and suicide  prevention, employee accountability, and improved benefits for  veterans, their dependents, and survivors. We cannot backtrack on this  progress, and the next VA Secretary must be ready on day one to  continue building on this success.   I will support Mr. McDonough's confirmation and hold him to his  commitment to work with our committee and with our veteran stakeholders  to deliver the improved benefits and services Congress has  legislated.                            ____________________
