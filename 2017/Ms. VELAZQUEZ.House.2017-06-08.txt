 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member,  Maxine Waters.   Here they come again, Mr. Chairman. My colleagues seem to suffer from  a case of policymaking amnesia. I was here in 2008 as our Nation stood  on the edge of financial ruin. I will never forget those dark days.   Thanks to Wall Street making reckless bets and inadequate government  oversight, millions of Americans lost their homes and jobs. Tell them  about market discipline back in 2008. Main Street small businesses shed  employees, and many shut their doors for good. Our economy nearly slid  into another Depression.   Now, my Republican colleagues may have forgotten that sequence of  events, but let me tell you something: The American people have not  forgotten.   Dodd-Frank has improved accountability in the financial system. It  has protected consumers and investors from predatory practices. It  stabilizes our markets. And yet here we are talking about gutting this  landmark law.   The American people are watching. Let's be clear. If you vote  ``yes,'' you are voting to restore the same conditions that fueled the  crisis and collapse of 2008. It is a vote you will regret--and be  remembered for. Vote ``no.''
