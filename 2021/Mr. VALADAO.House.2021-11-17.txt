 Madam Speaker, last month, I led the California  Republican delegation in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Haaland  and Secretary of Commerce Raimondo regarding the reinitiation of  consultation on the 2019 biological opinions for the long-term  operations of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.   Despite our request for a response, we did not receive an answer by  the set deadline. This issue is critical to my constituents in the  Central Valley. Failure to provide answers to our urgent questions is  unacceptable.   This week, I led another letter to Secretaries Haaland and Raimondo.  Once again, we are demanding answers regarding the administration's  antiscience decision, which threatens the livelihoods of Central Valley  farmers and families.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I will not back down, and I urgently  request attention and response to this issue.                            ____________________
