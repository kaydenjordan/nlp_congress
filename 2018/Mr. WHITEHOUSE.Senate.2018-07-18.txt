 Mr. President, I am grateful today to be joined by  Senator King, from the great State of Maine, to speak about the  troubling changes that we are seeing in the oceans and how climate  change is reshaping our States' fisheries.   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  recognizes that ``climate change imperils the structure and function of  already stressed coastal aquatic ecosystems.'' For the record, Maine  and Rhode Island are indeed aquatic.   The oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent of the excess  carbon dioxide that we have pumped into the atmosphere since the  Industrial Revolution began. That is changing the ocean's chemistry.  The oceans have also absorbed roughly 90 percent of the excess heat  trapped in the atmosphere by those greenhouse gases. As a result of  that excess carbon dioxide and that excess heat, our oceans are  warming, and they are rising. They are losing oxygen, and they are  growing more acidic. This puts marine life, coastal communities, and  the global ocean economy all in jeopardy.   Commercial fishing is an important economy in the United States, and  both Maine and Rhode Island celebrate our longstanding fishing  traditions. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, over  9.6 billion pounds of wild seafood, valued at $5.3 billion, was  commercially landed in the United States in 2016.   Across New England, American lobster was our most valuable fishery.  We had lobstermen bringing around $663 million--two-thirds of $1  billion--worth of lobster to shore. Sadly, Rhode Island's lobster  fishery is badly knocked down by warming ocean waters. NOAA notes:  ``The lobster industry in New York and southern New England has nearly  collapsed.'' Maine dominated the catch, bringing in nearly 85 percent  of the lobster landed in the region.   According to NOAA, from ``1994 to 2014, Maine's landings surged 219  percent to more than 124 million pounds.'' The lobster population is  shifting north, away from Rhode Island, New York, and Connecticut, as  waters warm, leaving Rhode Island and other southern New England  lobster traps empty. But Mainers are taking notice, too, as warming  waters are driving lobster even farther north along their rocky coast.  A recent study of 700 North American marine species predicted that  lobster populations could move 200 miles northward by the end of the  century as waters continue to warm. Senator King can report what 200  miles does to the coast of Maine.    Lobster is not the only fishery feeling the heat in New England. A  2017 study of global warming found that the greater Northeast region is  anticipated to warm faster than other regions of the world. According  to the ``Climate Science Special Report,'' a Federal report that will  form the scientific basis of the Fourth National Climate Assessment,  ``the Northeast has warmed faster than 99% of the global ocean since  2004.'' We have a global ocean hotspot off our coast. The Northeast is  also expected to see higher than global average sea level rise, putting  our ports, fishing docks, and coastal infrastructure all at risk.   Fishermen have noticed. They are keenly aware of the myriad ways  climate change is altering the waters that generations of their  families have fished, and they see the difference. Fishermen in Rhode  Island have told me: ``Sheldon, things are getting weird out there.''   ``Sheldon, it's not my grandfather's ocean.''   They share anecdotes of catching increasing numbers of tropical fish  early in the summer season and seeing fish  [[Page S5053]]  that rarely frequented Rhode Island waters until recent years. As new  fish move in and traditional fish move out, fishermen are left with  more questions than answers.   In Southern New England, black sea bass has become the poster fish  for shifting stocks. As we can see in this graphic, the 1970s had a hub  of black sea bass here, with this as the center and then a slight reach  upward but basically off the mid-Atlantic coast. This is 2014. The  center of activity has moved up closer to Rhode Island. We are right  here. Of course, black sea bass populations in our region have  increased concomitantly.   This commercially valuable fish, the black sea bass, can help Rhode  Island fishermen replace traditional species that are growing more  scarce, like winter flounder--the fish my wife studied for her graduate  work--which has crashed as winters warm.   The current fisheries' management structure, however, forces Rhode  Island fishermen to toss the increasingly abundant and valuable black  sea bass overboard. NOAA scientists saw this northward transit of the  sea bass coming years ago, but regulatory catch limits did not keep up.  They are generally based on historical catches. And States are hesitant  to give up quota even after the fish have moved northward and left  their shores, so State-specific quotas badly lag the changing  distribution of the fish.   A former Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council scientist  acknowledged that fish like summer flounder are moving north and told  NPR that ``some of the Southern states are having trouble catching  their quota, and states to the north have more availability of fish.''   Dave Monti is a friend who is a charter boat captain out of Wickford  Harbor in North Kingstown, RI. Dave said:         There's no doubt the waters have warmed and black sea bass       have moved in. The quotas haven't done a good enough job at       figuring in climate change yet.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an article from the Providence Journal describing the changes that  Captain Monti sees and our local efforts to deal with these changes.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From the Providence Journal]        Front Line of Climate Change: Black Sea Bass Surge Off R.I.                             (By Alex Kuffner)         Providence, RI.--Scientists tell us that some fish will be       winners and others losers as oceans warm.        In Rhode Island, count lobster, silver hake and winter       flounder among the losers, their numbers plummeting as       climate change drives water temperatures higher. On the list       of winners so far are squid, summer flounder, butterfish.        And black sea bass. The population of the dusky-colored       fish with striking blue accents has historically been       strongest off the mid-Atlantic Coast, but over the past       decade or so its numbers have spiked off New England and it       is becoming a more important catch for the region's       fishermen.        In a telling sign of black sea bass's surge in Rhode       Island, the state Department of Environmental Management last       month loosened regulations governing the recreational fishery       for the species, extending the season by 31 days and       increasing the fall possession limit to seven fish per person       per day, from five.        It may appear to be a small development, but the rules       change resulted from a heated debate among state and federal       regulators about how best to manage a species whose       distribution and abundance has gone through a striking shift       that few would have imagined a generation ago.        The back-and-forth over the fish also signals more       difficulties to come as regulators struggle to respond to the       impacts of climate change on the marine environment. Similar       issues are already playing out with summer flounder, another       warm-water fish that is becoming more common off the north       Atlantic coast.        How they are managed will have important implications not       only for those fish but for lobsters and other key species in       the ocean ecosystem.        ``We're in an adaptive mode right now,'' said Bob Ballou,       assistant to the director of the Rhode Island Department of       Environmental Management and chairman of the Atlantic States       Marine Fisheries Commission's black sea bass and summer       flounder boards. ``It's occupying all our time to think       through all the approaches to better manage these       resources.''        One of the key assumptions that the nation's fishery       management system is built upon is that species don't move       between general geographic regions.        That traditional regulatory framework held up for a long       time, but rising water temperatures and the resulting shifts       in species distribution and abundance are forcing the       beginnings of change.        In the case of black sea bass, it's not that the population       of the fish is simply relocating north. Numbers are still       decent in the southern portion of the fish's range, but they       are much stronger now off the coasts of New York,       Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts--places where the       waters used to be too cold to support large populations.        In Rhode Island, water temperatures in Narragansett Bay       have risen about 3\1/2\-degrees Fahrenheit since 1959,       according to weekly monitoring done by the Graduate School of       Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. Warmer       winters, in particular, have allowed black sea bass to thrive       this far north.        In the 1980s and 1990s, a fish trawl survey conducted by       the DEM rarely caught a single black sea bass in Rhode Island       waters, but incidence of the species has risen steadily,       especially over the past decade, and now each trawl nets       about two black sea bass on average.        Because black sea bass move between federal and state       waters, the fish is managed jointly by the federal       government, through the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management       Council, and states, including Rhode Island, through the       Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.        Although scientists have long known that concentrations of       the fish have been shifting north toward the Gulf of Maine,       it wasn't until 2016 that regulators started to factor in the       change.        That year, a new stock assessment for black sea bass       formally recognized for the first time two distinct       populations of the fish, a northern group around New England       and a southern group from New Jersey to the Carolinas.        The growth in the northern group more than made up for the       southern group's mediocre numbers, and the assessment       determined the total population of the fish to be nearly two       and a half times higher than the minimum stock threshold set       by regulators        ``That was a really big step forward,'' said Jason McNamee,       chief of marine resource management for the DEM. ``The       science is now catching up to what's going on with the       environment.''        But despite the robust overall picture for the fish, the       ASFMC's proposed quotas for this year called for a 12-percent       reduction in the northern region's catch to allow the       southern region, the historic center of the black sea bass       fishery, to increase its share.        Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut filed       an appeal, and on May 3, the fisheries commission relented,       allowing what amounts to a four-percent increase for the       northern region.        The stakes are high for Rhode Island, which is experiencing       deep changes to the composition of its marine species because       of its location, at the junction of what ocean scientists       call the Boreal Province--cold waters that include the Gulf       of Maine to the north--and the Virginian Province--warmer       waters of the mid-Atlantic to the south.        ``We're right at the front lines of these changes,''       McNamee said. ``These mid-Atlantic species are our most       important species now.''        Dave Monti reeled in another black sea bass.        Like the five others caught in Narragansett Bay on a recent       morning, at less than 15 inches long, it was too small to       keep. So Monti started working the hook out of its mouth.        ``You've got to be careful of the dorsal fin,'' he warned.       ``It'll stick right into you.''        As regulators have tightened catch limits for striped bass       and other saltwater game fish that were historically abundant       in Rhode Island waters, black sea bass has filled the void,       said Monti, a charter boat captain who docks his boat in       Wickford Harbor.        ``They've saved my charters over the past couple years when       other fish aren't around,'' he said.        Seas were too rough to visit his favorite place to fish for       black sea bass, a patch of waters in the open ocean near       Brenton Reef off Newport, so he steered his 44-foot boat the       Virginia Joan to a few spots in the Bay between Jamestown and       Narragansett.        Black sea bass is a reef fish that likes rocky bottoms and       patrols the waters around jetties and pilings for prey. It's       a hermaphrodite--some fish switch sexes as adults. The       species can be found off Rhode Island year-round, typically       coming inshore to the Bay in the spring to spawn and       wintering farther off the coast.        Just south of the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge, Monti       reached for a rod from a holder overhead. He called it his       ``sea bass slayer.'' It was fitted with a shiny, red-tinted       lure and he baited the hook with a slice of squid and a       little fish called a silverside. A few minutes later, the       first black sea bass was caught.        It doesn't take much work to find the fish these days, said       Rick Bellavance, president of the Rhode Island Party and       Charter Boat Association.        ``Black sea bass are a charter boat operator's dream,'' he       said. ``They're pretty prevalent, they're easy to catch, and       they taste great.''        On a recent charter to Block Island, the six clients on       Bellavance's boat caught only two striped bass and one       bluefish between them, so he started setting lines for black       sea bass. They promptly snagged 20 of the fish that were big       enough to take home.  [[Page S5054]]         Although he applauded the new regulations, he said the       changes have been slow to come and haven't gone far enough.       He'd like to have the current six-month season extended year-      round and the per-person daily limit raised to 10 fish.        ``We need to recognize that the stock has shifted to the       north and to the east,'' he said. ``Rhode Island is closer to       that epicenter than it used to be.''        Monti, who is vice president of the Rhode Island Marine       Fisheries Council, which advises the DEM on state fishing       policy, agreed.        ``There's no doubt the waters have warmed and black sea       bass have moved in,'' he said. ``The quotas haven't done a       good enough job at figuring in climate change yet.''        About half the morning's catch on Monti's boat were black       sea bass. Among the rest were other warm-water fish that are       becoming more common in Rhode Island: scup and summer       flounder.        After Monti freed the little black sea bass from the hook,       he held it in his hand. As the fish age, their scales become       more blue. This one had yet to develop the bright coloring,       but it was still striking.        ``Pretty, isn't it?'' Monti said as he dropped it back into       the Bay.        Not everyone loves the fish.        Black sea bass have voracious appetites, hunting on the       ocean bottom for crabs, clams and shrimp. The fish don't have       teeth but will swallow crustaceans whole.        Lobstermen complain of pulling up their traps and finding       black sea bass inside that have gobbled up their lobsters.        ``I see it everyday,'' said Lanny Dellinger, a Newport       lobsterman and board member of the Rhode Island Lobstermen's       Association. ``Everyday, every trawl. It doesn't matter if       it's mud bottom, hard bottom, deep water, shallow water.       There are so many black sea bass, it's unbelievable.''        The rise of black sea bass is coming at the same time that       the lobster catch is on a steep decline in Rhode Island,       falling from 8.2 million pounds in 1998 to 2.3 million pounds       in 2016, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.        Lobster is a cold-water species that is moving north as       Rhode Island's waters warm. The higher water temperatures       have made the lobsters that remain more susceptible to shell       disease. Dellinger and others believe that predation by black       sea bass is also pushing down the lobster numbers.        Black sea bass could be contributing to the decline, but       the fish is probably not the primary cause, said Jon Hare,       science and research director at the National Oceanic and       Atmospheric Administration's Northeast Fisheries Science       Center in Woods Hole. Crabs and other crustaceans that the       fish eat aren't feeling similar impacts, he said.        McNamee agreed, saying that the fish generally prey on       smaller juvenile lobsters, leaving the bigger ones alone.        As part of a larger study of black sea bass, the Rhode       Island-based Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation is       analyzing the gut contents of fish caught by nine       participating commercial and recreational boats.        ``We know that black sea bass do eat lobster, but we just       don't know if the rate of consumption is having an impact on       the size of the lobster population,'' said Anna Malek Mercer,       executive director of the foundation.        One lobsterman sent her photos of a 2\1/2\-inch long       lobster found inside a black sea bass in a trap.        ``When they end up in lobster traps, there usually aren't       any lobsters inside,'' she said.        Dellinger wants loosened regulations on both the       recreational and commercial sides to allow fishermen to catch       more black sea bass. He likened the fish to coyotes that need       to be culled or to rodents afflicting farmers.        ``It's like owning a corn bin full of rats and nobody's       allowed to get rid of them,'' he said.        Despite the recent changes, scientists and fishermen in       Rhode Island say that the management system for black sea       bass is still outdated.        Tellingly, none of the New England states has a seat on the       Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council--one of the two key       decision-making bodies for the species--even though much of       the fish's population is located off the region's coast.        That has meant that allocations remain high for fishing       boats in states like Virginia and North Carolina that must       sometimes travel half a day north to find the fish, while       Rhode Island boats are forced to discard their catch because,       local fishermen say, their quotas aren't high enough.        The southern states don't want to give up their share       because black sea bass fetches a good price--more than $3 a       pound on average--and the commercial fishery is growing in       value--tripling since 2009 to more than $12 million.        The black sea bass study being done by the CFRF is using       different gear types--from gill nets to trawls to lobster       traps--to gather more data on the species and strengthen       stock assessments that may be missing some fish.         Malek Mercer said that scientists are getting a better       understanding of the fish's changing population, but managing       the species is the problem.        ``For better or worse, science is not going to fix that,''       she said. ``But if we get our management there, I do think we       can have a really strong black sea bass fishery here.''        McNamee described the management system as ``deliberative       and slow by design.'' He acknowledged the frustration felt by       Rhode Island fishermen who have seen the state's traditional       groundfish stocks drop off while black sea bass proliferate.        ``There's still way more fish to catch than fishermen can       get access to,'' he said.     Mr. President, we have to fix this. To use the black  sea bass example, the species is comanaged by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery  Management Council and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.  Rhode Island only has a seat on the Atlantic States Commission; it does  not have a vote on the Mid-Atlantic Council. That means that my State  is not fully represented in the decision-making process, and perfectly  good black sea bass keeps being thrown into the sea by fishermen who  ought to be able to bring that catch home.   In 2016, NOAA scientists assessed the vulnerability to the effects of  climate change of over 80 commercially valuable species in the  Northeast. So this is not just a story about black sea bass or about  lobsters; this Northeast climate vulnerability assessment ranked  species based on climate risk and sensitivities to changing ocean  conditions.   Here is the climate risk factor graph. As we see, all 80 species  scored in the high or very high risk of climate exposure categories.  All 80 commercially valuable species they studied faced high or very  high risk. This is a red flag for our fisheries.   Maine is the place for lobster. In Rhode Island, squid is king. In  2016, 56 percent of the longfin squid caught on the east coast was  landed in Rhode Island. According to NOAA, this catch was valued at  over $28 million, accounting for nearly 30 percent of our landings  value in 2016. But climate change is putting our calamari at risk. Warm  waters may actually open more habitat for the species, but its carbon  cousin, ocean acidification, is the hazard. Like its shellfish  brethren, squid require calcium carbonate--for squid, it is to grow the  hard beaks they use to feed. Acidic waters decrease the availability of  this necessary compound in the seawater and can even dissolve calcium  carbonate organisms' shells under extremely acidic conditions.   On the west coast, shellfish farmers have been dealing with ocean  acidification since the mid-2000s. Dr. Richard Feely is the researcher  who first identified ocean acidification as the cause for oyster spat  failures in the Northwest back in 2005. He noted in a recent NPR  article that the acidification problem is only going to get worse.  ``The acidification water welling up from the ocean floor now contains  carbon dioxide gas emitted 50 years ago.'' Carbon emissions are worse  since then. Some hatcheries in the Northwest are already moving  operations to less acidic waters off Hawaii, and others are looking to  buffer the water with seagrasses to absorb carbon and lower acidity.  Shellfish farmers in Rhode Island are facing the challenge of  acidifying waters as well.   At the same time, marine species are also facing deoxygenation,  increased harmful algae, and other consequences of a warming and  acidifying ocean. The symptoms of climate change in the ocean are  everywhere.   A recent study in Global Change Biology warned that reduced oxygen  availability could limit the growth of fish and other species.  Fishermen can't make a living off sick and tiny fish.   California's lucrative Dungeness and rock crab season was cut short  in 2015 to 2016 due to a harmful algae bloom.   Our Great Lakes have been hit too. I went out on Lake Erie after the  horrible algae event there, and the fishermen who took me out sounded  like Rhode Islanders. One of them said: ``Everything I've learned from  fishing a lifetime on this lake is worth nothing now, because it's all  changing so fast.''   If we have an opportunity to have an open, bipartisan debate on a  strong Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization, I urge my colleagues not  to overlook the toll climate change is taking on our fishing industry.  The changes that are happening in our oceans do not care whether you  believe they exist. The physics, chemistry, and biology driving these  changes will happen anyway, and our fishermen are depending on us to  give the scientists and the managers the tools and resources they need  to meet the challenges climate change is bringing to our shores.   I now yield to my friend from Maine to give the perspective from his  rocky shores.  [[Page S5055]]     Mr. President, Senator King and I yield the floor.   First, let me thank him for joining us. Second, with Senators present  here from landlocked States, let me make the requests to both of you  that, when we come before this body with concerns about what is  happening to our ocean economies, which I think are shared by every  coastal Senator who is seeing these changes, that you view our pleas  with the same courtesy and respect that we show you when wildfires burn  through Utah and we come to make sure that there is adequate emergency  response or when Oklahoma faces hurricanes or cyclones and tornadoes  and the Federal Government and the Senate rally to the response of  those who are experiencing the pain of that in your States. Our fishing  communities and our coastal communities have a very different distress,  but I hope you will see it as an equal distress and pay us the courtesy  of your due consideration.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S5057]]
