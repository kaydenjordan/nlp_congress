 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3743, Supporting  the Foundation for the NIH and the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA  Act.   I introduced this bipartisan bill along with my friend, Chairwoman  Anna Eshoo, to build on our success of public-private partnerships that  have produced lifesaving medical breakthroughs.   The Foundation for the NIH and the Reagan-Udall Foundation were  created by Congress to support the NIH and the FDA by forging  partnerships between the Federal Government and private industry  experts.   Providing additional support to these organizations would further  accelerate research into novel vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and  other innovations, helping us prepare for future emergencies.   Due to partnerships such as these, we have already seen the success  of the ACTIV program in speeding developments of COVID-19 vaccines and  treatments.   It should be noted that we would not be where we are today without  the innovation seen in Operation Warp Speed. This public-private  partnership has not received the credit it deserves for creating,  developing, and manufacturing life-saving vaccines in record time.   Through my legislation, we can build on these successes and enhance  partnerships across the healthcare industry.   I thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Guthrie for their  support, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
