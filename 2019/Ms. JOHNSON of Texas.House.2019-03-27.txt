 Madam Chair, I rise today to voice my support  for H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. The purpose of this legislation  is simple: ensuring all women are rewarded with equal pay for equal  work. The landmark Equal Pay Act of 1963 has helped us to achieve  progress in this crucial policy area, but the Equal Pay Act, enacted  over a half-century ago, is out of date and out of touch with today's  business world. The Paycheck Fairness Act makes necessary and common- sense improvements to this historic law so that we can take another  step toward eradicating gender-based wage discrimination.   Most importantly, this bill seeks to make equal pay a reality for  women of color. Race and gender wage gaps harm not just the economic  security of women but also of their families. A woman of color who  works full time, year round, can lose more than $1 million in income  over a 40-year career because of the wage gap. Currently, black women  earn $0.60 for every dollar earned by their white male counterparts.  Native American women earn $0.57 to every dollar, and Latina women earn  $0.54. Meanwhile, white women and Asian women earn $0.79 and $0.87,  respectively. This wage gap has not improved for years and continues to  squeeze women's pocketbooks, erode their earning potential, and deprive  them of the means to improve their own lives and support their  families.   It is long past time to update the Equal Pay Act to give working  women the legal tools they need to challenge sex-based pay  discrimination and to encourage employers to comply with the law. The  Paycheck Fairness Act sets forth a path toward achieving those goals.   I urge members of the House to pass this critical legislation.
