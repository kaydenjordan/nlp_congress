 Madam President, I rise to offer motion to do something  that this tax plan fails to do: make good on President Trump's promise  to close the carried interest tax loophole. This motion has the support  of Senators Whitehouse, Donnelly, and Van Hollen.   I think we need to make our tax system simpler and fairer for hard- working families, businesses--particularly  [[Page S7655]]  small businesses--and manufacturers, and that is what I have been  working for. Unfortunately, this is not the plan being presented today  by Senate Republicans.   Let's be honest with the American people. This bill is largely a tax  giveaway to the wealthiest few and big corporations, while millions of  middle-class families will get a tax hike. With this partisan bill from  across the aisle, big corporations get permanent tax breaks-- permanent--while middle-class families will see tax increases. In fact,  most Americans earning less than $75,000 a year will see tax increases.  That is simply not fair.   It is also not fair that the top 1 percent will end up with over 60  percent of the benefits, and in exchange, 13 million more will lose  health insurance. Healthcare premiums will increase by 10 percent, and  Medicare and Medicaid have been put on the chopping block to pay for  it.   In addition, with the Senate Republican plan, powerful corporations  can still deduct their State and local taxes, but they completely  eliminate the State and local tax deduction for individual taxpayers.  This deduction ensures households aren't taxed twice by the Federal  Government on money they have already paid in State and local taxes,  including property taxes. But with the current Senate plan, nearly one  in three Wisconsinites will lose their personal income, sales, and  property tax deductions. A recent study shows that it could decrease  the value of home ownership. The average deduction in Wisconsin is  $11,653, and nearly $10 billion of Wisconsinites' paychecks would be  subject to a double tax--all to pay for a plan that favors those at the  top. What is more, by the latest estimation from our own congressional  scorekeeper, this plan will add $1 trillion--$1 trillion--to our  deficit, breaking our promise to the next generation and sticking them  with the bill.    Our Tax Code ought to reward hard work more than it rewards wealth.  It doesn't do that today, and it will not do that tomorrow if this bill  passes. In fact, this Republican plan's primary purpose is to reward  Fortune 500 corporations who will simply reward the wealth of  shareholders, not the hard work that drives productivity and growth  across our economy.   The primary promise of this legislation makes the same promise that  has not been kept to workers for decades. Trickle-down economics has  not worked in the past, and it is not going to work now. American  workers know that. But my colleagues, rushing to pass this legislation,  don't seem to care, because the only thing that matters is delivering  for donors, who have too much power and influence in Washington.   I want to see loopholes closed, like the one that favors Wall Street  hedge funds and allows them to pay a lower tax rate than many Wisconsin  workers pay. Earlier this year, I introduced the Carried Interest  Fairness Act to close the carried interest tax loophole for  millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street.   The carried interest loophole allows certain investment managers to  take advantage of the preferential 20 percent long-term capital gains  tax rates on the income they get for managing other people's money,  rather than the ordinary income tax rates of up to 39.6 percent that  American workers pay. My legislation closes the carried interest tax  loophole by ensuring that income earned by managing other people's  money is taxed at the same ordinary income tax rates as the vast  majority of working Americans pay.   As a candidate, President Trump included closing the carried interest  tax loophole in his tax reform plan. While campaigning in Detroit last  year, he said: ``We will eliminate the carried interest deduction and  other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street  investors, and for people like me, but unfair to American workers.''   Then this May, after being asked why his tax reform outline didn't  mention carried interest after campaigning on its closure, the  President responded by saying:         It's out. Done . . . carried interest was great for me, but       carried interest was unfair and it's gone.    I agree that it is unfair and it should be eliminated. However, it is  not gone with this legislation. This loophole for Wall Street is still  in the bill. Why? Is it because my Republican colleagues on the other  side of the aisle simply do not believe a word this President says? Is  it because Wall Street lobbyists, big banks, and hedge funds have such  a grip on Washington? Is it because these are the very donors that this  legislation is meant to serve with a win?   Today I am offering a motion to close the carried interest tax  loophole once and for all. It is simply unfair for Wisconsin workers to  pay higher income tax rates than a billionaire hedge fund on Wall  Street.   If you agree, you will support this motion. If you want to help  President Trump keep his promises to the American people, you will  support this motion. Let's do right by the American people and close  this tax loophole for the wealthy on Wall Street. Let's make sure that  our Tax Code rewards hard work as much as it currently rewards wealth.  If that isn't simple and fair, I don't know what is.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
