 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking  Member Lowey for bringing more disaster relief legislation to the floor  today.   I am pleased to see much-needed support for ongoing disaster response  efforts in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other hurricane- affected areas, including direct assistance to families, debris removal  operations, and emergency protective measures carried out by FEMA, and  additional activities of numerous other Federal agencies that are on  the ground working around the clock to help us to recover and rebuild.   I cannot thank enough all of our Federal and local personnel helping  us through this. I have been on the ground after Irma, after Maria, and  just recently, and I tell you, their support is invaluable.   I am particularly pleased to see the subdivision of $5 billion for  Disaster Direct Loan Program to assist local governments and with  measures taking into account the unique aid and flexibility needed for  the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.   Multiple loans will be available based on different types of losses  and unanticipated spending needs, and waivers of amount limits are also  helpful. Additional loans to pay for local matching requirements is an  important support.   However, I am deeply concerned about the important relief that was  left out of this bill and the administration's disaster relief request  last week. This does not incorporate the medium and long-term  assistance that played a clear critical role in the recovery following  previous disasters like Katrina and Sandy, and the Virgin Islands  cannot afford to wait for this to be a higher priority of the Federal  Government.   The package does not include community development and social service  block grant funding, Economic Development Administration funds,  supplemental housing assistance, nor additional funds for repair of our  water infrastructure, ports, community facilities, airports, roads,  parks, wetlands, and fisheries.   Damage sustained in all of these areas has been catastrophic, and  waiting around until another end of the year for auxiliary funding for  these pressing needs is not acceptable.   Perhaps most concerning is the lack of Medicaid program assistance to  the territory. Even before two consecutive Category 5 hurricanes that  decimated our hospitals and medical infrastructure, the Virgin Islands  was forced to operate a Medicaid program that is capped in an amount  that has no relationship to local needs, and our rate of Federal  matching funds, our FMAP, is limited to an arbitrarily low 55 percent  Federal to 45 percent local contribution.                                time  1300    Thousands of our citizens go without adequate care due to this  treatment every year, in addition to the impacts on our providers and  hospitals due to uncompensated care, but after these back-to-back  storms, there is no revenue being generated in the Virgin Islands and  Puerto Rico at this time. Our tourism-related economy is gone. We will  miss this entire year, at the very least.   With our public health and social welfare needs, we are in dire need  of supplemental Medicaid support, including a temporary 100 percent  Federal contribution, just like what was provided to Americans living  in Louisiana and Texas following Katrina.   I was pleased to see Ranking Member Pallone's proposal to provide  this 100 percent temporary Federal share with a substantial plus-up to  our allotment so that the American citizens--yes, American citizens--in  the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico can have the benefit of Medicaid in  this time of greatest need.   This has not been a part of this package. Virgin Islanders cannot  wait until Christmas for a Medicaid program. We need it now.
