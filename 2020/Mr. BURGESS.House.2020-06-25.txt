 Mr. Speaker, let me just say, to start, I don't often  agree with my colleague from Florida, Mr. Hastings, but I find myself  in agreement with him on two points this morning. One was his eloquent  praise for the gentleman from Georgia, and we will indeed miss his  eloquence here on the floor. It is always hard to follow the gentleman  from Georgia, which I frequently do in the Rules Committee, because he  is able to speak so clearly on an issue.   Another point I would agree with the gentleman from Florida on is  that we did spend a long time in the Rules Committee yesterday. It was  a marathon hearing, but it was important because so many of these  things had had no hearing and no chance for debate in the so-called  regular order.   About 60 or 70 percent of the bill, H.R. 1425, the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, which, as the gentleman from  Georgia points out, allocates a significant sum of money to the  Affordable Care Act in order to save the Affordable Care Act, something  that is now over a decade old. It is a sign that the law has failed and  failed to provide for Americans as it was originally described.   The House of Representatives should be leading at a time of crisis.  We shouldn't be making a halfhearted attempt to fix a broken law as a  present for its 10th birthday, and we certainly shouldn't do that  without the proper work from the authorization committee; in this case,  the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   Last fall, before we could have ever predicted the emergence of this  novel coronavirus, we debated a proposal here on this House floor. It  was called H.R. 3. It was a Speaker's proposal that would require the  government to set drug prices. In the consequence, if American  innovation was a casualty of that, then that was judged to be  acceptable collateral damage toward their political goal. But it was a  bad bill; it was the wrong time.   Unfortunately, some of those very same policies have found their way  and have been intruded into this bill. In fact, I very much regret that  such policies would receive any consideration during this pandemic.   Let's be very clear: American biomedical innovation in the form of  new treatments and cures is going to lead us to victory over this novel  coronavirus. We will beat this virus. We always do. We will emerge on  the other side victorious. But one of the paths to that victory is  American innovation, American biomedical innovation, American  pharmaceutical innovation.   A vote for this bill today is a vote against a cure for the novel  coronavirus. A vote for this bill today is a vote against a vaccine to  prevent this or future illnesses.   If this body wants to make an impact on drug prices, there are ways  to do that. We could sit down--in fact, our ranking member of the full  committee, Mr. Walden, has a bill, H.R. 19, which has a number of  bipartisan proposals, which means they have both a Republican and a  Democratic cosponsor, and it does so in a way that doesn't harm  innovation.   So what does this bill do to States? Well, it really hurts States  when they are already down. State Medicaid budgets are really, really  out of control right now. In fact, we should be helping, not hurting,  the States.   The Foundation for Government Accountability published a report in  June of this year titled ``States are about to be hit by a Medicaid  tidal wave,'' saying that this coronavirus is putting extra budget  pressure on States at the same time their general revenues, because of  demand destruction by the virus, are expected--State tax collections  are expected to decrease by 20 percent.   The bill before us today would reduce State's administrative FMAP if  they do not expand Medicaid. Punishing States in this way would further  hurt State budgets that are already being pushed to the limits.                                time  1045    So many of us remember the Supreme Court case in 2012, the case  titled National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. The  Court ruled that threatening States' Medicaid funding for not expanding  that program is, in fact, unconstitutional.   Sections 204 and 205 of this bill would violate the same principles  and coerce States, rather than incentivize States, into expanding  Medicaid. This bill will actively damage State Medicaid programs like  those in Texas.   H.R. 1425 also wastes taxpayer dollars on Affordable Care Act  outreach and enrollment and navigators that have already been proven to  not have a high return on investment.   It is one thing if they want to improve policies, but let's not go  back to bringing policies back from the dead that, in fact, are not  working.    Lastly, this bill fails to protect life. The bill  establishes a Federal reinsurance fund, and this reinsurance fund is  for individuals in ACA exchange plans. The fund is fiscally  irresponsible. It is $10 billion a year forever, so we don't even know  what the final CBO score is. But it also does not include longstanding  Hyde protections and, therefore, fails to ensure that Federal dollars  would never be used to pay for abortions.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has worked in a bipartisan way this  Congress on numerous policies that would make a real difference in  American healthcare. It is disappointing that the Democratic leadership  is pushing this partisan proposal ahead of providing Americans with  real support.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his kindness.
