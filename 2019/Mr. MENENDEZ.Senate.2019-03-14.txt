 Mr. President, I come to the floor to correct the  record concerning statements the Senate majority leader made yesterday  morning,  [[Page S1893]]  in which he claimed that GEN John Abizaid's nomination to be Ambassador  to Saudi Arabia ``is being held up.''   Allow me to ease the majority leader's concerns. Far from being  ``held up,'' the Foreign Relations Committee, with my full support, has  been extremely diligent in taking up General Abizaid's nomination; he  appeared on the very first committee nominations hearing of the 116th  Congress, and his nomination is advancing through the regular committee  process expeditiously. I look forward to his approval by the committee  and, hopefully, a speedy confirmation. As with all nominees, his final  confirmation is under the control of the majority leader.   I am concerned that the majority leader has an inaccurate view of the  nominations situation facing the Foreign Relations Committee. He stated  yesterday that ``if we want to solve problems in the Middle East,  through diplomacy, we'll need to confirm diplomats.'' Unfortunately, we  cannot confirm diplomats that we do not have.   It took 23 months before the Trump administration bothered to  nominate General Abizaid, leaving a gaping hole in our diplomatic  posture to Saudi Arabia and the region. It is possible that this  failure of leadership is the result of the President believing that his  son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is capable of doing this job from the White  House.   Regardless of the reason, Saudi Arabia is not an isolated example. It  took even longer, over 2 years, before the Trump administration  nominated a candidate to be U.S. Ambassador to Turkey. We are now 26  months into the Trump administration, and we still lack ambassadorial  nominees to critical countries like Egypt, Pakistan, and our close  ally, Jordan. This failure is a reckless abdication of a constitutional  responsibility that is essential to projecting American power abroad.  There is only one person responsible for this failure: President Trump;  yet the majority leader appears to be curiously oblivious to that fact.   Let me be clear: When the committee has received nominations, we have  worked with efficiency and diligence to vet and advance those  nominations. I have devoted my time and staff resources to ensure this  because of my strong belief that the State Department, USAID, and other  foreign affairs agencies must be appropriately staffed. We cannot  promote our foreign policy, protect American citizens, and advocate for  American businesses without a robust diplomatic corps. In the 115th  Congress, the committee reported 169 nominations. I reject any  assertion that we have not done our part to ensure that the State  Department is appropriately staffed.   All too often, however, the committee has received nominations late  or not at all.   There is, unfortunately, there is another severe problem that we  cannot ignore with regard to this administration's nominees. Delays in  advancing Trump political nominees is largely due to poor vetting by  this administration. When the President nominates and renominates  individuals with restraining orders for threats of violence, who  engaged in incidents that should, frankly, mean they never should have  been nominated, or made material omissions, sometimes on a repeated  basis, in their nomination materials, the Foreign Relations Committee  must do our due diligence on behalf of the American people. Someone has  to. My staff and I have had to spend significant additional time on  vetting because of the White House's negligence or incompetence.   The United States and our allies continue to face tremendous  challenges around the world. We must continue to lead on the  international stage and work in collaboration with international  partners to achieve our shared security goals, but to have our  diplomats in place, they must be nominated in a timely fashion and  vetted properly. Despite the majority leader's confusion on this issue,  that is the real hold-up here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to express a concern over the  Rubio amendment to the Sanders-Lee joint resolution, S.J. Res. 7, which  was passed by voice vote in yesterday's debate.   The Rubio amendment attempts to make clear that nothing in the joint  resolution is intended or may be interpreted to affect any intelligence  or counterintelligence activity or investigations relating to threats  in or from Yemen, which involves the collection, analysis, or sharing  of intelligence with any coalition partner.   I do not believe that it was the intention of the authors of S.J.  Res. 7 to restrict these intelligence activities per se. I believe it  was Senator Rubio's intention to make sure that that legitimate  intelligence activities, as specified, were not affected.   However, my concern springs from the full implications of what  ``sharing intelligence'' means. I assume it is meant to share useful  intelligence the United States may acquire about the intentions,  activities, characteristics, and other information about, for example,  the Houthis or Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That is entirely  appropriate.   But if the intelligence being shared is actually information that  allows Saudi Arabia or other members of the Saudi-led coalition to  specifically target and conduct military operations, such as  airstrikes, against specific sites in Yemen, then that would get  perilously close to the U.S. being directly involved in hostilities in  Yemen, including under the War Powers Resolution.   Section 8 of the War Powers Resolution considers U.S. Armed Forces to  be ``introduced into hostilities'' if, among other activities, members  of the U.S. Armed Forces ``coordinate'' the activities of foreign  forces. Arguably, enabling Saudi forces to target specific sites in  Yemen could constitute ``coordination'' under the War Powers  definition.   Why is this important? It is important, first, to preserve the scope  of application of the War Powers Resolution, which the Congress enacted  to rein in the power of the executive branch to make war anywhere under  any circumstances.   Second, the more direct assistance U.S. Armed Forces provide to the  Saudi-led coalition, the closer they are associated with the actions of  those countries. That could lead to shared liability in those  activities if and when those activities lead, inadvertently or  otherwise, to atrocities on the ground in Yemen.   Again, I do not believe that it was the intention of the author of  this amendment to create the legal space for this to occur. I would  advise the Department of Defense and the appropriate intelligence  agencies to be mindful of this issue and be cautious about what  intelligence information is shared and for what purposes it is used.                            ____________________
