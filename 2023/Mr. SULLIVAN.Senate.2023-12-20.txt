 Madam President, I know this might be one of the last  presiding duties of the year, so I appreciate the Presiding Officer  taking the time on the floor before she gets to go home.   I want to talk about two issues today here on the Senate floor. One  is a really important one. It is a policy issue that we have to solve.  What I am trying to do today is just make sure my colleagues--because a  lot of them get kind of fed some misinformation on this issue and then  the American people writ large--know what is going on so we can fix  this issue. I am hoping the White House and the administration and the  Treasury Department--that everybody is watching because this is an easy  one.   Imagine this, if someone came to you and said, ``All right. Let's  see. Is there legislation that we could pass that would help end slave  labor in China, with the Uighurs; help make sure we had a really strong  environment for our oceans and our fisheries; help make sure we weren't  funding the Russian war machine to go kill innocent civilians in  Ukraine; help make sure we keep strong American coastal communities;  and help promote the great American fishermen, who work so hard all  over this great Nation?'' We have been doing it way before the founding  of the Republic. If there is legislation that could do all of those  things, wouldn't you want to support it--oh, by the way--and that could  undermine our adversaries, the two big adversaries we have, Russia and  China?   Is there legislation pending in the U.S. Senate that could do all of  these things? The answer is yes. Hell yes. I just want to make sure all  of my colleagues know, because when I bring this to the floor when we  come back in the new year, I just want to make sure everybody supports  it because it is a no-brainer. It is a no-brainer.   So what am I talking about? Well, it is my U.S.-Russian Federation  Seafood Reciprocity Act. It has a bunch of cosponsors, Democrats and  Republicans. Senator Cantwell is a big, big promoter of this, just for  one example. But let me just give a little bit of background because  people are saying, I am sure: Wait. You have a piece of legislation  that can do all of that?   Yes, I sure do. And why anyone would not support it--well, once they  get educated, they will support it. So let's talk about it just very  briefly.   What is the background here? I am going to go way back, almost 10  years. So the Russians invade Crimea. You have an aggressive dictator,  Vladimir Putin, trying to invade everybody, right? We have to make sure  he doesn't win in Ukraine. The Obama administration smacks them with  sanctions, OK? I wasn't here then, but that is what happened. This was  in 2014. But I supported that. Then the Russians retaliated.   Now, one of the things they did when they retaliated was that they  said: We are going to ban the importation of all American seafood into  Russia. Now, Russia has a big seafood market, OK? So Russia said that  no American seafood can come into Russia.   By the way, my State is the superpower of seafood. The great State of  Alaska is responsible for the harvesting of over two-thirds of all fish  and seafood in America--two-thirds, 66 percent. We are the superpower  of seafood. Now, there are a lot of other great States that export  seafood. I am not sure the great State of Nevada does, but that is a  whole other topic.   So this is really important to my constituents. Tens of thousands of  my great constituents are involved with this. So imagine that. Russia  is still allowed to import in the United States almost duty-free, and  we can't export one fish, OK? That has been the situation since 2014.  Right there, that is just unfair, OK?  [[Page S6074]]    So I tried to work with the Obama administration, with the Trump  administration, and with the Biden administration to fix this--unfair.   By the way, the Russian seafood guys were eating into our fishermen's  market in our own home, in our own U.S. market--not fair.   By the way, American fishermen--Alaskan fishermen--have the highest  standards by far in the world on the environment, on sustainable  fisheries, on the management of fisheries and our oceans--this is  something Senator Whitehouse and I have passed legislation on--and on  workers' rights, OK? They are the highest in the world. It is not even  close. So the highest standards on the planet are right in America, are  right in Alaska. Russia and China--I am going to get to them--have the  lowest in the world, OK? So keep that in mind as we talk about this  issue.   So then it literally takes a war to fix this. Russia brutally invades  Ukraine. The Biden administration is putting together a sanctions  package.   I call the White House and say: Hey, look, how about including in  your sanctions package a way to fix this unfair trade situation where  Russia won't allow us to import one fish, and they can export into the  United States all they want. No way.   So, to his credit, President Biden said--or his team: Hey, I agree  with Senator Sullivan. Let's smack them with sanctions on fish.   So the Biden initial Executive order hitting Russia after they  invaded Ukraine said Russia can't import in the United States. Great. I  have been working on that for 10 years, and it is only fair.   So what happens? Hmm--these sneaky authoritarians--by the way, the  Russian seafood industry is controlled by oligarchs who are literally  taking a lot of that money and funding it for the Putin war machine. So  remember that, my colleagues who might want to object to this later.  Money is going to fund the Putin war machine from fisheries, OK? That  is a fact.   So, anyway, the little, sneaky authoritarian regimes--Putin and Xi  Jinping--are working together, and they are like: Hey, let's avoid  those American sanctions. We will take the Russian seafood caught by  Russian fishermen in Russian waters, and we will send it to China, and  we will have slave labor in China transform it, and then we will send  it to the United States. We will sneak around those sanctions--a big  loophole--using slave labor.    So that is what they are doing right now. They are doing it every day  by the hundreds of millions of dollars, if not in the billions. They  are avoiding these sanctions by saying: Let's take the Russians'  seafood, with the worst environmental standards in the world, and we  will send it to China. We will use slave labor by the Uighurs to  transform it, and we will call it Chinese fish. Then we will send it  into the American market.   That is happening right now--right now. So my legislation is simple.  It closes the loophole.   By the way, it is a really good idea because word is getting out that  the Chinese fishing industry is a disaster. They take these big fleets.  They go all over the world. They ravage the high seas. They ravage  fisheries wherever they go. They are like--what is a good analogy? I  don't know--rats in the water, right? They destroy the high seas  fisheries. They go off the coasts of smaller countries in South America  and Africa that don't have coast guards and can't enforce anything.  They are literally like the abuser of the ocean and the world--China,  OK?   Then they use slave labor. How do I know? Because there has been  article after article just in the last several weeks.   POLITICO did a great article that I would like to submit for the  Record after my remarks. This one is called--it is in POLITICO  Magazine--``How Uyghur Forced Labor Makes Seafood That Ends Up in  [American] School Lunches.''   This article can be found online at https://www.politico.com/news/ magazine/2023/11/21/chinese-forced-labor-seafood-00126642.   Madam President, the New Yorker has done great work on this. One was  titled ``The Crimes Behind the Seafood You Eat,'' from the New Yorker:  ``Americans know little about how their seafood is sourced. Much of it  comes from a vast fleet of Chinese ships. On board, human-rights abuses  are rampant.''   This article can be found online at https://www.newyorker.com/ magazine/2023/10/16/the-crimes-behind-the-seafood-you-eat.   Madam President, then there is another one from the New Yorker: ``The  Uyghurs Forced to Process the World's Fish,'' OK? Slave labor.   You know the Chinese--they try to dominate everything. They are  trying to dominate the fishing industry at the expense of my  fishermen--unfair practices.   ``The Uyghurs Forced to Process the World's Fish.'' This is from the  New Yorker in October of this year. The subheading is ``China forces  minorities from Xinjiang [Province] to work in industries around the  country. As it turns out, this includes handling much of the seafood  sent to America and Europe.''   This article can be found online at https://www.newyorker.com/news/ news-desk/the-uyghurs-forced-to-process-the-worlds-fish.   Madam President, this is what is going on.   Now, look, there are always a few companies out there, including in  our great Nation--and I am not besmirching them or anything, but you  know, they kind of whine. And, remember, this happened at the beginning  of the Ukraine war. You might remember that a lot of us, Democrats and  Republicans, were like: Hey, let's make sure we stop the Russian war  machine because right now America is importing a lot of Russian oil,  OK? And the Europeans and the Germans in particular were saying: And we  are importing a lot of Russian gas. So some of us were like: Well, hey,  we are going to cut that off. Let's cut that off. Let's nail them.   You might remember, at the beginning of the war, people were saying-- even in this country--and the Biden administration folks: Well, we  can't really cut off Russian oil. You know, that will hurt the American  economy. What about those importers of Russian oil in America? Those  refineries that use Russian oil? What about those guys?   With the Germans, it was the same thing: Well, we can't really cut  off the importation of Russian gas because, well, shoot, we use it.   Now, not a lot of people were buying those arguments. I certainly  wasn't. The way we got around those arguments was: Well, wait a minute.  We know that it is going to be a little painful, but here is an idea.  Let's not import Russian oil. Let's use American oil. Let's use more  oil from Alaska. We have way higher environmental standards and way  higher worker standards. And you Germans, don't import Russian gas.  Don't fund the Putin war machine. We will send you LNG from America.   So the Germans, the Biden administration, and everyone was like: That  is a good idea.   So what did we do? We cut off Russian oil. In Europe, they cut off  Russian gas. That is hurting those guys. That is good.   And what did we do? We said: Let's fill it up with American oil and  gas.   So why am I using that as an analogy? Because we have a couple of  companies--look, I get it, but, as I said when I debated it with  Senator Markey a couple of months ago, it is not a good business model,  America and American fish importers. Trust me. It is not a good  business model to be using slave-labor Uighur seafood from China. At a  certain point, Captain D's--you are one of the companies--it is going  to catch up with you. It is going to catch up with you. It is not a  good business model to be helping fund the Putin war machine.   I know there are a few companies out there saying: Oh, we don't like  the Sullivan bill. Shoot.   Really? So what is the answer? It is the same answer: We have great  American fishermen who can make sure you guys--Captain D's or whoever  else, I guess some in Virginia--you get fish. Don't worry. By the way,  it is a much higher standard.   I just learned today that a lot of the Russian fish sent to China  gets injected with 40 percent phosphates and water to plump it up, to  make it look more plump. That is disgusting. Then it gets sent to  America, maybe to Captain D's.  [[Page S6075]]    So my point here is, we are not out to hurt you. We can say: Use  American producers. Use great American fishermen from all over, not  just Alaska--Maine, you know, Virginia, California, Oregon, Washington  State. Use them. Don't block this legislation. Don't be a Putin lackey.  Don't help fund the war machine. Don't help Xi Jinping's forced slave  labor with the Uighurs. Buy American, for goodness' sake. Stand with  American fishermen.   So, when we come back, I am going to work this hard, and for all of  you--and there are not many but a few importers. I hope the NFI is not  doing this either. I hear they are, which would be really bad because  they are supposed to promote the exporters too. That is the National  Fisheries Institute. But what you need to do is not block this. This is  a freight train, right, and it is going to pass. You want to get out of  the way, and you want to help.   Stand with American fishermen. Let us in Alaska supply your company.  Don't rely on slave-labor China fish. Don't rely on authoritarian  aggression, Putin-backed seafood from Russia with low environmental  standards.   By the way, they are flooding the markets globally because they are  worried, and they are hurting fishermen in America, for sure. My  fishermen and my fishing communities in my State are really hurting  right now. This can help them.   So we have been working on this hard. A lot of my Republican and  Democratic colleagues are 100 percent with me. Like I said, there are a  few importers who are kind of working the halls here, and my answer is:  Come on. Be patriotic. Stand with America. Stand with American  fishermen.   Let's do legislation that can--what did I say at the beginning of my  remarks? Now do you understand?--help defeat slave labor, help the  environment, help strong American fishermen, help workers' rights, and  go after Russian and Chinese abuses in the seafood industry.   It is all over the place. It is only going to grow more widespread in  terms of the knowledge. The American people say: Wait a minute. Do I  want to eat fish that is slave-labor fish, Putin-oligarch fish? No. I  want to buy fish--by the way, the highest standard in the world, by  far. We don't inject 40 percent phosphates into this fish and make it  disgusting. I want to stand with American fishermen and buy seafood  from Americans.   So that is what we are going to do. We are going to close that  loophole. It is a big issue. Thanks for listening. But I sure hope when  we get back that my colleagues will fully support it. I think 99.9  percent of them already do. That is the right answer. It is the right  thing for our country and the right thing for America's fishermen.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am going to end my remarks today on  a high note and a very important one.   It is Wednesday. I like to come down and do what we call the  ``Alaskan of the Week.'' I can see the pages are already kind of  excited, right, because, let's face it, this is the most exciting  speech of the week and certainly the most interesting. So what I like  to do is come down--by the way, I know the press generally likes it  because it is normally a signal that it is the end of the week.  Everybody is going home. This is usually the last speech of the week. I  think this might be the last speech of the year this year.   What we do with the Alaskan of the Week, we talk a little bit about  what is going on in Alaska--I will get to that--and then I like to  highlight someone who is doing something great for my State. It might  be, you know, someone local. Our first Alaskan of the Week, I think,  was a librarian who had been a librarian for 40 years--amazing woman-- and then we have superstar world athletes, gold medalists in swimming,  and things like that. So we just cover the whole gamut.   Now, usually there is a poster board. I made this a very special  Alaskan of the Week poster board. This might be the first time ever it  has got Santa on it, and you are going to see why--a Santa-oriented  speech.   So, of course, right now, I am getting ready to head home in a couple  of hours. I was just home over the weekend. There are no worries in  Alaska right now about a white Christmas. Anchorage, my hometown, I  think we have had close to 100 inches of snow already. Look, for us,  that is a lot. I am talking about November, right. So we have a white  Christmas coming, for sure.   It is magical, of course, in Alaska. We have got reindeer. We have  got one that actually lives in downtown Anchorage. We have visitors  coming. We have got a great town called North Pole, AK--North Pole,  AK--and we have the Santa Claus House in North Pole, where Santa lives.  By the way, this is true. This is what my Alaskan of the Week speech is  all about.   If you write a letter to Santa addressed to the North Pole, your  letter will end up at the Santa Claus House in North Pole, AK. Why  wouldn't it?   By the way, this house is not to be confused with the abode of a  North Pole city council member. North Pole, AK, is a city a little bit  north of Fairbanks. This city council member, by the way, his name is  Santa Claus. His legal name is Santa Claus. He is a member of the city  council. I know him well. Look, I am not ripping him. He is a Bernie  Sanders Socialist, true. Now, why wouldn't he be? You know, the guy  gives out free gifts to everybody. That is true. He is a good guy.   So, Santa, if you are watching, hello--Santa Claus, city council  member, North Pole.   But in all seriousness, Interior Alaska--this is in the interior part  of our State--has the greatest, most kind people and generous. And in  keeping with the spirit of Christmas, our Alaskan of the Week is the  Miller family who is the owner of Santa Claus House in North Pole, AK,  which has been a fixture in our State--and really for the country--for  over 70 years--70 years. The Miller family founded Santa Claus House  and has been running it for 70 years, making North Pole, AK, literally  what it is today. They built the whole community.   Let me help you get into the holiday spirit by describing just how  magical the Santa Claus House in North Pole, AK, really is. If you  drive down Saint Nicholas Drive--I am not kidding--by St. Nicholas  Catholic Church, by the way, you will see a huge house lined with red  trim and murals of a reindeer and Santa's sleigh. Just outside is a  barn with a real reindeer, a massive, decked-out Christmas tree, and a  42-foot-tall Santa Claus statue welcoming you to Santa's workshop.   The magic does not end there. Inside the house, you are greeted by a  Christmas tree decorated with every ornament you can imagine, a live  countdown to Christmas Day--of course. Why wouldn't there be one every  day of the year--and a professional Santa Claus ready to hear every  Christmas wish from the thousands of visitors--and I am not just  talking Alaskans but Americans, people from all over the world who  visit Santa Claus House in North Pole, AK, every year. And you are also  likely to meet and see several members of the extended Miller family  working to make the Santa Claus House the winter wonderland it is. They  have been doing it for four generations, keeping the spirit of  Christmas alive.   Let me take you back four generations to the original founder of  Santa Claus House. That is Con and Nellie Miller. Born in 1913, Con and  his mother just didn't see eye to eye. They decided that it was best  that he join the Navy.   He joined when he was 15--a little young. This is just in the great  Alaska spirit. You know, I have talked about it a lot over the years.  We have more veterans per capita than any State in the country, so  being in the military and a veteran is very normal in Alaska. It is a  great part of our culture.    This young guy Con left Colorado and spent 3 years in the Navy,  starting at the age of 15. How he got in, I have no idea. He was on a  gun boat in China. Then he got out. Then Pearl Harbor happened. And of  course he is a patriot so he rejoined the Navy. He fought in the South  Pacific during the Second World War--so a great American, ``greatest  generation'' individual, Con Miller.   After the war ended, Con and his wife Nellie ended up in Fairbanks  with the goal of running a clothing store. To supplement their income,  Con sold  [[Page S6076]]  clothes in the surrounding rural villages, often donning a red Santa  suit each Christmas. He quickly earned celebrity status as the local  Santa Claus in Interior Alaska--the first that many children had ever  seen--ever--in rural Alaska.   In 1952, the Millers built a trading post 13 miles south--sorry, if I  said north--south of Fairbanks in the newly named North Pole, AK. So  just a little south of Fairbanks, the big city in the interior. One  day, while working hard at his new store, a young Alaskan boy  recognized Con and asked: Well, hello, Santa. Are you building a new  house? The inspiration clicked, and Con thought, Hey, why not? Let's do  this. And so the Santa Claus House was born.   In addition to purchasing groceries, locals could mingle at the soda  fountain and pick up their daily mail at the Santa Claus House under  the direction of the post mistress, Nellie Miller--Con's, a.k.a.  Santa's, wife. It was a mail contract station that served North Pole's  first post office for almost 20 years. So there you have it, North  Pole, AK, became a post office for America.   The Miller family lived above the store and was essential to its  operation. All three kids: Terry, Mike, and Merry--yes, Merry  Christmas, spelled M-E-R-R-Y, not M-A-R-Y--worked alongside their  parents. Despite their insight behind the scenes as employees, current  owner and manager Mike said they believed in Santa as much as anyone  else. Of course, they did. Everybody believes in Santa.   As North Pole grew--it is growing; it is a great community, like I  said, just a few miles outside of Fairbanks--the Santa Claus House grew  with it. Inside the store's emphasis on Christmas delights slowly  replaced the aisles of canned goods. Meanwhile, the Miller family  established themselves as pillars of the North Pole community--not only  North Pole but all of Interior Alaska.   Con Miller served as the mayor of North Pole for 19 years--the city's  longest serving mayor--while Nellie Miller acted as a marriage  commissioner for the community. Back then, that was a real job, a  marriage commissioner.   Eventually, both of their sons, Terry and Mike, also found politics.  The late Terry Miller was a State legislator. He was president of the  State senate and was elected to be our Lieutenant Governor in 1978.  Mike, who was helping around the Santa Claus House, also served in the  legislature as senate president from 1983 to 2001. This is a dominating  political family in Alaska, two State senate presidents.   I knew the Millers. They are a great, great family. Both Miller  brothers, very highly respected across the aisle. This is, and was, and  has been a great family committed to public service.   Begun over 70 years ago by Con and Nellie Miller, the Santa Claus  House continues as following generations of Millers keep up that  Christmas spirit and keep it thriving in North Pole, AK. It is still a  family-run business.   Mike Miller is looking forward to the next generation continuing to  run the family business with his daughter Carissa and son-in-law Paul  and staffed by several grandchildren. Isn't this just a wonderful  story? It really warms your heart as we head into the holiday season.   We all know Santa's job is a hard one, and it is also no small job  running the Santa Claus House for the world. In addition to the family,  there are between 40 and 60 employees year-round working there.   Besides being a delightful tourist attraction worldwide, the Santa  Claus House understands the true meaning of Christmas and uses its name  recognition for good works in the community, organizing food drives for  the Fairbanks Food Bank that is used throughout Interior Alaska and  many other charities.   Mike said: I think we have really worked hard to bring the spirit of  Santa to our community, ``the spirit of giving and family and caring  about one another. I hope we have done a small slice [in this service]  of helping people to realize that Christmas is about caring about one  another, giving, and [about] being good neighbors.''   That is Mike Miller.   They have done that in a huge way. They have done more than give a  small slice. For the past 70 years, they have given their all toward  spreading the magic, the wonder, and the joy of Christmas to Alaskans,  to Americans, to people all over the world.   So thank you to the Miller family and to the incredible institution  of the Santa Claus House in North Pole for making our State a more  jolly place, a more generous place, a more caring place, and for  keeping the spirit of Christmas alive--not just now during the holidays  but year-round in the great State of Alaska.   And, of course, to the Millers and Santa Claus House, congratulations  on being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:30 p.m., recessed subject  to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 6:11 p.m. when called to  order by the Presiding Officer (Ms. Butler).                        MORNING BUSINESS--Continued
