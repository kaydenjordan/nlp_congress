 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, I had the honor to meet  with Prime Minister Johnson of the United Kingdom, and later today, I  will meet  [[Page S6597]]  with Prime Minister Morrison of Australia as well. Any day Congress has  the opportunity to strengthen working relationships with two of our  Nation's closest friends and allies is a good day indeed.   Our meetings today come at a time when our most important trans- Atlantic and trans-Pacific alliances are facing growing threats to  collective security and to prosperity.   In the face of Russia's meddling, China's expansionism, a reinflamed  War on Terror, and further threats to democracy and human rights around  the world, the steady leadership of committed partners is more crucial  than ever. So I specifically wanted to thank our friends in Australia  and the United Kingdom for their years of loyal friendship that have  underpinned coalition operations in Afghanistan and our joint efforts  elsewhere to check the most pressing threats to our nations and to the  kind of world that will help us thrive.   I will be reaffirming my own commitment that America must be the  reliable, committed, and globally engaged ally that our closest friends  deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, over the past  several months, American families have had to contend with a historic  amount of painful, painful inflation. This summer, we saw the prices  for core personal consumption soar at the fastest pace in nearly 30  years. Last month, the Producer Price Index notched its steepest year- on-year jump in more than a decade. All across the country, across the  economy, families and businesses are being hit hard.   One measure of construction materials is reporting that homebuilders  are facing materials costs that are 22 percent higher than just last  year--22 percent higher than just last year. Homeowners and renters are  approaching a fall and winter in which heating costs are projected to  reach a 13-year high. Eighty-six percent of respondents told one recent  poll they were either ``extremely'' or ``very worried'' about  inflation.   Now, this is exactly what Republicans, independent experts, and even  liberal economists warned would happen if Democrats started ramming  through massive, massive inflationary spending. Back in the springtime,  Larry Summers, the top economic adviser to both President Clinton and  President Obama, warned at the time that runaway spending could ``set  off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a  generation.'' And, of course, that is exactly what has happened.   Well, just ask any working family in this country about their last  trip to the gas station, the grocery store, or the car dealership.  Inflation has gotten so bad on Democrats' watch that it has wiped out  every ounce of the average American worker's pay growth during this  economic recovery and then some. Annual real wage growth is negative  even though employers have been handing out raises because--because--of  inflation.   Remember, at the start of the year, working Americans had an economy  that was teed up for a roaring recovery. So when Washington Democrats  rolled out their first springtime spending spree, even the Washington  Post cautioned that ``the improving picture is raising questions about  whether the stimulus bill is mismatched to the needs of the current  moment.'' That was the Washington Post on the so-called rescue package  that passed back in March.   You might think that the disastrous consequences of Democrats' last  spending binge for working Americans might give our colleagues some  pause about the next one, but, alas, no such luck. Behind closed doors,  they are putting together another, even more reckless taxing-and- spending spree. They want to take the last bill, which Democrats called  the most leftwing law in American history, and actually dwarf even  that.   Massive tax hikes on Americans that will hurt families and help  China. Let me say that again. Massive tax hikes on Americans that will  hurt families and help China. A socialist transformation that nobody  voted for last year. Another invitation for even more painful inflation  that will hit working Americans right where it hurts. The American  people don't want it, and Senate Republicans won't support it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a related matter, yesterday  evening, Senator Shelby and I introduced a continuing resolution that  could pass the Senate and prevent a government shutdown. Our  legislation would fund the government through December. It would  restore the defensive assistance for our ally Israel that House  Democrats stripped out to appease some of the worst elements of the far  left.   As one frustrated Democratic Congressman stated yesterday, ``A  missile defense system [like] Iron Dome defends civilians from  missiles. Hence the name. Only in a morally inverted universe would  this be considered a `controversy.' '' That is a House Democrat  describing the action yesterday of House Democrats.   Our bill also removes the debt limit language that Democrats have  known since July--since July--will not receive bipartisan support from  Senate Republicans. As one of my colleagues put it succinctly, if  Washington Democrats want to jam through trillions of dollars in  reckless spending all by themselves, they can raise the debt limit all  by themselves. If they want to do one, they will need to do the other.  To do one, if they need to do one, they will do the other. It is that  simple.                            ____________________     Now, one final matter. The American people are  watching a terrible sight unfold down on our southern border. Many  thousands of people, largely from Haiti, are literally huddled together  underneath a bridge in Del Rio, TX, just across the Rio Grande.  Temperatures have been in the triple digits. The conditions are  unsanitary and inhumane.   This nightmare is the direct result of the leftwing policies and  leftwing messages pushed by the Biden administration. They say their  approach to immigration is the compassionate path, the one that  reflects the soul of America. They are wrong. In no way does it honor  America's soul or uphold American values to tolerate a major border  security crisis and unending--unending--humanitarian disaster that  appear to be permanent features of life under the Biden administration.   This false choice is the constant refrain from the left. Either we  adopt Democratic policies that lure people into literal squalor and  effectively open our borders in the middle of a pandemic or else we are  somehow betraying the spirit of the Statue of Liberty? That is simply  nonsense.   Legal, orderly immigration has been a proud strength of our country  and a core pillar of the American way of life literally for  generations. That is completely different than Washington Democrats  sabotaging our border while publicly advertising a catalog--a catalog-- of socialist benefits they say they will provide for illegal immigrants  who manage to make it in.   When President Biden was sworn in, thousands and thousands of people  took his far-left campaign rhetoric seriously and began streaming  toward our borders. One person at the border directly told the  Washington Post they came because they heard ``President Biden was  letting people in.''   First, in the springtime, his administration called this a seasonal  surge. Well, so much for that. We have had more than 150,000 border  apprehensions every single month for the past 6 months. Encounters  usually fall off during the hot summer months, but on President Biden's  watch, the opposite has happened.   Listen to one recent example of the chaos. A few days ago, the Biden  administration filled a big bus with illegal immigrants from this  encampment. The bus set out for somewhere else in Texas. But according  to news reporting, partway through the journey, the illegal immigrants  on board revolted, took control of the bus, and broke out. But more  broadly, it sounds like catch-and-release may be the de facto Biden  policy.   Just this morning, the Associated Press reports that according to  government officials, ``Haitian migrants camped in a . . . Texas border  town are being released in the United States . . . on a very, very  large scale . . . undercutting the Biden administration's  [[Page S6598]]  public statements that the thousands in the camp faced immediate  expulsion.''   Nobody believes Democrats that this lawlessness, chaos, and human  suffering is the fair and compassionate way to govern our country.  Nobody buys that. An average of recent surveys shows that only 36  percent--36 percent--of the country approves of President Biden's  handling of immigration, while 56 percent disapprove.   Look, Americans know a train wreck when they see one. Our citizens  deserve better than this failure--utter failure--of leadership, and so  do the people Democrats are luring here with a mirage.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
