 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for this  opportunity to speak about title 42.   Mr. Speaker, in the last 14 months, this administration and its open- door policies have created the worst border crisis we have seen in  decades, leaving our southern border very vulnerable to the dangerous  cartels and our communities are vulnerable to the lethal drugs that  they bring in.   Every day, 2,000 migrants evade capture and illegally enter our  country. That is over 300,000 illegal immigrants evading capture in the  last 6 months alone. Unfortunately, our Border Patrol warns us that  this is only the known gotaways, and that the real number is likely  much higher.   By the President's own admission, rolling back title 42 would cause a  mass migration event and would certainly overwhelm our already  overworked and undersupported Border Patrol. Not only are Americans  still held to a higher COVID protocol standard than the migrants at our  southern border, but title 42 remains one of the only tools our overrun  agents can use to get this swelling crisis under control.   Ending title 42 won't help President Biden fulfill his State of the  Union promise to secure the southern border, it will only make this  crisis that the administration has created more unsustainable.
