 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Ms. Deborah Hansen  for her service to the people of Florida's Sixth Congressional District  over the last 3 years in my office.   Deborah was born in Salem, Oregon, to her parents, Bill and Fae  Hansen. After graduating high school, Ms. Hansen left Salem to attend  the University of Utah where she received her bachelor's degree in  science and sociology with an emphasis in criminology, social work, and  child welfare.   Upon graduating from the University of Utah, Ms. Hansen began her  steadfast and inspiring career of public service. Deborah devoted over  30 years of work to the juvenile justice programs in Oregon and Utah.  During this time, she also taught criminal justice courses as an  adjunct professor for local community colleges.   While attaining all of her accomplishments, Deborah is most proud of  raising her four beautiful children--Dustin, Dalton, Dain, and Danelle.   Prior to coming to my office, Ms. Hansen served with Representatives  Cresent Hardy from Nevada and Representative Jason Lewis from  Minnesota. In 2019, I was fortunate enough to have Deborah join my team  as my office manager.   She quickly proved herself to be an invaluable asset, overseeing  multiple meetings, the many requests we received, managing the daily  operations of my Washington, D.C., office, and most importantly,  keeping a freshman Member of Congress on track--no easy task, for sure.   Not only did she keep all of us in line, but Deborah also brought a  great spirit to our office. She always brought in baked goods to share,  had a new story to tell--whether it be a memory of her time on the West  Coast, the latest adventures of her grandchildren, or about some  mischief her new puppy, Tucker, had managed to get himself into--we  were all ears.   Deborah is diligent; she is talented, hardworking, but above all, she  is kind. And while I am sad to see her leave, I can say without a  doubt, she has made both our office and our country a better place.   We wish Deborah a happy and hopefully, very relaxing retirement in  the country filled with quality time with her four children, 13  grandchildren, and her favorite puppy, Tucker. However, I know this is  not the end of Deborah's public service but the start of a new  adventure in service to her community.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues and the United States House of  Representatives to join me in commending Ms. Deborah Hansen for her  lifelong career of servant leadership. From the bottom of our hearts,  we wish Deborah the best as she embarks on this next chapter in her  life.                            ____________________
