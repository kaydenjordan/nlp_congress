 Mr. President, I want to begin today talking about the  debt limit by returning to three very frightening statistics.   The first is $15 trillion. That is the amount of household wealth  that a leading economist recently warned could be wiped out of the  economy should the government default on its debt.   The second is 6 million. That is the number of jobs that the same  analysis said could be lost should a default become a reality.   The third statistic is 9 percent. That is the unemployment rate our  country potentially faces if we don't do our jobs to raise the debt  ceiling.   Now, none of these statistics, none of these numbers need become a  reality if both parties unite in the coming days to pass the continuing  resolution sent to us by the House. It would keep the government open  for 3 months. It would provide funding for disaster relief and Afghan  refugees. And, of course, it would suspend the debt ceiling until the  end of 2022 so we can pay for the debt incurred at the end of the  previous administration.   Every single Member of this Chamber is going to go on record as to  whether they support keeping the government open and averting a default  or support shutting us down and careening our country toward a first- ever default.   Democrats will be united in supporting the passage of the CR. It is  the right thing to do for the American people, and it would immediately  stop these unnecessary crises that are knocking at our doorstep.   At the end of the day, the only thing that matters in a legislative  body is how you vote. That is the most important thing we do. There are  many other important things, but that is the one that matters the most.  It is what our constituents sent us here to do.   Now, Senate Democrats have said repeatedly that they are all for  avoiding a government shutdown. They have said repeatedly that the debt  ceiling must be raised.   So I want to offer a novel suggestion: If Republicans want to avoid  default, then they should vote yes. If the Republicans want to keep the  government open, they should vote yes.   But, incredibly, Leader McConnell, spinning a tail--a web of  subterfuge, deception, and outright contradictions--has said that he is  going to vote no, and he urges Republicans to vote no.   This is ``Alice in Wonderland'' logic. Republicans claim to oppose a  default, but they are saying they are going to vote for one anyway.  They say they oppose a government shutdown, but they are going to vote  for one anyway. They say they want disaster relief, but they say they  are going to oppose it when the time comes.   So they can resort to all the sophistry they want, but if they vote  no, the Republican Party will be solidifying itself as the party of  default, and the American people, unfortunately, will be the ones  footing the bill--a high cost to pay for Republican games, political  games.   By voting to default, the Republicans would be telling the American  people they are fine if people don't get their Social Security checks.  They are saying they don't care if our veterans are denied benefits.  They are saying they don't care if the markets come crashing down,  hurting people's pensions and IRAs.  [[Page S6632]]    Now, none of this is an exaggeration. Economist Mark Zandi, a former  adviser to the late Senator McCain, wrote recently that a default would  be ``a catastrophic blow to the nascent economic recovery from the  COVID-19 pandemic.''   He also warned that ``Americans would pay for this default for  generations.'' I hope my Republican colleagues heard the last part, as  they are thinking of indulging in the political game put forward by  Leader McConnell. ``Americans would pay for this default for  generations.''   Of course, we all know by now that the Republican justifications for  opposing raising the debt ceiling are entirely bunk. They say they are  opposed to new spending, but the Wall Street Journal has said:  ``Raising the debt limit wouldn't facilitate future spending, and  Congress would still need to raise the debt limit this fall even if no  new major spending programs are enacted.''   Do you hear that, Republicans? This is the Wall Street Journal. Even  if not a single new spending program were enacted, we would still have  to raise the debt that was incurred by President Trump and by all of  your votes.   How crass can you be? How heartless can you be? You voted to spend  these moneys because of COVID--it was a valid reason--and now you don't  want to pay for it, and you come up with some lame political sophistry,  trying to justify it. But everyone sees through that--everyone.   The truth is, we will be voting to pay for the debt accrued under  Presidents of both parties, including the $8 trillion added to the debt  under President Trump. Both sides incurred the debt; both sides should  pay.   It wasn't long ago that threatening a default on national debt was  something you only heard in the fringes of the Republican Party. About  10 years ago, the Republican Speaker at the time called the idea  ``insanity.''   But today, it is literally the party line--a sad commentary on just  how far down the rabbit hole the Republican Party has gone.   If my Republican colleagues disagree, they have a simple option: They  can vote yes to keep the government open. They can vote yes on  suspending the debt limit. It is in their hands.   But if Republican votes favor a shutdown and default, the American  people will see exactly who is responsible for throwing our country  into crisis.    Mr. President, first, let me say thank you to the few  remaining colleagues, but everyone else also, for staying here late  into the evening as we continue to confirm these important nominees to  the Biden administration.   Now, in a few moments, I will be filing cloture on the continuing  resolution that was passed by the House of Representatives this week.  The resolution is the answer for avoiding numerous fast-approaching  crises on the horizon, including an unnecessary government shutdown and  a first-ever default on our country's sovereign debt.   Members should be advised the cloture vote will take place this  coming Monday. Every single Member in this Chamber is going on record  as to whether they support keeping the government open and averting a  default or support shutting us down and careening our country toward a  default.   At the end of the day, frankly, the only thing that matters in the  legislative body is how you vote. It is what our constituents sent us  here to do.   Now, our Republican colleagues say they don't want a shutdown. They  say they don't want a credit default. They say they want hurricane aid.  Then the answer is simple. Just vote yes on this bill, and it will all  get done.   But if Republicans vote no, as many of them are saying they will, the  Republican Party will solidify itself as the party of default--the  party of default. They will endanger every single American in this  country, including those who rely on Social Security and Medicare  benefits. They will hurt small businesses, pensioners, and our  veterans.   If my Republican colleagues want to help the American people avoid  calamity, they can vote yes to keep the government open. They can vote  yes on suspending the debt limit. It is in their hands.   But come Monday, if Republicans vote in favor of a shutdown and  default, the American people will see exactly who is responsible for  throwing our country in crisis. There will be the President requesting  this bill, the House having passed the bill, the majority putting this  bill on the floor, and then the Republicans blocking it. Who is  responsible for the default?                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.
