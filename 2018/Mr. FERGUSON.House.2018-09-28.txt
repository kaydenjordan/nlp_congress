 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the bravery of the  LaGrange Fire Department.   In the early hours on the morning of Labor Day, the department  received a call for a house fire. As firefighters battled the blaze,  the flames were so hot that their fire hose melted in two.   Firefighters were trapped in the house. Luckily, everyone made it  out. But six of those firefighters suffered severe burns and injuries:  Pete Trujillo, Jordan Avera, Jonathan Williamson, Josh Williams, Jim  Ormsby, and Sean Guerrero. All are on the mend, but they suffered very,  very severe injuries.   These brave men and women put their lives on the line every single  day to keep our loved ones safe in an emergency with no expectation of  recognition for their heroism. But today, I would like us all to pause  and think about the tough work that they do and the danger that they  put their lives in. I would like us all to thank them and extend our  deepest gratitude to these firefighters and all of those around the  Nation.                            ____________________
