 Mr. Speaker, I am so glad our friends have  changed their mantra from ``stop the steal'' to ``start to heal.''   But in order to heal, you have to take strong medicine, and that  medicine happens to be the truth. My friends, the truth is,  unfortunately, this President is no longer fit to serve.   We cannot trust this President to protect American democracy after he  encouraged his supporters ``fight like hell'' in storming the Capitol.   We cannot trust him to protect American safety after he told these  violent seditionists, ``We love you. You are very special.''   We cannot trust this President to tell right from wrong even today  when he said that his remarks on January 6 were ``totally  appropriate.''   Mr. Speaker, we cannot trust this President to protect us when he  instigated a mob that tried to kill us.                                time  2215
