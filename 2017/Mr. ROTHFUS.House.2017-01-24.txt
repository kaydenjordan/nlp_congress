 Madam Speaker, I rise to support this rule and the  underlying bill, H.R. 7.  [[Page H626]]    For decades, Congress has annually passed the Hyde amendment, which  has prevented any government program from funding or subsidizing  elective abortion. The Hyde amendment has saved over 2 million unborn  children since 1976, including 100,000 lives in Pennsylvania.   For decades, this annual restriction on taxpayer funding of abortion  has been referred to as the Hyde amendment because it was the late  Congressman Henry Hyde from Illinois who sought to protect as many  unborn children as he could during his service in Congress.  Recollecting his own work, Congressman Hyde offered this poignant  reflection:   ``When the time comes as it surely will, when we face that awesome  moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as Fulton Sheen wrote,  that it is a terrible moment of loneliness. You have no advocates, you  are there alone standing before God--and a terror will rip through your  soul like nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the  pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there will be a chorus of  voices that have never been heard in this world but are heard  beautifully and clearly in the next world--and they will plead for  everyone who has been in this movement. They will say to God, `Spare  him because he loved us'. . . . ''   Henry Hyde is not forgotten, and this work goes on.   Despite former-President Obama's promise that no abortion would be  covered by his healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act authorized and  appropriated funds for healthcare plans with abortion coverage. This  must stop.   We must remember, abortion is not health care, and in no way should  the government fund or subsidize the violent destruction of unborn  children.   It is the overwhelming opinion of Americans, including those who  identify as pro-choice, that taxpayer dollars should not be used for  abortion. This legislation is absolutely essential to apply the  principles of the Hyde amendment consistently across the Federal  Government.   As hundreds of thousands march this Friday on the 44th anniversary of  Roe v. Wade, a decision Justice White referred to as an exercise in raw  judicial power, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey, for more than three  decades, has raised these issues in this very Chamber, speaking for  those who are defenseless and voiceless. He speaks because he speaks  truth and is motivated by his conscience to discuss these truths.   Every year since 1973, we have had a March for Life here in  Washington. This year, we have the 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. It  is one of the gravest examples of judicial activism in our Nation's  history. Seven black-robed Justices decided that the lives of unborn  children are not protected under the Constitution in what Justice White  referred to as an exercise in raw judicial power. In the last 44 years,  60 million children have died in abortion.   The March for Life draws thousands of people, young and old, Democrat  and Republican, from across the Nation year after year from near and  far, on buses, on planes, in cars, on trains, in snow, in rain, in  sunshine, and overcast skies. Why? Why do they continue to come?   They come because they are motivated by the transcendent truth that  was captured in our Declaration of Independence that everyone is  endowed by a Creator with an inalienable right to life--a right that no  one can take away.                                time  1830    Everyone in this Chamber has that right. Everybody listening to this  Special Order debate has that right. You have it today, you had it  yesterday, you had it before you were born. No one has the right to  take that right away.   The right does not depend on your ability to see, your ability to  hear, your ability to walk, your ability to talk. That right exists  because you are human. It is as simple as that. No one can take away  that right.   Those coming to the March for Life this year are coming to share that  witness, but they have also been witnessing back home the countless  acts of service they do for women in crisis pregnancies and to continue  with the help that they provide.   It is a good thing for them to come to Washington. I look forward to  welcoming my constituents from western Pennsylvania, and I encourage  them to come and stand and continue to witness until one day we  recognize the right to life for everyone in our country.
