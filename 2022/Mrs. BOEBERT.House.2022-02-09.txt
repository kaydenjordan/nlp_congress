 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of  Montezuma County commissioner, Joel ``Joe'' Stevenson. He will be  remembered as a larger-than-life champion of rural Colorado who never  wavered in his belief that the world needs more cowboys.   He was a rancher, a caring husband, a loving father, and a friend.  Joe was a happy warrior, and his passion with a smile will continue to  inspire me as I serve in Congress and generations to come. Joe devoted  his life to the agriculture community where he served his neighbors as  a brand inspector for the Colorado Department of Agriculture for 20  years.   Mr. Speaker, Joe's life of service has come to an end but his legacy  will live on in Montezuma County and the Colorado agriculture  community; and in his wife, Sheree; and his children, Colette, Chelsi,  Mary Jo, Jodie, and Sam; and in his 7 grandchildren who affectionately  called him ``Papa.''   Mr. Speaker, I take comfort knowing God's wraparound presence is  surrounding Joe's family today and he has entered into the joy of his  Lord. America needs more cowboys like my friend, Joe Stevenson, but I  know that heaven just gained one.                            ____________________
