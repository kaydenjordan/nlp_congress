 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of the  Inflation Reduction Act.   Oh, what a day in America. From lowering prescription drug prices for  seniors, to closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest corporations, to  making the largest investment in clean energy in history to tackle the  climate crisis, the Inflation Reduction Act will help improve the lives  of every single American. It will do it all while paying down the  deficit.   I am particularly proud that the bill includes my climate smart ports  provisions with my colleague, Ms. Barragan, which invests in ports  across the Nation, like the Port of Wilmington, allowing them to  upgrade their facilities, lower their carbon footprint, and create more  good-paying union jobs.   Madam Speaker, in a session of Congress that has already seen  remarkable landmark legislation passed, the Inflation Reduction Act is  the capstone of our efforts to deliver. With this bill, we continue to  put people over politics.
