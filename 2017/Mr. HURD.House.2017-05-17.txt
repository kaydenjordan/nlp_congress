 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2227) to modernize Government information technology, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2227         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing Government       Technology Act of 2017'' or the ``MGT Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) The Federal Government spends nearly 75 percent of its       annual information technology funding on operating and       maintaining existing legacy information technology systems.       These systems can pose operational risks, including rising       costs and inability to meet mission requirements. These       systems also pose security risks, including the inability to       use current security best practices, such as data encryption       and multi-factor authentication, making these systems       particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber activity.        (2) In 2015, the Government Accountability Office (GAO)       designated Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and       Operations to its biannual High Risk List and identified as a       particular concern the increasing level of information       technology spending on operations and maintenance, making       less funding available for development or modernization. The       GAO also found the Government has spent billions on failed       and poorly performing information technology investments due       to a lack of effective oversight.        (3) The Federal Government must modernize Federal IT       systems to mitigate existing operational and security risks.        (4) The efficiencies, cost savings, and greater computing       power offered by modernized solutions, such as cloud       computing, have the potential to--        (A) eliminate inappropriate duplication and reduce costs;        (B) address the critical need for cybersecurity by design;       and        (C) move the Federal Government into a broad, digital-      services delivery model that will transform the ability of       the Federal Government to meet mission requirements and       deliver services to the American people.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:        (1) Assist the Federal Government in modernizing Federal       information technology to mitigate current operational and       security risks.        (2) Incentivize cost savings in Federal information       technology through modernization.        (3) Accelerate the acquisition and deployment of modernized       information technology solutions, such as cloud computing, by       addressing impediments in the areas of funding, development,       and acquisition practices.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2227, the Modernizing  Government Technology Act, or the MGT Act.   Each year, the Federal Government spends over $80 billion a year on  information technology, with nearly 75 percent of that directed just  towards operating and maintaining existing IT systems. Couple this with  innovation and management strategies that are decades behind the  private sector when it comes to IT, and the increasing cost of  maintaining these aging and insecure systems, this is unsustainable.   These systems pose increasing operational and security risks for the  Federal Government, as we saw with the devastating OPM data breach,  which impacted over 20 million people.   As we see cybersecurity attacks on the rise across the globe, it is  imperative that we modernize and protect our information technology  systems. The American people deserve better from their government,  especially on an issue that is completely solvable. Our government  needs to be able to introduce cutting-edge technology into their  networks to improve operational efficiency and decrease operational  cost.   This bipartisan IT reform package is designed to reduce wasteful IT  spending and strengthen information security by accelerating the  Federal Government's transition to modern technology, like cloud  computing. This legislation is an innovative solution and a tremendous  step forward in strengthening our digital infrastructure.   This bill passed the House on voice vote last year and passed out of  the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by voice this year.  Unfortunately, we ran out of time on this bill last Congress with the  Senate, but we have an opportunity to act this year with an improved  bill.   H.R. 2227 authorizes two types of funds to modernize legacy IT and  incentivize IT savings in Federal agencies. The bill authorizes funds  within individual CFO Act agencies, and it authorizes a centralized  fund located within Treasury and overseen by OMB. The two funds will  incentivize IT savings and reward cost-sensitive and responsible chief  information officers.   Under MGT, savings obtained by Federal agencies, by doing things like  streamlining IT systems, replacing legacy products, and transitioning  to cloud computing, can be placed in a working capital fund that can be  accessed for up to 3 years for further modernization efforts.   This approach eliminates the traditional use-it-or-lose-it approach  that has plagued government technology for decades. This approach to  technology investments will transform government technology by keeping  our information and digital infrastructure secure from cyber attacks  while saving billions of taxpayer dollars.   This important bill has enjoyed widespread support from colleagues in  the House and the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly), my friend, for her support on this. I thank the  gentleman from the Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for all he  has done. I especially thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member  Cummings for their support.   The majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and the minority whip, Steny  Hoyer, have been vital to the success of getting this bill moving  forward.   I thank all of the other Members as well who have provided support  and leadership for the MGT Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from a number  of industry and trade groups in support of this bill.                                   Professional Services Council,                                      Arlington, VA, April 27, 2017.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.      Hon. Will Hurd,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Subcommittee on Information Technology, Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Udall,      U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.      Hon. Gerry Connolly,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Subcommittee on Government Operations, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Moran and Udall, Chairman Hurd and Ranking       Member Connolly: On behalf of the over 400 member companies       of the Professional Services Council (PSC), I write to convey       our association's strong support for your legislation, the       Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 (the ``MGT       Act''), and to thank you for your continued leadership to       advance policies that will upgrade the government's legacy IT       systems.        The MGT Act would establish a critical source of dependable       funding for federal agencies to invest in IT system       modernization, incentivize agencies to utilize the funds for       agency priorities, and accelerate the transition to the       cloud.        PSC supports the Act because we believe the bill will help       make government more effective and its networks more secure,       while reducing overall costs. Enactment would be a much-      needed and critical step to begin addressing the immense       challenges associated with upgrading federal information       technology systems and limiting cybersecurity vulnerabilities       inherent in the government's outdated computer systems.        PSC looks forward to working with you to see this       legislation enacted. Thank you for your leadership and       attention to this important issue. If you or your colleagues       have any questions or need additional information, please do       not hesitate to reach out to me.            Yours Respectfully,                                                  David J. Berteau,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                         IT Alliance                                               for Public Sector,                                     Washington, DC, April 28, 2017.

Dear Chairman Hurd and Ranking Member Kelly: On behalf of       the member companies of the Information Technology Alliance       for Public Sector (ITAPS), I am writing to express our strong       support for the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act       of 2017. We appreciate all the time, effort, and commitment       you have dedicated to reforming how the federal government       funds and invests in information technology (IT). This       bipartisan, bicameral legislation would enable new means to       fund IT solutions, including for IT modernization efforts,       and provide  [[Page H4262]]       funding availability to permit government IT to better keep       pace with innovation. We commend your staffs for       collaborating and working with ITAPS and our members.        The time is ripe to transform the way the federal       government acquires IT, and this bipartisan legislation is a       substantial step toward that transformation. The federal       government today spends about $60 billion dollars annually       sustaining their existing IT and their funding streams allow       them to either continue to sustain those systems or       modernize, but they do not have the funding to do both at the       same time. The MGT Act creates the necessary new options for       agencies to be able to sustain what is necessary for their       mission, while investing in modernizing and transforming IT       capabilities in the federal government for the digital era.        Again, thank you for the engagement you and your staff       afforded ITAPS and our members. We look forward to continuing       to work with you further as the bill advances through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                  A.R. ``Trey'' Hodgkins, III, CAE,      Senior Vice President, Public Sector.                                   ____         Adobe applauds Congressman Will Hurd (Texas) for       reintroducing the Modernizing Government Technology Act, H.R.       2227, and urges Congress to move quickly to enact this       important piece of legislation. Modernizing the federal IT       infrastructure is crucial to ensuring a stronger cyber       security foundation. The federal government on average spends       nearly 80 percent of its IT budget on servicing and       maintaining legacy IT systems, drowning out investments in       newer technologies that often deliver better, more secure and       less costly services to citizens.--Adobe VP & Public Sector       Chief Technology Officer John Landwehr                                   ____                                              Amazon Web Services,                                        Herndon, VA, April 28, 2017.      Re Support for H.R. 2227, the Modernizing Government           Technology Act.      Hon. Will Hurd,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Robin Kelly,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Gerry Connolly,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Udall,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Hurd, Congresswoman Kelly, Congressman       Connolly, Senator Udall, and Senator Moran: On behalf of our       customers, we applaud your leadership and commitment to       transforming federal information technology (IT) through the       Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT Act), H.R. 2227.       At Amazon Web Services, we believe in putting our customers       first by giving them the right tools to enable success, and       similarly this bipartisan and bicameral legislation gives our       customers the funding mechanisms they need to move to more       modern and secure federal IT systems and services.        The MGT Act allows agencies to modernize aging and       vulnerable systems and migrate to innovative technologies       such as commercial cloud computing. By giving agencies more       control over IT investments, the bill creates more strategic,       efficient, and common-sense incentives for agency buyers       without compromising transparency and oversight. Flexible       funding mechanisms like the agency working capital funds in       this piece of legislation enable the adoption of the most       secure, cutting-edge commercial technologies that the private       sector has long adopted.        The commitment of both Republican and Democrat members in       both the House and the Senate on the MGT Act and previous       versions of the legislation represents an acknowledgment that       Congress must act to improve and secure federal IT. This bill       gives the federal government the chance to provide better       constituent services that citizens have grown to expect and       deserve.        Again, we applaud the introduction of the MGT Act and urge       Congress to act this year to pass the legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Steve Block,      AWS Public Policy.                                   ____                                                          Brocade,                                                     April 27, 2017.      Re Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017.       Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives.      Hon.Will Hurd,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee           on Oversight and Government Reform, House of           Representatives.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           House of Representatives.      Hon. Robin Kelly,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Information Technology,           Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of           Representatives.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz, Chairman Hurd, Ranking Member       Cummings and Ranking Member Kelly: On behalf of Brocade, I am       writing in support of the Modernizing Government Technology       Act of 2017. This bipartisan bill is an important step       forward to accelerate the modernization of federal IT       networks. The Modernizing Government Technology Act will       provide federal agencies with critical and flexible financing       mechanisms to help break the cycle of federal IT investment       in outdated technologies. By facilitating federal agency IT       modernization, the bills will help agencies improve IT       effectiveness, bolster security, reduce maintenance spending       and better serve citizens, warfighters and veterans.        As an active partner in federal agency network       modernization, Brocade appreciates your leadership in moving       this bill forward this year. Brocade is committed to working       with other stakeholders to achieve the objectives of the       Modernizing Government Technology Act to help agencies       transition to modern networks that leverage open standards,       multivendor networks, and software-based technologies to       achieve their mission.            Sincerely,                                                       Jeff Rangel,      Senior Director, Corporate Affairs.                                   ____                                                  CA Technologies,                                                        May 1, 2017.      Hon. Will Hurd,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee           on Oversight and Government Reform, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Gerald Connolly,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Government Operations,           Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hurd and Ranking Member Connolly: I am       writing to express our support for H.R. 2227, the Modernizing       Government Technology Act of 2017 (MGT Act). This Act will       help address a vital challenge the Federal government faces       in providing better services for its citizens.        According to the Government Accountability Office, the       Federal government spends more than 75 percent of its IT       budget on operations and maintenance, rather than on       expenditures for new technologies. This limits the ability of       the government to provide innovative and efficient services       to citizens and it puts federal IT infrastructure at risk.        The MGT Act will enable agency officials to acquire and       deploy new technologies in ways that will help them provide       better services and cost savings to citizens in a more secure       fashion.        We want to thank you and your staffs for your tireless work       and active engagement with industry on this bill. CA       Technologies looks forward to continuing to work with Members       of the Committees and with House leadership as this bill       moves forward in the legislative process.            With warmest regards,                                                     Brendan Peter,      Vice President, Global Government Relations.                                   ____               [From Ian J. Rayder, Government Affairs, Cisco]         Cisco supports the important goals of the Modernizing       Government Technology Act of 2017, which was introduced with       bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. If       passed, the bill will accelerate a pivot away from outmoded       legacy systems to modernized solutions, which should cut       costs, improve security and boost operational efficiency. The       MGTA can help the federal government change the status quo       where nearly 80% of IT spending is used to maintain aging,       insecure, and expensive legacy federal IT systems. We thank       Information Technology Subcommittee Chairman Hurd, Ranking       Member Kelly, Government Operations Subcommittee Ranking       Member Connolly, and Oversight and Government Reform Chairman       Chaffetz for their leadership on this important issue.                                   ____                                                        Compuware,                                                        May 1, 2017.      Hon. Will Hurd,      Washington, DC.        Congressman Hurd: Compuware, the world's leading mainframe-      dedicated software company, is pleased to see the       introduction of the Modernizing Government Technology Act of       2017. As you know, we are headquartered in Detroit, Michigan       with 99% of our development team onsite. Our innovative       mainframe software assist the world's largest banks,       insurance companies and retail, transportation and government       organizations by enabling them to deliver mainframe-supported       products and services more quickly, cost-effectively and with       a higher level of quality.        A new generation of Federal IT leaders will soon assume       responsibility for guiding the agencies through modernization       efforts that meet citizens' increasingly tech-centric       demands. Having forged their careers in a period of intensive       technological innovation, these leaders are by and large       well-prepared to do so and the MGT Act provides a viable       funding path to support modernization efforts.        We are encouraged that the MGT Act suggests that an IT       modernization plan should pair the right applications with       the right platforms. One of the major platforms being       modernized is the mainframe. The reality is, a large       percentage of the mission-critical applications and systems       that run on the mainframe today will remain there for decades       to come. Organizations and agencies should build on what       works well and continue to leverage the decades of investment       in business rules and intellectual property.  [[Page H4263]]         Mainframe longevity is no accident. No other computing       platform comes close to delivering the performance,       scalability, reliability and security of the post-modern       mainframe. None offers a lower marginal cost. Nor has any       other platform come close to demonstrating a similar ability       to adapt to the changes in the world around it decade after       decade. The correct course of action is to diligently and       smartly leverage a post-modern mainframe for what it does       best.        Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments and we       look forward to providing additional information for the       Committee Report. Compuware is always available to testify.            Sincerely,                                                    Chris O'Malley,      CEO, Compuware.                                   ____                                                             CSRA,                                   Falls Church, VA, April 28, 2017.      Re the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017.       Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.      Hon. Will Hurd,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee           on Oversight and Government Reform.      Hon. Robin Kelly,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Information Technology,           Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.        Congressional Leaders: On behalf of CSRA, I write today to       express my strong support for the Modernizing Government       Technology Act (MGT Act), which is a shining example of       forward-looking leadership from Congress to help move the       government into the 21st century. As one of the leading       providers of next generation technology to the federal       government, CSRA wants to partner in providing solutions that       save taxpayer dollars and facilitate a better customer       experience for our citizens. The MGT Act is a crucial step       forward in creating our shared future of innovation.        Investing in the transformation of aging IT infrastructure,       as the MGT Act will do, will help protect networks currently       vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and make government more       efficient and effective for the American people. We know that       investments like these make highest and best use of the       taxpayer dollar, saving enormous sums of money down the line.       Innovation has long fueled the American economy; technology       can now make possible the achievement of national priorities.        I salute Congressman Will Hurd, Congresswoman Robin Kelly,       Senator Moran, Senator Udall, and the entire bipartisan,       bicameral coalition who have brought us to this moment of       opportunity. We urge the support of the entire Congress for       this legislation, which is a kick-start in creating a       government as dynamic and innovative as America itself.            Sincerely,      Lawrence B. Prior.                                   ____                                                Intel Corporation,                                       Washington, DC, May 16, 2017.      Hon. Will Hurd,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Hurd: Intel Corporation commends your       leadership in enabling the Federal Government to upgrade its       legacy IT Infrastructure through the Modernizing Government       Technology Act of 2017.        Your bill would enable the retirement, replacement, and       modernization of legacy IT that is difficult to secure and       expensive to maintain. This bill would strengthen the       incentives and wherewithal of federal agencies and       organizations to invest prudently in IT, thereby saving money       and increasing the performance of their IT systems.        Intel applauds your bi-partisan, bi-cameral effort aimed at       making our government work better for all citizens by       providing the means to enable it to keep pace with IT       innovation.            Sincerely,      Peter Pitsch,        Executive Director, Federal Relations.

Dear Chairman Hurd and Ranking Member Kelly: On behalf of       Microsoft Corporation, I am writing to congratulate you on       introduction of the Modernizing Government Technology Act of       2017 (H.R. 2227). Microsoft fully understands the promise       modern technology holds for enabling more efficient and       effective results for taxpayers and supports your efforts. We       commend you for including in the bill a fund to support IT       modernization, as it's critically needed by agencies that       need to improve their systems but are unable due to budget       constraints.        Microsoft also applauds you for working with the White       House Office of American Innovation on this legislation.       Having strong bipartisan, bicameral partners, combined with       Executive Branch support, demonstrates your commitment to       improve the federal information technology procurement       process.        We look forward to working with you and your bipartisan       colleagues in the House and Senate as the bill moves through       the legislative process.

Hon. Will Hurd,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Robin Kelly,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Hurd and Kelly: On behalf of the       Unisys Corporation, thank you for introducing the Modernizing       Government Technology Act of 2017 (MGT Act). Unisys strongly       supports enactment of the MGT Act because it provides needed       flexibility and funding resources to enable the Federal       Government to modernize its legacy IT systems and leverage       government-wide resources to gain efficiencies.        As a global information technology company that provides       leading edge security solutions to the government and       commercial markets, Unisys recognizes that one of the major       challenges facing clients is how to fund modernization       investments while maintaining existing mission critical IT       systems. The MGT Act addresses this challenge by authorizing       new modernization funding mechanisms for Federal agencies       that will allow them to build in cyber security by design,       effectively share government data, create long-term savings       and eliminate duplication.        Thank you again for introducing this much needed       legislation.            Sincerely,                                              Venkatapathi Puvvada,      President, Federal Systems.                                   ____                     Level 3 Statement on MGT Act of 2017         Today, Representatives Will Hurd (R-TX), Robin Kelly (D-IL)       and Gerry Connolly (D-VA), and Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS)       and Tom Udall (D-NM), introduced the Modernizing Government       Technology Act of 2017 to provide federal agencies additional       resources and flexibility to modernize outdated information       technology systems. Below is a statement from Level 3       Communications:        ``Level 3 Communications applauds Representatives Hurd,       Kelly and Connolly, and Senators Moran and Udall, for       championing federal IT reform and their commitment to       maximizing the value of taxpayer dollars by transforming how       the government invests in technology. Level 3 stands ready to       continue our collaboration with federal agencies to transform       their networks to improve efficiency, reduce costs and       maximize security.''     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from the Commonwealth of  Virginia has a few more speakers, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority  leader.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before the minority whip departs, I want  to thank him for his work on this. This has really been a bipartisan  effort, and it is really putting the country first. The gentleman is  correct: This might not make headlines, but this will have a greater  effect on our government being more efficient, effective, and  accountable. We thank him for his work on it.   Mr. Speaker, there are some things we get used to hearing, but when  you think about it, it is amazing just how much things have changed.   I hear a friend say that all of the photos he took on his phone  automatically updated to his cloud--not surprising there. But how long  ago was it that we couldn't even take pictures on our phone, much less  have them saved automatically on a cloud?   Nowadays, it is not uncommon to cash your checks online, manage your  accounts on Mint, pay individuals back online. Many millennials don't  even carry cash anymore. That is a revolution in money management that  just happened in a matter of years.   So, Mr. Speaker, why in the world would the Department of Defense use  a 54-year-old system as a backup to send and receive emergency messages  for our nuclear forces, a 54-year-old system that relies on floppy  disks? Why would the master file of the public's taxes at the IRS run  on a 1950s code?   Eighty percent of the $80 billion we spend each year on IT is used to  maintain legacy systems, to buy expensive parts that nobody uses  anymore for a 54-year-old system we shouldn't even have.   We would expect more from the private sector. We would expect mobile  cameras, cloud computing, online banking. Heck, we would even expect to  upgrade our phones and apps and  [[Page H4265]]  technology on a rolling basis every single week. Well, why should we  expect less from the Federal Government?   I would say this is about more than expectations. We all saw what  happened over the weekend with the massive global cyber attack:  hospitals shut down, transportation systems. This is a government  service issue. It is a government waste issue. It is a national  security issue.   Now, government may never be like Silicon Valley, but it should not  be stuck in the age of ``Mad Men.'' That is not only costly, it is  dangerous.   Will Hurd, an individual that has served his Nation in some of the  most dangerous parts of the world, an individual who worked in the  private sector when it came to technology, an individual who serves in  this body and, I will say this based upon everybody else I have served,  probably has the most bipartisan approach of anyone I have ever seen  serve in that position--he doesn't care about party. It is just as the  time when he worked in the CIA. He cares about his country. He has seen  the most deadly things happen, and, through his technology company, he  has seen that people fight wars new ways.   So he took it upon himself--it is not the issue that people would  campaign upon, but it is an issue that he saw needed a solution. He  worked with both sides of the aisle, and he said: Why can't we  modernize our own technology?    The Veterans Administration was created in 1921, and if somebody that  was a veteran had a problem and a claim, they would write it on a piece  of paper. In 1921, on a warm day like today, we would have fans going  to try to cool ourselves down. We would rush, after we got done voting,  to turn on our radios to see what the news was saying.   Well, the world all changed. We can look at our phones and get the  news instantaneously. We got central air to cool ourselves down. And if  you have a claim with the VA, lots of times they write it on a piece of  paper.   Well, do you know what? That is all going to stop today. That is  going to stop because we are going to make a smart investment. We are  going to make the Federal Government have the same accountability that  we expect in business or anywhere else.   And do you know what will happen? Government will become more  effective, more efficient, more accountable, and more transparent.   So I want to tip my hat to both sides of the aisle, and especially to  Congressman Will Hurd. He took the leadership, had the tenacity to stay  with it and the ability to work with all on, really, the issue that  people wouldn't talk about but expect to happen, and he was the right  person at the right time to make the push. That is why I support this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform my friend from the  Commonwealth that I have no further speakers and am prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have some young folks in the Chamber right now, and I  hope they recognize that this is how their government is supposed to  work: people working together, putting their differences past them for  the betterment of our great Nation.  [[Page H4266]]    It is an honor for me to have this opportunity to do this with so  many of my friends that I have grown to love and respect over these  last 2 years. And we get to save government money, protect our digital  infrastructure, and make sure that our government is providing the kind  of services we should and that the American people demand.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
