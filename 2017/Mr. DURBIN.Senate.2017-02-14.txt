 Mr. President, the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, is  likely to come to the floor soon, and I will certainly defer to him at  a later time, but I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning  business.    Mr. President, November 8, 2016, was not just election  day. It was a day that will live in cyber infamy because it turns out  that one of the leading enemies of the United States, the nation of  Russia, was directly engaged in the Presidential campaign that resulted  in the election on November 8. This is not speculation. It is a fact  based on conclusions that came from 17 different intelligence agencies  that confirmed this reality. This is the first time we can point to  where a foreign power has tried to influence the outcome of a  Presidential election in the United States. Their goal was clear: to  elect Donald Trump, to defeat Hillary Clinton. They hacked into  computers. They released information on a selective basis. They created  fake news stories. They used WikiLeaks--everything within their cyber  power to influence the outcome of the election. That was the reality.   This morning we were awakened to the headline that President Trump's  head of the National Security Council, LTG Michael Flynn, has resigned.  That is an incredible blockbuster of a story. And what was the reason  for his resignation? It turns out that he had a direct conversation  with the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Kislyak, and that  conversation included references to sanctions that President Obama was  imposing on Russia because of their involvement in our election. What  led to his resignation, of course, was that he misled both the Vice  President and the President about that conversation. When the facts  came out, he was forced to resign.   This is not business as usual in Washington. What we are dealing with  here is, in fact, a historic event--a powder keg in history--when it  comes to the United States and its security. The obvious question is,  Will this Congress of the United States, this branch of our government,  respond? Will we initiate thorough investigations as to the involvement  of the Russians in that election campaign and, specifically, any  involvement with any Presidential campaign during that time?   Twenty years ago, when I was elected to the Senate, there was an  investigation initiated by the Republicans at the suggestion--the  suggestion--that the Chinese Government played some role in the  Clinton-Gore campaign. The Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate  was entrusted with the responsibility to do a thorough investigation of  that allegation, and Fred Thompson, the Senator from Tennessee, was the  chairman of that committee, with John Glenn as the ranking Democrat.   The hearings went on for weeks--ultimately, for months--and then  there was a formal report issued. No credible evidence was found of the  suggestion, but it was taken that seriously by the Republican-led  Congress that the Chinese may have been involved in a Democratic  Presidential campaign.   How seriously is the Republican Congress taking the allegations and  statements from our intelligence agencies that the Russians were  involved in this last Presidential campaign?   It is time for us to have an independent, bipartisan commission  beyond Congress to look into this and give us solid answers. We need to  appoint people to head this commission of the stature of GEN Colin  Powell and Sandra Day O'Connor, who served on the Supreme Court, who  are credible people to lead this effort and this investigation and give  America the truth.   A week or so ago the New York Times published the results of a recent  poll that asked Americans what other nations they considered to be our  closest allies and worst enemies. The results weren't surprising.  Canada, the UK, and Australia topped the list of our best allies. Of  America's enemies, the top nations were different, but they included  North Korea, Iran, and Russia. That makes me wonder why President  Trump, in the span of a week, managed to insult and hang up on the  telephone call with the Prime Minister of Australia and then go on  national news to once again defend Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, in  light of what I just said earlier. Just a few days later, it is  revealed that his National Security Advisor, General Flynn, the one who  was fired by the previous administration and led chants unworthy of a  great democracy about locking up a political opponent, was, in fact,  speaking to a Russian official as a private citizen before President  Trump took office.   Monday, we learned that former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates,  whom President Trump abruptly fired, had warned the White House that  General Flynn had misled senior administration officials about his  communications with the Russian Ambassador and warned he was  potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Understand what I have  just said. The man who was picked by President Trump as his top  National Security Advisor misled the President and the Vice President  about a telephone conversation with the Russian Ambassador and, in the  opinion of our top law enforcement officials, left himself vulnerable  to Russian blackmail.   In the last days of the Obama administration, then Director of  National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan  reportedly shared Yates' concerns and concurred with the recommendation  to inform the Trump White House. Now that General Flynn has resigned,  leaving an already chaotic National Security Council in even greater  disarray, perhaps this isn't all that surprising anymore, but it  certainly should be.   This President has a troubling habit of lashing out at everyone and  anyone involved in a perceived slight--dangerous and unbecoming  behavior when granted the privilege to become President of this great  Nation. In fact, the number and range of those attacked or insulted by  Twitter is so significant I wouldn't even start to list them, but it is  important to note the list includes Republicans, Democrats, labor  leaders, businesses, retired generals, and others in almost every  conceivable category. Actually, one looks at the list and you quickly  realize the only unifying factor is not about putting America first or  America's image but instead about protecting a deeply fragile ego.   Listen to this excerpt from a vast list of those who have been  attacked by President Trump: President George Bush, President George W.  Bush, Speaker Paul Ryan, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Federal judges,  former Governor of New Hampshire John Sununu, the Republican  establishment, NATO, Major League Baseball, Macy's Department Store,  European leaders, Britain, Germany, New Jersey, the American delegate  system, the ``Today'' show, ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``The View,''  Chief Justice John Roberts, Colin Powell, President of United  Steelworkers Local 1999, ABC News, NBC News, FOX News, and seemingly  every other media outlet.   Now that we are in the category of those who have been attacked, we  can't leave Nordstrom off the list. The President even insulted the  former Governor of South Carolina, then chose her to be U.N.  Ambassador. In fact, there are hundreds upon hundreds on this list--a  list that in a foreboding, Nixonian way keeps on growing.   So if you make any criticism or joke about President Trump, make any  perceived slight, run a department store that doesn't carry his  daughter's products, lead a labor union, or do just about anything, be  prepared for an attack by a Trump tweet--except if you happen to be the  former Communist KGB official who now leads the one nation that  actually recently attacked our Nation. That would be Vladimir Putin.   How is it possible?   Russian President Putin launched a cyber attack of war on the United  [[Page S1137]]  States. He interfered in our election and tried to affect the outcome  and pick the winner. The evidence is overwhelming. It has been  available in increasing amounts over the last several months. Yet we  have a President who not only denies the Russian attack but has a  strange infatuation with President Putin--but is also suggesting  policies that dangerously puppet those of Putin.   It is now revealed that Trump's National Security Advisor, LTG  Michael Flynn, lied about discussing sanctions with the Russian  Ambassador immediately after the Obama administration announced new  sanctions for the attack on our election. Not only had General Flynn  and the White House suddenly remembered the facts differently, but more  dangerously, did Flynn's conversation undercut U.S. sanctions,  especially after Russia's assault on our election? And who instructed  General Flynn to have these suspiciously timed conversations with the  Russian Ambassador?   It is deeply troubling to imagine what might have been insinuated in  those talks, but given the blinders this President has shown in  ignoring President Putin so far, I worry about a suggested or hinted  trading for U.S. sanctions on Russia for little in return.   Quite simply, you don't make America great by selling out to a former  Communist KGB official. You only negotiate with such a dictator from a  position of strength, not denial or naivete.   So what has been the response to the cyber attack of war on America,  Flynn's dalliance with the Russians, and the dangerous disarray at the  Trump National Security Council from the party of Ronald Reagan, who  knew the Communist mind pretty well? Near silence. The party of Ronald  Reagan has spoken zero times about the Russian attack or Flynn's  actions on the floor of the Senate since early October. I waited this  morning for the Senate Republican leader to raise the obvious front- page story across America about the resignation of President Trump's  National Security Advisor, and not a word was mentioned.   Compare this to the 36 times the Republicans have come to the floor  to talk about stripping health care away from millions of Americans in  the last several weeks. Even President Trump's new Attorney General,  who brazenly changed his tune on Russia once having joined the Trump  campaign, said he had not yet read intelligence reports on the Russian  attack--a position even more stunning in light of the recent reports of  Sally Yates' warnings. Yet, incredibly, his colleagues were ready to  confirm him for the highest law enforcement position in the land.   I see the Democratic leader here, and I want to yield the floor to  him, but I will close with this. Are we going to have a fulsome,  honest, independent investigation of the Russian involvement in this  election campaign? We know it happened. Seventeen of our intelligence  agencies confirm it.   We also know that an investigation is underway by the Federal Bureau  of Investigation about this campaign and the involvement of the  Russians, and we know as well now that because of the conversations of  our National Security Advisor with the Russian Ambassador, he was  forced to resign in the first 4 weeks of this administration.   This calls out for a thorough investigation. The Republican Party in  Congress, which spent hours and days and weeks and months in  investigations involving Hillary Clinton, should at least acknowledge  the gravity of this matter and bring this to a full investigation--an  open and public one that can be trusted, an independent investigation-- that stands up for our basic democracy and does not allow the invasion  of the Russians or any other country into our democratic process.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, later today we are going to consider an  effort under the Congressional Review Act to change America's  background check system when it comes to the purchase of firearms.   For months, I have been listening to President Trump and the  Republicans talk about gun violence in the city of Chicago. It is a  heartbreaking reality. More than 4,300 people were shot in Chicago last  year and over 400 so far this year. It is not just Chicago. The  American Medical Association has declared that gun violence is a public  health crisis in our Nation.   So what is Congress doing to save lives in Chicago and across the  Nation from gun violence? What is the Senate doing to protect people  from being shot? Nothing.   Instead, the Republican Congress is trying to weaken one of the gun  laws on the books--the NICS Improvement Amendments Act. This is the law  passed unanimously by Congress after the Virginia Tech massacre and  signed into law in 2008 by President George W. Bush.   This law says that every Federal agency needs to let the FBI NICS  background check system know when the agency has information about  people who fall within the legal prohibitions on gun possession.  Everyone agreed we needed to get these records into the NICS system,  especially records about those who are seriously mentally unstable,  such as the Virginia Tech shooter. That man had a history of mental  illness, but he was able to buy guns and kill 32 people because his  records were not in the background check system known as NICS.    There is a longstanding Federal prohibition on gun possession by  those who are suffering from mental illness. This prohibition is so  well established that the late Justice Antonin Scalia cited it in the  Supreme Court's Heller decision as an example of a restriction that is  presumptively lawful and consistent with the Second Amendment.   There have been tragic cases where people with serious mental  illnesses have used guns to cause great harm. The Newtown, CT, shooter  showed signs of severe mental health problems that went untreated  before he killed 20 students and 6 educators at Sandy Hook Elementary  School. The Tucson, AZ, shooter, who shot Congresswoman Gabby Giffords  and killed six others, was diagnosed after the shooting with  schizophrenia. And it was 9 years ago today when a gunman who had been  diagnosed and treated for mental illness killed 5 people and injured 17  in a classroom building at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb.   About two-thirds of shooting deaths each year are suicides. Last  year, there were more than 21,000 suicides by gun. The National  Alliance on Mental Illness reports that ``about 90% of individuals who  die by suicide experience mental illness.''   Mental illness is a challenging issue for our society. I have worked  to expand treatment and coverage for mental illness, including through  the Affordable Care Act, one of the most important single laws we have  ever passed to address mental illness. I wish those who are trying to  repeal this commonsense gun safety regulation would drop that effort  and join us in stopping this repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We need  more and better services for people with mental illness.   The reality is that the gun laws on the books are narrowly drawn when  it comes to mental illness and so is the rule we are being asked to  repeal today. Current Federal law says that a person who has been  ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is prohibited from gun  possession. The phrase ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is defined  in the law as a determination by ``a court, board, commission, or other  lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal  intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease:  (1) is a danger to himself or others; or (2) lacks the mental capacity  to contract or manage his own affairs.''   The 2008 NICS Improvement law, signed into law by President George W.  Bush, directed Federal agencies to send their relevant records to the  NICS system. Last year, the Social Security Administration issued a  rule to implement this law after concluding that certain determinations  by the Social Security Administration qualify as an adjudication of  mental defectiveness.   Let me explain what the SSA rule says. Under this rule, starting in  December of this year, the Social Security Administration will begin  sending to NICS--the body which gathers information and records for  background checks before the possession of firearms--the name, date of  birth, and Social Security number of people who meet each of the five  threshold criteria. The person must be between the ages of 18 and 65,  have filed a claim with SSA for benefits based on disability, have been  diagnosed with a serious, long-term mental disorder, have been  determined by SSA to be disabled and unable to perform substantial work  because of the mental disorder, and have been subject to determination  by the Social Security Administration that the mental disorder is so  serious that the person needs to have a representative appointed to  manage the person's benefits.   This is not a situation where the Social Security Administration  would notify NICS just because a person can't balance his checkbook.  There must be a seriously debilitating, medically diagnosed mental  illness involved.   The rule is prospective only. Current Social Security disability  beneficiaries are not subject to it. The rule is predicted to cover  about 75,000 Americans, once it takes effect, out of the estimated 10  million suffering from a serious mental illness.   I might add here for the record, I do not suggest that every person  who has any form of mental illness is a danger. In fact, exactly the  opposite is true. But we do know that those who suffer from serious  mental conditions many times are engaged in violent conduct and many  times with horrible results when they have firearms.   The rule we are being asked to repeal on the floor of the Senate  provides for advance notice of the Social Security Administration  determination and the right to appeal through an administrative process  and in court. A person can  [[Page S1139]]  obtain relief from the firearms prohibition by having healthcare  providers and character witnesses submit statements that the person is  not a danger to himself or others.   Every politician claims they want to keep deadly firearms out of the  hands of those who are seriously mentally unstable. A statement made by  a Republican Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, the senior Senator  from Texas and my counterpart on the Republican side; he said in March  2013:         If there was a common thread in the Virginia Tech, Tucson,       Aurora, and Newtown massacres, it was the mental illness of       the shooter. . . . We should refocus our effort to make sure       the current background check system works to screen out the       dangerously mentally-ill.    Reasonable people can disagree over whether the SSA's rule gets it  exactly right. There are mental health groups that have concerns about  it, and I respect that. But using the Congressional Review Act is a  blunt tool. Instead of fixing the rule, the Congressional Review Act  would repeal the rule and--listen to this--permanently bar the Social  Security Administration from adopting any substantially similar rule.  So it likely would bar the Social Security Administration from ever  implementing a rule to submit mental health records to NICS in the  future.   If there are problems with this rule, they can be addressed by fixing  it. But the Republican response is always repeal first. This time, they  want to repeal a rule that doesn't start until December and its repeal  would preclude the Social Security Administration from even fixing or  positively changing it.   We also had disputes over the process the Department of Veterans  Affairs used to submit names of people with mental illness to the same  NICS background check system. Last December, we fixed it on a  bipartisan basis. We passed language in the 21st Century Cures Act to  ensure that a person can have his own doctor and lawyer involved in the  process. If the Social Security Administration rule needs fixing, we  can fix it too. But this Congressional Review Act is a sledgehammer,  not a tool to fix it.   We are being asked to vote today to ban an agency permanently from  complying with the NICS law that we enacted in 2008. We are being asked  to undermine the gun laws that are on the books.   I urge my colleagues to listen to the opposition of this resolution  of disapproval. Read the letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, who  say that the Social Security Administration rule ``is critically  important to the fabric of our nation's background check system.'' Read  the editorials in newspapers across the country that oppose repealing  this rule.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the  Chicago Tribune be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 10, 2017]         Editorial: Guns and Mental Illness: Don't Scrap This Rule                            (By Editorial Board)         If someone has a mental illness severe enough that he       cannot work or manage his own money, should he be allowed to       own a gun?        In the waning weeks of his presidency, Barack Obama       answered that question. Motivated by Adam Lanza's bloody       rampage at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that       killed 20 children and six educators in 2012, Obama imposed a       rule that barred gun ownership for people who qualify for       Social Security disability insurance because their mental       illness keeps them from working, and who cannot manage their       benefits. That pool is small--just 75,000 Americans.        The GOP-led U.S. House just voted to scrap that rule. Bad       move. The Senate now decides whether to back that bad move.       If it does, President Trump would decide whether to go along       or disagree.        Republican lawmakers hang their case on the argument that       the rule stigmatizes people with disabilities as dangerous.       ``There are people who need help and seek help, but that is       not a criteria for taking away one's constitutional right''       to own a gun, Texas Rep. Pete Sessions said.        Sessions implicitly exaggerates the impact of the rule. As       gun control measures go, the scope of this one is narrow. Its       goal is to keep guns out of the hands of people on record as       having a disabling mental disorder. The standard for taking       that gun away is steep--they have to be on Social Security       because their psychiatric disorder keeps them from working,       and they cannot manage their own affairs. Both conditions       must be met. Even if the rule keeps someone from owning a       gun, that person can pursue an appeal.        America has seen what can happen when someone with severe       psychiatric issues has access to firearms. Their names and       crimes live in infamy:        In 2007, Seung Hui Cho shot to death 32 people at Virginia       Tech University before killing himself. Two years earlier, a       judge had deemed Cho an ``imminent danger'' because of mental       illness and ordered him to seek treatment. But because he was       never committed, that assessment never got recorded in the       federal database of people ineligible to buy guns. Cho passed       the background check and bought the guns he would wield at       Virginia Tech.        In 2011, Jared Loughner shot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords       in the head and murdered six other people in Tucson, Ark.        In 2012, James Holmes strode into a packed movie theater in       Aurora, Colo., and opened fire, killing 12 people.        And there's Lanza, who went through months of hysterical       crying, stretches of lethargy and self-imposed isolation from       his family before unleashing terror at Sandy Hook Elementary       School. ``I didn't understand that Adam was drifting away,''       his father, Peter Lanza, told The New Yorker in 2014.        These crimes showcase the dangers in allowing severely       troubled individuals to buy firearms. The rule the House       voted to scrap doesn't cast so wide a net that it applies to       anyone seeking psychiatric treatment. It's specific in scope,       and anchored by a common-sense premise that many House       Republicans ignored: If a person's psychiatric disorder is       disabling enough that the individual cannot work or deal with       money-managing, bright red flags are being raised about his       or her capacity for sound judgment.        To us, that's a logical, well-grounded reason why he or she       shouldn't own a gun.     We can also read editorials in the St. Louis Post- Dispatch, the Charlotte Observer, the New York Times, and more.   Now listen specifically to the pleas of gunshot victims and their  family members. Listen to Patrick Korellis, of Chicago, whom I have  met. He was shot in a classroom 9 years ago at Northern Illinois  University by a man who had a serious mental illness. He wrote to me  and he said:         I was shot in my classroom by someone who was mentally ill,       and was able to obtain guns and a lot of ammunition because       the background checks weren't strong enough. Rolling back       some of these background checks doesn't make any sense, and       will allow more people to get through the loopholes.    Now listen to Janet Delana of Wellington, MO. She wrote to Congress:         My daughter Colby, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who       lived at home with her father and I, received monthly Social       Security disability payments for her mental illness. In 2012       she used the money from her disability check to buy a gun at       a local gun dealer. Because she was ill and suicidal, I had       contacted the gun dealer and begged him not to sell her a       gun. However, my pleas were ignored and the dealer sold her a       gun anyway because Colby passed the background check. An hour       later, she shot her father to death and tried once again to       take her own life. She is now in an institution for life, and       my husband is gone.    Janet said:         This SSA Rule is vital. I am very concerned this resolution       would preclude SSA and possibly even other agencies from       enacting any future regulations on this or related matters.    We have a public health crisis when it comes to gun violence--in  Chicago and in communities across the Nation. We have a responsibility  to do what we can on the Federal level to reduce the violence and  protect our citizens from getting shot. Voting for this resolution of  disapproval today would be a step backward. It would weaken the gun  laws on the books and make it easier for severely mentally ill people  to get guns. On this, the ninth anniversary of the shooting at Northern  Illinois University in DeKalb, it is unthinkable that we are going to  try to revoke a rule that would keep guns out of the hands of those who  should have no business owning them.   Let me conclude with a statement from Bloomberg business magazine,  published in an edition several weeks ago:         Advocates for the mentally ill caution that mental illness       shouldn't be equated with a penchant for violence. They're       right. But America's tragic experience with mentally ill       gunmen--from shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 to Newtown,       Connecticut, in 2012--shows the folly of simply dismissing       the danger.        In recent years Republicans have prioritized instant       gratification for anyone who desires to buy a gun. Last year       the National Rifle Association spent $50 million on the       campaigns of Donald Trump and six Republican senators. NRA       leader Wayne LaPierre, who met with Trump this week, wants       payback.        The Obama rule established a process for identifying only       Social Security beneficiaries who would be prohibited from       possessing guns under existing law. It required  [[Page S1140]]       that beneficiaries be notified of the prohibition, and it       provided means to appeal the determination before an       administrative law judge or a federal court.        Such provisions would safeguard individual rights. But they       offend the fundamental principle that drives the NRA, and       thus Republican, gun politics: Anyone should be able to get a       gun at any time for any reason and bring that weapon, loaded,       anywhere.    Common sense dictates that we be careful to keep guns out of the  hands of those who would misuse them. I sincerely hope that gun owners  across my State and across the Nation--and I respect them and their  constitutional right--will understand that reasonable limitations on  the possession and ownership of firearms is in the best interest of  protecting their Second Amendment rights as well.   I yield the floor.
