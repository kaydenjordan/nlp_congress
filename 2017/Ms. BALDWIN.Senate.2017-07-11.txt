 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of Ted Shannon, whose passing marks the end of an extraordinary  life spent in service to country, community, and family. Ted committed  his life to the pursuit of justice and equality. Ted and his late wife  Dorothy were incredible pillars who had a great influence on me as I  entered a life of public service.   Ted Shannon showed up. In service to his country, he became a civil  affairs officer in July of 1941 during WW II, attached to the British  8th Army during the occupation of Italy. In his subsequent post, he  served as executive officer for the Supreme Headquarters Allied  Expeditionary Force in Paris.   He showed up as a leader in education, whether it was in his role as  a Ford Foundation higher education adviser for five Middle Eastern  countries in Lebanon--the nation of his ancestors--or as a highly  regarded UW-Extension faculty member and dean for more than three  decades.   Ted Shannon showed up. Along with Dorothy and fellow travelers from  the New Deal era, Ted supported progressive causes at all levels of  government for more than half a century. I cannot recall an event,  large or small, for a progressive organization where I did  [[Page S3915]]  not see Ted and Dorothy pitching in, providing leadership and  encouragement no matter how challenging the cause.   He showed up as a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend.  Ted met and married the former Dorothy Judge while at Yale pursuing his  Ph.D. on the GI bill and shared his life with her until her passing in  2003. Ted was father to Tad, Sara, and Pam. Ted showed up as a hunting  and fishing companion to son, Tad, and sage adviser on matters of food,  music, languages, and world travel to Sara and Pam. He enjoyed outdoor  adventures with his dear friend, Bill Threinen. Ted, Dorothy, Bill and  Connie Threinen were friends and compatriots in advancing beloved  ideals and forward-thinking causes for decades. A few years after  Dorothy's passing, Ted married second wife, Kate Foster, of Eau Claire  and continued his life of service for another 9 years.   Ted showed up. He was a doer. He walked the talk. Ted's multifaceted  legacy is perhaps best illustrated by the words of Cuban poet Jose  Marti: ``Men of Action, above all those whose actions are guided by  love, live forever.''   The life of Ted Shannon serves as inspiration for anyone who seeks to  create a world of peace, dignity, and opportunity for all. I miss him  dearly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 100th  anniversary of a great Wisconsin company: Oshkosh Corporation.   Oshkosh Corporation began ten decades ago when cofounders William  Besserdich and Bernard Mosling believed they had created something that  would change transportation in America. Their new technology would  improve vehicle steering and drive capacity, two factors that were  essential for navigating unfinished roads. While the engineering was  groundbreaking, they could not find a manufacturer who would purchase  and build their designs.   Faced with possible failure, William and Bernard moved on to plan B:  manufacturing and launching their own vehicle. On May 1, 1917, they  founded the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company that soon issued its four- wheel drive truck prototype, known as Old Betsy, using the duo's  innovative technology. The company's rapid growth led them to move the  production facility from Clintonville to Oshkosh, where it was renamed  the Oshkosh Motor Truck Manufacturing Company.   Over the next 3 years, the Oshkosh Motor Truck Manufacturing Company  grew exponentially as a defense supplier for the U.S. military. In  1945, the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy presented Oshkosh with the ``E''  award for excellence in wartime production. Throughout the 1940s,  companies like Auto Body Works, Inc., and Kewaunee Shipbuilding and  Engineering, which would later become part of the larger Oshkosh  Corporation, made their marks on the military industry. The success of  these companies built the foundation for Oshkosh Corporation's current  success.   The escalation of the Cold War led to Oshkosh's first major defense  contract. They produced 1,000 WT-2206 snow removal vehicles that  allowed the Air Force to remove snow for bomber planes. Throughout the  1950s, the company continued to produce high-quality, technologically  advanced trucks for various branches of the military. As our country  transitioned out of a wartime economy, the company's focus shifted,  resulting in the 1967 name change from Oshkosh Motor Truck Company to  Oshkosh Truck Corporation.   Over the next several decades, Oshkosh continued to grow, as did its  subsidiaries. Whether it was defense or construction, Oshkosh is known  for its consistency, advanced technology, and efficient designs. In the  area of defense, the Oshkosh name has become synonymous in the minds of  U.S. servicemembers with quality, durability, and safety. From heavy- duty trucks, to the lifesaving MRAP--which was rapidly produced by  skilled and patriotic Wisconsin workers in order to accelerate the  safer vehicle's deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan--to the current  production of the joint light tactical vehicle, Oshkosh boasts an  unparalleled track record of delivering leading capability to our men  and women in uniform. That is a record I have been honored to support  throughout my time in Congress. As a member of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, I have worked to secure the funding required  by the Armed Services to meet their need for tactical vehicles.   I have also been proud to represent Oshkosh in the Senate because the  company has a steadfast commitment to its employees. Whether it was  1917 with two employees, 1972 with 500 employees, or present day with  over 12,000 employees across the world, Oshkosh provides for its  employees with scholarships, employee safety, and support. On the  production floor or in the office, Oshkosh Corporation employees'  remarkable dedication can be seen throughout the organization. I have  been honored to meet many of these talented workers, including speaking  with hundreds at a recent all-hands call at the Oshkosh Defense  facility in Wisconsin.   Oshkosh's success has also lifted the fortunes of hundreds of  Wisconsin companies throughout its various supply chains. Oshkosh is a  true linchpin of my home State's manufacturing economy, and both its  commercial and government programs support thousands of good-paying,  skilled jobs. Just last year, I had the opportunity to partner with  Oshkosh Defense and the Wisconsin Procurement Institute to strengthen  this vibrant network by convening an event to build relationship's  between Wisconsin suppliers and Federal agencies.   I would also like to commend the company's current leadership,  including president and CEO Wilson Jones, and John Bryant, the  president of Oshkosh's defense unit, both of whom I have had the  pleasure of working with over the years. Similarly, I want to recognize  the tremendous contributions made by their immediate predecessors,  Charles Szews and John Urias, respectively. The steady hand provided by  these leaders will ensure that the company is an integral part of  Wisconsin's economy for another 100 years.   Now, 100 years after the creation of ``Old Betsy,'' Oshkosh  Corporation and its brands continue to lead the industry; yet the  company has remained firmly committed to its strong ethics and  employee-centric culture. For the last ten decades, Oshkosh Corporation  has cemented its international reputation for innovation and  excellence. I know Oshkosh leadership and frontline employees will  continue to hold themselves to this high standard, as they continue to  grow and contribute to our great Wisconsin economy. I am so pleased to  add my voice in celebrating this monumental anniversary.                            ____________________
