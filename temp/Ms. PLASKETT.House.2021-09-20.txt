 Madam Speaker, September is Prostate Cancer Awareness  Month. Prostate cancer has led male cancer incidence in 96 countries.  It is the most common cause of death among men in 51 countries. The  United States leads the world in reducing prostate cancer deaths.   One in eight U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their  lifetimes. African-American men are over 75 percent more likely to  develop prostate cancer compared to White men and more than twice as  likely to die from the disease.   It is important for our men to understand that there are usually no  early warning signs for prostate cancer. For many years the disease may  be silent. That is why screening is such an important topic for all men  and their families.   Age is the biggest risk factor for prostate cancer; rates of  diagnosis steadily rise as men age into their fifties, sixties, and  seventies.   I have family members and close male friends who have suffered from  prostate cancer but underwent surgery and survived. Ask for early  screening, and please be aware of this month as we go through prostate  cancer awareness.                            ____________________
