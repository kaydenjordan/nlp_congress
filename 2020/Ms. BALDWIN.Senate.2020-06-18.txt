 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an enormous  step forward for our country, which happened earlier this week, on  Monday. Once again, on a morning during Pride Month, our Nation came  closer to realizing the promise of equality for lesbians, gays,  bisexual, transgender, and the queer community.   The Supreme Court has made it clear that workplace discrimination  against LGBTQ people is wrong, and our Nation's civil rights laws  prohibit it. While this is a joyous day and a joyous week, I want to  take a moment to acknowledge the untold number who have suffered in  this country for years without recourse. I want to recognize those  brave LGBTQ people who received pink slips, were passed over for  promotions, suffered harassment and bullying in break rooms, or never  got that initial interview--all simply because of who they are or whom  they loved.   I particularly want to thank the plaintiffs who brought these cases:  Gerald Bostock, Aimee Stephens, and Donald Zarda, as well as the  families and friends and lawyers who supported them. Sadly, Aimee and  Donald did not live to see this transformative moment for our country  and our community, but we will remember them and honor the efforts that  they and so many others have made to get us here. We will commit  ourselves to continuing to push forward for full equality for them.   On Monday, the Supreme Court affirmed what many Federal courts, the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and so many of us have  recognized for years--that title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is  properly understood to prohibit discrimination based on sexual  orientation and gender identity.   As Justice Gorsuch wrote for the majority:         Today, we must decide whether an employer can fire someone       simply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer is  [[Page S3079]]       clear. An employer who fires an individual for being       homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or       actions that it would not have questioned in members of a       different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role       in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.    This decision is far from radical, but it is transformative. It means  that at long last in every corner of this Nation, in big cities and  small towns, LGBTQ people are waking up in a fairer country. They now  know that they have recourse if an employer discriminates against them  simply because of who they are or whom they love. Employers know  unambiguously that they have an obligation in every State to judge all  of their employees on merit, not sexual orientation or gender identity.   While we have taken another big step forward--and it is a big step-- in the march toward full equality for LGBTQ Americans, we are not there  yet. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people face  discrimination in many more aspects of their lives than the workplace.  Our country needs to send the message that treating people unfairly  because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is wrong and  that it will not be tolerated, period, whether that is while buying a  house, going out to dinner, shopping in a store, serving on a jury, or  seeking help from a government program.   While the Court told us on Monday that discrimination based on sexual  orientation or gender identity is necessarily sex discrimination, those  cases were about employment. While I would expect that any  administration would now take a long, hard look at its wrong-headed  efforts--based on the legal arguments that the Supreme Court has just  rejected--to write LGBTQ people out of sex discrimination protections  in education, healthcare, and other areas, I do not have confidence  that this administration is going to do so.   There are areas of Federal civil rights law, such as those governing  public accommodations and Federal financial assistance, which don't  even yet prohibit discrimination based on sex. That is why the Senate  must take up and pass the Equality Act. Senators Merkley, Collins,  Booker, and I introduced this bipartisan measure to ensure that LGBTQ  people have the same nondiscrimination protections as other Americans  by adding sexual orientation and gender identity alongside all  protected characteristics, such as race and religion, to existing  Federal laws. It would ban discrimination in a host of areas, including  housing, public accommodations, jury service, access to credit and  Federal funding, as well as employment.   The bill would also strengthen our civil rights laws by adding  protections against sex discrimination to the Federal laws where they  have not been included previously, including those addressing public  accommodations and Federal funding.   More than a year ago, a bipartisan majority of the House of  Representatives passed the Equality Act. Unfortunately, like so many  other pieces of legislation that would improve the lives of the  American people, it has been ignored by the Senate majority leader and  placed in his legislative graveyard.   The Equality Act cannot be ignored any longer by the Senate, and  LGBTQ people should not have to wait any longer to enjoy the full  protections of our Nation's civil rights laws.   I urge the Senate to build on the Supreme Court's decision and act  today to bring our Nation closer to the promise of equality by passing  the Equality Act.   Finally, I want to close by acknowledging the extraordinary moment in  which our Nation finds itself today. Thousands upon thousands are  demanding the country confront racial injustices and systemic racism.  They rightfully call for change, and they righteously call for change,  and it is my hope that Congress will take an important step in righting  some of those wrongs by passing the Justice in Policing Act of 2020  without delay.   We must do so much more, and today I am keenly aware of the Black and  Brown LGBTQ people who experience discrimination and injustice in this  country--not just because of sexual orientation or gender identity but  also because of race or ethnicity.   As we approach another anniversary of the Stonewall riots that  sparked the modern LGBTQ movement for equality, I am also mindful of  the leadership of Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, transgender  women of color, in that historic moment. I hope the brave, courageous  legacy of these leaders and the urgent needs of Black and Brown LGBTQ  people would inspire us to take another step to strengthen the civil  rights for all Americans and pass the Equality Act.   I now yield to my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow.
