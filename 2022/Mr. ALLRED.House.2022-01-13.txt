 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this should be a bipartisan vote. The right to vote  has been reauthorized, and the Voting Rights Act has been reauthorized  overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in this House, and unanimously  in the Senate.   My constituent, George W. Bush, signed the reauthorization of the  Voting Rights Act. But now it is time for us to not just restore the  Voting Rights Act, but to make sure that we expand voting rights across  the country, to give us a sword and a shield; the shield of the Voting  Rights Act to protect the right to vote, to protect changes; and the  sword of the Freedom to Vote Act and the expansions that it will  provide, to vote by mail, voter registration, and allow every single  American to make their voice heard in our elections.
