 Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment.    Madam Chair, I bring a bipartisan amendment that is  cosponsored by Congressman Cedric Richmond and Congressman Garret  Graves. What this amendment is really designed to do is highlight the  fact that, as we are embarking upon another mission now to Mars, an  ambitious mission to get men back into space, ultimately to go back to  the Moon, that we also want to make sure that, as we are investing  billions of dollars in this incredible equipment and incredible  technology that America has been so ingenuitive in designing, that we  also make sure we are maintaining those facilities that are key  components to building a lot of that technology and building these  massive rockets, like the SLS for Orion.   I am proud that we have the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans.  It is actually in Congressman Richmond's district and has been a key  component to the space program going back to the Apollo days. There is  tremendous pride with the workforce and these massive facilities that  help design and build this incredible technology that allows these  missions to the Moon and these missions to Mars, ultimately.   So, as America is embarking on this great mission and an ambitious  mission that we should always continue to achieve, we are proud of our  Administrator of NASA, Jim Bridenstine, who actually came from this  House, served in this House, and now is very engaged in making sure  that this next ambitious mission to both the Moon and to Mars is being  carried out properly.   Again, we just want to highlight the fact that, as we are doing this,  we want to also make sure that we are maintaining those facilities that  are going to build the massive rockets and other technology and  equipment that will get us there.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
