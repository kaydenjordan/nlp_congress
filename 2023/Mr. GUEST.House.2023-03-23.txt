 Mr. Chair, in many places across our great Nation, parents  are being denied, being denied a voice in discussions around what their  children are being taught in schools.   As Republicans, in our Commitment to America, we made a promise, a  promise to establish the rights of parents to protect their children  from indoctrination in our classrooms.   As a product of the public school system and father of two sons who  graduated from public school, I understand the significant role our  schools play in the education of our future leaders.   However, far-left ideas have seeped into America's classrooms and  have blurred the line between education and indoctrination. We cannot  allow that to continue.   This bill simply protects the rights of parents, the rights of  parents to know what their children are being taught, what their  children are hearing in school, the right to see the budget that the  school is spending, the right to protect their children's privacy, and  the right to keep their children safe.   Simply put, this bill protects those parents who want to play a role  in their child's life and to protect their children from indoctrination  in the classroom.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this critical and  commonsense piece of legislation.
