 Madam Speaker, I am thrilled to celebrate the  release of my constituent, journalist Danny Fenster, who was unjustly  detained for 5\1/2\ months by the military junta in Burma.   I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all those involved in  securing Danny's release, including: Governor Bill Richardson; our  incredible diplomats in Burma, led by Ambassador Tom Vajda; Special  Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, or SPEHA, Ambassador Roger  Carstens; the State Department, from Tony Blinken on down; Chairman    Gregory Meeks, and all of my colleagues in the House who stepped up.   My heart is full for Danny's family. His parents, Buddy and Rose, his  brother, Bryan, his amazing cousins, they have all shown such  resilience, determination, and creativity throughout this difficult  journey.   I am so grateful for the powerful outpouring of support across  Michigan and this entire country. Our communities rallied together to  support Danny and the Fenster family. And now, by sticking together and  keeping the faith, we have brought Danny home.                            ____________________
