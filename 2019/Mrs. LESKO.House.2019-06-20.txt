 Madam Chair, this amendment prohibits funds under this  act from being used to enforce two rules under Obama's so-called Clean  Power Plan.   This plan was administrative overreach, plain and simple. It would  have mandated the shutdown of power plants and increased energy costs  for families across the country.   The Clean Power Plan is just another example of Obama-era regulations  killing American jobs, strangling our economy, and destroying our  domestic energy industry.   The proposed Clean Power Plan would have required Arizona, my State,  to achieve a 52 percent reduction in the CO2 emissions rate  for affected power plants and to achieve about 90 percent of that  reduction by next year, 2020. That was totally unrealistic.   Arizona has Palo Verde nuclear plant. It is the largest producing  nuclear plant in the entire Nation. Often Arizona produces more energy  than it consumes, and so we sell our energy and our electricity  throughout the Southwest. So Arizona energy is American energy.   The regulations that strangle Arizona power generating stations harm  American consumers well beyond our borders. I applaud the Trump  administration for recognizing the harm of the Clean Power Plan and  repealing and replacing it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule.
