 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 657 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 657         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2396) to       amend the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to update the exception for       certain annual notices provided  [[Page H9861]]       by financial institutions. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on       Financial Services now printed in the bill shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; (2) the       further amendment printed in the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4015) to       improve the quality of proxy advisory firms for the       protection of investors and the U.S. economy, and in the       public interest, by fostering accountability, transparency,       responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm       industry. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-46 shall       be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity, over the last  couple of weeks, to bring a number of bills from the Financial Services  Committee to the floor. We talk so much about regular order and having  a process where the committees are doing their work, where the  authorizers are deep into the details, and then we are bringing those  bills to the floor for the entire House to vote on. We have that  opportunity again today.   Mr. Speaker, the rule today brings two bills to the floor: H.R. 2396,  which is the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act, it  brings that under a structured rule, making in order the only amendment  that was offered, a bipartisan amendment, offered by Mr. Clay and Mr.  Trott; and it also brings H.R. 4015 to the floor, Mr. Speaker, which is  the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017. We did  not have any germane amendments offered to that measure in the Rules  Committee last night, so we bring that under a closed rule today.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues--as is the way of my chairman on  the Rules Committee--notice was sent out to all Members, and will  continue to be sent out to all Members, for each set of bills that we  consider in the Rules Committee soliciting any amendments or ideas that  folks may have. We sent out that notification, but, for these two  bills, we received only one germane amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I won't go into great detail about these individual  bills because we are fortunate to have the sponsors here on the floor  for the rule today. But what I do want to say is that this is another  series in a line of commonsense, authorizing pieces of legislation,  things that move through committee in a bipartisan way, that are going  to make life just a little bit easier for the American people.   We have a chance today, if we support this noncontroversial rule, to  bring these two noncontroversial bills to the floor and make that  difference together, a difference we all came to Washington to make.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to consider supporting this  rule as well as supporting the two underlying pieces of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to say sometimes there is a lot of pressure on the Rules Committee. You  come down here and you have got some of the most knowledgeable folks on  both sides of the issue, on both sides of the Chamber, and you have got  to be prepared to refute detail after detail after detail that might  confuse folks back home.   It gives me great pleasure today to not have to spend any time  refuting anything that my friend just said because the important thing  about developing a reputation is that it is just laughable to suggest  that Republicans are coming to the floor today to undermine privacy. It  is laughable to suggest that Republicans are coming to the floor today  to increase paperwork and red tape. And it is not only laughable,  [[Page H9863]]  but it is inaccurate to suggest that it is Republicans coming to do  this, Mr. Speaker. These are bipartisan bills coming to the floor  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Trott). His bill passed out of committee 40-20; a huge bipartisan vote  coming out of committee. It went through a hearing; it went through a  markup; it was everything that makes this institution work properly. I  appreciate him for bringing the issue forward to talk about the  tremendous bipartisan effort that he has put together.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to say that I agree with my friend. I, too, said to the FCC in 2015: If  it ain't broke, don't fix it.   I thought the first 20-plus years of the internet were marked by  innovation and freedom, and I wanted to keep that innovation and  freedom flowing.   The Obama administration wanted to insert itself into the internet  infrastructure in ways that it had never inserted government in  infrastructure before. And from the numbers that I have seen--my friend  may have different numbers--suggests that infrastructure investment has  declined over those 2 years, first time in the history of internet  infrastructure investment.   Mr. Speaker, reasonable men and women can disagree, but, understand,  internet freedom and innovation is exactly what we all want to protect.  Unfortunately, it is not what this rule is focused on today. This rule  today is focused on simplification and expansion coming out of the  Financial Services Committee.   Mr. Speaker, one of the gentlemen I had the pleasure of being elected  with in 2011 is the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy). He is one of  the sponsors of one of these bills we have before us today. He has been  a leader in the financial services field in his 7 years here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Duffy) to talk about the impact that his legislation will have on the  process today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin, the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend from Colorado is right. Time management is an  important issue here on the floor, and we have got to manage it,  whether it is closing statements or whether it is floor time throughout  the day.   Every bill we bring to the floor is not going to be the most  important bill that we bring to the floor, Mr. Speaker, by definition.   I hope that my colleagues were listening intently to my friend from  Colorado, not necessarily during his opening statement, and certainly  not during his closing statement, but during the middle statement where  he was talking about his vast knowledge of corporate boards and  corporate structures.   I have the pleasure of serving on the Rules Committee with Mr. Polis,  Mr. Speaker, and there are not going to be many Members of this  institution who have either been more successful in their private life,  not just talking about it, but doing it, when it comes to leading  institutions, and Members who work harder to try to find some common  ground to move things forward.   I was just telling Ms. Rossi on my staff, Mr. Speaker, that it  troubles me more when Mr. Polis is on the floor and we can't find  agreement, because I believe very often he tries harder than most to  find that agreement here. Mr. Speaker, you see it on the front page of  the newspaper day after day after day, folks talk about this  institution as if we will never find agreement with each other.    There are some issues of principle where finding agreement is hard,  where we just fundamentally disagree with one another.   It is not the case today, though, Mr. Speaker. Today, the case is  that we have two bills that moved through regular order in the  Financial Services Committee. That means, Mr. Speaker, that the  committee took up the legislation first, that the committee sorted out  the legislation first, and, Mr. Speaker, these bills, both of them,  passed the Financial Services Committee with big bipartisan votes.   There are many opportunities for us to come to the floor and talk  about things that divide us that we will never find agreement on. That  is not today. Today, we have a chance to come to the floor and talk  about differences that we can make together. Differences that are not  just bipartisan, but differences that are nonpartisan; good ideas that  can make a difference one life, one bill at a time.   Mr. Speaker, these bills are coming today under a closed rule for  one, under a structured rule for the other. That is true. For the  uninitiated, Mr. Speaker, that means that amendments aren't going to be  offered. It doesn't mean that amendments weren't allowed, Mr. Speaker.   We sent out the call to the entire House of Representatives, 435  Members. We said we have two bills coming before the Rules Committee;  we want you to send us all of your ideas, all of the different ways  that you think these two bills can be improved.   We got back one idea. One. And we made it in order for a vote on the  floor of the House. Dadgummit, Mr. Speaker, I think it is going to make  the bill better. I intend to support that amendment that we made in  order. It is a Democrat amendment. It came from my friend Mr. Clay on  the other side of the aisle. I intend to support it because I think it  is going to make the bill better.   Are there issues that are complex, that are partisan, that are  structured in such a way that having an open rule isn't the choice that  gets made? Of course there are. Of course there are.   I think my friend is right to criticize the majority when the process  gets closed down in this way. But today, Mr. Speaker, I think my friend  is wrong to suggest that the process is being closed down. The process  was opened up to the entire institution. One amendment was received,  one amendment was made in order. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that will be a  practice that we continue going forward. Two good bills today, Mr.  Speaker, if my colleagues support this rule: one from my friend Mr.  Trott, one from my friend Mr. Duffy, and the bipartisan amendment  offered by my friend Mr. Clay.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, and  then I hope they will come back to the floor and support the underlying  bills as well.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 657 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4585) to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from       relying on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the matter of       restoring internet freedom to adopt, amend, revoke, or       otherwise modify any rule of the Commission. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Cause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4585.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal  [[Page H9868]]       to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule       reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to       amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2)       Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for       the previous question on a resolution reported from the       Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the       opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper       amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate       thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
