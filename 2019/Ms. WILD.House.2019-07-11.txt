 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  yes on a bipartisan amendment to address the opioid crisis that affects  our servicemembers so severely. And I thank my fellow Pennsylvanian and  friend, Brian Fitzpatrick, for joining me in tackling this issue.   This amendment would establish a partnership between the Department  of Defense and academic health centers to work on three key areas:   One, focused research on reducing our servicemembers' dependency on  opioids;   Two, the development of new methods of pain management and mental  health strategies; and   Three, partnerships with industry that would advance technologies for  wounded servicemembers that will improve their day-to-day lives.   The opioid epidemic is not and cannot be a bipartisan issue. It hits  communities all across the country, regardless of ethnicity, race, or  socioeconomic status. But the epidemic is spreading to our  servicemembers at an alarming rate.   Our servicemembers have unique challenges. Studies show that 15  percent of servicemembers use opioids following injuries while  deployed, which is almost four times the civilian average of 4 percent.  As a result, addiction is higher among servicemembers than in the  civilian population and is rising. Over a 3-year period, the percentage  of misuse nearly tripled. That is why this amendment is so critical.   Our servicemembers protect all of us and we can protect them by  passing this amendment and curtailing the devastating addictions of our  American heroes.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this amendment.
