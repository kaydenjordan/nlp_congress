 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my House colleagues  who visited my hometown of Flint, Michigan, last week to get an update  on the city's ongoing water crisis. I want to specifically thank Leader  Nancy Pelosi; Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn; Representatives  Barbara Lee, Jim McGovern, Denny Heck, Dwight Evans, Jared Huffman;  and, of course, the members of the Michigan delegation, including Sandy  Levin, Brenda Lawrence, and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank them all  for visiting Flint.   I appreciate all my colleagues who have come to Flint to visit with  families, and I am especially grateful that Congress passed much-needed  help for this community as it struggles to overcome this water crisis.   Today, there is progress in Flint, thanks to this body. Nearly 7,000  of those dangerous lead pipes have been replaced so far using the  Federal funds that we provided.   The recovery does continue. The Flint water crisis has faded from the  national headlines, and this congressional delegation is a reminder  that the crisis isn't over. That visit was an opportunity for us to  hear directly from families that there is still much to be done.   What happened in Flint is not some anomaly. It is a warning to the  rest of the country and to this Congress that we have to do more to  rebuild America's critical infrastructure. Otherwise, we run the risk  of more Flint, Michigans to come.                            ____________________
