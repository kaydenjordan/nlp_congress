 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, let me congratulate our incredible new House  Democratic leadership team: Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, and Pete  Aguilar. It is a dawn of a new day here in Congress, as a new  generation takes on the solemn responsibility of leadership.   Leader Jeffries has been tireless in his work to put people over  politics. His steady leadership as chair of our Democratic Caucus,  uniting our Members, harnessing their talent and diversity, and  fighting tirelessly to make life better for American people is a source  of inspiration for me and so many others.   It is also a privilege to be here with my good friend   Tom Cole,  someone who I respect greatly and who I know greatly respects this  institution. We sit on opposite ends of the dais, but I admire Mr.  Cole's leadership and the example he sets. Even when we don't see eye  to eye, I am proud of our work to build an atmosphere of respectful  dialogue on the Rules Committee.                                time  1715    We have done so not just among our Members but among our hardworking  staff, and I thank our minority and majority staff, led by Don Sisson  and Kelly Dixon, for all of their hard work.   I look forward to working with Mr. Cole and his team this Congress to  continue our collaboration on issues of shared concern.   Mr. Speaker, as Leader Jeffries put it so succinctly this weekend,  our Republican friends campaigned on the claim that they would fight  against inflation and fight for the American people. Instead, all they  have done is come to Washington and fight with each other.   In fact, what has become crystal clear over the past few days is the  extent to which the Republican Party has been hijacked by an extremist  MAGA faction, a faction not interested in governing but in their own  egos, a faction not interested in compromise but in their own power, a  faction not interested in putting people over politics but instead  interested in putting their own political ambition over the people we  serve.   Now here we are, nearly a week later, considering their deeply flawed  rules package, the first legislation on the floor by this new majority,  and they are using it to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics, attack  women's access to abortion, make it easier for big oil companies to  pollute, and interfere in ongoing criminal investigations into  President Trump.   They are making it easier for billionaires and big corporations to  avoid paying their taxes. Is that part of their contract with America?  Is that their big plan to help everyday people? Because most people who  read this package would think it must be a joke.   What I am concerned about is not just what is written down here. I am  concerned by the backroom deals that Speaker McCarthy made with the  Freedom Caucus in exchange for their votes. Like Republican  Congresswoman Nancy Mace said just this weekend: ``We don't have any  idea what promises were made.''   This is unconscionable. We are only 1 week into this, and this is how  they are running this place.   There is a report out by Punchbowl News, and let me read it. It said:  ``There is also a secret 3-page addendum that McCarthy and his allies  hashed out during several days of grueling negotiations with the House  Freedom Caucus. This pact includes the most controversial concessions  McCarthy made in order to become Speaker--three seats on the Rules  Committee for conservatives, freezing spending at FY 2022 levels, a  debt ceiling strategy, coveted committee assignments, and more.'' Is  that what the Majority Leader meant when he talked about a new day and  transparency?   These rules are not a serious attempt at governing. They are  essentially a ransom note to America from the extreme right. The same  Members of Congress who held this body hostage last week are the ones  who ran interference for the January 6 insurrectionists, who tried to  overturn a free and fair election.   Even the new Speaker of the House voted to overturn the 2020  elections. We couldn't even get a public acknowledgment from him on the  2-year anniversary of that horrific day, not even a tweet.   It is clear that Republicans welcomed the election deniers into their  ranks with open arms, and now they are reaping what they have sown. The  insurrectionists are in charge.   I am reminded of the words of President Kennedy: ``In the past, those  who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up  inside.''   The American people get it. They rejected extremism in the last two  elections. That is why they picked Joe Biden, and that is why the red  wave turned into a pink splash.   My Republican friends still aren't listening, and in fact, they are  still empowering the extremists. Don't take my word for it. Let's go  through their rules package.   They are giving a single Member the ability to remove the Speaker at  any time, letting a small, far-right faction hold their leadership  hostage.   They are trying to shut down criminal investigations into the former  President's wrongdoing.   They are making it easier to slash taxes on billionaire corporations  while dismantling the social safety net.   They are giving committee chairs unbalanced discretion over which  witnesses can testify; rejecting pandemic safety procedures like remote  voting; trying to force an end to congressional staff unionization; and  the icing on the cake, a new subcommittee to push QAnon conspiracies  and launch fake investigations into nonexistent scandals. What is next,  a rule requiring we all wear tinfoil hats?   This package is disrespectful, not just to this institution, but to  the people who sent us here to govern.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Congressional  Budget Office report from today titled: ``Estimated Budgetary Effects  of H.R. 23, the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act.''  This nonpartisan report says that the GOP's IRS funding bill will add  $114 billion to the national debt, so when people talk about taking  steps to reduce the national debt, I am not sure what they are talking  about.          [From the Congressional Budget Office, January 9, 2023]   Estimated Budgetary Effects of H.R. 23, the Family and Small Business                          Taxpayer Protection Act         Summary: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010       establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for       legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net       changes in outlays and revenues that are subject to those       procedures are shown above.        The Congressional Budget Office adheres to laws and       Congressional rules concerning the federal budget and to a       set of principles (called the Scorekeeping Guidelines)       created by the Congress. Those principles guide how the House       and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget       Office, and the Office of Management and Budget attribute       budgetary effects to legislation, with the goal of promoting       consistent treatment of estimated effects among those       agencies. (For more information on those guidelines, see       Congressional Budget Office, CBO Explains Budgetary       Scorekeeping Guidelines, January 2021, www.cbo.gov/  publication/56507.)        When a provision in an authorization bill provides funding       for administrative or program management activities, such as       when the IRS receives additional funding for administrative       activities, spending of those amounts can result in increases       in receipts. Guideline 14, however, directs scorekeepers to       exclude those increases when estimating the budgetary effects       of proposals that would provide additional mandatory funding       for such activities.        Guideline 14 was adopted in part to avert cases in which       possible, but uncertain, receipts were used to offset near-      term increases in spending resulting from the same bill. That       guideline is asymmetrical, however. That is, even though       increased receipts cannot be credited to a bill that would       increase administrative funding, estimated receipt losses       that might result from a decrease in such funding are       included in the estimated budgetary effects.        H.R. 23 would rescind unobligated funds provided by       paragraphs (1)(A)(ii), (1)(A)(iii), (1)(B), (2), (3), (4),       and (5) of section 10301 of Public Law 117-169. CBO estimates       that the bill would decrease outlays by $71 billion and       decrease receipts by $186 billion over the 2023-2032 period.       Both of those effects are included in accordance with       Guideline 14.

Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to bring up the Women's Health  Protection Act.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the  Record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu) to discuss our proposal.    We heard a lot about inflation, but none of the first  12 bills that my Republican friends are bringing up have anything to do  with inflation or mention inflation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.  DeGette).    Mr. Speaker, let me just remind my friends that over a  million Americans died of COVID, including a Member-elect who was  supposed to be sworn in in the last Congress. These remote procedures  undoubtedly saved lives of Members and staff here in this Chamber. So,  please, let's not diminish what the point of all that was about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is taking credit for the 72- hour rule, which we created in our rules package, but thank you very  much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Clark), the Democrat whip.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend that the first bill  they are doing is going to add $114 billion to the deficit. Enough.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Aguilar), who is the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman mentioned the 72-hour  rule. Once again, I will say: You are welcome. Then she talked about  this being the most open and transparent rule ever. Maybe the  gentlewoman can share with us the secret 3-page addendum that we are  reading about, because none of us have seen it. So much for  transparency. I guess she is not going to share that with us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District of  Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, again, for mentioning the 72-hour  rule which has been mentioned many times. But I wrote it, and I thank  the gentleman for keeping it.   But when I hear people talking about balanced budgets, give me a  break. The first bill that my friends are bringing to the floor,  according to CBO, adds $114 billion to the debt. We don't need any  lectures from anybody on that side about balancing the budget. Give me  a break.   Maybe the gentleman can, again, share with us the secret addendum  that apparently was negotiated behind closed doors, so we actually know  what agreements were made.  [[Page H67]]    Four days and 15 votes, and there is only one change in the rules  package going from five to be able to vacate the Chair to one. Well,  there is a lot more to it. We all know that, but that is a big secret.  So much for transparency.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).    Mr. Speaker, I would just say to the gentleman that in  the vast majority of cases we did comply with the 72-hour rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr.  Horsford).    Mr. Speaker, following the vote on the previous  question, Representative DeLauro will offer a motion to commit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro) to discuss that proposal.  [[Page H68]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Mr. Speaker, again, let me just ask, will anybody on  the other side share with us the secret 3-page addendum that Speaker  McCarthy negotiated with the Freedom Caucus so we can know what else  was decided on, given away? I guess not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for my friend, but  really? I mean, come on.   What were the last 4 days about? I mean, again, days and days, and 15  roll call votes, and reporting by multiple sources tell us that there  is this signed agreement with the House Freedom Caucus that deals with  some of the most controversial concessions.   So, you know, I know it exists. It will come out sooner or later.  Everybody is talking about transparency and openness. It would be nice  if there was a little bit more transparency and openness from the other  side.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, let me continue what I was beginning in  the last exchange.   At least one GOP office apparently has the much-fabled 3-page House  rules addendum. ``We are taking a look at it . . . we're just going  through it,'' Rep.   Ken Calvert, a Steering Committee member, tells  Axios. Asked if Members have received a copy: ``I don't know if  everybody has.''   Again, don't come to the floor and talk about transparency and  openness and a new day. This is backroom politics. That is what this is  about, secret deals that no one is going to know anything about until  it is too late.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from  Oklahoma how many more speakers he has?    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, as well, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the last time House Republicans were in charge, they  ended their time in power with a government shutdown. They controlled  the House, the Senate, and the White House, and they shut the  government down and walked away.   Upon taking power once again, they began with a legislative shutdown,  a shutdown where a far-right fringe held the incoming Republican  leadership hostage and got them to give away everything, including  their own dignity.   What is clear from all of this is that the Republican Party no longer  cares about governing. This rules package is exhibit number one.   The American people sent us here because they want us to put people  over politics. Sadly, this rules package puts politics first,  empowering the extremists who are only interested in their own power.   As I have said again and again, if this new majority wants to work  together in good faith, my door is open. If this is their plan, they  have clearly chosen to become a party that embraces election deniers  and extremists, and Democrats will not go along to get along.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that I have had some harsh words for  this rules package. Call it ``tough love.'' I care very deeply about  this institution, about the work we do here, and the awesome  responsibility of the decisions we make. I am glad that my friends kept  the McGovern rule on the 72-hour and the McGovern rule that committees  have to do hearings and markups before they come to the Rules  Committee.   We weren't perfect, but overwhelmingly we kept our word.   This legislation does a great disservice to the people we represent,  and it does not live up to the high standards that we should have for  this institution. I believe that calling this House to a higher  standard is the right thing to do.   But let me be clear that my criticism is reserved for the resolution  we are considering and not for the distinguished gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), whom I respect and admire as a person even when we  strongly disagree, as we do today.   These rules are a giveaway to the far right, but this Congress need  not be. If my Republican colleagues want to get anything done, it is  clear that they are going to have to work together with Democrats to  get things done.   Let's end the extremism and put people over politics to get stuff  done.   People do not want government shutdowns.   People do not want to see us default on our financial obligations.   People want us to get stuff done and to keep the lights on.   The last two elections were a rejection of extremism. My friends  predicted an overwhelmingly Republican majority in the last election,  and instead, they got a pink splash because the American people,  Democrats, Independents, and a lot of Republicans said: You are too  extreme.   So put the extremism behind you. I urge the Speaker to work with  Democrats and not just work with the small fringe group in the  Republican Conference, but to work in a way to move the people's agenda  forward.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, a ``no'' on the previous  question, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H70]]         Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
