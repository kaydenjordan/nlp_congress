 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 725, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1153) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to  improve upon the definitions provided for points and fees in connection  with a mortgage transaction, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.  [[Page H907]]    The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1153         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). Pursuant to House  Resolution 725, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and submit extraneous material on H.R. 1153, currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                                time  0915     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1153, the Mortgage  Choice Act of 2017.   I would like to start out thanking my colleague, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) for his tireless leadership on this issue,  having ushered this very same legislation through our committee in  three different Congresses.   The purpose of H.R. 1153 is simple: to provide much-needed regulatory  red tape relief to our community financial institutions so they can  serve their customers; so they can provide them more mortgages. This is  a straightforward piece of legislation. It is practical, it is  necessary, and, Madam Speaker, it is bipartisan.   Now, you may hear today, Madam Speaker, from some of our Democratic  colleagues that ``we oppose the bill.'' We heard that claim in the  Rules Committee earlier this week. But I do find it interesting that no  amendments were offered during committee markup, nor were any  amendments offered at the Rules Committee. I remind all on the House  floor, Madam Speaker, that the Financial Services Committee favorably  reported this bill to the House with a strong bipartisan vote of 46-13,  which means almost half of the Democrats on our committee supported  this bill; and in the 113th Congress, Madam Speaker, this bill passed  by voice vote--not a single objection.   Madam Speaker, this bill would help make homeownership more  affordable for working Americans and would promote access to affordable  mortgage credit for low- and moderate-income families and first-time  home buyers. It does this while continuing to protect consumers.   The Mortgage Choice Act is needed because the CFPB wrote a flawed and  problematic definition that grossly miscalculates points and fees. The  result is that many mortgage loans, particularly those for low- and  moderate-income borrowers, would not meet the standards of a qualified  mortgage and thus not get made.   Currently, CFPB rules include affiliated title charges under a 3  percent cap when determining whether a mortgage is a qualified  mortgage, but it doesn't include unaffiliated. This does not make  sense. The CFPB rules are detrimental, again, to low- and moderate- income borrowers and first-time home buyers since they are more likely  to have smaller loan amounts and, therefore, more easily trigger the 3  percent cap.   That means under the current definition, many mortgage applicants  will be denied homeownership opportunities simply because they do not  fit into the government box; or the only mortgages in the alternative  available to them might be at far higher interest rates, making them  unaffordable for many. In other words, the CFPB's defective definition  has ended up protecting many consumers right out of their opportunity  to buy a home.   H.R. 1153, from the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), would  change the way points and fees are calculated by excluding fees paid  for affiliated title charges and escrow charges for insurance and  taxes. That would, therefore, Madam Speaker, increase homeownership  opportunities for borrowers by allowing more loans to meet the QM  standard.   Let's not just listen to me, Madam Speaker. Let's listen to our  community financial institutions that we expect to help our  constituents. A credit union from Washington explained how this was  affecting everyday Americans.   They wrote: ``A member at our credit union wanted to buy down his  rate on his mortgage with cash out of pocket at closing in order to  lower the payments for his retirement. However, doing so would have  made his total points and fees higher than allowed under ATR/QM, and  there was no allowable way around the problem.''   From my native Texas, a community banker wrote in and said: ``The  greatest frustration our customers have is our bank's inability to now  make home loans. For years we made loans to people for the purchase of  their homes. We would do about one every other week. So it was not a  large volume. It was a good service. We always made these loans to keep  in our loan portfolio. We never sold any home loans, but with the new  requirements for home loans, it has driven us out of this kind of  business. It has also taken us out of the construction lending on homes  because we cannot risk the risk of a takeout commitment failing. The  consumer is the loser.''   Indeed, that is true, Madam Speaker. As I mentioned earlier, Mr.  Huizenga has worked on this bill for the past two Congresses again. In  the 113th Congress, it passed by voice vote. It passed by an  overwhelming majority of 286-140 in the 114th Congress. I trust the  third time will be the charm.   I urge all of my colleagues to do what is right for our constituents  and to pass H.R. 1153 to provide open access for Americans to purchase  a home.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1153, the so-called  Mortgage Choice Act of 2017.   Unfortunately, this bill is yet another attempt to undermine the  strong consumer protections Democrats established under the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, taking us back to the  days of the subprime bubble.   While some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  forgotten those days, I haven't. I remember how predatory lenders  targeted unsuspecting home buyers by hiding fees and obscuring loan  costs, tricking them into exploding mortgages and locking them into  loans that they really couldn't afford.   Millions of home buyers were steered into high-cost, subprime loans  even  [[Page H908]]  when they qualified for prime mortgages, and lenders didn't even bother  to verify whether or not borrowers had the ability to repay their  mortgages. They weren't required to do that, so they didn't. The end  result was rampant fraud on a massive scale to millions of foreclosures  and a tremendous loss of generational wealth, particularly for  Black homeowners. Some of my constituents are still struggling and  trying to recover from the financial devastation that occurred during  this financial crisis.    The last thing Congress should do is to open the door to a return to  these fraudulent and harmful policies, yet that is exactly what H.R.  1153 would do. This bill seems like a technical fix to allow affiliated  title insurance and settlement services firms to be excluded from the  qualified mortgage rule's 3 percent cap on upfront points and fees paid  by borrowers. But make no mistake, there is nothing technical about  this. In fact, this bill would allow title insurance companies to jack  up prices on borrowers and allow lenders to receive what would  otherwise be illegal kickbacks.   Under this bill, lenders, including repeat offender megabanks, like  Wells Fargo, would have new opportunities to reap huge financial  profits at their customers' expense by steering them into costly title  insurance policies that have no cap on fees whatsoever.   Prior to the enactment of Dodd-Frank, lenders were able to earn  tremendous profits through lucrative kickbacks paid by their  affiliates. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA,  prohibits giving a fee kickback or thing of value in exchange for a  referral of business related to a real estate settlement service. But  this kickback prohibition does not apply to affiliated companies of  lenders, like a title insurance firm. To avail themselves of this  kickback loophole, some lenders have bought or created businesses to  enable them to profit directly from the relationship.   So Dodd-Frank established the responsible underwriting practice of  requiring lenders to verify a borrower's ability to repay when they  originate a loan. Dodd-Frank also enabled lenders to obtain some legal  protections when making residential mortgages if those loans are  considered a qualified mortgage or QM.   To be considered QM, a loan must have terms and conditions that are  understandable to borrowers and not contain predatory features  considered to be unfair or deceptive. QM loans, for example, can't be  interest-only loans, longer than 30 years, or have balloon payments.  Specific to the bill we are considering today, the amount of upfront  points and fees on QM loans cannot exceed 3 percent of the total amount  of the loan.   In short, QM loans are supposed to be low risk, prudently  underwritten, and free from the type of features associated with those  predatory mortgages that trapped borrowers in loans they couldn't  afford and that led to the financial crisis.   The points and fees cap included under the QM definition includes,  among other things, real estate-related fees paid to affiliates of the  lender for services, such as property appraisals, settlement services,  and title insurance. Fees paid to affiliates of the lender pose greater  risks to borrowers since lenders cannot steer borrowers directly to  their affiliates without open competition, and higher prices charged by  affiliates directly benefit the lenders.   Affiliate title insurance is especially problematic. The title  insurance industry is notoriously opaque. Due to a lack of competition  and readily available information on terms and pricing, consumers do  not shop around for title insurance as they might for other products  and services. Megabanks, like Wells Fargo, have used title insurance to  take advantage of consumers through illegal kickbacks schemes.   The Consumer Bureau took an enforcement action in 2015 against Wells  Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, ordering those megabanks to pay more than $24  million in civil penalties and more than $11 million to consumers  harmed by their kickback schemes with Genuine Title, a now defunct  title company.   At the time, Director Cordray said: ``These banks allowed their loan  officers to focus on their own illegal financial gain rather than on  treating consumers fairly. Our action today to address these practices  should serve as a warning for all those in the mortgage market.''   Madam Speaker, these kickback schemes continue despite Congress'  efforts to shut them down, and would likely increase if H.R. 1153 is  enacted. Because H.R. 1153 would remove fees that are charged by a  lender's affiliate title insurance company from the QM fee cap, the  bill directly encourages lenders to, once again, steer borrowers to  their affiliates so they can extract even more money from them.   Now, supporters of the bill argue that, because individual States  provide adequate regulation over the title insurance industry, it is  unnecessary, they say, to have additional safeguards related to  affiliated title companies and the fees they charge. However, research  from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows that  State laws do not, by themselves, offer robust protection to consumers  with title insurance. More than half of all States don't even collect  data from title agents. Some States have ``no particular standard'' for  determining whether title insurance rates are adequate, and even a  couple, like Illinois and Arkansas, do not regulate title insurance  rates at all.    Congress should be strengthening prohibitions on kickbacks, not  weakening them. We should enable borrowers to get the best price,  terms, and conditions on mortgage loans instead of creating more ways  for these megabanks, like Wells Fargo, to gouge American consumers.   When Congress considered this same measure last term, the Obama  administration issued a veto threat, stating that the bill ``risked  eroding consumer protections and returning the mortgage market to the  days of careless lending focused on short-term profits.''   Madam Speaker, buying a home is likely the largest purchase most  consumers will ever make. For this reason alone, Congress should  absolutely reject proposals like H.R. 1153 that would permit  residential mortgage lenders to take advantage of borrowers trying to  achieve the American Dream.   Finally, a long list of groups, including civil rights groups, such  as the NAACP and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,  as well as consumer groups at the National, State, and local level,  like Americans for Financial Reform, National Consumer Law Center, and  the Center for Responsible Lending, all oppose this so-called Mortgage  Choice Act.   So for all of these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me  in opposing H.R. 1153.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to say that,  if the ranking member would read section 8(a) of RESPA, she would  realize everything she said was false because it prevents any fee,  kickback, or thing of value.   Second of all, what she describes as a harmful and fraudulent policy  was supported by half of her Democrats, including her vice ranking  member, Mr. Kildee from Michigan.   Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), who is the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of  the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investments.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chair of the Committee on Armed  Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased now to yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), a cosponsor of the  legislation and a great friend of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we could not be more highly honored that the minority  leader would take such an interest in H.R. 1533, the Mortgage Choice  Act.   I am reminded that there are Members who come to this great Chamber  to make speeches, and there are those who come to make laws. When it  comes to speeches, I would note that the Gettysburg Address came in at  2 minutes, and Americans may think it had greater eloquence.   I would note that as the minority leader quoted the Bible frequently  throughout her speech, it reminds me of Isaiah 1:18, ``Come now, let us  reason together, says the Lord.''   Yet President Trump stood right there in the State of the Union  Address with his hand out with an olive branch extending an open hand  to work with Members of both parties on an immigration reform package.  He offered a fair compromise. He offered a fair compromise, and,  instead, the minority leader slapped his hand and called it insulting,  Mr. Speaker. She called it lame. She called it dangerous.   This is not someone who has come to this Chamber, the people's House,  in order to make law. The President didn't offer legalization. He  offered a pathway to citizenship. He didn't offer this for 700,000. He  offered it for 1.8 million. He said:         Let's secure our borders, and let's make sure that       immigrants who come to this country come legally and come       with their sleeves rolled up coming to work and build       America.    There are those who want to solve a problem, and there are those who  want to exacerbate a problem for the election.   Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans need the opportunity to  get mortgages to buy their part of the American Dream. Everything that  the ranking member said, she ought to share it with her own Democrats  because half of them on our committee support H.R. 1533 which is good  for America and good for prospective home buyers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all House Members to adopt it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 725, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
