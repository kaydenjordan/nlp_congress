 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the 100th birthday of  my constituent, World War II veteran, Joe Juarez, a member of the  Greatest Generation.   Joe was born in Fullerton, California. While growing up, his favorite  sport was baseball.   In 1942, Joe and his high school baseball team were on their way to  the CIF championship game, but they never made it because Joe and his  teammates were drafted and served in World War II.   As a private first class, Joe fought in the Pacific and was awarded  the Asia-Pacific Campaign Medal and a World War II Victory Medal. Joe  spent 2\1/2\ years in the Pacific before returning home. Several of his  teammates, including one of his brothers, never made it back.   Joe and his wife, Novel, were married for 68 years and raised three  children.   Throughout his life, Joe has never forgotten his Band of Brothers who  gave the ultimate sacrifice for this great country.   Happy birthday, Joe. Happy birthday. You are a true American hero.                            ____________________
