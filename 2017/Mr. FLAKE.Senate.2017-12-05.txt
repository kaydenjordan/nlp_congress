 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today with increasing concern about  the uncertain future facing DACA recipients. There are nearly 800,000  DACA recipients. They are children who were brought across the border,  through no fault of their own, years and years ago. There are nearly  800,000 across the country and nearly 50,000 just in Arizona alone.  They have protections now from deportation, but those protections will  run out around the first of March.   Despite the sense of urgency to solve the problem by the end of the  year, there is very little legislative progress to show for it. The  time has come for us to work together to deliver a real solution. We  don't need partisan bills that send a message; we need bipartisan  solutions that can pass the Senate.   We have spent so much time operating under reconciliation that it is  worth reminding people that this measure will need 60 votes in order to  succeed. So much of the legislation we have been considering has been  under reconciliation, with just a 51-vote margin being sufficient. That  will not be the case with a fix for DACA. We need to get 60 votes. That  means if we hope to protect DACA recipients, both sides will need to  compromise.   These individuals whom we seek to help are students, employees,  colleagues, and friends. They don't know any other home but the United  States. They have embraced the values of hard work and perseverance,  and, in turn, their communities have embraced them as their own. Some  of the most compelling pleas on behalf of these young people have come  from those who know them best. These kids are not just Americans in  their own eyes; they are Americans in the eyes of their friends, their  classmates, their teachers, and their coworkers.   We all recognize that these kids were brought here, as I mentioned,  through no fault of their own. No one wants to see them deported. As  leaders of a nation of immigrants, we need to work together and deliver  a chance for them to have a bright future. We need workable legislation  that can realistically be passed and signed into law. We don't need to  make a statement; we need to make a law.   There are many challenges facing us with regard to immigration, but  protecting these young people should not be one of those challenges.  This should be the easy lift.   I hope we can all work together in a bipartisan way to find a  solution for these kids who deserve a solution.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.    Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
