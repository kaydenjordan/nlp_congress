 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to set the record straight on  the President's border wall--quite frankly, something he didn't talk  about much last night during his speech to the country. But the truth  is, this is where the problem is. So I want to talk about it a little  bit today.   The President made it crystal clear--dozens of times, in fact--that  he was prepared to shut down the government in order to get the $5.7  billion for the wall, leading up to that speech last night. So here we  are today, day 19 of President Trump's shutdown. Political  gamesmanship? Well, that is nothing new in Washington, DC, but the fact  is, our debates need to be grounded in facts. So here are the facts:   The President's demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall is tall in  hyperbole and wide on theatrics but short on facts.   Last night, the President said that Congress has refused to provide  the resources needed to secure the border. That is not true. In fiscal  year 2018, Congress gave the President $1.3 billion to construct  fencing and other fixed structures along the southern border. I know so  because I worked side by side with my Republican colleagues to write  that bill. Today, not one of those projects is under construction--not  one.   Strong border security is much more than physical barriers. Congress  appropriated $21 billion for immigration enforcement and border  security in last year's Homeland Security Appropriations Act. That  includes money to expand manpower, increase technology, and utilize  communication services and resources on top of funding for physical  barriers.   Here is another fact: Hard narcotics likes meth and cocaine and  opioids are not coming over the border in backpacks; they are coming  through our ports in cars and trucks. We have the technology to fix  that, so let's appropriate the money toward real solutions at our ports  to stop the drugs from entering our country, not $5.7 billion for a  wall.   So, again, let's stick to the facts. Despite having more than $21  billion in border security and immigration enforcement funding,  including funds for physical barriers, the President has shut down the  government to demand another $5.7 billion exclusively for a wall.   One would think to ask, what would you possibly spend $5.7 billion  on, especially after already having $21 billion to spend on border  security and immigration enforcement? And we did ask him that. We asked  him for a plan. We told the President and Homeland Security Secretary  Nielsen that if they are going to break their promise to have Mexico  pay for the wall and use American taxpayer dollars, they ought to  produce a plan of action.   The plan we received in late December was incomplete--no analysis of  alternative technologies, no analysis on the impact to communities, to  landowners, to wildlife. And that plan only asked for $1.6 billion, not  the $5.7 billion the President is now demanding.   The President has also failed to address private property rights and  eminent domain. What is he going to do if a family refuses to sell off  wide tracts of their farm or ranch to allow a wall to go through and  split their ranch, divide their ranch? Are families going to cede their  water and mineral rights? Is the administration prepared to enter into  good-faith negotiations with literally thousands of families? And do we  know how much that is going to cost the American taxpayer?   These questions need answers. Yet, with these questions still  unanswered, there are folks in this body, the U.S. Senate, who are  prepared to write a $5.7 billion check to the President right now.   So here we are on day 19 of the President's shutdown. During the  President's speech last night, he was right about one thing: There is a  crisis taking shape in our country. But it is not the crisis on the  southern border that he is trying to manufacture. As a result of the  President's shutdown, there are 19,000 border agents today who are  working without pay. There are 51,000 TSA agents working without pay.  These are hard-working folks. They have families, they have mortgages,  and they are being forced by the President to secure our country's  borders and ports and airports while not knowing when their next  paycheck will arrive.   I have heard from Border Patrol agents who moved across the country  at their own expense so that they could be stationed along Montana's  northern border. How have they been repaid for their willingness to  serve? Well, they are not being paid. Not only do they have to absorb  the moving costs, but now they have to pay for rent and cover other  essential costs without a paycheck, and they are continually wondering  when they will get paid next.   Look, at the end of last year, CBP's recruitment efforts finally  started to bear fruit. For the first time in years, CBP began to  achieve gains in hiring border agents. This shutdown not only could,  but I believe it will set back those efforts dramatically. Who could  blame a family for passing on a job that could force you to work for  free?   The President talked last night of a ``sacred duty to America.'' I  can think of few things more un-American than withholding pay from  someone after an honest day's work.   But it is not just those stationed at the border and at our airports  who are hurting because of the President's shutdown. I am going to give  a small sample of letters and emails I have received from the folks  from the great State of Montana since the shutdown began.   Ronald from western Montana says this:         I spoke to my son, a career Coast Guard member. He tells me       that the Coast Guard is being directed to continue their       duties without being paid due to this ridiculous shutdown.       Senator, that is not right! Why do these brave men and women       have to continue to risk their lives without being paid? My       boy is worried about being evicted from his apartment with       two young daughters and a wife because they won't receive       their housing allowance! Please help fix this un-American       situation.    Shilo from Bozeman writes:         I and other federal employees have been converted into       political footballs for partisan politicians. My Christmas       vacation was canceled and pay has been suspended during a       time when some of us need the money the most. We are being       disadvantaged and made to suffer while the comfortable and       blithely unaffected cling to their arbitrary political       ideologies and refuse to compromise.    Daren from northeast Montana:         I have a farm equipment loan that is at a standstill       because the USDA is not picking up the phone. I have       contractors and vendors who are waiting to be paid. The       impact of this shutdown will last long after it ends.    Debra from Indian Country:         My daughters are federal employees proudly serving the       Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana through the Indian Health       Service. My daughters are both enrolled members of the       Northern Cheyenne Tribe, and both are single, hardworking       mothers. My granddaughters are afraid their moms won't be       able to pay the bills or buy groceries if the paychecks don't       arrive. Morale is horrid in Lame Deer.        Please stop this immoral shutdown. It is very unfair to       hardworking people like my daughters. They must work but will       not get a paycheck this Friday if the shutdown continues.    Mr. President, this is what a crisis looks like, and this is a crisis  you have created.   The President barely mentioned the wall last night in his address to  the Nation. Yet we are here on day 19 of a government shutdown that is  a direct result of his wish to build a wall from sea to shining sea.   It is time for the Senate to be the Senate. It is time for the folks  in this body to quit making decisions based on politics and start  making them based on facts.   The facts in this case are clear. There is no plan for $5.7 billion  for a border wall, Mexico will not pay for it, and the dysfunction of  this administration  [[Page S92]]  is causing real turmoil in the lives of 800,000 workers and their  families.   I am calling on the majority to bring some common sense to this  situation and to stand behind the bipartisan legislation that  Republicans and Democrats have passed over the last several months-- over the last month in particular--to reopen the government and put an  end to this crisis.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
