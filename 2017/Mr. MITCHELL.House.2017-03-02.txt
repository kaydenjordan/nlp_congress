 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 1004.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 1004 is sponsored by Representative Tim Walberg, my colleague  from Michigan. Cosponsors include Representative Farenthold,  Representative Meadows, Representative Gosar, and myself.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of  2017.   Every year, agencies promulgate thousands of new regulations and  impose billions of dollars in regulatory costs on the American public.  Those rules are conceived of, developed, written, and imposed by  unelected agency officials--bureaucrats.   In return for the authority to issue regulations, Congress and the  American people require two simple things from agencies. First,  agencies must inform the public about their intended regulatory  actions--early and accurately--to provide ample time for thoughtful  feedback and consideration from the public. Second, we want the  agencies to listen to what the public has to say about the proposed  regulatory action.   Making sure the public has an opportunity to participate in this  process is key. The public comment period is an essential part of  upholding our democratic values. It ensures Americans have a voice  heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process.   H.R. 1004 helps preserve and strengthen the integrity of the public  comment process in several ways. First, the bill defines the parameters  of how an agency should communicate when asking for and offering a  proposal and asking for public feedback. H.R. 1004 requires the agency  to identify itself in communications on the proposal. Imagine that. We  ask them to identify themselves. The agency must clearly state whether  it is accepting comments or considering alternatives.   Most importantly, agency communications during this process must use  a neutral, unbiased tone. This bill requires agencies to do only what  you would expect them to do if the request for feedback was genuine and  sincere. This bill will uphold the purpose and value of the notice and  comment process enshrined in the Administrative Procedures Act.   When issuing new regulations, agencies must provide notice of the  regulation and accept comments from the public before finalizing the  regulation. Often, regulated entities, small businesses, and subject- matter experts can provide new insights and perspectives agency  officials simply do not have and do not understand. The notice and  comment period allows the public to provide valuable insight to the  agencies to help them make better regulations, more effective  regulations, and minimize the adverse impacts.   However, not every agency takes this opportunity to really listen to  the public. Often, agencies develop a proposed regulation and assume it  is the end of the story. In effect, agencies reduce the notice and  comment process to checking the box.   A perfect example, unfortunately, is when EPA developed the waters of  the United States rule, known as WOTUS, EPA's behavior during the  notice and comment period indicated that the EPA had little interest in  listening to the public. Quite the contrary.   EPA used Thunderclap, an online social media platform, to disseminate  government-sourced messages through unaffiliated individuals to  encourage the public to provide positive comments. They did not  identify themselves and used a third party to source comments that  would support their  [[Page H1470]]  perspective. The goal was clearly to pad the administrative record with  positive feedback rather than soliciting genuine input in an effort to  measure the rule's effect on the public.   In fact, the Government Accountability Office found the EPA undertook  a covert propaganda campaign by soliciting social media comments in  support of their proposed rule. Let me say that again: a covert  propaganda campaign.   GAO also told EPA to report this violation to the President and  Congress because the agency's appropriations were not available for  those prohibited purposes. They spent taxpayer money--our money--on  something that was prohibited.   H.R. 1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, seeks to shine a  light on how agencies are communicating about pending regulatory  actions. This bill simply tells agencies they need to keep to the facts  and avoid soliciting support when they ought to be soliciting comments.   H.R. 1004 also establishes transparency requirements for the agency  in how it communicates to the public. The bill requires agencies to  post on their website some basic information about each communication  about a pending regulatory action. For each communication, the public  will be able to see a copy of the communication, the intended audience,  the method of communication, and the date it was issued--simple  transparency expectations. Additionally, H.R. 1004 requires agencies to  post information online about each of their regulatory actions.   Mr. Chairman, the Regulatory Integrity Act will bring integrity back  to the rulemaking process with transparency and simple guidelines for  effective and appropriate communication.   The Regulatory Integrity Act is a good, bipartisan bill. This bill  received support in the previous Congress, and the House of  Representatives passed the bill last Congress.   On February 14, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government  Reform approved this bill without amendment.   I thank Congressman Walberg for his leadership on this issue. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who is my colleague and good  friend.  [[Page H1471]]                                     time  0930     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, one thing is clear to me, even as a freshman: we need  to correct the record here.   My colleague from the minority suggests that somehow, magically, the  GAO just determined they were the police officer, they cried foul, they  stopped them.   Let's be clear about this. First, the GAO intervened because they  were asked to do so by Chairman Inhofe. They investigated after the  chairman asked them to look into it because of the concerns; not in  advance, not because they found it independently, but because it was  such a significant and egregious action that the chairman of the  committee said: We need to look at this. And they did so.   Second, it was after the fact. What they found was that it was so  extraordinarily egregious, they actually cited them for inappropriately  spending taxpayer money.   Now, let's talk about what they did. We talk about chilling  communication. Knowingly, why would you put out something on a social  media site such as Thunderclap sourcing messages, not identifying  yourself, if for any other purpose but to create propaganda? Why would  you do that?   H.R. 1004 simply requires--and I will repeat them, because the  minority seems to have a problem understanding this--the agency  identified itself in its communication on a proposal: hello, this is  the EPA. We are talking about this problem.   They make clear they are accepting public comments for and against:  What do you think about it; what are the problems; will this work?  Imagine that concept.   They require that agencies provide feedback on the comments that is  genuine and sincere and not have already written the final bill--as my  colleagues says, the perfunctory process.   That is what it requires. I have a difficult time understanding how  that chills input from the public. And to be absolutely blunt with you,  if it chills a few bureaucrats from deciding what they think is best  rather than what this body believes is best, or, frankly, what the  courts believe is best, then we have achieved our objective here today.   So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will make my statement brief. As you  know, I believe in a little bit of brevity around here. Let me suggest  that we have talked at length on the content of the bill and the intent  of the bill. Let me suggest that my colleague may have used the wrong  example or analogy because we all know, where there is one mosquito,  there is more. Where there is one, there is more. At this point in  time, this bill says we are going to take care of his mosquitoes. With  all due respect, I ask my colleagues to support the bill, as I believe  it puts the transparency required in rulemaking that will require  agencies to disclose they are asking for comments and who is making the  comment. It is one more step in getting the government accountable to  the people rather than accountable to itself.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
