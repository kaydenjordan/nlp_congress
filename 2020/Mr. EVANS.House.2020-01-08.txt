 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chairperson of  the Small Business Committee, Chairwoman Velazquez, for yielding. The  gentlewoman has, in the 3 years that I have been here, led this  committee in a very positive direction, and also as the ranking member  before she became chair. Ranking Member Chabot has also been a partner  in this effort. I thank him too for his leadership of working together.   I thank Mr. Hagedorn from the great State of Minnesota, which is one  of my favorite places--Sleepy Eye, Minnesota--the gentleman knows that  I know about Sleepy Eye--as well as Mr. Joyce, who is a colleague from  Pennsylvania. I thank my colleagues for their leadership on this bill.   The well-being of our communities depend in part on what we do to  create circumstances where small businesses can thrive. When small  businesses thrive, Americans enjoy great economic security. In my home  city of Philadelphia, minorities constitute about 65 percent of the  population. Yet, they constitute 80 percent of those in poverty.   Coupled with the fact that the city has a poverty rate of nearly 25  percent, creating economic opportunity for minorities is critical to  advance well-being: financially, physically, and socially.   We, as Members of Congress, have tools in our toolbox to address  economic disparity. One of those is H.R. 5146. This bill will allow  small businesses to compete more fairly with large businesses by  permitting small businesses to create past performance records.   A past performance record is integral to winning federal contracts,  but small businesses are prevented from establishing one.   Most of the work of minority-owned small businesses does not count  towards past performance, such as work in joint ventures or as  subcontractors to prime contractors.   This hurts small businesses' ability to bid, compete, and win  contracts as primes. In turn, it impairs the business' ability to grow,  create jobs, and contribute economically to the community.                                time  1545    With the passage of this bipartisan bill into law, we will create  circumstances where all small businesses, including minority-owned  small businesses, will be better equipped to compete and thrive.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chair again for her leadership and the  staff, too, for working together collectively to make this happen. I  invite all of my colleagues to support passage of this bill.
