 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the United States remains in the grip of an overdose  pandemic, unfortunately. I rise today in support of the Extending  Temporary Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act.   Madam Speaker, 3 years ago, DEA temporarily scheduled fentanyl  analogues as controlled substances to crack down on China and drug  traffickers smuggling fentanyl across the southern border. Last year,  Congress passed the temporary extension that continued to criminalize  fentanyl analogues until May 6 of this year.   Previously, drug traffickers could slightly change the molecules in  the drug, so the formula was not technically considered fentanyl and  was not prohibited, although it was still potent, leading to a lethal  game of whack-a-mole.   Madam Speaker, locally, we have seen that fentanyl has been a major  problem, even with the scheduling in place. Pasco County, in my  district,  [[Page H2027]]  has already had 48 people die from overdoses since January of this  year, and many communities throughout the country are experiencing the  same overdose increases as the pandemic has only exacerbated the mental  health and addiction crisis in our country.    Madam Speaker, if this scheduling ban expires, we expect far more  fentanyl to flood our streets and many more lives to be tragically  lost. We cannot allow this to happen.   I urge my colleagues to join us in extending this current ban and to  work together in a bipartisan manner on a permanent solution--it must  be a priority--a permanent solution to this scourge.
