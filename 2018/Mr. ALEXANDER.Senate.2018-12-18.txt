 Mr. President, before the Senator from Maine speaks, I  thank the Senator from Ohio for his generous comments.   I defer to the Senator from Maine.    I thank the Senator from Maine and the Senator from  Ohio. I often say to my constituents in Tennessee that they might look  at Washington, DC, as if it were a split-screen television. On one  side, for example, we had in September all the mudslinging back and  forth during the Judge Kavanaugh hearings, but on the other side of the  screen, at the very same time, in the very same Senate, in the very  same Capitol, we had 72 Senators working together on opioids  legislation. Senator Portman played a major role in that. We had the  songwriters bill that Senator Hatch and I had been working on for 15  years. We had appropriations bills with a fourth year of biomedical  funding. And we had, coming out of the Interior and Energy Committees  in our Senate by a vote of 19 to 4 in the Senate and unanimously in the  House, a piece of legislation sponsored by Senator Portman, Senator  Warner, Senator King, and me--and others--that will do more for our  national parks system than has been done in 50 years.   I don't know how often my colleagues here--someone says: Well, why  don't you guys ever do anything? Why don't you stop arguing with each  other? Just on the floor a moment ago, I heard the Senator from New  Jersey talk about a prison sentencing bill that the Senator from Utah  was talking about at lunch in the Republican caucus, and then President  Trump was talking to me about it on Sunday night. They are all for it.  It is a huge change in prison sentencing.   I mentioned a number of bills. So on the side of the split-screen  television, which is the problem-solving part of the U.S. Senate, there  is the Restore Our Parks Act, the Portman-Warner-King-Alexander bill  that will do more for the national parks system--the 418 units of it-- than anything in a half century. It not only has our support, it has in  the House of Representatives 228 bipartisan supporters. It has in the  U.S. Senate 37 of our 100 Members already, and I suspect it will have  more, and it is strongly supported by President Trump. It has 100  conservation groups for it.   Let's think about that for a minute. What else can you think of that  has President Trump, 100 conservation groups, 228 House Members, and 37  Senators in favor of it that is such a good idea? I can think of  nothing else. For example, in the Smoky Mountains--and Senator Portman  and his family have been there, at our home, more than once; he is a  great outdoorsman, he is a great leader for the national parks in many  areas--there is a Look Rock Campground that has been closed for several  years. We would have 5,000 families visit it if it were open. The  problem with it is the roof leaks and the bathrooms don't work, so it  is closed. We are going to fix that, but it is true all over the  country.   So I guess the logical question is, Why don't we go ahead and pass  it? The problem is the way we pay for it. Senator Portman is a former  Budget Director, and Senator King discussed the funding of the issue.  It is because we paid for it with something we call mandatory funding.  But it is not the kind of mandatory funding that we usually worry about  in the Senate. That is when we borrow money and use it to pay for  Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, other entitlements, and that is  running our debt way up. All of us are worried about that. This is  different in three ways. The Senator from Maine talked about it. This  is really debt that we are reducing. Deferred maintenance is debt, and  this is the backlog that we intend to fix.   The second issue is that we are using real money. We are not  borrowing money to spend; we are taking money from drilling for oil or  for gas or for other energy on revenue, paying for other needs, and  then we are using some of that money--up to $6.5 billion, I believe--to  pay for about half of the deferred maintenance needs of the national  parks system. That is not a budget gimmick; that is real money to  reduce debt.   Then it is, in one other way, not the same as the mandatory funding  we often talk about here; it is authorized only for 5 years. It is a  limited, targeted program using real money to reduce debt. It is  supported by Republicans and Democrats, the Senate and the House, the  Office of Management and Budget, the Trump administration, and the  President himself.   So I agree with the Senator from Maine, and I congratulate the  Senator from Ohio. He and Senator Warner of Virginia were the two  Senators who came up with this idea, working with conservation groups.  Senator King and I had a similar idea, and we put the bills together.  We thought the right person to be the principal sponsor is the former  Budget Director, Senator Portman, because we are talking about spending  money, and Senator Warner, who has been such a leader in the area, and  Senator King.   So I agree that we ought to pass it this week with that kind of  support. It is a terrific idea that almost all Americans will support.  But if it doesn't pass this week, it ought to be the first order of  business in the first month we get back. I look forward to working with  the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Maine to help accomplish  that.    I thank my colleagues. I will conclude the colloquy,  if that is all right with Senator King and Senator Portman, and then I  ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes to speak about Senator Hatch.    Prior to doing that, I want to join Senator Portman in  acknowledging the leadership of Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, along  with the conservation community, in developing the bones of this bill.  We had competing bills; he and Senator Portman were out there first, so  we did what we should do. We put them together, and look at the result.  That happens a lot more than people notice. When an airplane lands  safely, it is not news; when it crashes, it is. This is an example of  one landing safely. My prediction is that if all of those 100  conservation groups and all of those Senators in Congress who already  support this will sign up with this quickly in January, we can get this  train moving, and we can begin to fix the roofs and repair the  bathrooms and build the roads and take America's best idea--our  national parks--and make it what the American people expect it to be.   I thank Senator Portman and Senator King for their leadership as  well.    Mr. President, in 1976, it was not a particularly good  time in the Republican Party. Watergate had decimated the Republican  Party in 1974, and the hangover still existed in 1976. But one good  thing that happened was the election of Orrin Hatch from Utah to the  U.S. Senate.   He was a boxer as a kid. He grew up the hard way. He joined the labor  union, moved to Utah, and won the Senate race that he wasn't supposed  to win.   I happened to be here in 1977, in January, as an administrative  assistant to Howard Baker, who was the newly elected Republican leader  of the Senate. There were then only 37 or 38 Republican Senators, but I  was impressed with their vigor and enthusiasm. No one impressed me more  than the young Senator from Utah.   Here is what he was doing by 1978. I want to read a paragraph from  the ``American Senate'' by Neil MacNeil and Richard Baker, which I  think is the best history of the Senate.         In the spring of 1968, Utah's Orrin Hatch and Indiana's       Richard Lugar, both freshmen Republicans, undertook a       sophisticated filibuster to defeat organized labor's prime       legislative goal, a complex bill to revise the nation's labor       laws. First, they relied on traditional tactics--much talk,       quorum calls, and all the other dilatory maneuvers. They       copied the Southerners' old strategy of creating three       platoons, each of a half-dozen senators, to spell each other       over the next several weeks. Next they adopted Senator       Allen's post-cloture strategy, introducing more than 1,200       amendments with which to continue their filibuster       indefinitely. Robert Byrd [who was the majority leader] tried       six times to invoke cloture and failed.        This victory by conservative Republicans was the most       notable that they had so far achieved, and the editors of the       Congressional Quarterly concluded that Republican       filibustering had changed the dynamics of the Senate's       legislating. The Republicans, they said, ``had retrieved for       themselves a weapon of enormous legislative importance,'' so       important that now, for practical purposes, the Senate could       not approve any controversial measure without producing a       sixty-vote super-majority.    So when we say you have to get 60 votes to get anything important  passed around here, we can thank Orrin Hatch because, when he came to  the Senate, in his first couple of years, along with Senator Lugar, he  took on a task that nobody thought he could win--the primary objective  of organized labor in a Democratic Congress, with a Democratic  President, when Republicans had only 37 or 38 votes in the Senate, and  he stopped it. That is typical of Senator Hatch's persistence.   He later became chairman of three important committees in the Senate  in his 42 years here: the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee; the Judiciary Committee; and the Finance Committee.   Like many Senators, he realized not long after he was here that it is  hard to get here, and it is hard to stay here, so you might as well try  to amount to something while you are here. Amounting to something means  getting a result, and getting a result means, if you have to get 60  votes to do it, working with people on the other side of the aisle.   He formed an important alliance with Senator Ted Kennedy, who was the  leading liberal Member of the Senate. Hatch had proved himself to be  one of the most partisan Republicans. But when they could agree, they  passed some very important legislation.   There was the Hatch-Waxman Act. There was legislation about religious  freedom. I won't try to list all of the legislation. I think it is  accurate to say that no living Senator has passed more legislation than  Orrin Hatch.   He also did me a personal favor. In 1991, I came back up here as  President Bush's nominee to be U.S. Secretary of Education. I should  have known better, but I sold my home and put my kids in school. I  forgot that I had to be confirmed and that anybody might object to it.   I went before the Democratic-controlled HELP Committee. Senator  Metzenbaum of Ohio said: Governor Alexander, I have heard some very  disturbing things about you, but I don't think I will bring them up  here.   Nancy Kassebaum said: Well, Howard, I think you just did. She was a  Senator from Kansas.   For 2 or 3 months, I twisted in the wind, wondering whether I would  be confirmed by the Democratic Senate. Late one night, somehow Orrin  Hatch came to the Senate floor and got me confirmed by unanimous  consent. I spent 22 months as President Bush's Education Secretary. I  think he was a  [[Page S7769]]  consequential education President, with his America 2000, his summit of  Governors on education, and his advocacy for start-from-scratch  schools, which we now call charter schools. But I have Orrin Hatch to  thank for that confirmation.   Of all the bills that Senator Hatch has worked on, my favorite is the  Music Modernization Act. We call it the Hatch-Goodlatte Music  Modernization Act because of his role in it. He likes it, too, because  it is a bill that helps songwriters, mostly. We have thousands of  songwriters in Tennessee, all around Nashville--Nashville is Music  City. Memphis has a lot; upper East Tennessee has a lot; other places  in America have a lot. Songwriters are typically taxi drivers, music  teachers, waitresses, all sitting there, not making much money, but  with the idea of writing a No. 1 song.   The problem is that as the internet arrived, more than half of the  money in the music industry came from songs played online, and  songwriters, No. 1, weren't getting paid often and, No. 2, weren't  getting paid a fair market value. So a number of us took that on, and  the result was the Music Modernization Act.   By the time it passed the Senate by unanimous consent and the House  almost unanimously, too, it had 80 sponsors here. But it was a very  complex bill, a once-in-a-generation copyright law change, and the  principal sponsor was Orrin Hatch. It is right that he should be. He  was chairman of the Finance Committee. But more than that, he is a  songwriter himself. He has had a gold record and a platinum record. We  think of him in Nashville as our third U.S. Senator. He is welcome to  come back any time in his retirement after January and sit down and  write some more songs because his Music Modernization Act, the Hatch- Goodlatte Act, is going to help thousands of songwriters and make this  a more joyful country with more good songs.   So I come to the floor today simply to express my respect and  appreciation for our Senator who is retiring, Orrin Hatch, who served  42 years--longer than any other Republican in the history of the U.S.  Senate--and to say that if he decides he is running out of things to do  when he goes back to Utah, the door is open in Nashville. He can come  and write a few songs.   I yield the floor.
