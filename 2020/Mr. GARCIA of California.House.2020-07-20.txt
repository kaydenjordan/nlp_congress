 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment, No. 217, which would direct the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration to establish a dedicated center for  artificial intelligence.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 20, 2020, on page H3576, the following appeared: gentleman  from California (Mr. Garcia).  Mr.  Speaker,      The online version has been corrected to read: gentleman from  California (Mr. Garcia).  Mr. Speaker,    ========================= END NOTE =========================      NOAA's AI strategy works to expand the application of AI in every  NOAA mission area by improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and  coordination of AI development and usage across the agency. Passage of  this amendment will enable NOAA to utilize AI for further support of  partners in wildfire detection and movement, which is so critical to my  California 21st District.   Mr. Speaker, last year, my district was devastated by the Woolsey and  Tick fires, and we saw the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library  surrounded by flames. Our community remains at significant risk for  wildfires.   Establishing a center for artificial intelligence at NOAA, among  other proactive measures, will be vital in improving the agency's  wildfire detection efforts. This asset will help ensure firefighters  and communities have the tools they need to track and fight wildfires  effectively.   Passage of this amendment is an essential step in the right direction  to protecting California.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for working  across the aisle with me on this important amendment.
