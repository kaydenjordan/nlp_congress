 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we have some rare good news on the public  health front. COVID cases are down at the lowest level since July.  Crucially, hospitalizations and deaths are also down dramatically, more  than 70 percent lower than they were in January during the Omicron  wave. Compared to just a few months ago, our Nation is experiencing far  less suffering and death, thank goodness.   But despite the progress we have made, COVID continues to be a  threat. Every day, 800 American families lose a loved one to COVID--800  a day--and catch new infections, which present an opportunity for the  virus to mutate.   We are at a turning point in this fight against COVID. Now, we need  to strengthen our healthcare system. We need to stay a step ahead of  this deadly virus. That is especially true since the subvariant of  Omicron--BA.2, as it is known--has become dominant in America.   Remember the frenzy last holiday season when we were running from  pharmacy to pharmacy trying to find rapid tests for our families or  waiting in the freezing cold for hours on end to get a PCR test? Why  would we ever want to be caught flatfooted again? We need to sustain  our public health funding so that our hospitals and healthcare  professionals have the equipment and tools they need to keep us safe.   The one thing dramatically worse than returning to the dark days of  COVID-19 and the deadly variants would be to return unprepared. If we  want to keep our masks off--and I do--if we want to keep our kids in  school--and I do--and our businesses open, we need to make smart  investments in America's capacity to confront future strains of these  variants. We can't continue this cycle of neglect and panic. These  pendulum swings harm our health system and contribute to unnecessary  costs and suffering.   Congress must come together on a bipartisan basis. And shouldn't we  all agree on this: that we move as a nation in the same direction? That  means providing funding to purchase new booster doses, including those  which the FDA authorized this week for adults over the age of 50. I got  mine yesterday morning. If we don't purchase these vaccines now ahead  of time, then we  [[Page S1845]]  will be sleepwalking into the next deadly wave.   We also need to ensure that as soon as the FDA authorizes a vaccine  for kids under the age of 5, parents can get their kids protected as  soon as possible.   Funding also is needed for oral antivirals and other therapeutics to  treat patients who contract a serious case of COVID. These treatments  will keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed.   And we need funding to maintain the testing infrastructure we have  built up over the last several months, like President Biden's  successful program to put up to 1 billion--billion--rapid tests right  at the doors of every American who wants one.   The fact is, Congress should have already provided funding for these  lifesaving resources, but we still haven't done it. This lack of  funding has already hit my home State of Illinois. Last week, shipments  of monoclonal antibody treatments to our State were scaled back 35  percent to preserve the supply. Also last week, thanks to a lack of  funds, the Department of Health and Human Services announced they would  no longer pay hospitals and health clinics for testing they have  provided to 30 million uninsured Americans.   Several free community-based testing sites and pharmacies in Illinois  are now closing up. The money is running dry. At one community health  center in Illinois, one-third of the patients are uninsured. That  clinic has received more than $150,000 to test, treat, and vaccinate  the patients--money well spent not just to protect these patients but  every Illinoisan. If Congress doesn't provide new funding, that health  center may be forced to close for good.   All of us want to keep the masks off for good and move past this  coronavirus, but to think we can just wish away COVID forever would be  naive, irresponsible, and fiscally unwise.   I urge my Republican colleagues to join in a bipartisan effort to  provide new funding for our COVID preparation response efforts. Let's  be ready for whatever this virus might bring.
