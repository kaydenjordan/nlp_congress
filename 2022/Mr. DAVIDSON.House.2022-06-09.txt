 Madam Speaker, from the debate and from the whole  premise of this red flag law proposal, you would think that there was  no such way to deal with this problem in America. It has been pointed  out that 19 States have red flag laws already, but there are 50 States  that already have a way to have someone adjudicated minimally  dangerous.   Every single State, the premise that we can identify somebody who  might pose a risk to themselves or others is the whole premise why red  flag laws might work. But that is the same premise that allows Baker  Acts to work in every single State and Washington, D.C.   The difference is that the person charged, the person accused of  being this mentally incompetent, mentally dangerous person, has the  right to confront their accuser. And that is what they are trying to  undo. It already exists in law. Everyone knows that we cannot accept  our children being murdered. We can't accept our communities being  destroyed and gutted, not just by violence, by increasing violence, by  increasing acts of despair; not just shootings, but suicides--and the  number one cause of death for 18- to 45-year-olds--fatal overdoses.   There is something going on wrong. It is not the guns, it is the  culture and the evildoer. When do we stop blaming the evildoer, the  doer of evil deeds? And if you could identify who that doer of evil  deeds might be, wouldn't you want to take them away from the weapons  instead of taking the weapons away from them?    If you don't take the person away, they can get other guns. They  might even get a car and drive through a parade.   Let's keep our communities safe. Let's keep our kids safe. Let's  focus on the real problem and not just run the same play over and over  again. The Democrats have a preconceived solution to every emergency,  and it is shameful to watch this exploitation of violence to achieve a  Democrat-longstanding objective to undermine our Second Amendment.
