 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tomorrow, our Nation's Capital will  once again host many thousands of Americans gathering peacefully to  support the most basic human right--the right to life. For 49 years,  the March for Life has united people from diverse backgrounds,  different faiths, and all 50 States to celebrate the dignity of human  life and confront the ways our society fails to protect it.   This year, the marchers will arrive in a Washington controlled by a  Democratic Party that has grown increasingly radical on this issue.  Today's Democrats work overtime to keep our country one of just seven  nations on the planet that have abortion on demand even after the  unborn children can feel pain. Our shameful company includes China and  North Korea. Fewer than 30 percent of Americans endorse this view, but  Democrats have made it party dogma.   On President Biden's watch, Washington Democrats have even turned  against the longstanding bipartisan Hyde Amendment. Both parties used  to agree that at least Federal taxpayers should not be forced to fund  abortions. Now Democrats on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue declared  war on even this.   So I warmly welcome the marchers from Kentucky and across the  country. This radical version of the Democratic Party needs to hear  your voices now more than ever.                            ____________________     Today marks exactly 1 year since President Biden  became our fourty-sixth President. This all-Democratic government has  had 365 days to start delivering on some of their core promises.   So what were those promises, in their own words? ``Crushing the  virus,'' ``strengthen[ing] our alliances,'' and, above all else,  ``lower[ing] the temperature'' and reuniting a divided country.   Remember, upon taking office, this administration had historic  tailwinds at its back. President Biden inherited lifesaving vaccines  and a distribution system that was already up and running. He inherited  a string of bipartisan rescue packages, including one that was only  just a few days old. He inherited an economy that was prime for a  roaring comeback. Those were the promises. That was the inheritance.   So let's take a look at the progress report. Last spring, against  expert advice, the Biden administration dumped another mountain of  borrowed cash on an already white-hot economy. As a result, we are now  being hammered by the worst inflation in 40 years. Practically  everything families need and want have gotten much, much more  expensive. Constant shortages disrupt family shopping. Households are  being hit with soaring heating costs if they stay home and soaring gas  prices if they go out. Our economic trajectory looks shakier today than  it did when Democrats were sworn in.   Of course, we have continued adding back jobs from COVID lockdowns.  That was certainly going to happen. But job creation has massively  underperformed Democrats' own projections for job creation with their  super costly springtime stimulus package.   When 2021 was said and done, the country had added roughly the same  number of jobs that we were on track to create before Democrats  implemented one policy or spent one dime. They managed to literally  blow $1.9 trillion but only barely beat the starting trajectory they  inherited.   They call that spending a COVID package, but less than 10 percent of  the money went to the actual medical fight, and that certainly shows.   Americans are entering their third year of this pandemic with too few  tests, too few treatments, too many new cases, and too many school  closures; muddled guidance on boosters that caused FDA experts to  resign in protest, and needless divisive vaccine mandates that were not  even constitutional.   One year in, the coronavirus is decidedly uncrushed.   And COVID wasn't the only epidemic sweeping American streets. Take  violent crime. Far-left rhetoric and anti-law-enforcement local  policies have led major cities to set all-time records for homicide in  2021.   Or take fentanyl. This deadly imported poison was the leading cause  of death for Americans aged 18 to 45, last year. The No. 1 killer of  Americans in their prime--fentanyl.   So why aren't Democrats treating this like an emergency? When was the  last time President Biden even talked about this?   And drug deaths are not the only consequence of our weak borders.   Candidate Biden's rhetoric incentivized a historic flood of illegal  immigration, and then President Biden's weak policies lit the fuse. The  result? The biggest surge in illegal border crossings in 60 years--60  years.   All these issues are priorities for American families, but the Biden  administration spent most of 2021 focused on none of those. Washington  Democrats spent months chasing a reckless taxing-and-spending spree  packed with far-left policies that citizens never wanted. We spent half  of 2021 trying and failing to blow $5 trillion on windmills and  welfare.   When that effort faded, Democrats abruptly pivoted and started  shouting that American democracy was on death's door. They  propagandized that some evil anti-voting conspiracy was sweeping  America, and the only solution to this grand crisis was a gigantic  partisan election takeover bill that Democrats had conveniently written  years before the events which they say now prompted it.   The American people didn't buy the fake hysteria. One-half of one  percent of the country thinks election laws are our top issue. In fact,  more Americans believe voting laws are too loose than too tight.   Oh, but Democrats went all in on this obsession. A few days ago, the  sitting President of the United States called millions of Americans his  domestic enemies and analogized--analogized--U.S. Senators to Jefferson  Davis.   Well, last night, the fake panic drove 48 Senate Democrats to walk  the plank on a failed effort to shatter the Senate itself for short- term power. And now Washington Democrats appear to be launching an  absurd and reckless campaign to delegitimize the next election in  advance, in case they lose it. Sound familiar?   Yesterday, the President told reporters that he might not accept the  2022 election results as legitimate if his election takeover bills do  not pass Congress first. It all sounds eerily familiar.   This morning, the House majority whip followed suit. He was asked if  the legitimacy of our elections is contingent on Washington Democrats  passing these bills, and he replied: ``I am absolutely concerned about  that.''   The Democrats who preached countless sermons about accepting voter  decisions are now saying the midterms may be illegitimate, unless they  win.   So America, after all of this, do you feel unified? Do you feel  healed? Do you feel like our core institutions are being protected?   Now, Senate Republicans have met this administration more than  halfway. In 2021, the Senate built and passed a major infrastructure  bill. We passed bipartisan legislation on competing with China.   But beyond that, this administration deliberately chose to build  their whole  [[Page S359]]  governing strategy around the party-line reconciliation process.   So the President cannot deflect blame for his disappointing first  year. The American people know where the buck stops, and if our  Democratic friends do not change course, before long, the buck will  stop somewhere else.   Now, on a related matter, President Biden also campaigned on  strengthening America's partnerships and renewing our global  leadership. Well, how has the administration done?   The administration that campaigned on restoring alliances abandoned a  coalition of loyal partners with its disastrous and fatal retreat from  Afghanistan.   The Biden administration green-lit Vladimir Putin's Nord Stream 2  pipeline, and the Democrats blocked us from sanctioning it. This  pipeline will help Putin gain even more leverage over Western Europe  and, of course, further isolate Ukraine.   As we speak--right now--Putin has amassed more than 100,000 Russian  troops along the border of Ukraine. If these forces cross into Ukraine,  it will not be a new invasion or a ``re-invasion.'' It will represent a  major escalation of an ongoing occupation.   Ukraine has been fighting a Russian-backed war on its own now for  8 years. Eight years ago, I tried to warn President Obama that Putin is  only deterred when the world imposes real costs--real costs--on his  misbehavior.    But the Biden Administration sent Ukraine nonlethal support, and the  sanctions it imposed and coordinated proved not to be as tough as  advertised. The Obama-Biden administration failed to end Putin's  invasion or compel compliance with the Minsk accords. Now the Biden- Harris team must not repeat the Obama-Biden grave mistakes.   But yesterday, on live television, President Biden telegraphed  passivity--telegraphed passivity--and weakness, exactly when our allies  can least afford it. Our President seemed to state--and, I pray,  unintentionally--that he expects Putin to escalate in Ukraine, and, in  any case, Putin can do what he wants.   Here is what the President said: ``That decision is totally, solely,  completely a Putin decision. . . . I suspect it matters which side of  the bed he gets up on.''   What on Earth does that mean?   Further, the President said: ``My guess is he will move in.''   The President said: ``My guess is he will move in. He has to do  something.''   So President Biden thinks Putin has to do something. What does that  even mean? Why is our President speculating like a passive observer on  the sidelines?   He isn't a pundit. He isn't Putin's psychoanalyst. He is the  President of the United States.   So will America hold Russia accountable if it escalates? Here was the  message from our Commander in Chief: ``It depends on what Russia does.  It's one thing if it's a minor incursion''--a minor incursion--``and  then we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et  cetera.''   ``It is one thing if it is a minor incursion''? Does this mean  President Biden will not actually authorize the tough response that his  own administration officials have spent weeks--weeks--promising?   This was a moment to deliver a powerful warning to the Kremlin that  Ukraine's sovereignty is inviolable; that we would stand with her  people; that the cost of escalation would be devastating.   It was a moment to reassure our partners in Kiev and our allies along  NATO's eastern flank that America had their back.   It was a moment to call for NATO's unity, not to expose and appear  hamstrung by NATO's divisions. It was a bizarre and devastating  performance--especially, I would add--for our friends on the  frontlines.   President Zelensky's Defense Minister has already shot back. This is  from Ukraine's Defense Minister:         We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with       quasi-aggression or small incursion operations. This       aggression was [already] there since 2014. This is the fact.    I suspect our own Secretary of State, who is in Europe to meet with  our allies and the Russian Foreign Minister--was also shocked by what  the President had said. Minutes later, White House staff put out a  frantic statement laying out a completely different position than what  President Biden had just expressed. By then, of course, significant  damage had been done.   But, alas, the damage can be undone. The President of the United  States is never powerless. President Biden needs to clean up his  remarks. He needs to clearly state American resolve and clearly  demonstrate American leadership. He should call President Zelensky and  NATO's allies most threatened by Russian aggression. He should rally  allies and partners around the world to defend Ukraine and the  international system that is being threatened by Putin.   His administration should be using every waking moment right now-- right now--to expedite our delivery of real defensive capabilities to  Ukraine.   The President must cut the indecision and redtape that has slowed us  and our partners down. President Biden should finally, at long last,  get around to nominating an Ambassador to Ukraine, a position he has  left empty for 12 crucial months.   He should send U.S. forces to shore up NATO's eastern flank--not if-- not if and when Putin escalates, but right now, before it is too late.   He should encourage our treaty allies to do likewise. But while  alliance unity is important, the lowest common denominator of NATO's  most nervous members cannot be allowed to restrict American action.   Whatever course other nations choose to chart, we cannot afford to  let Moscow underestimate our resolve to impose serious--serious-- crushing costs in response to any further incursion against Ukraine.   Our friends and America's reputation deserve nothing less.
