 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3506 makes technical amendments to  update statutory references to provisions in title 7, title 20, and  title 43 of the United States Code. In the process of updating  statutory references, there were some related technical errors found.  The bill also makes amendments to correct those errors.   These changes come at the request of the Office of Law Revision  Counsel, which is a nonpartisan office in the House of Representatives  that prepares and publishes the U.S. Code and performs the very  important role of keeping the code up-to-date.
