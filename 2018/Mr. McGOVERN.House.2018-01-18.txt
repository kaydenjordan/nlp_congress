 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn in the strongest  possible terms the ongoing, unrelenting attacks against civilians in  Syria committed by the barbaric, lawless regime of Bashir al-Assad,  with Russian backing.   We have all heard the statistics over and over again like a broken  record: as many as half a million people killed since the armed  conflict began in March 2011, tens of thousands of them civilians; tens  of thousands more detained, disappeared, and perhaps, or even likely,  dead, directly at the hands of the regime; more than 11 million people  displaced once and again, inside and outside of Syria's borders, the  largest single refugee crisis the world has seen since 1945. More than  half of those displaced are children and youth.   Last summer, much was made of the cease-fire agreement that the Trump  administration reached with the Russian Government to establish  ``deescalation zones'' to stabilize Syria, while keeping the Assad  regime in power.   We were told the agreement would save lives. Trump said: ``. . . all  of a sudden, you are going to have no bullets being fired in Syria. . .  .''   Well, that has turned out not to be true. The deescalation zones are  not deescalating.   As of late December, more than 400,000 people remain trapped,  besieged by regime forces in eastern Ghouta, one of the deescalation  zones, only half an hour's drive from Damascus.   As U.N. Special Adviser on Syria Jan Egeland said last December:  ``There is no deescalation zone, there is only escalation in this  deescalation zone.''   Idlib, another ``deescalation area,'' suffered a dramatic increase in  air attacks last September against armed groups not covered by the  cease-fire agreement. In late December, airstrikes and shelling against  a hospital, a medical warehouse, and a vegetable market killed,  injured, and displaced scores of people.   The U.S. Government heralded the military defeat of ISIS in Syria in  November. But the defeat of ISIS has not and will not end the Syrian  conflict; and Russia has not succeeded in pressuring Assad to end the  conflict, nor in restraining Assad's attacks on civilians as he has  gone after rebel forces.   Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Syria deteriorates each and  every day. World Vision estimatesthat 5.6 million people are in need of  acute humanitarian assistance. The U.N. says a total of 13.1 million  people need some form of assistance. That is 3 million more than at the  end of 2016. The situation is worse today, after months of  deescalation, than it was a year ago.   Of those 13 million, 3 million are trapped in besieged and hard-to- reach areas. That is 4\1/2\ times the population of Boston or  Washington, D.C.  [[Page H480]]    Humanitarian access to those areas is not guaranteed by the regime,  nor by its backers; international law and obligations be damned.   Some of the most heartbreaking news out of Syria has to do with the  crisis in healthcare. The ``weaponization'' of healthcare in Syria is  not new, but the depravity of it all still shocks me. According to a  recent report by researchers at the American University in Beirut,  ``Syria has become the most dangerous place on earth for healthcare  providers.''   According to the International Rescue Committee, in 2011, there was  one doctor per 600 people in Syria. But now, in east Ghouta, there is  only one doctor per 3,600 people.   Medical supplies are not allowed into besieged areas and terribly ill  patients are not allowed out.   What military or political purpose is served by denying medical  evacuation to women and children suffering from heart disease, cancer,  kidney failure, and blood diseases?   Mr. Speaker, current policy is not working to end the crisis in  Syria. It is time to change course, not by sending more Special Forces  troops there without any authorization, nor by promising to keep them  there indefinitely to fight against the next iteration of ISIS.   What we need is to reassert American diplomatic leadership and exert  real pressure to end the war. We need a plan to transition Assad out of  power. We need to pass H. Res. 632, condemning the senseless attacks on  hospitals and medical personnel in Syria.   We need to shame Russia for its failure to ensure humanitarian  access. We need to increase our contributions to humanitarian  assistance for Syria and make full use of the option of cross-border  assistance.   We need to open our hearts to the Syrian refugees and welcome more of  them to our country. We need to do everything in our power to lay the  groundwork to ensure accountability for Assad's victims. That includes  funding the international, impartial, and independent mechanism to  assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes.   The Syrian conflict has gone on far too long. The horror of it all  can be mind-numbing, but we must not lose our outrage. Now is the time  to reenergize our efforts and find a way to end the suffering.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney) for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, today we will consider the 61st closed  rule of the Congress, part of a disturbing and familiar pattern.  Republicans are running this House with no regular order, no hearings  on legislation, and one closed rule after another. Speaker Ryan and  House Republicans recently set a record as presiding over the most  closed session of Congress in history, and now they are adding to it.   With no transparency and their continued effort to silence any debate  or dissent, this House Chamber feels more like the Russian house rather  than the people's House. Now, I know Donald Trump is enthralled with  authoritarian rulers and authoritarian rule, but that doesn't mean you  guys have to follow suit.   Today's rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 4712, yet another  partisan and extreme Republican bill that is completely unnecessary and  aimed solely at pleasing the majority's rightwing base. The simple  truth is that this bill is filled with inflammatory language  intentionally designed to politicize women's access to healthcare. It  is clearly about nothing more than advancing an agenda to take away  access to safe and legal abortion.   With this bill, House Republicans are meddling in the decisions that  should be left up to doctors and patients. That is not our job. What we  are doing today is not about serious legislating. If it were, the  majority would have gone through regular order. This bill is nothing  more than a very cynical effort to give Republican Members of Congress  something to point to when they join the anti-choice march in  Washington this week. Republicans are recklessly playing politics with  women's health, and they should be ashamed.   My Republican colleagues claim that this bill is just a reinstatement  of the current born-alive law. First, if that were true, then this bill  would be redundant and unnecessary; and, second, Democrats would  support it. When the original law came to the House floor in 2002, it  was passed by a voice vote. We all agreed. But this bill is not a  reinstatement.   This bill takes the current, functional law and adds a radical  inclusion of criminal penalties for doctors if they violate the  unreasonable requirements of this legislation.   Under current law, when a child is born alive, including during an  abortion procedure, the healthcare provider is required to care for  this newborn and apply a standard level of care given to any and every  child. However, this bill takes the law a step further and requires  that the doctor immediately transport this child to a hospital, without  exception, whether it is safe for the child or not, or face criminal  punishment--up to 5 years in jail.   This bill could create a chilling effect and limit access to safe,  legal abortion for women since physicians may fear prosecution.  Patients need and deserve access to compassionate and appropriate  medical care. This bill is, quite frankly, unconscionable.   Mr. Speaker, there are times when immediately transporting a newborn  to a hospital that may be miles or even hours away may result in grave  harm to that infant. Such decisions must be left to the professional  judgment of doctors and clinicians.   Doctors and clinicians oppose this law because it prevents them from  giving the best care to their patients. The American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly oppose this legislation,  calling it a ``gross interference in the practice of medicine.''   Current law is working and should not be radically changed for a  partisan talking point. Right now there are a number of truly critical  issues that we ought to be considering on this floor, not a sound bite  for an anti-choice rally coming up in the next couple of days.   A clear majority of Americans, I should point out to my colleagues,  seven out of ten, say they believe a woman should have the right to a  safe, legal abortion according to a Quinnipiac University poll. By  stark contrast, fewer than three in ten Americans--that is 29 percent-- approve of the job Republicans are doing in Congress. Maybe the  majority ought to get the hint. People don't like what you are doing.  This should be a wake-up call to Republicans to end their partisan  crusades and start doing their jobs. It is time to focus on the real  pressing issues we face.   The Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, which nearly 2 million  kids and their families rely on, has been in limbo for months as States  are beginning to run out of money. Now Republicans are pushing a  continuing resolution that fails to permanently extend CHIP.  Permanently extending CHIP would not only give these kids and their  families the certainty they need when it comes to their healthcare, but  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that it would also  save $6 billion. I thought the majority were the party of fiscal  responsibility. Do the right thing and save $6 billion. But Republicans  would rather kick the can down the road once again.   The authorizations for Community Health Center funds and the  Maternal, Infant, and Childhood Home Visitation programs will remain  expired. That is not even included in this partisan CR that we are  going to see a little bit later today.   Each and every day, 122 DREAMers are losing their protected status  and ability to work in this country, and my Republican friends don't  seem at all bothered by that.   People who are first responders, saving lives, people who serve in  our military and people who work in our companies who are such great  members of our community are treated like this in such a rotten way,  and yet more inaction.   The administration just stripped 200,000 Salvadorans legally residing  in the United States of their protected status, people who are obeying  our laws and who are working here legally.                                time  1245    They did this while admonishing Congress to provide these same people  with an enduring lawful immigration status; and yet, we have a Congress  that is so dysfunctional, they can't even agree on what to have for  lunch,  [[Page H496]]  never mind move anything forward that is positive with regard to  protecting these important members of our community.   The debt limit needs to be raised to ensure the U.S. is able to pay  its bills. Communities are urgently in need of resources to fight the  opioid epidemic that is killing 91 Americans a day.   They are tired of your press releases. They want the funding to be  able to respond to the crisis in their communities; yet, nothing in  this CR, no urgency here in Congress.   More needs to be done to help repair damage left by devastating  wildfires and hurricanes that have ravaged this country. I just came  back from a trip to Puerto Rico. The place is still in great disrepair,  and our initial response to that hurricane was disgraceful. We have a  special obligation to these people, our fellow citizens, to better  respond; yet, there is no urgency here.   Most importantly, where is the budget agreement that sets the caps  for fiscal year 2018? House and Senate appropriators can't even begin  negotiations on an omnibus funding bill until they know the top-line  numbers.   That means that this will not be the last short-term continuing  resolution that we see before this House. Until there is an agreement  on the budget caps, we will continue to see the Republican majority  keep kicking the can down the road. We will see CR No. 5 in mid- February and maybe CR No. 6 shortly thereafter.   When will the Republicans finally stop negotiating with themselves  and instead reach out to Democrats and work in a bipartisan way and  actually get the job done that we were sent here to do by our  constituents?   We are just hours away from another Republican shutdown, and instead  of working on a bipartisan agreement, we are here discussing this  inflammatory bill that will impose criminal penalties on doctors and  allow Congress to intrude on medical care decisions.   When are we going to put the radical rhetoric aside and do our jobs  and tackle the real issues that the Americans sent us here to tackle?   Here is kind of the icing on the cake. This government shutdown is  looming. We are going to run out of money on Friday. All hell is going  to break loose if we can't come to some sort of agreement. You would  think we would be working together to get this done as quickly as  possible.   But then we are told we are going to consider the continuing  resolution rule after this and then we are going to debate it, but we  are not going to vote on it until later night, after 7, maybe even  later.   Why, people might ask, are we delaying action on a bill that decides  whether we keep the government open?   Oh, we just found out President Trump is doing a political rally with  Republican Members of Congress in Pennsylvania.   So the political rally is more important than the well-being of the  American people?   What are you guys thinking?   Shame on you. This is a moment of urgency and instead of doing  political sound bite legislation and instead of doing political rallies  in Pennsylvania for an election that doesn't happen until March,  Members of Congress ought to be here, working to keep the government  running, to come to some sort of accommodation on the DREAMers, to make  sure community health centers are funded, to make sure our veterans get  the funding and the healthcare they need.   What you are doing is atrocious. If the American people could sue you  for political malpractice, you would be in deep trouble.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, to oppose this bill that  would severely undermine women's access to essential services like  abortion, and I urge my colleagues to cancel the political rally and  get back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my colleague from Wyoming that I will  point out a little statistic that she might be interested in. That is,  I think never in history has the government been shut down when the  same party controls the House, the Senate, and the White House, like  the Republicans do right now. The Republicans have a 23-seat majority,  I think, in the House right now. You control the agenda.   If the gentlewoman or her leadership were interested in working with  Democrats, here is a little advice: maybe you ought to have asked us to  the table. Maybe you should consult with us. Maybe you should ask us  what we think is important. Maybe you ought to understand that if you  want to get something done that is bipartisan, you have to act in a  bipartisan way.   The reason why I am anxious to get this vote on the CR is because I  think the CR that has been proposed is wholly inadequate. It is not in  the best interest of our country.   But I want us to continue to negotiate it. Maybe the Republicans will  come back to the table and negotiate. That is why I feel so strongly  that my Republican friends ought not be going to political rallies in  Pennsylvania today with the President and they ought to be staying here  to do the work to make sure we get a bipartisan agreement to keep the  government open.   I get it. You are losing seats all around the place. The popularity  of the Republican Party has never been lower. You are all panicked. But  the election isn't until March. Donald Trump can take all of you on his  luxurious plane to Pennsylvania at another time. But today, we ought to  be focused on the people's business. Next week, we are supposed to be  off. So you have all the time in the world next week to be able to go  with Donald Trump on a political excursion.   When I think about what is at stake and we are delaying votes on a  continuing resolution and on further negotiations because people are  more interested in the political rally in Pennsylvania, this takes my  breath away.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Slaughter), the distinguished ranking member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are, again, at a very urgent moment here for our  country. We have a lot to do, and we ought to be working in a  bipartisan way to keep the government open. That ought to be  everybody's priority. Quite frankly, we ought to be focused on that  more than on a bill that is a sound bite that is going nowhere.   In fact, this bill was so important to my Republican friends that it  never had a hearing or it never went through a markup. It just  miraculously appeared at the last minute in advance of this anti-choice  rally coming up.   But with all that is going on right now, I mean, with the threat of a  shutdown, I am looking at Donald Trump's tweet:   ``Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total  support to Rick Saccone, running for Congress in a special election  (March 13). Rick is a great guy.''   That is where the President's head is today. And he is taking a bunch  of Republicans with him. Rather than negotiating a bipartisan deal that  will help keep the government running, that will help the DREAMers,  that will help our kids, that will help community health centers, that  will help our hospitals, and that will help our veterans, the focus is  on a political rally in Pennsylvania. This is unbelievable. Cancel the  rally--you have until March 13--and, instead, focus on the people's  business.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.  DeGette), the co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me respond to the gentlewoman from Wyoming because I just want to  make sure I am clear here.   There are less than 35 hours left before the government shuts down. I  think that is a pretty big deal that should concern Republicans and  Democrats.   I want to be clear. I don't care if the President goes to  Pennsylvania. He can fly on his nice jet, enjoy lifestyles of the rich  and famous or whatever he does, and go anywhere he wants in this  country. I don't care where he travels to.   What we object to is the fact that this House is going to recess  during this critical time so that he can bring along a whole bunch of  Republican Members of Congress to be part of a political event at this  crucial moment when the government is about to shut down. I find that  astonishing.   The gentlewoman talks about how we owe it to the men and women in  uniform to make sure we support our military. Do you think our men and  women in uniform want us to take a break right now so that Republican  Members can join the President on his fancy jet and go to Pennsylvania  for a political rally? Is that where the priorities of this Republican  majority really are?   I guess it is a habit. The last time we almost had a shutdown, in  December, the Republicans took a break so that they could go to the  White House for a party to celebrate their tax bill.   I am sorry. I know a lot of Republicans in my district and across the  country who I don't think prioritize parties and political rallies over  us doing our business. Either postpone the political rally or have the  President go without Members of Congress. But the idea to recess until  after 7 at this crucial moment when so much is in the balance I find  just unbelievably beyond the pale.   Mr. Speaker, for months the majority has been holding the healthcare  of 9 million children and over 9 million individuals, including seniors  and pregnant women, hostage while they passed tax breaks for  millionaires and billionaires. Well, time is up. With each day that we  fail to act, our constituents face uncertain times. It is wrong.   Mr. Speaker, even President Trump says he agrees that we need to act  on CHIP. Just this morning he tweeted: ``CHIP should be part of a long- term solution, not a 30-day or a short-term extension.''   Well, here is the chance to stop playing politics with CHIP--and  community health centers as well--and do just that. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative McEachin's bill, H.R. 4820, the Advancing Seniors and  Kids Act.   This bill would restore certainty and stability to so many of our  vulnerable citizens by responsibly addressing critical healthcare  priorities. It permanently reauthorizes CHIP; it reauthorizes community  health centers for 2 years; and it includes other vital healthcare  programs that provide relief to pregnant women, seniors, and many more.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. McEachin) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming that I am not going to vote for the CR because it doesn't do  anything for community health centers and doesn't do anything to  alleviate the burden of DSH payments for the hospitals that provide to  vulnerable communities and doesn't fund Veterans Health the way we want  it to. There is a whole bunch of stuff.   I just want this process to move forward so we can get back to  negotiating and actually get a deal that is bipartisan that we all can  be proud of. That is why--tell your Members: Please don't go on this  political rally today. Instead, let's keep this House going and let's  do the people's work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Iowa: the  process stinks.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee) for a unanimous consent request.  [[Page H501]]    (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as long as the gentlewoman doesn't have  any other speakers, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to say to all of my colleagues,  Democrats and Republicans, that this process is lousy. This is yet  another closed rule. The bill before us didn't even go through  committee. There was not a hearing. There was not a markup. It just  miraculously appeared right before an anti-choice rally, and here it  is, take it or leave it. That is not the way this place is supposed to  be run.   At some point, no matter what your ideology is, no matter what you  believe about some of these issues, you have to be for a more open  process, a more deliberative process. This diminishes the House of  Representatives. This is not what the people, I don't care what the  political party or ideology may be, want from their Congress. They want  a more open and transparent process.   Mr. Speaker, this bill before us, as I said before, is a sound bite.  It is going nowhere, but it has been introduced, and we are going to be  voting on it purely for political purposes.   Mr. Speaker, this morning, the majority whip announced: ``Upon  conclusion of debate on H.R. 195''--that is the CR--``the House will  recess until 7 p.m.''   Recess? I mean, recess? With all that is at stake, we are going to  recess?   This isn't a time for recess or a political rally.   Shame on Republicans who are delaying action in this House on moving  the process forward on a continuing resolution, to try to buy some time  to make it better, hopefully, so that it can earn bipartisan support.  Shame on them for going to a political rally instead of staying here  and doing their job.   This is the time to responsibly fund government. Those of us on the  Democratic side have a lot of issues with what the House leadership is  ramming through in terms of a CR. We were not part of that discussion.  We were not asked what our values are and what we think is important.  This is purely a product that the Republicans negotiated with  Republicans.   My hope is that we have time to make it better, but when you recess  until 7, not to make it better, not to negotiate, but so that  Republicans can go to a political rally, shame on you for doing that  with all that is at stake.   Our soldiers don't want us to recess. Those who depend on community  health centers don't want us to recess. Our veterans don't want us to  recess. Yet everybody's perfectly fine on the other side of the aisle  with taking a break; no big deal; no rush, nothing, as we get closer  and closer to this crisis.   At some point we need responsible leadership in this House, and that  begins with a return to regular order, a more open and transparent  process, a respect for the views of the minority, and it means  prioritizing the business of the American people.   I will say funding the government is more important than a political  rally in Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deep concern over  China's worsening human rights record, a clear indicator of its  increasing authoritarianism.   With the consolidation in power of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese  authorities are making it more and more evident that they will not  tolerate any internal dissent or opposition to their rule.   I am not talking about armed opposition, but about loyal opposition-- the kind of opposition that takes China's constitution, its laws, and  its international human rights obligations at face value.   On July 1, 1997, Britain transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to  China. Under a ``one country, two systems'' arrangement with London,  Beijing promised to allow universal suffrage as an ``ultimate aim,''  along with other freedoms.   Yesterday a Hong Kong court jailed democracy activist Joshua Wong for  three months for blocking clearance of a protest site, his second  prison sentence related to the Umbrella Movement's pro-democracy  protests in 2014.   Joshua was the public face of the Umbrella Movement, which called for  free elections for Hong Kong's leadership in the framework of the ``one  country, two systems'' agreement. He had already been on bail pending  the appeal of a separate six-month sentence for unlawful assembly. This  time around the judge made clear that he was making an example of him  because of his leadership role.   His fellow activist Raphael Wong was sentenced to four and a half  months, and several other activists received suspended sentences.   What's notable about this story is that after the protests, Joshua  and Raphael went on to run for seats in the Hong Kong parliament. They  didn't radicalize or take up arms. They stood up for their principles.  And now they're in jail.   I have often stood on the floor of this House to call for respect for  the human rights of the Tibetan people in China.   Just a few months ago the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, which I  co-chair, held a hearing on the repression of religious freedom in  Tibet.   Tibetan Buddhists face extensive controls on their religious life--an  intrusive official presence in monasteries, pervasive surveillance,  limits on travel and communications, and ideological re-education  campaigns. Religious expression and activism have been met with violent  repression, imprisonment and torture.   As of last August, 69 monks, nuns or Tibetan reincarnate teachers  were known to be  [[Page H547]]  serving sentences in Chinese prisons--although the real number is  likely much higher.   And the Chinese government continues to claim the prerogative to  decide who will succeed His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the highest figure  in Tibetan Buddhism, who is now 82 years old.   This extreme Chinese interference in the physical and spiritual lives  of Tibetans occurs even though the Tibetans seek only to fully exercise  the autonomy guaranteed them by the Chinese constitution and China's  ``Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy.'' In the late 1980s the Dalai Lama  proposed the Middle Way Approach as a path toward Tibetan autonomy  within China, and he has pursued that path through non-violence ever  since.   Then there are the Uyghurs. Like the Tibetans, the Uyghurs are the  victims of restrictions imposed by the Chinese authorities on their  religious, cultural and linguistic practices.   The repression of Uyghurs has increased since July 2009, when a  police attack on Uyghur demonstrators led to rioting and nearly 200  deaths. Between 2013 and 2015, clashes involving Uyghurs and Xinjiang  public security personnel led to hundreds more deaths.   In the aftermath of these kinds of fatal encounters, the Chinese  authorities have claimed the Uyghurs were carrying out or preparing to  launch attacks against government property or civilians. But credible  human rights groups argue that many violent incidents began as peaceful  protests--again, a form of loyal opposition.   Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch has reported that Chinese authorities  in Xinjiang are collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and  blood types of all residents in the region between the age of 12 and  65.   For what purpose? Are we witnessing steps toward some kind of  ethnicity-based attack on the whole of the Uyghur people?   And there have been alarming reports regarding the detention and  possible mistreatment of some family members of U.S.-based Uyghur  rights activist Rebiya Kadeer, feared to be in retribution for her  human rights advocacy efforts. This could be another instance of  China's efforts to silence criticism through intimidation, detention,  and threats to the families of activists living abroad.   Unfortunately, I could go on and on.   But I want to close with recommendations.   I am guided by two principles. We as Americans must defend human  rights and democracy, values that have made us a great nation. And  there must be consequences for bad behaviour.   But as Chinese authorities consistently work to undermine democratic  participation within its borders and violate the human rights of their  peoples, I do not see any consequences. It is time to impose some.   I urge us to start by passing two pieces of legislation on Tibet that  have been introduced in the House: H.R. 1872, the Reciprocal Access to  Tibet Act, and H. Con. Res. 89, expressing the sense of Congress that  the treatment of the Tibetan people should be an important factor in  the conduct of United States relations with the People's Republic of  China.   I urge the full and robust implementation of the Tibet Policy Act of  2002--including the designation of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan  Policy, a statutory position that the Administration has yet to fill.   I urge the robust use of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights  Accountability Act to sanction Chinese officials responsible for grave  violations of the human rights of Tibetans, Uyghurs, and the many other  loyal opposition activists who have been targeted in recent years-- human rights lawyers, religious practitioners, writers, artists.   I urge a united expression of support from this House for the release  of Liu Xia. She should be allowed to leave China.   I urge this House to support the right of His Holiness the Dalai Lama  to return to his homeland.   I urge the U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong to speak out loudly and  forcefully on behalf of Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and other pro-democracy  advocates in Hong Kong. We must hold China strictly accountable for the  terms of the 1997 transfer of sovereignty.   These steps may not be enough to turn back China's increasing  authoritarianism. But they would be a start.                            ____________________
