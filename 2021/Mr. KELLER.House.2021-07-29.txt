 Madam Speaker, the Hyde amendment has long been a  bipartisan measure that prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to  fund abortions. It is shocking to me that my Democrat colleagues are  working to eliminate this amendment. Make no mistake, the Hyde  amendment saves lives.   I will continue to do my part to support pro-life legislation because  our creator endowed every one of us with certain unalienable rights to  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. After all, if we are  unwilling to fight for life, what are we willing to fight for?   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
