 Mr. President, on Friday night, President Donald Trump  issued an Executive order that strikes at the very heart of our  democracy.   I wish I were exaggerating. I wish this were some sort of game. But  the ban that imposes religious tests and keeps refugees and immigrants  from entering our country is illegal, it is unconstitutional, it is  immoral, and it must be overturned.   The effects of this order were immediate and terrifying for people in  Massachusetts and all across this country. My office got a call from an  Iranian citizen who was traveling to Massachusetts to see his daughter  who is currently receiving treatment for cancer. He was denied boarding  in Germany and sent back to Iran. We heard from a woman who already has  an approved immigrant visa but still hasn't found an airline that will  allow her to board a flight to the United States. A Massachusetts  resident called because her cousin who holds a student visa was not  allowed to board a flight either. Another Massachusetts resident called  because her Iranian sisters were denied boarding at London Heathrow.  Both have their valid J-1 visas. One is a visiting professor at  Harvard, and the other is a postdoc fellow at Harvard Medical. We heard  from an Iranian student studying at MIT. She was denied entry on  Saturday, and when she tried to return on Sunday, after the temporary  stay had been issued, she was denied boarding by Lufthansa. A  Massachusetts student on a student visa called because his wife was  denied boarding in Switzerland.   None of these people are criminals. None of these people are threats.  They are students at some of the world's top universities; they are  doctors and scientists at some of the country's best hospitals. Most of  them have already been vetted and granted the right to come to America.  One is a father who wants to see his cancer-stricken daughter. They are  husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends  and neighbors. They are people. They are real people. They are part of  what makes Massachusetts great, and they are part of what makes America  great.   Donald Trump's radical ban on Muslims isn't in line with American  values or with our Constitution. It is also not in line with what the  Republican Party stands for.   In the months following the attacks of September 11, President George  W. Bush made a point to remind the United States that we were not at  war against Islam. In a speech in April of 2002, he said:         America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred       against people of Arab background or Muslim faith. America       values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths--Christian,       Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is       practiced and protected here, because we are one country.       Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because       we're one country. Race and color should not divide us,       because America is one country.    Do Senate Republicans agree? If so, then come down here and say so.  Where are you? Where are Senate Republicans when their Republican  President issues an order targeting one religious group?   Let's be clear about what happened here. Keeping the details secret,  working with a small group of operatives inside the White House,  consulting no experts in diplomacy or homeland security, and getting  advice from outsiders with no actual legal authority, President Trump  acted unilaterally to issue this order.   Make no mistake, while it may not affect every Muslim in the world,  Donald Trump's Executive order is a Muslim ban, and it is  unconstitutional.  [[Page S475]]  This is a crisis. The Senate should take up and pass Senator  Feinstein's bill to overturn this illegal order right now. What is  happening is shocking. It is shocking, but it is not surprising.   Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do. During  his Presidential campaign, he promised ``a total and complete shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States.'' That is what he said. Last  year, it seemed like pretty much everyone agreed that this was not  acceptable in the United States of America.   Speaker Paul Ryan declared:         A religious test for entering our country is not reflective       of America's fundamental values. I reject it.    Where are you now, Paul Ryan? Have you rejected President Trump's  order to impose a religious test for entering our country? Have you  introduced a bill to overturn it? You have the power. Where are you?   As Governor of Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence said: ``Calls to  ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and  unconstitutional.'' Where are you right now, Vice President Pence? Have  you called to overturn President Trump's offensive and unconstitutional  order? Have you asked Republicans to introduce a bill to overturn it?  You have a platform. Where are you?   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a Muslim ban  ``completely and totally inconsistent with American values.'' Where are  you right now, Mitch McConnell? Have you rejected President Trump's  Muslim ban that is completely and totally inconsistent with American  values? Have you introduced a bill to overturn it? You have the power.  Where are you?   President Trump ignored these Republican leaders. Today these  Republican leaders will not stand up for what is right. President Trump  may be willing to ignore the Constitution and the laws of the United  States of America, and the Republican leadership in Congress may be  willing to ignore the Constitution and the laws of the United States of  America, but the American people are not.   This weekend, Americans across this country came together to reject  this sort of fear and hate. The American people showed courage, even as  the Republican leadership hid out. Crowds of people raced to airports  across this country to welcome immigrants and refugees and to demand  compliance with court rulings that gave individuals and families  temporary relief and to demand that this reckless order be rescinded.   I was proud to stand with hundreds of people at Logan Airport in  Boston on Saturday night and then with more than 20,000 people in  Copley Square on Sunday. We had one of the biggest demonstrations in  the country. I also want to say I am in awe of the hundreds of lawyers  and translators who dropped everything and spent sleepless nights in  airport terminals and courts fighting for justice. Because of their  tireless work, we have already been able to undo some of the damage  caused by President Trump.   While I am encouraged by our victories in the courts this weekend,  the Trump administration has derided these judges and, in some  instances, refused to follow these orders. This is shocking and  unconstitutional. Congress must act. We must act now. Congress must  stand up and say to President Trump that this is not who we are.  Congress must say to Donald Trump and to the world: We will not turn  our backs on lawful immigrants and refugees fleeing murderers. We will  not turn our backs on people who risk their own lives to protect our  soldiers in Iraq and in the fight against ISIS. We will not give ISIS  more recruiting material. We will not promote an imagined religious war  between America and Islam. We will stand for our values, for American  values, for human values. We will not be divided by hate and fear.   Fifteen months ago, I traveled to the Greek island of Lesbos. This is  the first stop for many Syrian refugees as they flee from the  terrorists of ISIS. That was where I saw the shoddy, paper-thin river  rafts that people cram onto, with nothing more than a hope and a prayer  that they will make it across a choppy sea. I saw the little plastic  pool floaties that people put on small children, hoping it would be  enough to save them if the raft went down.   I met a 7-year-old girl who had been sent out on that perilous  journey alone. I thought about what horrors her parents must have faced  to hand a wad of cash to human smugglers with only the most desperate  dream that their little girl would find something better on the other  side.   President Trump is trying to shut the door on that little girl and on  countless others who are fleeing for their lives. He is trying to shut  the door on children, on doctors, on students, on engineers, on  husbands and wives, on grandmas and grandpas. That is not all.  President Trump is trying to shut the door on people who risked their  lives helping American soldiers, people who face execution in the hands  of terrorists if they are sent back.   President Trump is even trying to shut the door on legal immigrants,  on students and faculty, on people who work in Massachusetts and across  this country, on people who have already been thoroughly screened for  entry into the United States and have been granted permanent status to  live and work in our country. This has nothing to do with security-- nothing.   Little girls fleeing from murderers are not a threat. Elderly  grandparents detained at airports are not a threat. Students and  teachers and people who work in Massachusetts and across the country  are not a threat. Iraqi translators who put their own lives at risk to  protect American soldiers are not a threat. We should welcome them. We  should welcome them with open arms. That is who we are.   Voices from across the political spectrum, including many of my  friends from across the aisle, have already stepped forward to  criticize this order, but criticism is not enough. President  Trump's Executive order must be overturned. We must overturn it.    For those who remain unconvinced, I would like to take some time this  evening to talk about some of the people who are hurt by the  President's reckless, heartless, illegal, and unconstitutional actions.  As stories have poured into my office, on the evening news, on social  media, we have heard time and again about the consequences of President  Trump's reckless and illegal order, and I would like to share some of  those stories in my time tonight. I want to read one.   My staff and I have spent the weekend listening to and meeting with  people who have been affected. I have seen firsthand the devastating  effects of President Trump's actions. I want to start with a story of  someone I met at Logan Airport on Saturday night. The story I want to  read is from CBS Boston, ``Detainee Released After Federal Judge Grants  Stay On Trump's Immigration Freeze.''         Hamed Hosseini Bay was questioned at Logan Airport Saturday       while trying to get back into America after caring for his       sick father in his native Iran. Hosseini Bay has lived in the       Boston area for approximately nine years. After a judge       granted a case brought by lawyers from the American Civil       Liberties Union Saturday night, Hosseini Bay was reunited       with his wife and daughter, who had traveled with him to Iran       but returned two weeks earlier.        He was not angry about his questioning.        ``Everybody was friendly,'' Hosseini Bay told WBZ-TV's Jim       Smith. ``They had to do what they had to do. I'm grateful for       all the people back there, but it was chaotic.''        Hosseini Bay's wife is now questioning what the future will       be like for her family in America. ``It's just terrifying how       my life has changed in two days, in three days,'' she said.       ``I don't know (about the future). Last week everything was       normal. I would pick up my daughter from preschool, she was       like everyone else, I was like everyone else. But now we're       different.''    I met with this family. This is what President Trump's order means.  It means stopping people like this and telling them that their future  is different now in America.   I am going to read another story. This one is from NBC Boston.  ``Protesters Rally as Doctors, Students Blocked From Entering Country  After Trump's Orders.''         At Boston's Logan International Airport, at least six       people from Iran were detained Saturday after their flights       landed in the U.S. A Federal judge in New York issued a       temporary stay late Saturday for all detainees affected by       Trump's executive orders, which barred all refugees from       entering the United States for four months, and indefinitely       halted any from Syria. Trump argued the ban is needed to keep       out ``radical Islamic terrorists.''        A tweet by Samira Asgari, an Iranian doctor, stated that       she was denied boarding when she arrived for her flight to       the U.S.  [[Page S476]]       from Germany. In a Skype interview from Switzerland, Asgari       told us she had planned to come to the U.S. to start a study       at Harvard Medical School analyzing tuberculosis.        ``My view of America of course, doesn't change because of a       decision a politician makes. My view of America changes       because the land that used to be the land of those who want       to be there, who want to do something good to the community       and take something good from the community--that picture of       America has changed for me,'' she said.        Several students at Massachusetts colleges also tweeted       that they were being blocked from entering the country.        In a statement, MIT officials said they're ``very       troubled'' that Trump's executive order is affecting the       university's community and are exploring options for helping       impacted students.        Northeastern University in a statement to their community       offered support to their students, faculty and staff       reminding them of ``their commitment to each other.''        We believe in the commitment to inform each other, but that       is what it is that Donald Trump is trying to destroy.    Another story, from WBUR, a ``Somali Family Resettling In Lowell  Worries For Other Refugees As Trump Promises Restrictions.''         The order will have global implications, including for one       newly arrived Somali family now living in Lowell.        The three Ahmed sisters from Somalia huddled on a couch       with their mother in a lobby of a busy office. Each woman       wore a brightly colored head scarf and winter jacket, and       each clutched a plastic bag carrying their personal       documents.        They are the most recent refugees to be welcomed at the       International Institute of New England's Lowell resettlement       office. And, with Trump's refugee restrictions hanging in the       balance, they are likely the last Somali family to enter the       state for some time.        ``My mom and dad fled from the conflict in Mogadishu,''       explained Hawo Ahmed, 24. She and her twin sister were only 4       months old when their parents fled for Kenya.        Hawo retold the story of her mother, Fatuma, and why she       and Hawo's father left in 1993 amid the Somali Civil War.        ``She said that it was, like, conflict all over the       country,'' Hawo said. ``People were killing each other, like       tribes, different tribes were killing each other. Whenever       they see you, they kill you, and they even used to come in       the houses to rape the girls and kill them. So they had to       move.''        The youngest daughter, Asha, was born in Kenya, where the       girls grew up, and went to school and learned English. Still,       they all very much consider themselves Somali.        When asked about their father, one of the young women said       she watched him die in 2006 from an asthma attack. She said       the family didn't have enough money for a new inhaler.        After beginning the refugee application process in Kenya 6       years ago, the family arrived in Manchester, NH, only a few       days ago.        Hawo and Muna said their arrival barely felt real, like a       dream come true. And then, Hawo said, as soon as they got off       the plane, they saw the news about Trump's executive orders       on the airport television.        ``Even tears were filled up in my eyes, because I felt very       bad for others,'' she said. ``They have more expectations,       some were even told where they are going, which city they are       going, and if they stop all the things, it's going to be very       painful. I just have a very sincere request to the President,       that he should drop out that idea. That is all.''        Hawo said that they know many fellow refugees in Kenya who       are in the final phases of their application process.        She said her aunt and cousin, who live in a refugee camp in       Kampala, Uganda, had only one more interview to complete       before they were hoping to meet them in Massachusetts. Now       they're not sure what will happen.        ``I couldn't sleep last night just thinking about them, and       she has been in the process for so long, and we want, if you       can help her,'' Hawo said.    That is what Donald Trump is doing to people around the world.   Another story--WCVB TV.         Trump's executive order worries Massachusetts family       awaiting loved one.        With the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump fulfilled       a campaign promise that temporarily bans more than 130       million people from entering the United States.        Several people were prevented from entering Boston due to       Trump's executive order.        ``We are very worried. We are very concerned,'' Omar Salem,       of Canton, said. ``I'm hoping for the best. I'm hoping that I       could get a text from him saying, `I'm here.'''        Salem is anxiously awaiting his brother's arrival back in       Massachusetts. The Syrian-born, Boston-based orthodontist was       on vacation when the President signed the executive order       suspending visa entry from seven countries.        ``We didn't know it was going to be that bad and that       shameful,'' Salem said.        Salem's brother thought his green card would be enough to       secure his return, but the business owner is now facing       uncertainty.        ``It always starts somewhere and we see it evolving to       become much bigger and much more sophisticated,'' Salem said.        While Salem is hoping to see his brother soon, his heart is       heavy for the millions of refugees and visa holders, who see       the U.S. as a sanctuary of freedom and acceptance.        ``I really call it un-American to do this with the stroke       of a pen,'' Salem said.        The seven countries included in the executive order may be       just a starting point as the order left room for a broader       ban.    That is what Donald Trump is doing around the world.   Another story--this is a Facebook post from Niki Rhamati, a student  at MIT.         I just got back home (Tehran) and I figured I should break       the silence. I want to start by saying how grateful I am to       all the friends, faculty, alums, sorority sisters, staff and       admin at MIT and other parts of the US who have contacted me       in the past couple of hours. My inbox is flooded with       messages and emails of love and support. I am truly       speechless, grateful and proud to be part of the MIT       community. I have never been subjected to any form of       religious or racial discrimination at MIT. Our community is       extremely diverse, inclusive, supportive and accepting of       individuals and their backgrounds. But I cannot believe all       this love is coming from the same country that banned me from       entering its borders just a couple of hours ago.        I don't want to get to the political mess that has created       this situation for me and many others. I just want to share       what millions of other people and I are going through, and       simply what it feels like to be an Iranian and targeted to       such racism and discrimination--things I have been very       familiar with most of my life.        I currently have a valid multiple entry student visa that       I've used for the past year and a half and have traveled very       smoothly (thank you Obama!). I came home (Tehran) to visit my       parents and family. I suspected I would not be able to travel       as easily as before with the new President, so I extended my       stay.        Here's the story of what happened this past week. On       Wednesday, I woke up to the announcement of the new Executive       Order by President Trump that would restrict entry for Syrian       refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries       (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen) for 30       days. As BBC Persian, one of the reliable sources here,       contacted immigration attorneys and Politicians, this order       was read and interpreted as, ``issuance of any types of       immigrant and non-immigrant visas would be banned for       citizens of those countries for 30 days.''        The President had not yet signed this order so the ban was       not yet effective. I changed my flight to another one that       would get me to Boston on Saturday night with a transfer in       Qatar. It was rumored that the President signed the Order       once I was on my way to the airport, and it was executed       while I was in my first flight to Doha. But I looked on the       White House website, BBC and Washington Post and nothing had       been published yet. When I got to Doha, I was stopped at the       gate for my U.S. flight.        We found out that the ban (which is effective for 90 days       now instead of 30), included everyone currently holding an       immigrant, student or tourist visa as well as Green Card       holders. We heard a lot of people were deported at the       American border in different cities.        About 30 other Iranians and I were stuck in Doha, waiting       for flights back to Tehran. Among them were old couples       trying to go and see their children in the US, 2 old women       trying to be with and help their pregnant daughters there for       their third trimesters, students who had just gotten their       visas and families who had sold their belongings back home so       they could build a better life in the US. All these people       had gotten visas legally and had gone through background       checks. The President had said that the goal of this Order       was dealing with illegal immigration. Do any of the people       sound like illegal immigrants?        This will not secure the borders from the terrorism and       illegal immigrants. It will only increase racism in the       American society. The President is trying to make       Islamophobia a norm and policy by which he wants to lead the       country. There has not been a single terrorist activity from       those 7 countries listed above, in the US.        If you feel like helping millions of people facing this,       please contact your representatives or senators in your areas       and ask them to fight against this absurd ban. Reach out to       friends and ask them to do the same. Please also let me and       everyone else know how we can contribute to this.        As I was stuck in Doha, with other Iranians, I was telling       stories of interactions with many of the Americans I know.       Please know that I love and respect all of you because you       have always treated me with love and respect.    This is who Donald Trump is trying to keep out of the country.   Another story--this time from CNN.         A Syrian teen was headed to MIT and then came the ban.        Mahmoud Hassan was ecstatic when he got the acceptance       letter.        All through high school, the 18-year-old had one goal in       mind: get an engineering degree from the prestigious       Massachusetts Institute of Technology.        But Hassan is from Damascus, Syria. And Friday, he had his       hopes crushed through no fault of his own.  [[Page S477]]         When President Trump signed the executive order on       immigration, temporarily banning citizens from certain       Muslim-majority countries, Syria was one of the seven.        ``Now Trump's orders will prevent me from going there,'' he       told CNN. ``My dreams are basically ruined.''        Hassan had been looking forward to his journey to the       Cambridge campus in the fall. He says he had been offered a       scholarship.        He's read and reread that letter from MIT dozens of times.        ``Dear Mahmoud, On behalf of the Admissions Committee, it       is my pleasure to offer you admission to the MIT Class of       2021! You stood out as one of the most talented and promising       students in one of the most competitive applicant pools in       the history of the Institute.''        Hassan doesn't know what he'll do next.    This is who Donald Trump is determined to keep out of America.   Another story. This one is from our office.   A constituent from Concord, MA, came into my office in Boston just  this morning--Monday, January 30, 2017. She came looking for more  information on the current status of the Muslim ban, on behalf of her  husband, who was originally born in Iran.   She explained that when he was young, he received refugee status in  Australia for religious persecution, as he was raised in the Baha'i  faith. He now has dual citizenship in Iran and Australia and is a green  card holder of 10 years here in the United States. He is the vice  president of a startup company that requires him to travel outside the  country often but has decided that, because of the latest Executive  orders, to stay grounded in the United States until further notice. He  is currently safe in the United States.   Emam has also decided to begin his U.S. citizenship application, and  the couple have two young children whom they are raising in the United  States, afraid to travel outside the United States on business because  of President Trump's ban.   Another story. This is a story via the Wall Street Journal.         Iraqi interpreter Laith al-Haydar received multiple death       threats for working with the American military at the height       of the war in his country. In return for helping the U.S., he       and tens of thousands of other Iraqis were promised U.S.       immigration visas.        Nearly four years after he applied, the 41-year-old father       of two is still waiting for a visa--and now he faces a new       setback: President Donald Trump signed an order suspending       immigration from several countries with a Muslim majority,       including Iraq, and a temporary ban on all refugees.        Mr. Haydar is among roughly 58,000 Iraqi applicants for       U.S. immigrant visas and refugee resettlement under the       federal programs that promised to fast-track entry for Iraqis       who worked with the U.S. government and other institutions       deemed critical to the U.S.-led effort in Iraq, according to       the State Department. A similar program for Afghans who've       worked with the U.S. government may also be at risk.        At least one Iraqi and two Afghans who worked with the U.S.       government and also qualify for expedited immigration visas       were turned away from American ports of entry on Friday and       Saturday, a State Department official said, adding that       several more were prevented from boarding planes to the U.S.        A substantial backlog of applications remains in part       because Congress limits the number of visas that can be       granted each year. Frustration with visa delays has now been       aggravated by Mr. Trump's executive orders.        Critics of the visa ban say it abandons thousands of       valuable allies abroad and risks deterring such people from       working with the United States in the future at a time when       Mr. Trump is promising a more aggressive military posture       abroad.        ``These guys laid their lives on the line alongside       American soldiers and got paid a fraction of what I made,''       said Jake Thomas, a U.S. Army veteran who worked with Mr.       Haydar in Iraq and who now lives in Georgia. If they want       out, we need to honor our promises and get them out. Mr.       Thomas is one of several U.S. military officers who have       written letters to the State Department appealing for Mr.       Haydar to get a visa. He said he sympathizes with some of the       views regarding immigration that Mr. Trump campaigned on, but       he added that Iraqis like Mr. Haydar ``were singled out and       shot at for serving the United States and we made a       promise.'' Mr. Thomas said he knew of five Iraqi interpreters       who were killed in the 15 months of his last tour in Iraq,       including 3 who were gunned down in their homes for working       with the U.S. military.    President Trump continues to ignore the damage he is doing to the  safety of our country and our servicemen and servicewomen overseas.  Brave men and women who risked their lives to help U.S. soldiers in  Iraq have already been caught up in the President's unconstitutional  order.   I just want to associate myself with the man who said--who had been  there, the soldier who had been there--that America made a promise. I  believe in an America that keeps its promises. Donald Trump's order  breaks our promises.   Another story, this one from Marcolla via PRI:         The Iraqi linguist who worked side by side with US troops       in Baghdad put her life on the line for America's war effort.    Now her family is in danger back in Iraq and she fears her efforts to  get them to safety in America are all but doomed.         ``I'm scared. The chance to see my family reunited again is       very slim now,'' she says. ``People like me and my family who       helped and supported America, I believe we should be       reunited. The history of the United States is to support       people and help them, not to separate the families.''        Marcolla was just 18 and living in Baghdad shortly after       American tanks rolled into the Iraqi capital in 2003. She was       recruited to work for the US military. Her role caught the       attention of Iraqi militants. They sought revenge. They       burned down Marcolla's house, kidnapped her father and       murdered her husband.        Fearing for her life, she applied for a US visa. And in       2013, after seven years of waiting, she received the       permission she had been waiting for. But Marcolla had to       leave her parents and siblings behind, even though she says       they too were in danger because of her service with US       troops. She says she tries to talk with her family in Baghdad       daily. ``Every day their lives are in danger,'' she says.       ``They have to change their address, move from place to       place. They live in the unknown.''        Marcolla is worried that the refugee ban proposed Wednesday       means her parents and siblings will never reach American       soil.        ``We already been in extreme vetting,'' she says. ``I       understand and I respect the US rules and the safety and       national security. . . . I understand that and I respect       that. However, there are people in Iraq who have a long       history of supporting America in Iraq and Afghanistan--the       linguists, the translators--they deserve and they need their       papers to be expedited.''    These are the people Donald Trump is keeping out of America.   Another story from Mother Jones:         ``Immoral,'' ``Stupid,'' and ``Counterproductive'':       National Security Experts Slam Trump's ``Muslim Ban.''        ``At the moment we need them most, we're telling these       people, `Get screwed.' ''        While Trump's executive order claims to be in the interest       of ``protecting the nation,'' experts in national security       and counterterrorism who spoke with Mother Jones argue that       it poses potentially disastrous immediate and long-term       security threats to the nation and US personnel overseas.        ``Not only is it immoral and stupid, it's also       counterproductive,'' says Patrick Skinner, a former CIA       terrorism case officer who now works at Soufan Group, a       security consulting firm. ``We've got military intelligence       and diplomatic personnel on the ground right now in Syria,       Libya, and Iraq who are working side by side with the people       imbedded in combat and training and advising. At no time in       the US's history have we depended more on local--and I mean       local--partnerships for counterterrorism. We need people in       Al Bab, Syria; we depend on people in certain parts of       eastern Mosul, Iraq; in Cert, Libya. At the exact moment we       need them most, we're telling those people, `Get screwed.' ''        Kirk W. Johnson, who spent a year on reconstruction in       Fallujah in Iraq with the US Agency for International       Development (USAID) echoes Skinner's fears: ``This will have       immediate national security implications, in that we are not       going to be able to recruit people to help us right now, and       people are not going to step forward to help us in any future       wars if this is our stance.''        The US-led war on ISIS is but one front of a constellation       of fights against extremist groups that could be hampered by       Trump's decision. ``The US is officially banning people in       these countries at the same time we are trying to build up       local support to fight ISIS,'' Skinner said. ``It takes a       long time to build trust with these people. You have to start       over, say, `Okay, starting now, trust me.' How many times can       you get away with that?'' It also sends a message that groups       like the so-called Islamic State can exploit. Elizabeth       Goitein, the codirector of the Brennan Center's Liberty &       National Security Program, says, ``The message this projects       is that America sees Muslims as a threat--not specific       actors who are intent on committing terrorist acts. The       message that America really is at war with Islam will be       ISIS's best friend.''        BuzzFeed reporters Mike Giglio and Munzer Al-Awad spoke       with five current or former ISIS fighters who cited Trump's       divisiveness as a factor that will weaken America. They added       that his rhetoric against Muslims will help them reinforce       their narrative that America and the West are fighting not       just terrorism, but Islam itself. ``Trump will shorten the       time it takes for us to achieve our goals,'' said one.        Meanwhile, the very allies who have operated alongside US       personnel in war zones for years--contractors and translators       like Darweesh--are once again being abandoned. For the past       decade, Johnson has been leading an effort to resettle Iraqi       allies, many of whom, he says, face torture, kidnapping, and  [[Page S478]]       death after collaborating with American soldiers. It all       started in 2006 when he heard from an Iraqi USAID colleague       who had been identified by a militia. The militia left a       severed pig's head on his door step, along with a message       saying that it would be his head next. Despite his years of       helping the United States, the US government offered no help,       and he had to flee the country with his wife.    ``We are not going to be able to recruit people to help us right now,  and people are not going to step forward to help us in any future wars  if this is our stance.''   This is what Donald Trump's Executive order is doing. It is putting  Americans at risk around the world.   Another story from Newsweek: ``Spy Veterans Say Trump's Muslim- Country Visa Ban Will Hurt Recruitment.         President Donald Trump's temporary ban on immigrants from       seven Muslim-majority nations takes a major recruiting tool       out of the hands of US spy handlers, say a growing number of       intelligence veterans.        For decades, CIA and US military spy recruiters have held       out the promise of eventual resettlement in America to induce       foreigners to turn coat and work secretly for the United       States against terrorist groups or repressive governments. In       reality, many were caught before they ever made it, but       during the Cold War countless Eastern Europeans living under       communist rule, and more recently, Muslims across the Middle       East, North Africa and Central Asia, have worked secretly for       US spy agencies on the promise that they or their children       would eventually be extracted. Another effective recruiting       tool for US operatives has been to offer their agents'       families medical care or education in the United States.        Those inducements, a primary recruiting tool in Muslim       land, were effectively suspended with Trump's executive order       Friday to temporarily ban immigration from seven critical       targets of the U.S. spy agencies--Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen,       Sudan, Libya and Somalia. The departments of State and       Homeland Security, the order stipulates, may allow entry from       those countries on ``a case-by-case basis,'' but it's a balky       arrangement not likely to appeal to the managers of the CIA's       highly secretive operations directorate, its espionage and       covert action arm.        Intelligence veterans with vast counterterrorism experience       are expressing dismay about how the order will affect their       spy operations.        ``These individuals often put themselves at the risk of       death for working with the U.S., and without the ability to       offer them safety, we will be reducing the likelihood that       those in countries targeted by the ban will work with us in       the future,'' Phillip Lohaus, a decorated veteran of the U.S.       Special Operations Command and CIA, tells Newsweek.        ``We relied heavily on local translators, many of whom have       gone on to forge productive lives for themselves here in the       States,'' Lohaus added. ``Why would they take such a risk if       they knew that they would face retribution or death by       staying in their home countries?''        ``Absolutely,'' agreed Cindy Storer, a former member of the       CIA intelligence team that tracked al-Qaeda leader Osama bin       Laden. ``It hurts,'' she said in a brief interview. ``Capital       h-u-r-t-s.'' Imagine, she said, if the ban had been in place       when Jamal al Fadl, a Sudanese Muslim and key al-Qaeda       operative, showed up at the American embassy in the mid-1990s       and volunteered to defect to the United States. FBI       counterterror agents brought him into the U.S., where he       provided ``a major breakthrough of intelligence on the       creation, character, direction, and intentions of al-Qaeda,''       according to the official 9/11 Commission report.    And that is what Donald Trump is putting an end to.   Another story from the Washington Post: ``Dissent memo circulating in  the State Department over Trump's policy on refugees and immigrants.''   For this one, Foreign Service officers have written a memo--and they  shared it with the Washington Post--in opposition to President Trump's  Executive order. Here are excerpts from a leaked dissent memo by U.S.  Foreign Service officers regarding the Executive orders:   It will immediately sour relations with these seven countries, as  well as much of the Muslim world, which sees the ban as religiously  motivated. These governments of these countries are important allies  and partners in the fight against terrorism, regionally and  globally. By alienating them, we lose access to the intelligence and  resources we need to fight the root causes of terror abroad before the  attack occurs within our borders. It will increase anti-American  sentiment. It will have an immediate and clear humanitarian impact. It  will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy.    Looking beyond its effectiveness, this ban stands in opposition to  the core American and constitutional values. This ban stands in  opposition to the core American and constitutional values that we, as  Federal employees, took an oath to uphold.   The United States is a nation of immigrants, starting from its very  origins. The concept that immigrants and foreigners are welcome is an  essential element of our society, our government, and our foreign  policy. So, too, is the concept that we are all equal under the law and  that we, as a nation, abhor discrimination, whether it is based on  race, religion, sex, or national origin. Combined together, that means  we have a special obligation to maintain an immigration system that is  as free as possible from discrimination, that does not have implied or  actual religious tests, and that views individuals as individuals, not  as part of stereotyped groups.   Banning travelers from these seven countries calls back to some of  the worst times in our history. Laws enacted in the 1920s and which  lasted through the 1960s severely restricted immigration based on  national origin and, in some cases, race. The decision to restrict the  freedom of Japanese Americans in the United States and foreign citizens  who wanted to travel to settle in the United States during the 1940s  has been a source of lasting shame for many in our country. Decades  from now, we will look back and realize we made the same mistakes as  our predecessors: shutting borders in a knee-jerk reaction instead of  setting up systems of checks that protect our interests and our values.   We do not need to place a blanket ban that keeps 220 million people-- men, women, and children--from entering the United States to protect  our homeland. We do not need to alienate entire societies to stay safe.  And we do not need to sacrifice our reputation as a nation which is  open and welcoming to protect our families. It is well within our reach  to create a visa process which is more secure, which reflects American  values, and which would make the Department proud.   Again, this is a dissent memo circulating in the State Department  over President Trump's policy on refugees and immigrants.   And this is what Donald Trump's Executive order does; it makes us  less safe. It is wrong.   Another story, from a Boston Globe op-ed, Matt Gallagher, who is a  veteran. The headline: ``Trump rejects the Muslims who helped us.''         The bravest person I've ever known went by the nickname       Suge Knight. He was as physically imposing as the infamous       music producer, but he was calm and bighearted, with a smile       as wide as a canyon. A Sudanese Muslim, Suge served as my       scout platoon's interpreter during our deployment to Iraq in       2007 and 2008, and he went on every patrol and mission with       us, no matter the circumstances. He'd survived multiple       roadside bomb attacks, had lost three young children to the       bombings of the first Gulf war, and yet still believed in       America and what America represented to him and his family.        Though he doubted he'd ever get to our country, he aspired       for his children to do so. ``Perhaps my grandchildren will go       to school with your kids,'' he once told me with typical       paternal charm. ``I'd like that very much.'' I felt the same.       We all did. He was one of us.        President Trump's recent executive order on Muslim refugees       and immigrants works to ensure that such a dream never comes       true. Muslim allies, including interpreters like Suge in Iraq       and Afghanistan, have done more for the United States during       the past 16 years of war than most Americans will even think       of doing their entire lives. Yet we're abandoning them in       their hour of need, wrapping ourselves up in a big, billowing       flag of fear and pretending it's for safety. We're also       abandoning Middle Eastern refugees fleeing the very       terrorists we've professed to combat, who have seen their       homes and lives destroyed and now seek shelter on our shores       the same way immigrants have for generations.        This is a national disgrace. The president's executive       order betrays American values and weakens our national       security all at once. Our country was founded as a haven.       Trump and his administration seem intent on turning it into a       medieval fortress.        In November, shortly after the election, I joined a       nonpartisan group in Washington, D.C., to advocate for Muslim       refugees and immigrants--Veterans For American Ideals, a       project of Human Rights First. There was a gray pall over the       city, and a deep sense of uncertainty for what awaited, even       in Republican offices. No one knew then what we all know now:       Trump really did mean to do what he'd said on the campaign       trail.        Time and time again, Democrats and Republicans alike told       us the United States already has in place the best and most       thorough refugee and immigrant screening process on the       planet. A prominent Republican adviser assured us that       Trump's ``extreme vetting'' idea was just a ploy to rustle up       votes. A national security official suggested that we should       be more thankful Congress  [[Page S479]]       had saved the Special Immigrant Visa program for interpreters       and translators who served with the US military, and       maintained that the amount of issued visas was sufficient,       despite the overflowing backlog of requests.        A shouting match ensued. Enraged veterans can have our own       sort of diplomatic style.        I look back at that week with both pride and despondency.       On one hand, to see so many young American veterans standing       up for the principles of our nation--often the very same       principles that led them to enlist in the military to begin       with--was stirring. We tried, sometimes successfully and       sometimes not, to convey to politicians the importance of       remaining true to our Muslim brothers- and sisters-in-arms.       We also tried to remind them of the secondary and tertiary       effects of not honoring the bonds forged in combat. On the       other hand, bearing witness to how easily dismissed entire       lives and formative experiences can be by fellow citizens       (let alone elected representatives) was rather dismaying.        Even in our era of yellow-ribbon patriotism and star-      spangled grandiosity, veterans' stories of heroic Muslim       translators and brave, dedicated local Iraqis and Afghans       were, sometimes, met with hollow stares and empty platitudes       in Washington. What we were telling these officials defied       their preconceived notions about vets, and Muslims, and how       vets of the terror wars were supposed to feel about Muslims.       What we were telling them was that American security was       dependent on opening our doors to as many vetted refugees and       immigrants as possible, not barricading ourselves and saying,       ``We're not that America anymore.'' What we were telling them       was that we knew, more than any other group of Americans,       what the hearts and souls of the Middle Eastern people were,       and that those hearts and souls were so very much like our       own.    These are just some of the stories of what Donald Trump is doing to  people here in America, to Americans abroad, and people around the  world.   This Executive order is illegal. It is unconstitutional. It is  immoral, and it must be overturned by Congress.   I understand that under the rules, a majority can stop any Senator  after speaking for an hour postcloture, but there is a bit more I would  like to say.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 additional  minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I will continue with the story that was published this morning in the  Boston Globe. This is from a veteran who was writing of his own  experiences.   He says:         Trump's executive order, which seeks to ``keep radical       Islamic terrorists out of the United States,'' will only       embolden those very same people, who already had a near-zero       chance of gaining entry to our country to begin with. This       order proves too many ISIS and al-Qaeda talking points true       about what the United States really is, and will serve as an       excellent recruiting tool for those organizations and others.        This executive order isn't about national security. It's       about fear-mongering for ends we can only guess at.        This shouldn't be a partisan issue. As my friend Phil Klay,       winner of the National Book Award and a Marine veteran,       pointed out last year, Ronald Reagan's ``city on a hill''       speech outlined an America ``For all the pilgrims from all       the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness toward       home.''        ``I get that people are scared,'' Klay continued. ``But       it's only during frightening times when you get to find out       if your country really deserves to call itself the `home of       the brave.' ''        Donald Trump's zero-sum worldview and flimsy understanding       of the intricacies of modern war and terrorism threaten to       undermine our republic. His policy on Middle Eastern refugees       and immigrants must be checked and resisted by citizens of       all political stripes, legislators of both major parties and       the judicial courts.        After 16 years of war, much of my generation of military       veterans stands with the Middle Eastern people we sweated,       labored and bled with, and sometimes died for. It's going to       be a fight, but it's one we're not going to lose. The legacy       of America's past is at stake, as well as the soul of its       future.        Matt Gallagher is the author of the novel ``Youngblood''       and the memoir ``Kaboom: Embracing the Suck in a Savage       Little War.'' He is an Iraq war veteran and a former US Army       captain.    And he wrote this morning in the Boston Globe.   We are here tonight because this country is in crisis. We are here  tonight because it is a constitutional crisis, because it is a moral  crisis. We are here tonight to stand up and ask the rest of the U.S.  Senate to overturn Donald Trump's Executive order. We have that power.  All we need is the courage, the courage to stand up and do what is  right. This is why we came to the U.S. Senate, to stand up and do what  is right.   I call on the rest of the Senate to overturn Donald Trump's illegal,  unconstitutional, and immoral Executive order.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.
