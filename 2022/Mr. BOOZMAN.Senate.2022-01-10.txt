 Madam President, I rise today to recognize  Springdale Police Chief Mike Peters, who spent his career serving his  community with unwavering commitment. His retirement as chief of the  Springdale Police Department will surely leave big shoes to fill.   Chief Peters' dedication to his job is a testament to his character  and courage, beginning with his pledge to serve his country in the U.S.  Army. Being in uniform for more than 5 years taught him countless  lessons about the importance of leading by example and serving others.  That service helped shape him into the leader he is today and gave him  the tools to build a 30-year career in the Springdale Police  Department.   Peters' Arkansas roots also helped inspire him to stay in the Natural  State and serve his community. He graduated from the University of  Arkansas and demonstrated his abilities in service and in the  classroom, which helped his career advancement.   After his time in the Army and the Arkansas National Guard, Peters  worked in investigations and drug enforcement. He thrived in this role  and was promoted to sergeant in 1998. After working as a shift  supervisor for 4 years, he was promoted to Lieutenant in 2001 and then  captain in 2004. His clear devotion to the force and record of time and  time again sacrificing for his community allowed him to advance  quickly. Peters' served rotations in administration, patrol, and  investigations before being promoted to Springdale chief of police on  September 11, 2015.   His accomplishments and accolades have been plentiful and essential,  including the design and construction of the Criminal Justice Complex,  which houses the new police department and district court and its  offices; graduating from the FBI National Academy; and memberships  within the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Arkansas  Association of Chiefs of Police, and the FBI National Academy  Association.  [[Page S116]]    Chief Peters is known for being a strong leader who truly cared for  those under him. ``It's his leadership and how he brings up others  beneath him to build on what the department has done and advance the  department,'' Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse said about his service.   Peters' long and extremely successful career is representative of so  much of our law enforcement across the State and the Nation. I am so  thankful and proud of the men and women in blue who serve their  communities everyday by keeping citizens safe and providing them vital  support and assistance. I congratulate Chief Peters on the incredible  impact he has left on Springdale and his fellow members of the  Springdale Police Department. I wish him luck in his next  endeavor.                            ____________________
