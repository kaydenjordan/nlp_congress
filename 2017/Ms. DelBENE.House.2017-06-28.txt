 Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans may have delayed the  vote, but make no mistake, they are pushing ahead with a destructive,  dangerous healthcare bill that is not just mean, it is immoral. The  American people are right to be outraged. I am outraged.   We should be working together to give people better coverage at lower  cost. Instead, Senate leaders crafted legislation that leads to lost  coverage for 22 million Americans, skyrocketing deductibles, hospital  closures in rural communities, and the return of annual and lifetime  caps on care.   For families like Colton's in Mill Creek, Washington, who have  watched as their 17-year-old son battled high-risk leukemia for 8  years, I can promise you, we are not backing down. Colton is in his  fifth remission and still fighting--and so are we.   Healthcare is not a privilege reserved for those fortunate enough to  be wealthy or healthy. It is a human right, and it is worth fighting  for.                            ____________________
