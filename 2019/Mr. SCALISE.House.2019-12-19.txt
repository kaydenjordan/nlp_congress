 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for yielding. I  thank all the people who we have worked with to get to this point  because passing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement is  going to be a major victory for American workers, yet another sign that  we can improve on our current trade relationships.   I think a lot of people were concerned that maybe the President would  pull out of NAFTA because he was clearly critical of the flaws of the  previous agreement. But what he did was actually go and negotiate with  Mexico and get a better deal for American workers. Then he went to  Canada, which might have been a little more reluctant, but he got a  better deal with Canada, as well.   What you see is not only a trade agreement that is a major win for  the American economy--conservative estimates show over 160,000 new jobs  get created. Agriculture gets a big win because many of our products  that we can't sell to Canada now will be able to be sent to those  markets.   This shows how Congress can work with this administration to do  something that is really good for American workers.                                time  1115    But what it also does, Madam Speaker, is it sends a message to the  rest of the world that we can work with our friends to get better trade  deals, our other friends around the world like Japan, like the United  Kingdom, who would like to work to get better trade deals. But if you  can't get a deal from your neighbors from the north and south, you  surely are not going to be able to get a deal with anyone else.   Now, this tells them that we can close deals and that there are other  countries lining up that want to be a part of this economy. We have the  hottest economy in the world, and it is only going to get better for  workers here.   But it then sends a message to China that not just America wants to  send, but a message that all of our allies around the world want to  send, that when you do business with America, you have to follow the  rules. You can't play by your own set of rules. And now, for  enforcement of deals, it really shows that China is going to have to  become part of the world economy and play by the rules that everyone  else in the world plays by.   That is an important win for all of those forgotten men and women  across this country who appreciate the work President Trump has done,  Bob Lighthizer, who has been his quarterback on this all the way  through, and everyone else. So it is going to be a big win for our  country and for our economy.  [[Page H12250]]
