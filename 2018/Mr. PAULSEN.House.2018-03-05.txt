 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my support as a  cosponsor of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, which gives  Liberians in deferred enforced departure permanent status.   Thousands of Liberians came to the United States to escape civil war,  seeking a better life and a safer environment to raise their families.  For the last 25 years, many have sought and realized the American Dream  through hard work, drive, and determination. They have become small- business owners and leaders in our community. Minnesota is home to one  of the largest Liberian communities in the United States, many of whom  live in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of getting to  know many members of the Liberian community personally. I have heard  their stories, and I have seen their love for America firsthand.  However, they are facing uncertainty today because their temporary  period of protection is about to expire, so it is imperative that  action be taken to ensure they are able to live here, work here, and  continue to offer their contributions as important members of our  community.                            ____________________
