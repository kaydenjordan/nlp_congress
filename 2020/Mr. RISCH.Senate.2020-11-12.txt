 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today I am pleased to honor Idaho Sewing for Sports in Grangeville as  the Idaho Small Business of the month for November 2020.   Idaho Sewing for Sports--ISS--is a manufacturer of custom padding and  coverings for ski resorts and summer recreation destinations throughout  the globe. In 1986, founders Gail and Will Williams returned from a  business trip to Canada and found themselves in Grangeville, ID. It was  during this stop they were captivated by its natural beauty, lifestyle,  and community. As a result of this experience, the Williams decided to  relocate their family and business to Grangeville, where it has  operated for nearly 25 years.   ISS has developed a reputation for producing high-quality custom  coverings for lift seats, wall and tower paddings, zip lines, and other  resort infrastructure. Since its relocation to Idaho, ISS has grown to  be one of the largest custom padding manufacturers in America. While  the Williams have since retired from the business' day-to-day  operations, their son Gunther and his wife Joy now manage the business.   In addition to operating a successful business, ISS has been integral  to aiding the community's COVID-19 relief efforts. As a board member of  the Syringa Hospital in Grangeville, Gunther Williams learned that the  hospital was experiencing a shortage of gowns and masks. In response,  Gunther jumped into action and directed his staff to coordinate with  the hospital to develop medical grade gowns and masks. Syringa Hospital  supplied ISS with the patterns it needed to produce the gowns and  provided surgical blankets to produce masks. Through their heroic  collaboration, ISS produced thousands of gowns and masks at cost that  were distributed to hospitals and first responders throughout the  country.   Congratulations to Gunther, Joy, and all of the hard-working  employees of Idaho Sewing for Sports on being selected as the Idaho  Small Business of the Month for November 2020. Your commitment to  service and community is humbling, and you make our great State proud.  I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
