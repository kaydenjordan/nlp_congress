 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle on the Energy and Commerce Committee and our new chair of the  Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, Mrs. Blackburn, and the  new ranking member on the committee, Mr. Doyle.   I believe by the end of today, Mr. Speaker, the House Energy and  Commerce Committee will have produced close to 20 pieces of legislation  already this Congress for consideration by the House, and I think all  of them have been bipartisan. That is the kind of work this great  committee is known for and we hope to continue to do. I thank my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   I think we agreed that the FCC was in need of process reform. This is  the people's business that they are conducting. It needs to be done in  an open and transparent and predictable way so that all of those  involved in the public's business can see what is happening.   The Federal Communications Commission regulates an incredibly dynamic  and innovative sector of the American economy. The communications  technology sector directly impacts the lives of consumers in meaningful  ways. Consumers are able to map their ways to new places, find  information and enriching content, and reach their loved ones who might  live in the most remote places, literally, of the globe.   Communications technology also enables other industries to reach  their audiences in new and life-changing ways: health care, finance,  manufacturing, agriculture. All of these industries are leveraging  communications technologies in ways to better serve the American  consumer.   It is essential that we do as much as we can to protect and promote  innovation in this sector of the economy. We can't afford to allow this  fundamental sector of the economy to languish or fail under outdated  regulations or faulty regulatory processes. That is why Committee on  Energy and Commerce has focused on improving the processes at the FCC,  so that it operates in an effective and transparent manner.   This bill represents the fourth time, as you have heard, that we have  brought a measure to this House floor that seeks to improve the way the  FCC conducts its business. Last Congress, as chairman of the  Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, process reform was a  priority and it still is. I am committed to continuing the reform  effort by supporting this legislation once again.   Over the years, we have worked closely across the aisle to formulate  a bipartisan compromise piece of legislation that addresses many of the  concerns that we all share. Whether it is creating certainty for  regulated industries by requiring shot clocks and deadlines, protecting  consumers by prohibiting data dumps at the eleventh hour, or empowering  all Commissioners by creating a tool for bipartisan majority to bring  an item up for a vote at the FCC, this legislation is intended to  improve the way the FCC does its business all across the board.   One of the concerns we heard from some on the committee during the  consideration of this legislation was that an overly proscriptive piece  of legislation could hamstring the agency. Well, I think we have  structured this legislation to fully address that legitimate concern by  allowing the agency, itself, to determine the specifics of the  overarching principles that we set forth. We give them that  flexibility. We just want them to do the job.   For example, the bill requires that all Commissioners have adequate  time to review decision documents before having to vote. However, we  allow the agency to determine what the adequate amount of time is  through a rulemaking process that will generate input from the  industries, the consumers, the stakeholders; and, ultimately, that  should result in a Commission decision that reflects the way that the  agency can best function.                                time  1615    I think it is important to note that we are still extremely committed  to these important reforms, even though we have seen a change in  administrations and will see a new chairman.  [[Page H576]]  Process reform is not about political ideology or partisan rancor,  rather, it is about ensuring that government continues to work for the  people. I am hopeful that this legislation will reach the President's  desk and result in a better, more efficient, more transparent Federal  Communications Commission, the kind of regulator that the most  innovative and dynamic sector in the world deserves.
