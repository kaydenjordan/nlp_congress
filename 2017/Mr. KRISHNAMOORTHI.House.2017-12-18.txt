 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the Members of the House  will cast a vote on the tax conference committee report, the final  version of the Republican tax plan.   The Republican leadership rushed this bill to the finish line at the  expense of small-business owners and working families. I strongly urge  my colleagues to vote ``no.''   As a former small-business owner, I understand firsthand the  importance of tax simplification. Unfortunately, this bill does the  opposite: it complicates our Tax Code while giving companies fewer than  2 weeks to adjust before it goes into effect. This creates serious  uncertainty for small-business owners who create jobs and invest in our  communities.   I support reforming our Tax Code, but I ask my colleagues to stop  rushing this process and to put working families first. There is simply  too much at stake.   We can simplify our tax system without exploding the national debt  and spiking healthcare premiums. For the sake of our economy and our  future, we need to kill this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LaHood for  organizing this Special Order. I am so honored to be a part of it.   As the Congressman mentioned, my name is Raja Krishnamoorthi, a  Congressman representing the great Eighth District of Illinois, which  are the west and northwest suburbs of Chicago   I am proud to join my colleagues tonight in celebrating Illinois'  bicentennial--the 200th year--of statehood. There is something special  in celebrating the anniversary of Illinois' entry into the Union, as it  was the State which produced the man who would save it.   I am proud to be from the Land of Lincoln, but for all of its  national and historic importance, my love of our home State is also  very personal. I did not have the honor of being born in Illinois, but  it is my home and always will be because our State welcomed my family  with open arms, as it has for so many others over the last 200 years.   You see, I was born in New Delhi, India, and when I was 3 months old,  my parents brought our family to the United States so my father could  continue his education and our family could embrace all the  opportunities of this great country.   It wasn't easy and there was struggle, but my family came to know  that the American Dream of building a better life was possible because  the people of Illinois made it so.   We had our challenges, but everything changed for the better when my  father was offered a position as an engineering professor in a  mysterious place called Peoria, Illinois. They did not know where  Peoria, Illinois, was at the time. They unfurled the map, found out  where Peoria was, packed the U-Haul in New York State, and started  driving and driving and driving. They made it to Peoria, but that was  when the golden years in our family started. That is where they  educated their two sons in wonderful public schools. That is where they  bought their first home. That is where they entered the middle class.   Every night, my father would say something at the dinner table along  the lines of: Think of the greatness of this country and of Illinois,  and make sure that the governments in both places are there for the  next families who need it.   My father began teaching. My brother and I went to school in Peoria,  and Peoria became our home. More than three decades have passed. My  father is still teaching at Bradley University, and he and my mother  still live in the house I grew up in.   Though I went away for college, I always knew where I would be when  it was time to start my own family. My wife, Priya, and I were married  in Illinois, and all three of our children are being raised there. It  will always be our home, for all the joys of the Cubs' wins and for all  the challenges of its winters.   As I look back on the opportunities my family had, that I have had,  and that my children will have, I will feel an overwhelming sense of  gratitude to Illinois.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Krishnamoorthi for those  heartfelt words about Illinois. I appreciate those very, very much.   Mr. Speaker, next I yield to one of the deans of our delegation from  the city of Chicago, a strong advocate for our State and the city,  Congressman Danny Davis.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank  Representative LaHood for organizing this opportunity for all of us  from Illinois to talk about the greatness of our State.   We have had on the floor individuals from very different parts of the  State, but Illinois has always had a reputation of having one of the  most congenial delegations in Congress any way you cut it. We have  always had that during the time that I have been here, and to be able  to talk about the diversity.   As Representative Krishnamoorthi was making his comments, you could  hear the emotion in his voice as he talked about how Illinois had  welcomed his family. And that is what Illinois has done. It has  welcomed individuals from all parts of the world. Individuals, large  numbers of Puerto Ricans who came from Puerto Rico; Mexican Americans;  individuals who were immigrants; African Americans, like myself, who  migrated from the rural South.   No, I didn't grow up in Illinois. I wasn't born in Illinois. As a  matter of fact, I was born in Arkansas. Of course, it is the only State  in the Bible that Noah looked over his ark and saw.   Large numbers of individuals from my State, from Mississippi, from  Louisiana, from Texas, from Tennessee, from Alabama, and from other  places migrated to Illinois, and especially to Chicago.   I have the opportunity to represent what I consider to be the most  fascinating piece of geography in North America that is compressed into  a political subdivision. My district begins at Lake Michigan. You can't  go any further east. It abuts the lake. It is downtown Chicago. It is  The Loop. It is the Magnificent Mile. It is Water Tower Place. It is  the future's industry. It is the big banks. It is home to corporate  America. Major corporations have their headquarters in downtown  Chicago.   But it also has more hospitals than any other single district in  America, which means that it is a health mecca. It also has some of the  first of the community health centers, the federally qualified health  centers, that were organized, the Mile Squares, the Near Norths, the  Martin Luther Kings, Access Healths.   It is a fascinating place, but then a part of it is home to Ernest  Hemingway. There are more Frank Lloyd Wright structures in my district  in a place called Oak Park than any other place in the world.   With the exception of a few places, it is the museum capital of the  Nation, every kind of entity. But the diversity of its people, some  very wealthy individuals, but then the areas that were devastated by  the riots after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.   But some of the greatness of people like John H. Johnson, who  started, developed, and owned Johnson Publishing Company. Parker House  Sausage. We don't do a great deal of farming, but we do a lot of other  kinds of things, businesses like Ariel Capital, Loop Capital.                                time  2030    These businesses provide an opportunity for others to interact. Great  people, I have had the good fortune to just know a whole bunch of young  athletes: Isaiah Thomas, Kevin Garnett, Doc Rivers, and Darryl  Stingley. All of these guys grew up in my district--not just in  Chicago, but in my district.   I represent the Chicago Bulls. I represent the Bears, the Black  Hawks, and a little bit of the White Sox. Unfortunately, the Cubs are a  little further  [[Page H10175]]  north where Congressman Mike Quigley is and represents, but we embrace  them also.   President Barack Obama lived right at the edge of my district.   Chicago, Illinois, is filled with inclusivity. Carol Moseley Braun  was the first African-American woman to be elected to the United States  Senate from the State of Illinois. Of course, Barack Obama was also  elected to the Senate. Roland Burris was a member of the Senate, and  Abraham Lincoln.   I grew up as a fan of Abraham Lincoln because of the role that he and  Illinois played in the abolition of slavery. My mother was a great  Abraham Lincoln fan, so as a little boy, I knew every story that you  could think of about Abraham Lincoln.   The thing that I am most proud of, though, is the inclusivity and the  diversification of our State.   Representative LaHood has represented and demonstrated what Illinois  is all about, and that is bringing all of us together to extol some of  the virtues of our great State. I thank the gentleman for his  leadership, and I thank the gentleman for his action.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Davis for those  wonderful words about the State of Illinois, its history, and the city  of Chicago and all his advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, as you can see, each of our districts has  played a role in not only shaping Illinois' history, but that of the  entire Nation and the whole world. Whether it is the business hub of  Chicago, the farmers downstate, or the many Main Street businesses in  every city, Illinois' influence can be seen every day no matter where  you are.   That is why our bicentennial theme of ``Born, Built, and Grown'' is  so appropriate. As 2018 begins and we continue to get closer to our  State's birthday on December 3, 2018, bicentennial events all across  Illinois will help us recognize the important people and products that  our State has to offer. For example, a bicentennial beer has already  been judged and selected, hailing from the Hand of Fate Brewing Company  in Petersburg, Illinois, within my congressional district.   I encourage everyone to check out the full list of events at  illinois200.com. I am sure I will be running into many of my colleagues  at several of them throughout the year as they happen across the State.   While Illinois' first 200 years have included both struggle and  success, our State should be a point of pride for all of us. I think we  heard that tonight. While we have accomplished so much, as my  colleagues and I have talked about here tonight, there remains much to  be done. Illinois remains on the path of prosperity, and the hard work  and determination that the people of Illinois are known for will surely  get us there.   Mr. Speaker, I will just close by wishing Illinois a happy early  birthday. We look forward to celebrating over the next year.   I am proud to be born and raised in the State of Illinois and that my  wife and I are raising our three boys in Illinois. We hope they stay  and prosper in Illinois, and we look forward to this next year of  celebration for 200 years of Illinois being in this great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
