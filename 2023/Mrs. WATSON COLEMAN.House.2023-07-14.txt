 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, yet I am tired.   I am tired of having to come down to the well of this Chamber to  mourn the needless death of another child.   I am tired of gun violence being the leading cause of death among our  precious children.   Finally, I am tired of my colleagues across the aisle. When presented  with an opportunity to do something about these tragedies, they do  nothing.   I am disgusted that so few have signed on to any mental health  legislation. My bill to invest in mental health resources for our young  people passed this body just 2 years ago in a bipartisan fashion, but  now, Republicans' sense of bipartisanship, and even caring for the  lives of others, has vanished.   Mr. Speaker, I must confess I am tired of marching down here to  demand something that should have been given to these children from the  very beginning--their sense of safety.   I may be tired, but I will not stop.                            ____________________
