 Mr. Speaker, as I speak, Israel is under attack by the  terrorist group Hamas with thousands of rockets launched at Israel  since May 10.   Israel has a right to defend itself. The United States would never  allow rockets to be launched by our enemies at civilians on our soil,  and Israel cannot allow rockets to be launched at Tel Aviv and  Jerusalem.   I was proud to join more than three-quarters of my fellow Members of  Congress in April to support full funding for security assistance to  Israel. As we said in that letter, Congress is committed to maintaining  Israel's qualitative military edge and its ability to defend itself, by  itself, against persistent threats.   Today, it is even more important to stand up and say: We stand side  by side with our ally. I will continue to work to continue to help  Israel defend itself from Hamas' threats and to cut off the support to  Hamas.                            ____________________
