 Mr. Speaker, the immoral effort to take away health care  from millions of working families across the country has begun.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, thousands of families in my home  State of Washington have been able to get quality health care, and now  the Republican majority is set to strip away that healthcare coverage  from those struggling to make ends meet.   If they succeed, three quarters of a million Washingtonians will lose  their health care; 55,000 young people in our State will be kicked off  their parents' healthcare plans; being a woman, once again, becomes a  preexisting condition where women would again have to pay out of pocket  for basic, preventive screenings and birth control; nearly 4 million  Washingtonians, covered by their employers, would see their costs  increase and coverage decline; and 50,000 Washingtonians who gained  health care through Medicaid expansion will lose it.   Mr. Speaker, health care is a fundamental right and not a privilege.  Instead of rolling back the progress we have made, we should be  strengthening and expanding health care to cover all who live in our  Nation.                            ____________________
