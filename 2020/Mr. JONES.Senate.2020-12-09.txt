 Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for those  remarks. I am humbled.   You know, everyone knows the old saying ``My, how time flies when you  are having fun.'' My time here has drawn to a close, but despite the  difficulties, the challenges, despite the rancor that we often see in  this body, as well as Washington, DC, I can honestly say I have had a  lot of fun. The last 3 years have been amazing, and I have loved being  a Member of this body.   I actually was able to accomplish a few things, thanks to you. But  you have been fun; you have not just been kind. It has really been  good.   By the way, your staffs have been awesome. I know you hear that a lot  from constituents. Maybe you don't hear it enough from other Senators.  Your staffs have been amazing to us, and I really very much appreciate  it.   You know, as the minority leader said, everybody knows I am a  baseball fan. If you go into that office, you will see in my reception  area all 100 baseballs that I had signed. And it was fun getting them-- either here on the floor or in a committee room, at the retreat that  the Democrats had. There were so many who had never signed a baseball,  and you figured out that it wasn't easy to sign a baseball.   (Laughter.)   And even those who signed in their office, when we sent them to their  office, they always came up and talked about it. It was a time to put  politics aside and just talk a little bit--something we really don't do  enough of around here, leaving the weighty politics and  responsibilities that we have just to sign a baseball and talk about  how much fun it was.   I remember, right after I was elected, I was talking to a friend of  mine, dreaming big about the things that we could accomplish that would  make a difference in the lives of the people of Alabama and the people  of America. We talked about the possibility that we could work on a  bill as important as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Voting Rights  Act of 1965. But I knew--I knew, though--that such opportunities were  not likely, especially in what I knew to be a 3-year window and not  knowing what the future would hold--although, I have got to be honest,  I had a pretty doggone good idea when I got here.   If there was one thing my momma always taught me, it was to be  realistic about things. I knew it was going to be tough, but to even  have an opportunity to talk and work on things that bring such  transformational changes--those kind of things come along once in a  generation, if we are lucky. They are that legislative equivalent of a  perfect game in baseball. You are lucky if you get to be part of that  in your career, but you always have to hope and you have to strive for  the possible, not just the likely.   For those of you who really don't know about baseball--there may be a  few--a perfect game is just that: nine innings, three outs, three up,  three down. Everything has to work together in synchrony. It is not  just the pitcher who throws balls and strikes; it is the outfielder who  catches the fly; it is the second baseman who has to get the out and  throw the runner out at first. Everyone has to fall in line and work  together as a team--as a team. And it is not just that; it is the  people on the field. They are all working and they are all striving for  the same goal. As it turned out, I didn't get a chance to be part of a  perfect game. I didn't think I would, but I didn't get that chance.   Sometimes I worry, as many of you do--especially if you listened to  the farewell speeches of Lamar Alexander and Tom Udall and Mike Enzi  and others--you worry if those perfect games can ever be had in this  Senate again. I worry about that. But we always come close, and I came  close.   Right after I got here, I got invited to be part of the Common Sense  Caucus, which I had to explain to people in Alabama that that is really  not an oxymoron, that there is common sense up here.   But within 6 weeks of being up here, I was at Susan Collins' office  with so many here--some 20 Senators, Republican, Democratic--talking  about immigration, working on immigration reform. It was the hottest  topic of the day, an important topic that is still important today. I  just marveled at the fact that here I was, 6 weeks into this, and I was  in that room being a part of those discussions.   What was even more astonishing to me is that people actually wanted  to hear what I had to say. That didn't happen, having raised three  children, been married. I don't always get that, when people want to  know what you have got to say. But they did, and I was so gratified,  and I was so honored.   We would meet in Senator Collins' office. We would meet in hideaways.  It was exciting. And we came so close. You all remember that? We came  so close, within about three votes of doing what they said couldn't be  done, of doing something that was possible but not probable.    That sense, what I saw of my colleagues, is why we ran for the  Senate.  [[Page S7303]]  I could see it. I could feel it in those rooms, in those discussions. I  could see it on the floor that day as people were voting. It is why we  wanted to be in this body.   I remember sitting in the cloakroom, and I was as disappointed as  ever when we failed. And for a long time, probably still to this day,  when I am asked ``What is your most disappointing day in the Senate?''  I will always talk about that vote that failed so close, which was so  important. But what it did demonstrate is, through that effort-- effort--that anything is possible. You have got to come close sometimes  before you get across the finish line. You have got to play in the red  zone a little bit before you get the touchdown. You have got to hit  that line.   But whatever we did, it is possible. The Senate is capable of great  things, if we do them, of bridging divides that society may view as too  wide to cross. We can do that. It is not that wide between here and  there. It is not that wide, and people need to know it and respect it.   I am not the first and I certainly will not be the last to talk about  the importance of bringing people together who hold opposing views and  working toward what is both possible and palatable. But all too often  the desire to do that kind of gets lost among other actions that don't  quite match the words that we say.   I noticed the other day how many heads were nodding in the farewell  speech of Senator Alexander, Senator Enzi, and Senator Udall. And then  what happens? I have looked at a lot of farewell speeches in the last  month. They all say a lot of the same things, and everybody, I am sure,  nods.   We have got to do better. You have to do better. I don't think I  fully appreciated it. And I listened to the minority leader talk about  where I come from in Fairfield, but I don't think I fully appreciated  it until fairly recently. It seems like I just kind of love a lost  cause. It seems like every time that there is something that needs me  there, I am there--fighting for justice for others, for others who feel  like hope is lost, from the church bombing case to a Senate election in  Alabama. I fought for those causes because I believe in hope. I believe  in redemption. I believe in the possibility. Some may call that naive,  and many have, but I have not been afraid to touch on the so-called  ``third rail'' issues of our political system because I believe that,  right now especially, there is no time for caution.   My first speech on the Senate floor was about gun violence. No one  could believe a Senator from Alabama actually talked about how we can  stop gun violence in a way that made some sense--not from an extreme  view on the right or an extreme view on the left but right there in  ways that made sense.   It was a topic that I knew could have easily been twisted into a  negative campaign ad--which, by the way, it was.   (Laughter.)   We saw it coming. But I also knew action was so important. We took  some small steps on that issue over the last 3 years, despite a lot of  political pressure to the contrary, and I hope you will do more in the  years ahead because lives will depend on it.   Everything doesn't have to be a perfect game. There is great  satisfaction in the day-to-day triumphs. You can and we did hit a home  run or two and more than our share of singles and doubles. I am really  proud of the 20-plus bills that I led or co-led, bipartisan bills, that  have been signed into law over the last 3 years. None would have been  possible without bipartisan work.    One of my first original bills, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records  Collection Act would never have become law without the commitment of  Senator Cruz to help bring long-overdue closure to the victims of those  terrible crimes.   I see Ted in the back. I appreciate Senator Cruz's involvement in  that. I will have to say, it was so much fun, after we got that done,  to go back home and tell that to all my Democratic friends. What is  your proudest? I said: Well, the proudest moment right now is with my  partner, Ted Cruz. They said: Aha.   But it shows what is possible, folks. And it was an important bill.  None of those bills have meant more to me, though, than the bipartisan  effort that I led with Senator Collins to eliminate the military  widow's tax that for almost two decades had deprived widows of full  survivors' benefits that they deserved.   So many of you went to bat for that bill: Senator Reed, Senator  Inhofe, and others. You were getting a lot of pressure, not from me or  Susan Collins. You were getting pressure from a lot of those military  widows. They had been up here for 20 years, and for 20 years the  dollars and cents had prevented that from becoming a reality. We fought  on that because we knew what we were doing was right. We knew it was  right that you could not put a price on the duty we owe to the men and  women of our armed services and their families.   I will never forget that day in December when we passed the NDAA that  included the elimination of the widow's tax. In the Gallery, there was  a large group of Gold Star widows who had been up here for 20-plus  years to try to get that done, never being able to reach the goal. And  on that day, we did it. You did it. Susan and I got a lot of credit,  but it was this body, with the help of some folks in the House, that  made it happen. That was just one of the memorable days on the floor.   Swearing-in day was unbelievable--simply an explosion of emotions. To  walk on the floor as a U.S. Senator, some 37 years after I left the  floor with my old boss as a young staffer to my mentor Howell Heflin,  and to take the oath of office for his seat was just really a  remarkable circle of life.   There are two especially significant things about that day too. One  is that I hope that you all recognize by now that the freshman class of  2018 will likely go down in history as one of the greatest freshman  classes ever. The team of Smith and Jones can't be beat. It is as  American as apple pie. I was really proud and honored to be there with  Tina Smith that day.   I was also honored, if you recall, that there were three Vice  Presidents on the floor of the Senate that day. Now President-Elect Joe  Biden escorted me in. Former Vice President Walter Mondale escorted  Senator Smith. Mike Pence, the current Vice President, swore us in.  And, actually, if you now think about it, we had a fourth--soon-to-be  Vice President Kamala Harris. That is a pretty remarkable time--pretty  remarkable.   It was also a remarkable day when what I hope is going to be a new  tradition in the Senate took place: When we had on two different  occasions, once each year, six Senators--three Democrats and three  Republicans--reading Dr. King's ``Letter from a Birmingham Jail.'' That  document remains one of the most significant in American history, and  it is as important today as it was when it was written in 1963--and, in  some ways, maybe more important for the moment we find ourselves in. I  have asked--and I know he will do this--my colleague Senator Brown to  carry on that tradition in my absence.   And then there was the day of the swearing-in in January of 2019. I  was here to observe, to pay my respects to all those who were returning  and for those who were joining. And as I was standing in the back by  the cloakroom, Senator Tester walks up and says: Jones, what are you  doing?   You can't get anything past Tester. There were probably a few  profanities ladened in there as well, if you know Senator Tester.   I said: Well, Jon, what do you think I am doing--with probably a  couple of other kind of milder profanities.   He said: Look, Daines is caught in a snowstorm back home and can't  make it here, and I would like for you to escort me down when I take  the oath.   As it turns out, it is likely to be the only time I get to do that-- and it was a true honor, my friend.   Simply sitting at this desk is perhaps the greatest thing, taking  this place in and watching each of you, noting the bipartisanship,  especially as we close the Congress--especially as we close this  Congress--and how Senators move freely from one side of the aisle to  the other. Occasionally, I will tell you, I confess, that I just come  back here by myself, and I will open this drawer and will read the  names of the Senators who sat here: John Kennedy, Ed Muskie, Hubert  Humphrey, my colleague Senator Shelby, and so many others. And it is  just overwhelming.  [[Page S7304]]    You know, growing up, it was always the Presidents or Presidential  candidates who captured my attention. I knew the names of some  Senators, but that began to change for me watching the Senate Select  Committee on Watergate when I was in college. It was a remarkable time  and a remarkable committee. And then everything changed again in 1979  while I was studying for the bar and got a phone call from Senator  Heflin's chief of staff, Mike House. I had campaigned for the judge.  Mike offered me a 1-year position on Heflin's Judiciary subcommittee,  which I eagerly took. That year not only changed my life but brought  about a respect for this body, for the Senate--as an institution, as  individuals, and for so many of its Members--that I had never had  before. From that point on, folks, I was hooked. I was hooked on this  body--before being elected to the Senate. And now I have come to love  the Senate a lot and, importantly, all of the possibilities that go  with it, which is why I don't really want to spend my last moments on  the floor talking about what I have done. I want to talk about what  needs to be done, what can be done, what is possible.   You know, even back in 2017, people said it was just not possible to  elect a Democrat from Alabama to the U.S. Senate--and here I have been.   It is possible to make affordable quality healthcare a reality for  all Americans. The ACA right now is the best hope and only plan that is  out there. As President Obama said--and everybody should do this--if  there is a better plan you can come up with, put it out there. Let's do  it. I will publicly support it.   The goal is healthcare for everyone in some way. There are so many in  this country and in my State of Alabama who desperately need it-- before, during, and after this COVID crisis. It is possible to give  people in remote and rural areas access to healthcare, but it is going  to take a lot of work, and it is going to take getting out of partisan  corners.    It is possible to provide a quality education to every American  child. I know education is often funded locally, but it is possible to  do it. You just have to roll up your shirt sleeves and get it done.   It is possible to extend broadband--access to broadband--to all  Americans and bring every man, woman, and child into the modern era,  just like we did--the Congress did--with Franklin Roosevelt in the  Rural Electrification Act in the 1930s. Broadband is the new power. It  is possible to do that. High speed and affordable, that is key-- affordable broadband.   It is possible to ease the burdens on working-class Americans by  setting a minimum wage that is not going to hamstring businesses but  will raise the quality of living for so many in this country. So many  in my State are in poverty, but yet they work. They work. They work  hard, but yet they are still below that poverty level. We need to do  what we can to lift them out of that poverty. It takes a lot of work.  It takes hard work.   It is possible for law enforcement to serve and protect all  Americans--not just some--to root out the systemic racism that exists  within law enforcement by enlisting the support of both law enforcement  and the communities. It is possible.   I will candidly tell you another great disappointment was when we let  that moment pass this summer--hoping that with a new President, maybe a  new Senate, maybe a new Congress, we could get something accomplished.  I hope that that still happens, but I was disappointed we let that  moment pass this summer when all of the country and all of the world  was behind us to say: Please do something. Please do something that we  have known about for decades, for centuries. Please do something.   Law enforcement said: Let's do something.   We let it pass. But it is never too late to do the right thing. It is  never too late for justice.   It is possible to ensure that every eligible voter is able to cast a  ballot and have it counted. Now is the most important opportunity we  have seen in 2020--concerns about our election process; that it might  have been stolen; that there might have been fraud. Use that  opportunity to say: Let's don't let these allegations have any credence  going forward. Let's get together. The technology is there.   Figure out a way that together we can make our election safe and  secure and that all people will have access to the ballot box--all  people who are eligible to vote in this country.   It is possible for our system of justice to treat all Americans  equally--not just talk about it, but to do it. It is what I have tried  to do throughout my career. It is possible.   And this is going to be a challenge. It is possible to restore the  American people's faith in government. And we all know right now that  that faith has been shaken for many, many reasons. The faith has been  shaken, but it is possible to restore it. It is possible for each of us  to learn--as Atticus Finch taught us--to see things from another  person's point of view, to walk around in their skin or in their shoes,  to see things from other's point of view, to find that common ground.   It is possible for us to realize that deep down that progress is not  a zero-sum game, that a rising tide lifts all boats.   These things are not easy. They take dedication and hard choices, but  they are worthy goals. I know many of my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle are dedicated to the same goals, and though I won't be able  to cosponsor anything with you from this point on or debate the  amendments in committee--if you get amendments in committee--I am going  to support you in whatever efforts I can, no matter what side of the  aisle your desk is on. And I will keep working toward the same goals  too, even after I leave this place.   Remember, though, as we get into the vitriol, as we get into  political rhetoric--just remember the Jones law of politics, adapted  from Newton's third law. Just remember that for every action, even in  politics, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If you go too far on  one side or the other, you are going to get a reaction on the other  side, just as hard. And that makes it harder and harder to reach that  common ground.   You know, in Senator Brown's book about his desk and the people in  his desk, he quotes the political philosopher Hannah Arendt who  observed: ``The good things in history are usually of very short  duration, but afterwards have a decisive but a short time of  influence''--a long influence--``over what happens over long periods of  time.''   A short time--and I know you may be thinking, well, Doug was only  here 3 years; so that is what he is talking about. But I am not. In  history, I am looking at something bigger--whether it was Martha  McSally's 2 years or my 3; Senator Gardner's 6; Senator Udall's 12;  Senator Alexander's 18; or Enzi's and Roberts' 24; or, if you are like  Pat Leahy, since Moses was in the bulrushes.   Our time here is short. There is not anybody on this floor right now  who is not thinking about their time since they were sworn in and said  that it was just like yesterday, because it was. Our time is short. It  is of a limited duration, and we have to act like that. We have to make  sure that every day we are moving.   It has been a realization of a long-held dream. I have so many to  thank: Doug Turner, who is here; Joe Trippi, on my campaigns; and my  late friend, Giles Perkins; and an amazing family: my bride Louise, my  rock; my two boys, Carson and Christopher, who have wanted to kill both  me and Louise since they have been living at home during the pandemic.  They have been incredibly supportive. And then my daughter Courtney and  her husband Rip and her two beautiful girls, my granddaughters, who are  still the brightest stars in my sky, Ever and Ollie.    I am grateful to each of you, my colleagues, and all that you helped  me with.   I am grateful to an amazing staff. I am not going to go all the way  through it. They have been true rock stars. I am going to enter  something into the Record about my staff.   I am grateful for the advice and counsel of Alabama's senior Senator  and an old friend, Senator Shelby. While Richard and I may disagree on  many policies, we share a commitment to the people of Alabama to make  sure that we do all we can to get the people in Alabama the quality of  life that  [[Page S7305]]  they deserve, and I so much appreciate Richard's service to the people  of the State of Alabama, his long and distinguished service--which  started out as a Democrat, by the way, just saying. That is where the  seed was planted, folks.   I also want to mention briefly the chairmen of the committees I  worked on: Senator Crapo, Senator Inhofe, Senator Alexander--who was  one of the first people who helped me come over--and the work that we  did together. You pulled me and helped me. Senator Collins, who chaired  the Aging Committee.   But I am especially grateful for the ranking members of those  committees: Senators Brown, Casey, Murray, and Reed. Their friendship  and counsel have been invaluable.   Of course, I want to thank the minority leader for all of his work  for me and on behalf of me. And as I think you guys know--not always  the people of Alabama--Senator Schumer never tried to put puppet  strings on me. I know I got accused of that, but he never ever tried  and, for that, I am very grateful.   To the people of Alabama, I promised to do my best to represent each  of you, whether or not you voted for me, and I am proud of the work  that we did on your behalf and that I have accomplished on your behalf.  Thank you to the people for giving me the honor of serving you as your  Senator.   Finally, I am going to resist the urge to tell you what is wrong with  the Senate, how it operates today. You hear it virtually every time a  Senator gives a farewell address, and, instinctively, you know it deep  down. But I will offer you this. There is a book I finished reading  recently that Ira Shapiro, a former staffer, wrote. Many of you may  remember or know Ira. He wrote a book called ``The Last Great Senate.''  It ought to be required reading for every Senator coming in. It was  published 8 years ago, about the two Congresses during the Carter  administration and how they operated--Bob Byrd as majority leader,  Howard Baker as the minority leader, how they got things done for the  American people. The author laments that the Senate doesn't operate  today in that fashion. I was here for one of those years. Senator Leahy  was here during that time.   His closing is even more important today as it was when the book was  published. He said:         America is adrift in turbulent and dangerous waters. Facing       enormous challenges at home and abroad, we urgently need our       once-vaunted political system to function at its best,       instead of at its worst. To be sure, it is more difficult       being a senator today than it was in the 1960's and 1970's.       The increasingly vitriolic political culture, fueled by a       twenty-four-hour news cycle, the endless pressure to raise       money, the proliferation of lobbyists and demanding,       organized interests are all well known, and they take a toll.       But all of those factors make it more essential that our       country has a Senate of men and women who bring wisdom,       judgment, experience, and independence to their work, along       with an understanding that the Senate must be able to take a       collective action in the national interest.    Please remember that as you go about the country's business; remember  that as you go about the Senate's business; remember that as you go  about your business as a Senator. And as you do, keep and preserve the  reverence that the Founders envisioned for this body. As former  Majority Leader Mike Mansfield once said, ``The constitutional  authority . . . does not lie with the leadership. It lies with all of  us, individually, collectively, and equally. . . . In the end, it is  not the Senators as individuals who are of fundamental importance. . .  . In the end, it is the institution of the Senate. It is the Senate  itself as one of the foundations of the Constitution. It is the Senate  as one of the rocks of the Republic.''   Something we should all remember.   One more little bit of advice. Take out the word ``negotiation'' when  you are talking about legislation. Don't talk about negotiating this  bill or that bill, whether it is COVID relief or even appropriations.  It works, but let me tell you what is happening out there, what is  happening out there with the people. They hear those words, and they  think this is some side or the other trying to get an advantage. It is  like labor and unions. It is like a civil or criminal lawsuit. Somebody  is trying to get an advantage to try to do things for their own  interests.   We can talk about it from the Democratic side of how we are working  for the people; we are negotiating for the people. We can talk about it  from the Republican side; that we are negotiating for patriotism and  businesses to make sure they are protected. But what is being heard by  the American people is this is all about Democrats; this is all about  Republicans and getting that political power.   Talk about common ground. Talk about sitting down with the  administration or whomever and finding common ground. Talk about the  goals that you agree on and how to get there. ``Negotiation'' is just a  bad word, and I hate that, but it is.   As I prepare for the next chapter of my life's journey, there is a  sadness of what I am going to leave behind, but there is also  optimism--optimism, the glass half full, the men and women who serve in  this body and their successors and the staff who support them. And I  emphasize that, again, the staff who support them. Leading together  will continue to bring a better future for the American people, for  your constituents, for each of us together, not as a caucus but  together as a Senate.   You are just a damn, unbeatable team. You are an unbeatable team.   May God bless you all. May God continue to bless the United States of  America.   Mr. President, with a deep sense of humility and gratitude, I say for  the last time, I yield the floor.   (Applause, Senators rising.
