 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3525, the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National  Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture Act.   The contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to this  great Nation have been enormous. The history of AAPIs is rich, but this  history is rarely talked about, and the contributions often go unknown  or unrecognized. I am often asked how someone can learn about AAPI  history, and admittedly, I don't know as much as I should.   Now more than ever, with the rise in hate crimes like the Atlanta  shootings and other acts of violence in New York City and throughout  the country, we keep hearing this phrase, ``You don't belong here.''   I have heard that throughout my life and, sadly, my two little boys,  4 years old and 6 years old, have already heard hurtful words that have  labeled them in ways they don't yet understand.   Like many, I don't want my kids to understand who they are through  sources of hate and discrimination. I want them to feel pride, pride in  who they are, pride in AAPIs, and pride in our place in this Nation.   Our story is not just an Asian-American story. It is an American  story. The history is not just an Asian-American history, it is  American history, and this history isn't just for AAPIs to learn, it is  for all of us. Together, through learning, we can come together,  creating greater understanding, a closer knit community, celebrating  the richness of this Nation.
