 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the  105th birthday of western Nebraska native Margaret Masek.   A graduate of Gering High School, Margaret has 7 children, 21  grandchildren, and 46 great-grandchildren.   In her 105 years, she has experienced the Great Depression, both  World Wars, and the landing on the Moon.   After more than a century of life, Margaret says her greatest  accomplishment is her children's education and  [[Page H1469]]  enabling them to live their lives to the fullest.   She spent her birthday this year opening birthday greetings from her  family living all over the world, including Hong Kong, Fiji, London,  Paris, Costa Rica, South Korea, and, of course, Nebraska.   Born on June 11, 1914, she begins each day by thanking God for giving  her another day, as we all should.   Please join me in congratulating Margaret on her 105th birthday.                            ____________________
