 Mr. Speaker, Charles Rettig, the former IRS  Commissioner, who was appointed by the Trump administration, said early  last year that the United States is losing $1 trillion in unpaid taxes  every year. He said the agency lacks the resources to catch tax cheats.  Most of the unpaid taxes, he said, are a result of evasion by wealthy  and large corporations.   With this legislation we are considering today, it is clear that the  GOP once again is putting tax-evading profits over people.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to join me in rejecting this  legislation to protect working families that play by the rules and  fight fairly every day.
