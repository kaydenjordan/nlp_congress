 Mr. Speaker, due to a longstanding prior commitment, I  was unable to return for votes on Saturday, August 22. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 179 (PQ); ``nay''  on rollcall No. 180 (Rule); ``yea'' on rollcall No. 181 (MTR); and  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 182 (H.R. 8015).                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
