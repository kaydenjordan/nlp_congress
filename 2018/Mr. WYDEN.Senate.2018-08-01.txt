 Mr. President, a short while ago the Senate passed the  final version of the National Defense Authorization Act. Here is why I  opposed that legislation: It is a national security bill that weakens  our national security. This afternoon I want to discuss why.   The Chinese tech company ZTE was revealed not long ago to be a serial  sanctions violator. They violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North  Korea, knowingly selling American technology to those countries. For  their violations, the Commerce Department dropped the hammer and hit  them with crippling penalties, including a fine of $1.2 billion.   That is until Donald Trump stepped in to save ZTE.   With a speed and a focus this administration seems incapable of  bringing to any other issue, the President ordered his team to spring  into action to rescue ZTE. He fired off tweets. He made the eyebrow- raising comment that it was a problem that U.S. sanctions were hurting  jobs in China. His Treasury Secretary virtually apologized for the U.S.  having taken action against a serial sanctions violator. This all comes  from an administration putting on a show--constantly tough talking--and  from a President pretending that he puts America first. He sure didn't  in this case.   Now there are a few sides of this issue for everybody at home to  remember--the national security aspect, as well as the trade and  economic aspect.   First, I sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a few months  ago, the committee held an open hearing with Bill Evanina, the Director  of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. He is the  point-man for the Trump administration when it comes to questions of  counterespionage and counterterror. In response to my question, he told  me that ZTE poses a national security risk to the United States.   That was not some outside individual providing testimony. He is not a  hearing witness chosen by Democrats. Again, that is the person who has  led the National Counterintelligence and Security Center since 2014. He  says ZTE poses a threat to America, but his boss, the President of the  United States, let ZTE off the hook.   Here is the second issue: the Trump administration loves to tout what  it calls new trade deals, but as far as I can tell, just about the only  deal they have cooked up with any teeth, the only one that is actually  finished, is this ZTE deal that saved jobs--in China.   Colleagues, the President and I don't agree on much, but one of his  favorite talking points that I do agree with is that our country has to  do a lot more to stop China from stealing our technology and our jobs,  but when you look at this ZTE case, he seems to be giving away our jobs  and our security.   It is an absolute head-scratcher to me and to a whole lot of other  people including Senators on both sides of the aisle. It raised the  question are the President's decisions being guided by something else,  something other than American interests? That is because the ZTE deal  came right after the Trump family secured valuable trademarks in China  and a Trump project in  [[Page S5575]]  Indonesia got a $500 million loan from a Chinese state-owned company.   So a bipartisan group of Senators, myself included, said let's figure  out a way to reinstate the penalties against ZTE as a part of the  annual defense authorization bill, but when it came time to hammer out  the differences between the Senate's bill and the House's bill,  Republicans watered down the ZTE penalties. Republicans in both  Chambers caved to the White House and handed a big gift to China at the  expense of American jobs and national security.   In my view, it is inexcusable that the plan put together by Senators  on both sides--a plan that would have protected our security and  punished a serial violator of U.S. sanctions--was stripped out of this  bill. The weaker House proposal that took its place doesn't go nearly  far enough to fight the espionage threat that the Trump  administration's own counterintelligence nominee testified to.   Bottom line, Trump's ZTE deal is bad for American security and  American jobs. The House got it wrong with their weaker legislation.  The Senate was under no obligation to accept their watered-down bill.  That is why I voted no, and that is why members who voted for this  proposal cannot claim innocence when it comes to letting ZTE off the  hook for its violations of our sanctions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am placing a hold on the nomination  of Justin Muzinich to be Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. I will  maintain that hold until the Treasury Department provides the Senate  Finance Committee information and documents related to Russia and its  financial dealings with President Trump and his associates, as well as  outside organizations Russia used to help elect him. I originally asked  for these documents on May 10, 2017, and have yet to receive an answer  of any kind.   I have stated repeatedly that we must follow the money if we are  going to get to the bottom of how Russia has attacked our democracy.  That means thoroughly reviewing any information that relates to  financial connections between Russia and President Trump and his  associates, whether direct or laundered through hidden or illicit  transactions.   The Treasury Department for which Mr. Muzinich is nominated to serve  as the No. 2 official is responsible for much of this information. The  Treasury Department authorities include intelligence and enforcement  functions to combat financial crimes and threats, including money  laundering.   For these reasons, I will object to any unanimous consent request  concerning the nomination of Mr. Muzinich.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am lifting my hold on the nomination of  Mr. Jason Klitenic to be General Counsel of the Office of Director of  National Intelligence. Senator Grassley and I have received a response  to our March 6, 2018, letter regarding the Intelligence Community  Office of Inspector General, OIG, and the termination of its Executive  Director of Intelligence Community Whistleblowing and Source  Protection, ``Executive Director.'' In addition, I have been provided  access to documents related to the Executive Director's termination. I  remain concerned about the circumstances surrounding that termination  and look forward to reviewing them further, even as I work with my  colleagues to strengthen protection for intelligence community  whistleblowers. My hold on the nomination of Mr. Klitenic was based on  these concerns and not on the qualifications of the nominee.                            ____________________
