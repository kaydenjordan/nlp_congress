 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, a day before Yom HaShoah, or  Holocaust Remembrance Day, to recognize the late Cornelis and  Wilhelmina de Ru.   In 1940, Nazi forces invaded the Netherlands, and days later, the  Dutch were forced to surrender. Throughout the next 5 years, the de Ru  family risked everything to save the life of a young Jewish teenager,  Maurits Kopuit. He was only one of two survivors in his family.   The de Rus understood the great risk involved in shielding Maurits,  yet they displayed unyielding courage in their effort to save a fellow  citizen.   During the Holocaust, the Nazis systematically killed 6 million Jews.  However, throughout this nightmare, there were a few like the de Rus  who refused to allow dark forces to prevail.   This past Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. de Ru were named Righteous Among the  Nations for their heroic efforts to protect Mr. Maurits Kopuit from the  Nazi regime during World War II.   Righteous Among the Nations is a special designation by Yad Vashem,  the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, that conveys the gratitude of  the State of Israel and of the Jewish people for those who took risks  to save Jews during the Holocaust.   As of January 2018, Yad Vashem had recognized over 26,000 people from  51 different countries with the Righteous Among the Nations  designation. Their names appear on the Mount of Remembrance in  Jerusalem. It is an unprecedented tribute by victims to those who stood  by their sides.   Next week marks the 74th anniversary of the Nazi army's surrender. We  must never forget the consequences of remaining silent in the face of  evil and intolerance.   Please join me in honoring the de Rus' selfless actions and  commemorating all those whose lives were lost.                       Honoring the Life of Stan Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the late Stan  Smith, an exemplary historian from Rancho Bernardo whose help made the  San Diego Veterans History Project possible.   Stan's brother, Charlie, was killed during the invasion of Sicily in  1943 during World War II. This prompted Stan himself to join the U.S.  Navy and later prompted his interest in recording veterans' accounts of  their service during World War II and the Vietnam war.   Stan began helping my office in 2013 and worked with us for 3 years  before going to help the San Diego Veterans Museum.                                time  1015    He recorded more than 100 oral histories of San Diego County veterans  in  [[Page H3309]]  the 7 years since he began, ensuring that their stories would never be  forgotten.   Stan understood the importance of passing history down from one  generation to the next and thanking the men and women who, like Stan,  served our country.   We are deeply grateful for Stan Smith's commitment to recording  veterans' stories. His work has ensured that their stories will never  be lost. Please join me in honoring Stan Smith and his children, who  plan to carry on the work their father started.   Mr. Speaker, if there are any San Diegans who are interested in  becoming involved with the Veterans History Project, I hope they will  contact my office.                            Congratulating ResMed     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate ResMed, a  medical device company located in my district, for receiving the 2019  Duane Roth Renaissance Award.
