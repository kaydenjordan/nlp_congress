 Madam Chair, I am proud to stand before you and offer my  support for H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   One issue that has a significant impact on my constituents is the  skyrocketing cost of insulin. Across Pennsylvania, more than 1 million  people live with diabetes and can spend anywhere from $1,200 to $20,000  on insulin medication each year. Over the past decades, the price of  insulin has increased 197 percent.   When I think about the impact that these price hikes have on my  constituents, the first person that comes to my mind is a young man by  the name of Chase. Chase is from Philadelphia. He was diagnosed with  Type 1 diabetes at the age of 3. He came to my office not long ago.   Chase told me that he and his mother needed Members of Congress to do  something about the cost of insulin because he was worried about the  burden it was placing on his mother, even though his illness was  brought on through no fault of his own.   Chase walked me through each step of his journey with his illness. He  told me what he and his mother do on a daily basis to manage the  diabetes. He is strong in his message that we need to do something  about this rising cost. Chase is 10 years old. He did not choose this,  and neither did the other 30 million Americans across the country.   Under H.R. 3, there will be a reduction in insulin. It is important  that I stand with my colleagues today and support H.R. 3, which  includes my bill.   It is important that this bill will help seniors afford healthcare  costs by increasing the number of them who are eligible for the  Medicare Savings Programs. No one chooses to be sick, and no one  chooses illness for their children.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation. It is time to act.
