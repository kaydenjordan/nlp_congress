 Mr. President, 6 weeks after the passage of tax reform, we  continue to show the American people how we are delivering on our  promises with real, lasting tax reform.   In fact, a recent poll showed that 69 percent of Americans are  satisfied with the boost in our economy. Another poll showed that  Americans' approval of our tax reform package has more than doubled  since its passage. I know it will continue to rise as more families see  the benefits coming their way. Our new tax law will ensure that they  are able to keep more of their paychecks and that the jobs of the  future are created right here in the good old U.S.A.  [[Page S674]]    Back home in South Carolina, we continue to see positive changes  because of tax reform. More businesses are awarding their employees  with raises, and as a result, more families are putting more money in  their bank accounts and in their pockets.   Here is a real-life example. I received a note from Steve Potts, the  CEO of Scout Boats in Summerville, SC. Scout Boats is, for those who  may not know--but everybody knows Scout Boats--Scout Boats is a world- class brand. It has been recognized all over the world for quality  boats. Here is a success story, an organic success story.   Back in 1989, Steve started his business with his wife in their  garage. They did very well for a while, and then, of course, very  quickly, Hurricane Hugo came about several months later and wiped them  out. They had to start all over again.   They had two employees in 1989. Their life savings were invested into  Scout Boats. Today, almost 30 years later, they have 340 employees.  This year, they are going to hand out $1,000 bonuses to their 340  employees, and they hope this is the year that they will take their  employees from 340 to 350 and exceed 400 employees.   He said:         We're confident this will help--    The tax reform package.       --further stimulate our own company morale, as well as become       an attractive career opportunity for new employees we are       currently searching for. . . . We believe by us giving back       to our employees, we're doing exactly what you and many       others originally intended with tax reform.    This is fantastic news and proof that we are reaching our goals.   I want to say thank you to Steve, not only for sharing your story but  for rewarding the hard work of your employees. It is what happens in  small and medium businesses all over the country.   Having started a small business myself, I understand and appreciate  the dedication Steve had to his vision and to his employees, because  for Steve and so many entrepreneurs, their employees are an extension  of their family. So being in a position to provide those folks with a  $1,000 bonus each is a big deal. It is a big deal for the company. It  is a big deal for the employees. It is reflective of the fact that most  small businesses are reinvesting in their future, which means  reinvesting in their employees. Steve is a classic example.   Just like Steve, in the last 6 weeks, more than 3 million Americans  have seen direct benefits from tax reform, be it bonuses or wage  increases or better benefits. It is all good news, and it just keeps on  coming. It is good news. More than 300 companies across our great  Nation have announced significant benefits for their employees.   There is more. My Investing in Opportunity Act was included in the  tax cut, and it is designed to help 52 million Americans living in  distressed communities like the very one in which I grew up. We have  worked hard to get the IIOA--Investing in Opportunity Act--across the  finish line so that it can be deployed in States around this Nation to  help those very folks. That means everything from workforce investment,  to better education, to businesses being attracted into these  opportunity zones.   I want to thank the majority leader for his words on the Investing in  Opportunity Act yesterday morning. He is right. This will empower  communities, and it will put up a big neon sign that says we are open  for business. It will help communities that today may be wavering,  questioning whether they can be successful. This is a resounding yes.  Yes, you should be hopeful. Yes, you can be successful.    I know these communities full well, and they are full of folks  looking for a chance, an opportunity to put their creativity, their  intelligence, and their work ethic on display. The Investing in  Opportunity Act will provide that chance.   The benefits of tax reform have just begun. Whether it is bonuses for  workers, more wages, better benefits, or the implementation of the  Investing in Opportunity Act, we know that the best is yet to come for  the American people.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
