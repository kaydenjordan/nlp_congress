 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report for  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   The NDAA continues rebuilding readiness and provides vital  capabilities required to implement the National Defense Strategy.   Highlights include significant investments in operations and  maintenance, facilities, sustainment, and military construction; also,  nuclear triad modernization and authority to deploy low-yield weapons;  the historic establishment of Space Force as a separate military  service with a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and $5.3 billion in  emergency funding to rebuild Tyndall and Offutt Air Force Bases, Camp  Lejeune, and China Lake Naval Air Station, all of which were struck by  natural disasters.   The stress that military families endure from frequent deployments  makes the systemic failures of privatized military family housing truly  deplorable. Critical reforms in this bill include a Tenants Bill of  Rights, formal dispute resolution, and improved quality control for  repairs and mold remediation.   The bill also provides critical oversight of the Defense household  goods program that will ensure that military families are put first in  DOD reforms.    The bill also addresses PFAS contamination by prohibiting  nonemergency use of firefighting foams containing PFOS and PFOA and  requires DOD to accelerate fielding a PFAS-free replacement.   I want to thank Readiness Subcommittee Chairman   John Garamendi for  his leadership.   Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry also deserve great  recognition for preserving the committee's 59-year bipartisan tradition  of passing the NDAA to support our warfighters and their families.   I want to thank the professional staff who worked tirelessly to  complete this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.
