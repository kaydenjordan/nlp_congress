 Mr. Speaker, last week, I led a bipartisan group to visit  Lithuania and the OSCE meeting in Vienna, Austria.   In Lithuania, we met with the leaders and assured them of America's  Article 5 responsibilities and commitments in case Russia comes into  Lithuania. They are very concerned.   We met with our troops, who are 6 kilometers away from Russian troops  stationed in Belarus. We then went to the OSCE in Vienna, and we led a  strong response to support Ukraine and oppose an unbelievable invasion  by the cruel Vladimir Putin.   The European community is united, except for Russia and Belarus, in  opposing the intrusion. Vladimir Putin is not operating in a rational  manner. His KGB history and his extreme response to COVID have driven  him to a delusional, paranoid, and dangerous state. It concerns all.   I appreciate the actions of our President in supporting our country.  I support President Zelensky, who is the Maccabee of his era, but the  candle has only lasted so long. We need to get him more oil.  [[Page H1152]]                                ____________________
