 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the Justice in Policing Act was crafted in response to  George Floyd's murder. Almost no one believes that that was  justifiable. Partisans have snatched this moment of unity to further  divide our Nation.   How have they done that?   Look at this debate. Speaker after speaker has hurled insults falsely  claiming that no Republican supports reform. Now, it is true that we  don't support this reform, but the majority has refused to even  consider amendments or alternatives to this partisan bill.   An essential component of any justice in policing bill would correct  current injustices. I only have time to mention one: warrantless  surveillance of American citizens is wrong.   Get a warrant.   Last year, conservatives and progressives united around this point,  and the Speaker blocked debate or amendment to FISA reauthorization.  Now the same tactics are being employed. Every single Member of  Congress is here to represent American citizens, and denying us  amendments denies all Americans a voice.   Don't politicize something that can heal and unite us. Vote ``no'' on  this bill. Insist on regular order.                                time  1930
