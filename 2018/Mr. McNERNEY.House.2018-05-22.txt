 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the Members of the House for talking about this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 204, the Right to Try Act. I  don't agree with my friend from Texas that there is no downside, and I  will go over that here in these 2 minutes.   The House took up this issue before, and I voted against it then.  This version is worse, so of course I am going to oppose it.   It would weaken the FDA's authority and provide broad access to  unproven treatments. The FDA's oversight of experimental treatment  plays a critical role in protecting patients from bad actors with  malicious intent or from drugs that are grossly untested. The FDA's  oversight protections protect patients from experimental treatments  that might do more harm than good.   Chipping away at the FDA's authority would put patients in my  district and around the country in great danger by providing liability  protections for manufacturers and weaken the FDA's oversight ability.  This legislation would leave patients with no recourse in the case of  harmful side effects.   This legislation is even more flawed, as I said, than the House bill  that I voted against back in March. Like the earlier bill, the Senate  bill contains the same dangerous, unnecessary pathways to experimental  treatments, but it exposes a much larger number of patients to serious  risk--not just terminal patients, but patients that would like to try  something that is not even tested. In fact, it is so broad, that it  exposes patients of all chronic conditions to the risk of experimental  treatments.   More than 100 major patient safety groups have voiced their strong  opposition to this bill.   Moreover, this bill is not even necessary. The FDA has an expedited  approval process for terminal patients.  [[Page H4360]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for patient safety and  vote against this flawed legislation.
