 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, like so many others in the Senate across  America, I was saddened to learn this morning of the passing of Colin  Powell.   In his lifetime, he broke down so many barriers, and he held some of  the most important titles in this great Nation: General of the U.S.  Army, National Security Adviser, America's first Black Joint Chiefs of  Staff, and our first Black Secretary of State.   But before he held any of those positions, and after he stepped away  from them, Colin Powell was always a patriot and a public servant. He  was the son of immigrants--Jamaican immigrants--who raised their  children to make the most of every opportunity that America offered and  to show their gratitude to this Nation by giving--giving back however  they could.   That story of opportunity and obligation is a story told by every  immigrant parent to their children. It is the same story my mother  taught to me and my brothers.   Much has been said and written about Colin Powell's historic and  distinguished career as a soldier and a statesman. He was respected in  a way that transcended partisan labels.   He wasn't perfect. His speech in 2003 to the U.N. General Assembly  claimed incorrectly that Iraq likely possessed weapons of mass  destruction. It was based on information he was given and later learned  to be false. It helped make a case for a war about which he had  misgivings, and he would come to regret those remarks the rest of his  life.   But he never stopped trying to serve, even after leaving public  office. In 2010, Colin Powell spoke out publicly about a cause that is  deeply personal to many people, including myself. He and other military  leaders urged this Senate to pass the Dream Act--legislation that would  give young immigrants who grew up in the United States a chance to earn  their citizenship.   Who better could speak to that issue than Colin Powell, the son of  immigrants who served this Nation with distinction and combat and in  public service? Regrettably, at the time, while a majority of Senators  supported the Dream Act, it was filibustered and did not pass. Still,  tens of thousands of immigrants are risking their lives today defending  our Nation in uniform. Among them may very well be another Colin  Powell.    It would be a fitting tribute to Secretary Powell for us to pass  immigration reform now--this year--and recognize what a great patriot  and son of immigrants like Colin Powell brought to this Nation.   One last point. Colin Powell survived one form of cancer nearly 20  years ago. He was being treated for another when he passed away.  Multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer, weakens the immune system. So  despite the fact that he was fully vaccinated, General Powell died of  complications of COVID.  [[Page S7021]]    It is sad and ironic that a man who spent so much of his life  defending others from danger, in the end, died from a common enemy that  too many of our fellow citizens continue to deny, thus giving the virus  an opportunity to replicate and wreak havoc. We are not each other's  enemies; the virus is the enemy.   Today, it claimed the life of an American statesman. By this time  tomorrow, it will have taken another 1,500 family members, neighbors,  heroes to many.   Especially for young children who can't be vaccinated yet and for the  millions of Americans with compromised immune systems, we really have  to increase our vaccine rates.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and  the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, growing up in East St. Louis, both my mom  and dad worked for the railroads. We weren't wealthy, but we had a  comfortable life. I have come to learn how connected that was to our  being a union family. I believe that more than any other force in  American history, the American labor movement has created middle-class  opportunity in America. Unions have won victories that have allowed  American workers to buy homes, send their kids to college, and save for  retirement. I know firsthand that none of this would be possible if  workers did not have the freedom to advocate for fair working  conditions for themselves and their families.   That is why I am proud to say that Chicago is the hometown of the  American Labor Movement, the site of the Haymarket Affair, the Pullman  railroad strike, and the Republic Steel Strike. Today, Chicago's union  members continue to be students of history and recognize the struggles  of those who fought for fairness, justice, and equality at work.  Throughout its 125-year history, the Chicago Federation of Labor--CFL-- has consistently fought for fair treatment of workers in Chicago, Cook  County, and beyond. Though the people, challenges, and times may have  changed, the CFL's mission has remained firm. Throughout its history,  the CFL has organized workers across industries regardless of race,  ethnicity, or nationality. Today, we celebrate the great work of the  Chicago Federation of Labor and congratulate its staff and supporters  on its 125th anniversary.   The Chicago Federation of Labor was chartered in 1896 by the American  Federation of Labor. Formed, in part, as an attempt to end corruption  in Chicago's labor unions, the CFL focused its early efforts on  strengthening a unified voice for the city's labor movements, upholding  the labor rights of its union members, and mediating contract disputes  on behalf of local unions. In 1906, Irish immigrant John Fitzpatrick  was elected president of the CFL. An organizer and committed unionist,  his innovation ushered in an era of stability and reform to the union  community. During his 40-year tenure as president, Fitzpatrick created  accessible news publications and established the labor party.   Upon Fitzpatrick's death, William Lee, president of Bakery Drivers  Union Local 734 and vice president of the CFL, was elected president  and would go on to serve for nearly 40 years. Lee continued  Fitzpatrick's commitment to racial and social justice, as the CFL and  other labor organizations supported Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in  organizing his visits to and rallies in Chicago. In 1964, then-CFL  President Lee celebrated the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on  the front page of the Federation News, writing, ``[W]e have come closer  to the ideal of the Declaration of independence with the Civil Rights  Law.''   In its fight for justice for all workers, the CFL has welcomed  freedom fighters and labor leaders from around the world to Chicago,  including Cesar Chavez, Lech Walesa, and Nelson Mandela. In 1994, under  the leadership of President Don Turner, the CFL launched its Workers'  Assistance Committee, now the CFL Workforce and Community Initiative,  which provides job seekers, including veterans and low-income workers,  with training and job search resources. In recent years, the CFL has  worked to pass increases to the minimum wage, paid sick leave,  protections to retirement security, and a host of other policies to  protect workers.   While in Congress, I have had the pleasure of working with the CFL on  a variety of issues. Just this year, I was honored to work with current  CFL President Bob Reiter on the inclusion of a 100 percent coverage for  COBRA health insurance premiums as part of the American Rescue Plan  Act, helping millions of struggling workers to remain on their employer  health plans.   The blueprint created 125 years ago has evolved, but the mission of  the CFL has remained constant. Today, with nearly 300 affiliates and  500,000 union members in Chicago and Cook County, the CFL continues to  embody the ethos of practical idealism and unrelenting determination  for working people.   Congratulations to the Chicago Federation of Labor on 125 years of  great work, giving workers a support network to advocate for their  rights.
