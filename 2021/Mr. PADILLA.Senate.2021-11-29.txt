 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Agua Caliente  Land Exchange Fee to Trust Confirmation Act.   This legislation would place certain lands into trust for the Tribe  in order to finally allow the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians to  manage these lands that are of special, cultural value to their people  .   Land that has traditionally been held by Agua Caliente has been  divided into a checkerboard between the Tribe, Federal Government, and  private landowners.   In 1999, the Bureau of Land Management and Agua Caliente entered into  an agreement to acquire and exchange lands within what would become the  Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. In 2000,  legislation was enacted to establish the monument and authorize the  land exchange.   For 17 years, Agua Caliente worked with the Bureau of Land Management  to finalize an agreement to exchange the lands that are addressed by  this legislation, and in March 2019, the land exchange was finalized.  However, since the original legislation didn't expressly address the  status of land transferred to the Tribe, the lands covered in this bill  were not placed in trust. My legislation would correct that and provide  the fix to finally place the exchanged land into trust and made part of  Agua Caliente's reservation.   This bill represents the final step to complete the original 1999  agreement between Agua Caliente and the Bureau of Land Management.   Importantly, enactment of this legislation would allow for improved  land management and allow Agua Caliente to manage these lands that have  a longstanding cultural and natural resource value to the Cahuilla  people.   The land is in a remote wilderness area within the Santa Rosa and San  Jacinto Mountains National Monument, and the Tribe will manage the land  as conservation lands similar to how it is managed by the Bureau of  Land Management.   I thank Congressman Ruiz for his partnership on this effort and for  his commitment to honoring the Federal Government's trust  responsibility. I also thank the bipartisan Members of the House who  have supported this legislation and Senator Feinstein for coleading  this effort with me in the Senate.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Agua  Caliente Land Exchange Fee to Trust Confirmation Act as quickly as  possible.
