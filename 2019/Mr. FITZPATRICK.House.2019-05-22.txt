 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding group of citizens in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who are  actively engaged in academic achievement.   Last year, New Hope-Solebury Middle School established its robotics  club, and it did not take long for that club to grow and find success.  They quickly grew to 20 students strong, with 5 students recently  awarded the Judges Award at the competitive VEX Robotics Competition.   The robotics club at New Hope-Solebury Middle School is looking to  build off of its accomplishments. With the help of librarian Craig  Smith and school board member Mark Cowell, members are looking to  become more active in competitions to demonstrate their skills.  Recently, the Lambertville-New Hope Rotary Club, of which Mark is a  member, held a fundraiser to assist these kids in reaching their goals.   I would like to congratulate members of the New Hope-Solebury Middle  School robotics club on their achievements. I would like to thank Mark  and Craig and members of the Lambertville-New Hope Rotary Club for  their vision.     Recognizing Walter Wydro for His Steadfast Commitment to Community                                  Service     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a citizen of  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for his steadfast commitment to community  service.   Walter Wydro, a resident of Upper Makefield, has been a constant  presence in local initiatives for 50 years. Walter has been a champion  for land preservation and played a significant role in open space  efforts in Upper Makefield Township.   Since 1972, Walter has served on the Upper Makefield Planning  Commission. He was also a founding member of the Newtown Area Zoning  Jointure, the first of its kind in the State of Pennsylvania.   In 2004, Walter was named Upper Makefield's Volunteer of the Year  and, in 2005, he joined the Bucks County Planning Commission. His work  has been so impactful and his reach and expertise so great that the  Bucks County Commissioners declared May 7, 2019, Walter Wydro Day.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the privilege to represent such a  thoughtful and compassionate constituent as Walter, and I thank Walter  for his innumerable contributions to our community.           Recognizing Ben Harder for His Strength and Perseverance     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an outstanding  resident from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who is teaching us all about  strength and perseverance.   Ben Harder, a resident of Levittown, recently participated in the  Kiwanis-Herald Sesame Place Classic, which I was honored to attend.  This was Ben's 21st consecutive year participating in the 5K race, an  event cherished by our local community. His presence this year was made  remarkable, however, due to the fact that Ben is currently undergoing  chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.   Mr. Speaker, Ben is no stranger to athletic feats. While a student at  The University of Southern Mississippi, he was also a top-ranked power  lifter for his weight class.   I would like to honor Ben for his strength and his spirit in the face  of adversity, and our entire community is praying for him as he  undergoes treatment.   I would also like to extend our best wishes to Ben's family,  including his siblings, Arthur, Chloebelle, Rosen, and Eleanor.                            ____________________
