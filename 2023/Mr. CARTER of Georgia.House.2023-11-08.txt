 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise today in support of the amendment by the gentlewoman from  Florida to ensure that Congress is conducting the proper oversight of  the executive branch.   This amendment mirrors the REINS Act, of which I am a proud original  cosponsor. This bill passed in the House earlier this year with  overwhelming support. It is clear that the American people believe the  overreach by the executive branch must come to an end.   There are over 2.1 million bureaucrats and not nearly enough  transparency into the rulemaking process. This amendment appropriately  defines a major rule so that more attention is put into a rule or  regulation that has an effect on the economy.   It is our constitutional duty to keep the executive branch  accountable, and that is exactly what this amendment does. Checks and  balances must be reasserted, and we must stop wasteful spending. The  American people do not want bureaucrats making impactful decisions when  they are struggling to afford everyday items. I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Mr.  Ogle's amendment, which will prohibit  [[Page H5632]]  the funds from being used to institute mask mandates.   Mr. Chairman, when President Biden admitted that there is no Federal  solution to COVID-19, he admitted that the mask and vaccine mandates  were never about public health, they were about control.   Placing mask mandates on the American people and dictating that they  must comply, or else, runs contrary to our commitment to America. Let's  not forget that throughout the entire pandemic Democrats ignored their  own masking rules while forcing children to wear them at school, and  even outside on extremely hot days.   Liberal elites were spotted without their masks at hair salons, fancy  restaurants, and more. Those same hypocritical leaders shamed others  who did not comply with the mask mandates that they ignored.   The American people see right through Democrats' masking political  theater and will never forget how they played politics with our  children by shuttering their schools and masking their faces, even as  doctors were noting the harm those mandates were causing our children.   As a pharmacist, I trust patients to work with medical professionals  and their families to make healthcare decisions that work best for  them.   A decision to receive a vaccine or wear a mask is a personal one and  should only be done in consultation with a trusted healthcare  professional.   That is why we need policies that empower workers to work, allows  children and families to thrive, and encourages patients to foster  relationships with their healthcare providers. One-size-fits-all  mandates are nothing short of government overreach in its most  tyrannical form.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative Ogles for working on this  amendment. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and  oppose President Biden's unconstitutional mask mandates.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Tim  Malchak, a Savannah native and member of the Band of Brothers, on being  nominated for Christian Country Artist of the Year.   This nomination is an incredible honor, and I cannot think of anyone  more deserving than Tim. He has spent over 40 years in the music  business as a singer-songwriter and as a former MCA/Universal recording  artist.   Tim first became known in the music industry when multiple songs of  his made it to the top 40 hit singles in Billboard's Hot Country Music  Charts.   He has 24 albums in which he shares his love of Jesus Christ through  music and testimony. Tim considers himself extremely blessed to be able  to let God's light shine through him and minister to others through his  music.   Tim has made the First District in the State of Georgia proud. Great  work. I look forward to what else he will accomplish in the world of  music.                            ____________________
