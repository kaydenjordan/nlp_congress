 Mr. Speaker, too often, our country fails to get people  the mental healthcare they need. This is true for Americans of all  ages, and it is particularly acute for our Nation's college students.   They face the hurdles of corporate greed in our healthcare system and  stigma against mental health treatment. But they also run into  roadblocks with unhelpful or, at times, actively harmful campus  policies.   Policymakers need to give students the tools they need to succeed so  they can graduate and become leaders in our communities.   I have written legislation, the Student Mental Health Rights Act,  that would strengthen mental health policies on college campuses to  better protect young people struggling with mental health challenges.   Students have begun a third school year disrupted by COVID-19. They  continue to face the challenges of being physically isolated from their  peers and navigating remote or hybrid instruction.   The problem is clear: Protecting students' health is urgent and  necessary.                            ____________________
