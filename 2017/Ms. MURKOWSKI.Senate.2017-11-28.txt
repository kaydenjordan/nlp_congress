 Mr. President, today I wish to discuss a bill that has  been worked on for years. H.R. 228 will help tribes streamline what are  called 477 programs. Recently, a question was raised about the Head  Start program and its possible inclusion in 477 plans. I do not think  that Head Start services are eligible for incorporation into 477 plans.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Congressman Don Young and  me to the Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  November 27, 2017.      Hon. Ryan Zinke,      Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Zinke, We write today to provide information       about our legislation, the Indian Employment, Training and       Related Services Consolidation Act (H.R. 228 as passed the       House / S. 91 as reported by committee in the Senate). Our       legislation has bipartisan backing and the support of a broad       coalition of tribes and tribal organizations.        During consideration of the legislation, a question was       raised as to whether any Head Start services would be       eligible for incorporation into a tribal ``477 Plan'' under       H.R. 228 / S. 91. The answer is no--Head Start is an early       childhood education program, and does not fit into any of the       categories of eligible programs' purposes that are listed in       Section 6 of the bills. Head Start services are not eligible       under current law for incorporation into tribal 477 plans,       and will not be eligible under our legislation.        We wanted to take the opportunity to provide this       background should it be helpful in the future.            Sincerely,      Don Young,        Congressman for All Alaska.      Lisa Murkowski,        U.S. Senator.
