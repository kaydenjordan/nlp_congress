 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of His Eminence  Archbishop Elpidophoros, who was recently elected the new Greek  Orthodox Archbishop of America.   Archbishop Elpidophoros was born in Constantinople, Istanbul, Turkey,  in 1967. Since August 2011, he has served as the abbot of the  Patriarchal Monastery of Holy Trinity in Halki, where I had an  opportunity to meet him this past April. What a wonderful, wonderful  person.   Madam Speaker, our beloved seminary is located there as well.   He is an expert theologian. I was so blessed to have a conversation  with him. He is kind and honorable. We could hope for no better  qualities in our new archbishop.   He replaces Archbishop Demetrios, who has retired after 20 years at  his post.   Archbishop Elpidophoros leads a church of more than 1\1/2\ million  Greek Orthodox Christians in the United States, promoting the values of  orthodoxy at every opportunity.   I wish Archbishop Elpidophoros the best in all of his endeavors and  congratulate him on this great achievement. May God's grace be upon him  in his new role.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 26 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, June 21, 2019, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
