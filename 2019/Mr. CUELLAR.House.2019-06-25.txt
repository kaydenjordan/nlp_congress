 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership and the rest of the appropriators and the staff who are  working very hard to get this emergency bill on the floor.   This bill is important. I live on the border. I don't just go visit  the border. I have been to the CBP processing facilities. I have been  to the nonprofit shelters for the immigrant children.   I speak with the brave and compassionate men and women who are  responsible for managing this humanitarian crisis. These men and women  are my neighbors, and we have their back. They have expressed to me the  urgency of getting this funding to enable them to protect the life and  the safety of the migrants in their custody.   But we must also keep in mind the communities that are also providing  the food, the housing, and the assistance that they need, communities  like Laredo, like McAllen, Texas, like San Antonio, and so many other  communities across the southwest border. So we must pass this bill to  provide that funding.   But there are two particular provisions that I d want to mention,  also. One is the humanitarian reimbursement for communities, and the  other is the one-stop processing centers that I had requested and have  been added on this particular bill itself.    Let me talk about the humanitarian care.   Madam Speaker, you have cities, you have counties, you have churches,  and you have nonprofits that have really stepped up for many years. In  fact, they started this work in 2014 when the first wave of children  started coming up here. This bill includes $60 million for the direct  reimbursement for local communities and nonprofits in Texas, New  Mexico, Arizona, and California.   This funding will now use a different model. One, we set up a new pot  of money to make sure that we get that funding. The second thing is  this model provides direct funding where the local communities can now  ask for these requested moneys.   We had a different model back in 2014, and, unfortunately, you had  Governors, like my own State of Texas, that got over $100 million and  only provided $400,000 in the last 4 years, 5 years.   So this new funding will get the money directly to them. In fact,  this funding will now be distributed through the Emergency Food and  Shelter Program National Board, and they  [[Page H5156]]  are required to distribute that money within 30 days after this board  gets this money.   So we have to provide that assistance to them because, again, they  have to be reimbursed for food, water, medicine, medical supplies,  temporary housing, and transportation. So that assistance has to be  provided to the local entities.   The second provision is this one-stop center, $200 million to make  sure that this multiagency, integrated, migration process gets this.    Madam Speaker, we have to provide this because, again,  the Border Patrol agency cannot handle this, and, therefore, we need  this particular processing center.   Again, it is a good bill. Why should we wait for the Senate? We are  the House of Representatives, and we have a right to pass our own bills  and not wait for the Senate.   For those reasons, I say let's support this bill.                                time  2030
