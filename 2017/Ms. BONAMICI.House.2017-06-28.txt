 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  1215, a misguided and misnamed bill that will limit access to justice,  especially for women.   The bill caps the amount of compensation a jury can award to a victim  who suffers medical injuries, even catastrophic injuries, because it  creates a lifetime cap of $250,000 for noneconomic damages.   This means that women, or men, for that matter, who are at home  raising their families, or children who are victims of devastating  medical malpractice are told that the value of their injuries and their  lives is less than that of their wage-earning counterparts. That is  patently unfair. It disproportionately penalizes people who are family  caregivers--a very important job, but one that does not involve wages.   Furthermore, many women across the country have been victims of  medical malpractice that has left them unable to bear children.   How can we say to these women that the loss they have suffered, the  loss of an opportunity to be a mother is without value?   That is unacceptable, and it is cruel.   Many medical errors are preventable. We should be focusing on  improving patient safety, not taking away rights from victims.   I oppose this bill, and I will continue to fight back against  attempts to limit access to justice for those who need it most. Please  join me in voting ``no.''  [[Page H5272]]
