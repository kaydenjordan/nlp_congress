 I thank the chairman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise with the greatest respect for my colleague from  the District of Columbia and her passion on this subject and the bill  that she has introduced. I rise with equal respect for my colleague,  Chairman Barletta, and the way in which he has walked this bill through  the process, but I am going to oppose this bill. I am going to do so on  the basis of process. I thought it important to explain why, given, I  think, the amount of energy that has gone into the bill and the fact  that I wasn't able to voice a vote against it when it was voice voted  at the committee level.   I do so because I think that blank checks rarely work out well for  the  [[Page H1552]]  taxpayer. In fairness to the bill, it is not a blank check. The bill is  actually prescribed in three different ways--the way in which it will  impact Federal buildings. My problem, though, is on methodology in that  the General Services Administration that ultimately gave the numbers to  the CBO on which they base their score did not get in final form how  many Federal buildings we are talking about. I think that leaves,  therefore, something of an open end as to what this bill will  ultimately cost; and that then goes to impact the very children for  whom the breastfeeding will take place.                                time  1800    A child born in America today is going to inherit a giant liability  from the Federal Government in terms of the cost of our Federal  Government. By accountants from both the left and the right, they have  said what we have in place is not sustainable. Therefore, I think it is  very important, from a process standpoint, that we look at a final form  number on any of these bills that we throw out and we prescribe,  regardless of, again, how well-meaning they are and how measured they  are, which is certainly the case with this bill.   I wanted to stand to give a quick explanation. I thank the gentleman  for the time.
