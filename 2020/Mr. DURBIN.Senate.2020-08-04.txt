 Madam President, I have a recommendation for my  colleagues in the Senate. I recommend, as the Senator from New York  does, that they go home--literally, leave Washington, go home, and meet  up with the people who sent them to Washington to work for them.   I did last Friday, as I do every weekend. I asked specifically to  meet with five individuals who are out of work. I wanted them to tell  me their story and to share that story with the people of Chicago. It  was quite a moving experience.   We have 800,000 Illinoisans who are claiming unemployment. Now there  is a possibility that the $600 a week Federal benefit that was coming  to them to help pay their bills will disappear. Technically, it ended  last Friday.   So I asked these unemployed Illinoisans to tell me their story.  Roushaunda Williams told me a story about being a bartender for 19  years at the Palmer House Hilton before being laid off in March. She  earned significantly more while working than she is receiving in  unemployment. She is literally worried she is going to lose her home  and healthcare if she loses that $600 a week.   Andres Moreno worked at a restaurant in downtown Chicago before the  pandemic. He was pretty proud of his career, working in the restaurant  business. He said: I did well. He and his husband have both lost their  jobs and their health insurance. Without the additional $600 a week in  unemployment compensation, they will not be able to even buy health  coverage.   Aileen Dimery is an interesting person. She is in lighting  technology. Her job involves big events. They set up the lights for  concerts and other gatherings for thousands of people. She said: Nobody  knows I am there, but I do. I am one of the first women who has ever  been in this profession.   Well, those big concerts and crowded venues aren't there anymore.  Aileen doesn't have anyplace to go back to. She said one thing that  still sticks with me. She said: I started working when I was 15. I  worked 36 years. You know how many weeks, Senator, that I have had on  unemployment in my 36-year work experience?   I said: No.   She said: One. This notion that I would rather stay home and draw  unemployment than go back to work, that isn't who I am. I have proven  over a lifetime that I am not someone who really doesn't want to earn  their pay.   Her enhanced unemployment, if it expires, would mean that her bills-- including paying rent--just can't be paid.   Jesus Morales worked at the Drake Hotel in Chicago for 33 years and  made up to $1,700 a week. He reminds me that I met him 20 years ago  when he was a bartender and a waiter at an event that I attended. Well,  he has been laid off since March, and without the $600 payment, he is  afraid he will not be able to make his mortgage payment, and the COBRA  payment, which covers his health insurance for his family, would be  impossible.   Samantha Arce is a mother of three. She just gave birth a few weeks  before the lockdown began. Her place of work is closed, and her fiance  has lost his job. They quickly went from two working parents with three  kids to no working parents. Enhanced unemployment payments help them  pay hospital bills and care for their young kids. She brought her  little boy. He is about 4 or 5 months old--cute little fellow. He  smiled throughout the whole event. Little did he know what was going on  in the minds of his mom and dad as they try to cope with the political  decisions being made in Washington.   Losing that $600-a-week payment, which the Republicans have proposed,  would really create a devastating situation for these families and  these individuals. I hear regularly and have heard it for a long time-- there is this notion that if you are unemployed, you are just not  trying hard enough. There are jobs out there, they say.   Well, that is not what the numbers tell us. There are four unemployed  Americans for every available job--four for every available job. And  employers who say: Well, if so-and-so would come back to work, but they  are making too much on unemployment--of course, that is the case in  some instances, but it is rare. Did you know that of the Americans who  have gone back to work since we began this pandemic assault, of those  who have gone back to work, 70 percent are making less than they made  on unemployment? Well, why would they make that economic decision to go  back to work and make less than unemployment?   Well, it is just like Aileen. They are workers. At their heart, they  are workers. No. 1, they believe in the dignity of work; they are proud  of what they do; and they want to go back to doing it. No. 2, they know  unemployment is not forever. No. 3, sometimes there are benefits when  you go back to work that really count, like the health insurance policy  that had the doctor and the hospital which you and your family need.   In June, the Illinois unemployment rate dropped to 14.6 percent, and  the State added 142,000 jobs, but that unemployment rate of 14.6  percent is the greatest we have faced since the great recession. Since  the beginning of March, around 1.7 million unemployment claims had been  filed in our State of a little less than 13 million people. That is  nearly 10 times the number of claims processed during the same period a  year ago. The same thing is true in neighboring States like Kentucky,  where the unemployment claims are 10 times what they were a year ago.   Nationwide, around 30 million Americans are relying on enhanced  unemployment benefits just to keep things together. Trust me, they tell  me. We are not saving this money. We are not investing this money. We  are spending this money as fast as it is handed to us to pay for our  home, our car, utilities, and food.   The Republican approach would cut the unemployment benefit check from  the Federal Government from $600 a week to $200 a week--a $400 cut. It  would then require States to put in place a complex system of 70  percent wage replacement. It sounds so logical that if you are  unemployed, you get 70 percent of your paycheck.   That is an interesting formula. How do you make a formula like that  work? Well, you have to gather a lot of data about what a person was  earning when they were employed and then put that into a computer, in  terms of the payout each State would make under this new formula. It is  different than what States are already doing. What we found out is,  States are very different when it comes to their computer technology.  We were told that, incidentally, by the Trump administration when we  established the $600-a-week payment. They told us back in March: Don't  make this too complicated. Make it simple, a flat dollar amount because  these 50 States have computers that range in sophistication from  primitive to the most modern, and they are not going to change these  computers in time to help the people who are currently unemployed.   The Republicans seem to have forgotten what we were told by the Trump  administration when we initially enacted the $600-a-week payment. This  70 percent payment for unemployment doesn't work if the computers can't  make it work, and we are told it will take anywhere from 2 months to 5  months for these computer systems to even try.   What are these families supposed to do, the ones I just described to  you, while the computer systems are being retooled, and who is going to  pay for the retooling? If the States can't implement this program, and,  instead, the flat cash payment goes from $600 to  [[Page S4683]]  $200 for month after month after month, trust me, the lines at the food  pantries will be longer than ever.   The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that cutting this benefit  to $200 a week will reduce our gross domestic product by 2.5 percent  and cost us 3.4 million jobs. Just what we need, more unemployment,  thanks to the Republican formula.   Research from the JPMorgan Chase Institute suggests the enhanced  benefits have helped thousands of households to continue purchasing  critical needs: food, diapers, and the basics. Allowing these benefits  to expire will result in household spending cuts and a reduction in  economic activity, which is exactly the opposite of what we need to do  right now.   This weekend, on television, there was a governor from the Federal  Reserve in Minneapolis who basically said: This is exactly the wrong  time to cut back on benefits to the unemployed   And when the questioner said to him: Well, what about our deficit?   He was very frank about it. Yes, for the time being, it will add to  the debt of the United States, but if the economy recovers, which we  all have to work to achieve, that recovered economy will be able to  take care of that debt. That is something to keep in mind too. It isn't  just for the benefit of the families who are unemployed; it is for the  benefit of the overall economy to put money back into it now.   We learned in basic economics that if you want to get out of a  recession, the first dollar the government gives away should be to the  unemployed. They will spend every penny of it, and they will spend it  and then have it respent into the economy over and over again. That is  how you create consumer demand. That is how you create demands for  business activities, goods, and services.   So, I want to make it clear from what I learned last Friday in  Chicago. No one--no one is getting rich off of unemployment. They are  using their unemployment benefits to survive. Average rent is about  $1,400 a month in this country. COBRA health insurance, where you pick  up the health insurance policy from the employer that just laid you  off, runs about $1,700 a month for a family and $600 a month for an  individual. The average cost of food for a male adult in America,  between $200 and $400 a month. Add it all up. There isn't much left  over. And if the Republican proposal of cutting $400 a week from each  of these unemployed becomes the law of the land to try to make ends  meet, workers of color have a disproportionate impact when it comes to  this economic collapse.   Overall unemployment was 11.1 percent in June. Unemployment among  Black workers is 15.4 percent. It is 14.5 percent for Latinx workers.  According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, Black households  cut their household consumption by 50 percent more and Latino  households cut their consumption by 20 percent more than White  households. That is the reality.   Let me address two or three particulars raised by the Senator from  Kentucky about the state of play as we try to negotiate a satisfactory  conclusion and next step. The first point: This week marks the third  month--the third month since Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House  Democrats passed a rescue package. For 3 months, their effort, called  the Heroes Act, has been sitting on the desk of Senator McConnell.  Initially, he said: I don't feel a sense of urgency to address this  issue. Then he went on to say: We haven't spent all the money we  appropriated the first round.   Whatever the reason, it wasn't until 7 days ago that the Senate  Republicans kind of made a proposal. The only thing we have seen  specific in writing was their proposal for liability immunity, which I  will address in a moment. The rest of the things were oddly presented  as potential legislation, which would be brought to the floor of the  Senate.   Imagine that? We have the White House and congressional leaders  sitting down negotiating, and Senator McConnell said: Well, the  Republicans will bring a bill to the floor. Well, if you follow the  Senate, six or eight different bills to the floor, the first swipe is  going through Republican majority committees. Second, how long is that  going to take for us to debate and then negotiate between whatever we  pass and what is pending in the Heroes Act? It makes no sense.   But I will tell you what makes even less sense. In the negotiations,  these delicate and important life-changing negotiations that are taking  place on Capitol Hill--these negotiations to determine what is next now  that the $600 Federal payment has expired under unemployment, for  example--in these negotiations, there are six chairs. One chair is  occupied by the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States,  Mark Meadows. Another chair is occupied by Secretary Mnuchin from the  Department of the Treasury. The third chair is Speaker of the House,  Nancy Pelosi. The fourth chair is Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader  of the U.S. Senate. But there are two empty chairs in this room for  negotiations. Those two empty chairs should be occupied. One should be  occupied by Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader of the House. He is  not there. He doesn't attend these negotiations. And the other, of  course, should be occupied by Senator McConnell, the Republican leader  of the Senate.   He has enough time to come to the floor each day and criticize  Speaker Pelosi's measure that she passed 3 months ago, but he  apparently doesn't have time to attend negotiations which could resolve  the differences between the House and Senate and finally bring to rest  the concerns of millions of Americans about whether or not there will  be enough money coming in next week to pay the bills. It is pretty  tough to come to the floor each day and criticize the Democrats for not  showing success in negotiations when the Republican leader in the  Senate is boycotting the negotiation meetings. What is that all about?  I have been around here for awhile. I have never seen that before where  one leader is intentionally staying away from the negotiations. I don't  see how that can end well.   I see my colleague from Texas has come to the floor. I want to say a  word about a proposal which he is promoting and is likely to speak to  this morning before I turn the floor over to him.   Remember when Senator McConnell came to the floor in the last several  months and said: I am drawing a redline. When it comes to any  negotiations, this redline is liability immunity for corporations, and  if you don't accept my language on liability immunity, there will be no  negotiations, and there will be no positive outcome--redline.   He made that speech over and over again as he warned us about the  flood, the tsunami--``tsunami'' was his word--the tsunami of lawsuits  that are going to be filed by people, by trial lawyers, these  mischievous, frivolous lawsuits, over the issue of COVID-19. So we kept  wondering, when are we going to get to see Senator McConnell's  liability immunity proposal? We waited week after week after week.  Nothing. Just speeches on the floor. And then last Monday it was  unveiled--a 65-page bill. We finally got to see what he was talking  about. It is understandable why they held it back. It is the biggest  giveaway to the biggest businesses in America in modern memory. This  bill would literally override State laws that have been passed to deal  with this issue of culpability and blame when it comes to the pandemic  we face.    Twenty-eight States have already enacted laws to deal with it. This  McConnell-Cornyn proposal would override those State laws. Sadly, their  proposal would give incentives to cut corners when businesses deal with  health and safety in the midst of this pandemic. This bill would  jeopardize frontline workers and families, and, sadly, it would risk  further spread of the virus.   Here is my top-10 list of what is wrong with this bill that is  proposed on liability immunity:   First, the bill does nothing to protect workers, improve safety  standards, or give businesses any incentive to take the proper  precautions.   We had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. I believe the senior  Senator from Texas was at this hearing. A fellow representing a  convenience store chain in Texas--his last name was Smartt--was the  Republican witness. He was a very good witness, I might add. He told us  how, in the hundreds of convenience stores he had in Texas, his company  was literally doing everything they could think of to make the  [[Page S4684]]  work environment and the customer's environment safe. He talked about  social distancing and masks and sanitizers. They were doing everything  they could. But his plea to us was: Senators, what is my standard of  care? What is the standard I am expected to achieve? If I know that, he  said, I can move forward and meet that standard, and I am going to. I  am committed to it.   Do you know what? I believed him. I believed his was a good-faith  position. He said he wanted to know the standard--the public health  standard--expected of him, and he would meet it.   I want to tell you, if somebody turned around and sued him afterwards  because of that, I am convinced that there isn't a jury in America--let  alone in Texas--who would find him to be liable for negligence or  recklessness. He did what he was asked to do. He followed the standards  he was given. But his plea to us was: ``Give me a standard. I don't  know where to turn.'' That is what he told us.   The second concern I have with this bill is that it would gut  existing State law safety standards. It would federally preempt the  right of workers and victims to bring cases under State law to seek  accountability for coronavirus-related harms and would supplant State  laws that require businesses to act with reasonable care.   Under the bill, the only way a victim could hold a business liable is  if the victim proves by clear and convincing evidence--a higher  standard than most--both that the corporation didn't even try to comply  with the weakest available safety guideline and also--also--that the  corporation was grossly negligent. I can just tell you, having spent a  few years making a living as a lawyer, that those are almost impossible  standards to meet.   Third, by setting an immunity threshold at ``gross negligence,'' the  bill would immunize corporations from accountability for conduct that  meets the standards to prove negligence or recklessness under current  State law. So you can get away with negligence; you can even get away  with recklessness; but, boy, you just better not show gross negligence.  That is what the bill says.   Fourth, the bill would enable corporations to be shielded from  liability even if they make no effort--no effort--to comply with the  guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control, due to the way the  bill treats nonmandatory guidelines. Why would Congress federally  preempt State laws and then allow businesses to ignore the Federal CDC  safety guidelines?   Fifth, instead of establishing strong, clear, enforceable Federal  safety standards by OSHA and CDC, the Republican bill would go the  other direction and shield businesses from enforcement proceedings  under Federal health and safety laws; in other words, specifically  protecting businesses from being held accountable under existing health  and safety laws, Federal bills, laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act,  the Americans with Disabilities Act, OSHA, and many, many more.   Sixth, my Republican colleagues say this bill is aimed only at  frivolous coronavirus lawsuits, but the bill would wipe out legitimate  claims by workers and victims. By forcing all COVID lawsuits to meet a  higher standard of proof, heightened pleading requirements, limits on  discovery, and other restrictive hurdles, the bill would make it nearly  impossible for workers and victims to even file a claim, let alone  prevail.   Seventh, the bill would upend the medical liability laws of all 50  States and impose 5 years of sweeping Federal preemption for nearly all  healthcare liability cases, including for claims that are not related  to COVID.   I went through this and read it over and over again because I used to  deal with medical malpractice cases. I heard, on the floor, Senator  McConnell and Senator Cornyn say: ``We have to protect the doctors. We  have to protect the hospitals. We have to protect the nurses.'' That,  of course, appeals to all of us because we feel such a debt of  gratitude to the healthcare workers and what they are going through to  protect us. So I took a look, and it turns out that they compiled the  statistics on the number of medical malpractice cases filed in America,  in the entire Nation, that mention coronavirus or COVID-19. Do you know  how many medical malpractice cases have been filed during what they  call a tsunami--a tsunami--of frivolous lawsuits against medical  providers? How many do you think in the course of this year? Six. In  the entire Nation of 50 States, 6 lawsuits--what a tsunami.   The provision on medical malpractice goes further and says: You don't  have to prove that you were dealing with coronavirus to get this  special treatment. You can say that the coronavirus had some impact on  you as a medical provider.   Some impact. That is it? What does that mean? Coronavirus has had an  impact on every single American. Some impact? It basically means that  all medical malpractice suits are going to be put on hold for 4 or 5  years regardless of the circumstances, regardless of whether they had  anything to do with COVID-19.   Eighth, the bill aims to solve a problem that does not exist. We are  months into this epidemic, and there has been no tidal wave of worker  or victim lawsuits that justifies this massive Federal preemption of  State laws and grants of broad immunity. Out of 4.7 million Americans-- and that is a low-ball number--4.7 million Americans who we think have  been infected by COVID-19, there have been 6 COVID medical malpractice  suits, 17 consumer personal injury suits, and 75 conditions-of- employment suits. Many of the lawsuits involving COVID-19 are between  insurance companies: Does your policy cover, or does your policy cover?   Ninth, the bill is entirely one-sided in favor of corporations. Under  the bill, corporations get immunity as defendants but can still bring  COVID-related cases as plaintiffs. Only workers and infected victims  have their rights cut off by this bill.   Finally, the bill even goes so far as to allow corporations and the  Department of Justice to sue the workers for bringing claims for COVID  infection.   The liability immunity this bill would grant would last for 5--5  years. The fact that our Republican colleagues are proposing 5 years of  immunity for corporations but only a handful of months of assistance  for workers and families tells you their priorities.   This Republican corporate immunity proposal is not credible, and  there are serious questions as to whether it is even constitutional.  This is an area traditionally governed by State law. Twenty-eight  States have adjusted their laws to address it during this pandemic. The  Federal Government has deferred to the States on nearly every aspect of  COVID response--this President said: Leave it to your Governor; leave  it to your mayor--from testing, to procuring PPE, to mask policies, to  stay-at-home orders. There is no reason why the Federal Government now  wants to step in at the expense of workers and at the expense of  customers.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican corporate immunity bill   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin),  [[Page S4688]]  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily  absent.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Timothy McCarthy has had an amazing career  in law enforcement where he was at the right place when needed. Whether  it was protecting Presidents or his hometown of Orland Park, Tim has  been where people needed him most. After 48 years, he will be retiring,  and today, I lend my voice to the many who honor him.   Tim dared to try out for the University of Illinois' football team as  a walk-on in 1967, even though he had not played the sport at Leo High  School in Chicago. However, he was so impressive that he was given a  full scholarship the next year, playing strong safety for the Fighting  Illini. Injuries cut his football career short, but he found himself on  another career path, the Secret Service.   With a father who served in the Chicago Police Department as a  sergeant, law enforcement was a natural draw for him. He started out as  an investigator in the Chicago field office for the Secret Service in  1972. Tim moved to the Presidential protection division for President  Jimmy Carter.   On March 30, 1981, Tim was protecting President Ronald Reagan in  Washington. A coin toss with a fellow agent put him into duty that  fateful day. He remembers wearing a brandnew blue-gray suit when John  Hinckley, Jr., stepped out from a crowd with a handgun and attempted to  kill the President.   In 1.7 seconds, John Hinckley, Jr., fired six bullets. The first  bullet hit Press Secretary James Brady. The second hit Washington, DC,  police officer Tom Delahanty. The third was set to hit President  Reagan, but Tim, with that extraordinary courage, stepped in front of  the President and took the bullet in the chest. Another bullet  ricocheted, hitting the President under the arm. Hinckley might have  killed President Reagan, but that day, we were lucky to have Tim  McCarthy doing his duty to protect the Gipper.   Tim spent 2 weeks in the hospital and was back on the job that June.  He would never be able to do the 5 to 7-mile runs he used to do, but he  continued in the Secret Service. Tim received the National Collegiate  Athletic Association Award of Valor in 1982 for his heroic deed. He  remained in touch with President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, for the  rest of their lives. Tim also served in the Presidential protection  division for President George H.W. Bush before returning to Chicago to  run the Secret Service office there.   In 1994, Tim accepted the position of the Orland Park police chief in  Illinois. Often, police chiefs serve 3 to 5 years, but Tim stayed on  for 26 years. He led the development of new policing strategies,  including bike patrol officers, cookouts with police, and community  meetings with beat officers. Under his leadership, the police  department launched villagewide initiatives, addressing mental illness  through a crisis intervention team that focuses on responses to mental  health-related incidents.   Tim was a hands-on leader, whether it was back up for a search  warrant or reporting a crime scene at early hours of the morning or  packing sandbags  [[Page S4725]]  during a flood. In 2016, he received the very first Chief of Police of  the Year Award from the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.   This month, Tim is retiring to be with the center of his life his  wife, Carol, his three kids, and seven grandchildren. He has more than  earned it.   Tim McCarthy did more than make history in saving the life of  President Reagan. He has dedicated his life to making America a safer  nation. We were fortunate to be blessed with his courage and his  amazing record of public service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

A bill to increase wildfire preparedness and response  throughout the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Energy and Natural Resources.    Mr. President, in the days since we lost our colleague  Congressman  John Lewis, many of us have come to the floor to talk  about his extraordinary courage and tenacity.   At the age of 25--25--he joined 600 civil rights activists to march  across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL, in pursuit of the right  to vote. We have talked about how that day became known as Bloody  Sunday, after John and the other courageous marchers were met with  brutal beatings from Alabama State troopers, and how, in the days that  followed, President Lyndon B. Johnson called on Congress to pass the  Voting Rights Act.   It was 55 years ago this week that President Johnson sat at a desk in  the President's Room right off this Chamber, a room that we walk by  many times each week, and signed the Voting Rights Act into law. He  noted at the signing ceremony:         [L]ast March, with the outrage of Selma still fresh, I came       down to this Capitol one evening and asked Congress and the       people for swift and for sweeping action to guarantee to       every man and woman the right to vote. In less than 48 hours,       I sent the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to Congress. In little       more than 4 months the Congress, with overwhelming       majorities, enacted one of the most monumental laws in the       history of American freedom.    Those were the words of Lyndon Johnson. He signed the Voting Rights  Act in 1965.   Well, we have made significant progress since that day, thanks to  great men like John Lewis, who marched to enact the Voting Rights Act,  and the advocates and litigators who battled for decades to enforce it.   But there is a grim reality. Insidious voter suppression efforts  still continue in America today. These efforts may not seem as obvious  as the old-school poll taxes and literacy tests. But make no mistake.  They are aimed at denying the fundamental right to vote, and all too  often they are successful.   When I was chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the  Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights, I decided to travel to  the States of Florida and Ohio for public hearings to speak to  officials and experts on the ground and to determine why those States,  through their legislatures, were passing laws--what I considered  burdensome laws, such as reducing opportunities for early voting. Why  were they making it harder to vote in Ohio and Florida?   In both States I asked witnesses, under oath, what evidence of  widespread voter fraud prompted these laws that made it more difficult  for people to vote and limited the time when they could vote. The  answer was simple. Under oath, what was the evidence of fraud? There  was no evidence of fraud.   It turned out that there were a handful of election fraud cases here  and there, rarely prosecuted, and that is it.   In contrast to the mere specter of widespread voter fraud, we learned  that these voter suppression laws really had consequences. We heard  over and over that restrictive voting laws have a disproportionate  impact on whom? Low income voters, Black voters, Brown voters, young  voters, elderly, vulnerable voting populations.   When you make it harder to vote, it is tougher for these people to  show up and vote. Someone knew that.   After the hearings, we learned more about the real reason behind  those laws. According to news reports, Republican consultants and  former officials admitted after the 2012 election that the Florida law  discussed at my hearing was literally designed to suppress the vote,  particularly among those leaning toward the Democratic column.   A year later, the Supreme Court announced its decision in Shelby  County v. Holder. In a 5-to-4 vote, the divided Court struck down the  provisions of the Voting Rights Act that required certain jurisdictions  to preclear any changes in their voting laws with the Department of  Justice.   The decision effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and in  the aftermath, several State legislatures pushed through discriminatory  restrictions on voting that previously would have required approval by  the Justice Department ahead of time.   As an example, in North Carolina the legislature enacted a massive  voter suppression bill, including a strict photo ID requirement, early  voting cutbacks, and the elimination of same-day registration, out-of- precinct voting, and preregistration for teenagers who were about to  turn 18 before an election.   What did a three-judge Federal panel have to say about this North  Carolina law? They said ``it targeted African Americans with almost  surgical precision'' and ``enacted the law with discriminatory  intent.''   Those are unequivocal words. Despite all the press releases to the  contrary, the Court knew exactly what was going on in North Carolina.  They were trying to stop African-American voters in that State from  being counted.   Unfortunately, litigation targeting these voter suppression efforts  has faced an increasingly uphill battle, as President Trump has packed  the Federal courts with partisan, rightwing judges, including several  with appalling records on voting rights.   And though the Supreme Court continues to state that the right to  vote is both ``fundamental'' and ``preservative of other basic civil  and political rights,'' the Court has also continued to permit broad  assaults on America's access to the ballot box.   Let me give you an example. In April, the Court forced thousands of  Wisconsin primary voters in April of this year to choose between their  health and exercising their right to vote in the middle of a COVID-19  pandemic. The Court refused to extend the deadline for returning  absentee ballots, despite the public health national emergency we face.   A State official in Wisconsin recently said that at least 71 people  were infected with COVID-19 after voting in person or working at the  polls during that primary election.   In June, the Supreme Court turned down a request to reinstate a Texas  district court judge's order which would have ensured that all voters  in the State could ask to vote by mail, in light of the pandemic.   And just last month, the same Court refused to lift a stay in Florida  that will prevent hundreds of thousands of otherwise eligible  Floridians from voting in this month's primary election, simply because  they can't pay the fines and fees imposed on them long ago as part of a  criminal sentence.   What did Justice Sotomayor say in her dissent about this Florida  case? ``This court's inaction continues a trend of condoning  disfranchisement.''   Well, it is time for this to end. I am introducing today a joint  resolution. I don't do this lightly.   In the time that I have served in Congress, I believe that this is  only the second time that I have proposed an amendment to this  Constitution.   I believe, at least personally, that I am humbled by this document. I  know it was far from perfect when written. We have learned that over  the years with all the amendments and the history that has followed.  But I have never thought myself worthy to add words to that document.  One other time, on abolishing the electoral college, I had a bipartisan  measure that I offered. But this is only the second time I have done  it.   This joint resolution would create and enshrine an explicit,  individual right to vote in the U.S. Constitution, and protect all  Americans who seek to exercise this fundamental right.   Specifically, the amendment would provide an affirmative right to  vote for every American citizen of legal voting age at any public  election held in the jurisdiction in which they reside.   It would also require that any efforts to limit the fundamental right  to vote would be subject to the strictest level of review in the  courts.   Additionally, it would ensure that States could no longer rely on  section  [[Page S4735]]  2 of the 14th Amendment to prevent Americans from voting due to an  earlier criminal conviction.   Finally, the amendment would provide that Congress has the  irrefutable authority to protect the right to vote through legislation.   If ratified, this constitutional amendment would protect against  nefarious election administration changes that lead to long lines and  people beating on doors, trying to get in to vote. These long lines  have reduced voter turnout on election day. How in the world can we be  a stronger nation if fewer people participate in the most important  part of democracy?   It would protect against photo identification requirements that  disproportionately harm low-income voters and African Americans and  Hispanics.   Black lives matter. Brown lives matter. American lives matter. And  when it comes to voting, this insidious effort to undermine the  opportunity for these people to vote has to be called out for what it  is.   It would also provide a path to end discriminatory criminal  disfranchisement laws that are a relic of the Jim Crow era and yet  continue to strip millions of citizens of their fundamental right to  participate in our democracy.   Some may ask why we should pursue this amendment, when there are  clearer, perhaps easier, steps that Congress can take right now to  protect voting rights under its existing constitutional authority   Let me give you an example. The Senate can quickly pass the  John  Lewis Voting Rights Act amendment, which the House passed last year,  but that would rely on the decision by Senator McConnell to actually  let the Senate vote on a measure coming over from the House. There is  little hope that is going to happen.   Given the ongoing ruthless assault on voting rights in America, it is  clear that additional tools are necessary to push back against  widespread voter suppression. I recognize that amending the  Constitution is no small matter. I am well aware that introducing this  amendment today is not going to lead to any immediate change, but I  also believe that this moment represents the next step in a movement--a  movement in America that will ultimately lead to a ratification of this  amendment.   I am going to work with my colleagues and constituents to build  support. I will ask opponents as to why they believe that fundamental  right, preservative of all other rights in America, should not be  affirmatively granted to the American people and literally enshrined in  the United States Constitution--the right to vote. I plan to work with  grassroots organizations who are fighting for their voting rights to be  restored.   I am going to work with Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who  has led this effort in the House, and I plan to work with civil rights  leaders, including an old friend, Jessie Jackson, who for years has  called for this amendment to be introduced in the Senate.   I want to thank Reverend Jackson for his timeless leadership and  advocacy. I am grateful to have the support of the Rainbow/Push  Coalition as we introduce this amendment, along with the Advancement  Project national office. Let me thank Senators Warren, Sanders,  Merkley, Hirono, Markey, Van Hollen, and Blumenthal for cosponsoring,  and I hope others will join us.   By accident, I was given a book several years ago entitled ``White  Rage,'' written by Carol Anderson. Carol Anderson is a professor at  Emory University. The book was given to me by my brother-in-law, and I  was skeptical that I would even read it, let alone like it. Well, I  have to state that I have read it and recommended it over and over to  my colleagues in the Senate, including giving a copy to then Senate  Majority Leader Harry Reid. He decided, after reading the book, that it  was so good that he invited Professor Carol Anderson to come speak to  our caucus. She is an amazing person and a great historian.   She followed ``White Rage'' with this book, ``One Person, No Vote.''  In it she tells the history of voter suppression. It is an eye-opener.   After the Civil War and all those deaths to end slavery, after the  assassination of Lincoln and after the effort was made to finally give  to Blacks in the South a chance to become full-fledged citizens, they  ran into Jim Crow laws.   She talks about something which I had heard of but knew little about.  I would like to say a word from the book.   The question is about the efforts made to suppress the Black vote in  the South, and she writes:         That became most apparent in 1890 when the Magnolia State       passed the Mississippi Plan, a dizzying array of poll taxes,       literacy tests, understanding clauses, newfangled voter       registration rules, and ``good character'' clauses--all       intentionally racially discriminatory but dressed up in the       genteel garb of bringing ``integrity'' to the voting booth.       This feigned legal innocence was legislative evil genius.        Virginia representative Carter Glass, like so many others,       swooned at the thought of bringing the Mississippi Plan to       his own state [of Virginia], especially after he saw how well       it had worked. He rushed to champion a bill in the       legislature that would ``eliminate the darkey as a political       factor . . . in less than five years.'' Glass, whom President       Franklin Roosevelt would one day describe as an       ``unreconstructed rebel,'' planned not to ``deprive a single       white man of the ballot, but [to] inevitably cut from the       existing electorate four-fifths of the Negro voters'' in       Virginia.        One delegate questioned him: ``Will it not be done by fraud       and discrimination?''        ``By fraud, no. By discrimination, yes,'' Glass retorted.       ``Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what we propose . .       . to discriminate to the very extremity . . . permissible . .       . under . . . the Federal Constitution, with a view to the       elimination of every negro voter who can be gotten rid of,       legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength       of the white electorate.''    Unapologetic, straight in his remarks, his racism was rampant, and so  it was across the country.   Black lives matter. America matters. And our democracy matters. Once  and for all, the right to vote should be enshrined in our Constitution.  People died for it. It is time for us to work hard to show that we care   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.

SEC. 4. INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES STUDY ON SCHOOL-BASED                     MENTORING PROGRAMS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education, acting through       the Director of the  [[Page S4733]]       Institute of Education Sciences, shall conduct a study to--        (1) identify successful school-based mentoring programs and       effective strategies for administering and monitoring such       programs;        (2) evaluate the role of mentors in promoting cognitive       development and social-emotional learning to enhance academic       achievement and to improve workforce readiness; and        (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the grant program under       section 136 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical       Education Act of 2006, as added by section 3, on student       academic outcomes and youth career development.        (b) Timing.--Not later than 3 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education, acting       through the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences,       shall submit the results of the study to the appropriate       congressional committees.                                  ______    Mr. President, in the days since we lost our colleague  Congressman  John Lewis, many of us have come to the floor to talk  about his extraordinary courage and tenacity.   At the age of 25--25--he joined 600 civil rights activists to march  across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL, in pursuit of the right  to vote. We have talked about how that day became known as Bloody  Sunday, after John and the other courageous marchers were met with  brutal beatings from Alabama State troopers, and how, in the days that  followed, President Lyndon B. Johnson called on Congress to pass the  Voting Rights Act.   It was 55 years ago this week that President Johnson sat at a desk in  the President's Room right off this Chamber, a room that we walk by  many times each week, and signed the Voting Rights Act into law. He  noted at the signing ceremony:         [L]ast March, with the outrage of Selma still fresh, I came       down to this Capitol one evening and asked Congress and the       people for swift and for sweeping action to guarantee to       every man and woman the right to vote. In less than 48 hours,       I sent the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to Congress. In little       more than 4 months the Congress, with overwhelming       majorities, enacted one of the most monumental laws in the       history of American freedom.    Those were the words of Lyndon Johnson. He signed the Voting Rights  Act in 1965.   Well, we have made significant progress since that day, thanks to  great men like John Lewis, who marched to enact the Voting Rights Act,  and the advocates and litigators who battled for decades to enforce it.   But there is a grim reality. Insidious voter suppression efforts  still continue in America today. These efforts may not seem as obvious  as the old-school poll taxes and literacy tests. But make no mistake.  They are aimed at denying the fundamental right to vote, and all too  often they are successful.   When I was chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the  Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights, I decided to travel to  the States of Florida and Ohio for public hearings to speak to  officials and experts on the ground and to determine why those States,  through their legislatures, were passing laws--what I considered  burdensome laws, such as reducing opportunities for early voting. Why  were they making it harder to vote in Ohio and Florida?   In both States I asked witnesses, under oath, what evidence of  widespread voter fraud prompted these laws that made it more difficult  for people to vote and limited the time when they could vote. The  answer was simple. Under oath, what was the evidence of fraud? There  was no evidence of fraud.   It turned out that there were a handful of election fraud cases here  and there, rarely prosecuted, and that is it.   In contrast to the mere specter of widespread voter fraud, we learned  that these voter suppression laws really had consequences. We heard  over and over that restrictive voting laws have a disproportionate  impact on whom? Low income voters, Black voters, Brown voters, young  voters, elderly, vulnerable voting populations.   When you make it harder to vote, it is tougher for these people to  show up and vote. Someone knew that.   After the hearings, we learned more about the real reason behind  those laws. According to news reports, Republican consultants and  former officials admitted after the 2012 election that the Florida law  discussed at my hearing was literally designed to suppress the vote,  particularly among those leaning toward the Democratic column.   A year later, the Supreme Court announced its decision in Shelby  County v. Holder. In a 5-to-4 vote, the divided Court struck down the  provisions of the Voting Rights Act that required certain jurisdictions  to preclear any changes in their voting laws with the Department of  Justice.   The decision effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and in  the aftermath, several State legislatures pushed through discriminatory  restrictions on voting that previously would have required approval by  the Justice Department ahead of time.   As an example, in North Carolina the legislature enacted a massive  voter suppression bill, including a strict photo ID requirement, early  voting cutbacks, and the elimination of same-day registration, out-of- precinct voting, and preregistration for teenagers who were about to  turn 18 before an election.   What did a three-judge Federal panel have to say about this North  Carolina law? They said ``it targeted African Americans with almost  surgical precision'' and ``enacted the law with discriminatory  intent.''   Those are unequivocal words. Despite all the press releases to the  contrary, the Court knew exactly what was going on in North Carolina.  They were trying to stop African-American voters in that State from  being counted.   Unfortunately, litigation targeting these voter suppression efforts  has faced an increasingly uphill battle, as President Trump has packed  the Federal courts with partisan, rightwing judges, including several  with appalling records on voting rights.   And though the Supreme Court continues to state that the right to  vote is both ``fundamental'' and ``preservative of other basic civil  and political rights,'' the Court has also continued to permit broad  assaults on America's access to the ballot box.   Let me give you an example. In April, the Court forced thousands of  Wisconsin primary voters in April of this year to choose between their  health and exercising their right to vote in the middle of a COVID-19  pandemic. The Court refused to extend the deadline for returning  absentee ballots, despite the public health national emergency we face.   A State official in Wisconsin recently said that at least 71 people  were infected with COVID-19 after voting in person or working at the  polls during that primary election.   In June, the Supreme Court turned down a request to reinstate a Texas  district court judge's order which would have ensured that all voters  in the State could ask to vote by mail, in light of the pandemic.   And just last month, the same Court refused to lift a stay in Florida  that will prevent hundreds of thousands of otherwise eligible  Floridians from voting in this month's primary election, simply because  they can't pay the fines and fees imposed on them long ago as part of a  criminal sentence.   What did Justice Sotomayor say in her dissent about this Florida  case? ``This court's inaction continues a trend of condoning  disfranchisement.''   Well, it is time for this to end. I am introducing today a joint  resolution. I don't do this lightly.   In the time that I have served in Congress, I believe that this is  only the second time that I have proposed an amendment to this  Constitution.   I believe, at least personally, that I am humbled by this document. I  know it was far from perfect when written. We have learned that over  the years with all the amendments and the history that has followed.  But I have never thought myself worthy to add words to that document.  One other time, on abolishing the electoral college, I had a bipartisan  measure that I offered. But this is only the second time I have done  it.   This joint resolution would create and enshrine an explicit,  individual right to vote in the U.S. Constitution, and protect all  Americans who seek to exercise this fundamental right.   Specifically, the amendment would provide an affirmative right to  vote for every American citizen of legal voting age at any public  election held in the jurisdiction in which they reside.   It would also require that any efforts to limit the fundamental right  to vote would be subject to the strictest level of review in the  courts.   Additionally, it would ensure that States could no longer rely on  section  [[Page S4735]]  2 of the 14th Amendment to prevent Americans from voting due to an  earlier criminal conviction.   Finally, the amendment would provide that Congress has the  irrefutable authority to protect the right to vote through legislation.   If ratified, this constitutional amendment would protect against  nefarious election administration changes that lead to long lines and  people beating on doors, trying to get in to vote. These long lines  have reduced voter turnout on election day. How in the world can we be  a stronger nation if fewer people participate in the most important  part of democracy?   It would protect against photo identification requirements that  disproportionately harm low-income voters and African Americans and  Hispanics.   Black lives matter. Brown lives matter. American lives matter. And  when it comes to voting, this insidious effort to undermine the  opportunity for these people to vote has to be called out for what it  is.   It would also provide a path to end discriminatory criminal  disfranchisement laws that are a relic of the Jim Crow era and yet  continue to strip millions of citizens of their fundamental right to  participate in our democracy.   Some may ask why we should pursue this amendment, when there are  clearer, perhaps easier, steps that Congress can take right now to  protect voting rights under its existing constitutional authority   Let me give you an example. The Senate can quickly pass the  John  Lewis Voting Rights Act amendment, which the House passed last year,  but that would rely on the decision by Senator McConnell to actually  let the Senate vote on a measure coming over from the House. There is  little hope that is going to happen.   Given the ongoing ruthless assault on voting rights in America, it is  clear that additional tools are necessary to push back against  widespread voter suppression. I recognize that amending the  Constitution is no small matter. I am well aware that introducing this  amendment today is not going to lead to any immediate change, but I  also believe that this moment represents the next step in a movement--a  movement in America that will ultimately lead to a ratification of this  amendment.   I am going to work with my colleagues and constituents to build  support. I will ask opponents as to why they believe that fundamental  right, preservative of all other rights in America, should not be  affirmatively granted to the American people and literally enshrined in  the United States Constitution--the right to vote. I plan to work with  grassroots organizations who are fighting for their voting rights to be  restored.   I am going to work with Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who  has led this effort in the House, and I plan to work with civil rights  leaders, including an old friend, Jessie Jackson, who for years has  called for this amendment to be introduced in the Senate.   I want to thank Reverend Jackson for his timeless leadership and  advocacy. I am grateful to have the support of the Rainbow/Push  Coalition as we introduce this amendment, along with the Advancement  Project national office. Let me thank Senators Warren, Sanders,  Merkley, Hirono, Markey, Van Hollen, and Blumenthal for cosponsoring,  and I hope others will join us.   By accident, I was given a book several years ago entitled ``White  Rage,'' written by Carol Anderson. Carol Anderson is a professor at  Emory University. The book was given to me by my brother-in-law, and I  was skeptical that I would even read it, let alone like it. Well, I  have to state that I have read it and recommended it over and over to  my colleagues in the Senate, including giving a copy to then Senate  Majority Leader Harry Reid. He decided, after reading the book, that it  was so good that he invited Professor Carol Anderson to come speak to  our caucus. She is an amazing person and a great historian.   She followed ``White Rage'' with this book, ``One Person, No Vote.''  In it she tells the history of voter suppression. It is an eye-opener.   After the Civil War and all those deaths to end slavery, after the  assassination of Lincoln and after the effort was made to finally give  to Blacks in the South a chance to become full-fledged citizens, they  ran into Jim Crow laws.   She talks about something which I had heard of but knew little about.  I would like to say a word from the book.   The question is about the efforts made to suppress the Black vote in  the South, and she writes:         That became most apparent in 1890 when the Magnolia State       passed the Mississippi Plan, a dizzying array of poll taxes,       literacy tests, understanding clauses, newfangled voter       registration rules, and ``good character'' clauses--all       intentionally racially discriminatory but dressed up in the       genteel garb of bringing ``integrity'' to the voting booth.       This feigned legal innocence was legislative evil genius.        Virginia representative Carter Glass, like so many others,       swooned at the thought of bringing the Mississippi Plan to       his own state [of Virginia], especially after he saw how well       it had worked. He rushed to champion a bill in the       legislature that would ``eliminate the darkey as a political       factor . . . in less than five years.'' Glass, whom President       Franklin Roosevelt would one day describe as an       ``unreconstructed rebel,'' planned not to ``deprive a single       white man of the ballot, but [to] inevitably cut from the       existing electorate four-fifths of the Negro voters'' in       Virginia.        One delegate questioned him: ``Will it not be done by fraud       and discrimination?''        ``By fraud, no. By discrimination, yes,'' Glass retorted.       ``Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what we propose . .       . to discriminate to the very extremity . . . permissible . .       . under . . . the Federal Constitution, with a view to the       elimination of every negro voter who can be gotten rid of,       legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength       of the white electorate.''    Unapologetic, straight in his remarks, his racism was rampant, and so  it was across the country.   Black lives matter. America matters. And our democracy matters. Once  and for all, the right to vote should be enshrined in our Constitution.  People died for it. It is time for us to work hard to show that we care   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.
