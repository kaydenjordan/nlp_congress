 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his  leadership on this issue before and now.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 251 to extend the DHS  Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards, CFATS, program for a  period of 2 years.   Like many of my colleagues in the House, my district is home to a  number of chemical facilities. They play a crucial role in the local  economy, but with that comes a risk. The CFATS program helps address  that risk and makes communities like mine safer, without being overly  burdensome.   Twelve years ago, the Bush administration issued a call to action to  address credible terrorist threats to high-risk chemical facilities  across the country. At the time, chemical facility security was one of  the biggest security gaps we faced, and Secretary Chertoff asked  Congress to ``pass a balanced, risk-based security measure for the  chemical industry.''                                time  1645    Within the year, Congress attached language to the DHS appropriations  bill, giving DHS temporary authority to implement a chemical security  program. CFATS survived on annual authorizations through the  appropriations process for 8 years, and the lack of certainty and  stability stunted the program's growth.   In 2014, after the tragic explosion at the West, Texas, chemical  facility, Congress finally passed a 4-year authorization bill. Since  then, the CFATS program has invested in better tools, better trained  personnel, and a better strategic vision for the future. In short, the  CFATS program has matured.   Today, the program has the buy-in of industry and bipartisan support  on the Hill. And although I think we can do more to advance the  objectives of the program, it is clear that CFATS has made us safer.  [[Page H268]]    Authorization for CFATS expires in a matter of days. If Congress does  not act, we will lose a valuable antiterrorism program, and we will  forfeit the hard-earned progress that has been achieved.   This bill would allow DHS to continue its work to secure chemical  facilities, and it would give Congress an opportunity to hear from  stakeholders and the department about the improvements we should make.   In the last Congress, Chairman Thompson and I made repeated requests  to prioritize CFATS through hearings and markups. Unfortunately, at  this point, with the program staring down expiration, it is simply too  late for that.    Passing H.R. 251 would allow us to continue the  conversation around this important national security program without  leaving chemical facilities more vulnerable to attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to support H.R. 251,  and I hope the Senate will follow suit.
