 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlemen from  Virginia for yielding to me and for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 50, the misleadingly  named Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, which passed  out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on a strictly  partisan vote.   This dangerous bill is an attempt to weaken consumer protections,  give private industry an unfair advantage, and erect unnecessary  barriers to the regulatory process. Ultimately, this bill is designed  to prioritize the interests of private businesses over the interests of  the consumers these rules are designed to protect.   H.R. 50 also slows the regulatory process by using litigation today  to delay the approval of rules. The existing Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act of 1995 prohibits courts from using the law to stay, enjoin,  invalidate, or otherwise affect an agency rule. H.R. 50 would  fundamentally change that law by eliminating this prohibition, giving  regulated businesses the ability to abuse a gratuitously expanded  judicial review and tie up rules that would otherwise protect real  people in courts for years.   While it has been very popular in this Congress to attack regulations  as uniformly bad, the reality is that many of these rules are crucial  to protecting our air and water, preventing dangerous financial  practices, and ensuring the safety of food and drugs--to put it more  simply, to protect Americans from corporations whose only motivation is  to maximize their profit. Enacting this legislation would put these  vital rules at risk.   H.R. 50 is a very harmful bill. I want to urge all of my colleagues  to vote against it on the House floor today.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply strikes a  section of H.R. 50 that subjects independent agencies to the reporting  requirements of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, also known as UMRA.   The Office of Management and Budget, which is charged with  implementing the President's priorities across the executive branch, is  responsible for overseeing the implementation of H.R. 50.                                time  1000    This bill expands OMB's role by requiring them to guarantee that each  agency complies with the act's requirements, which puts the independent  agencies in jeopardy of political interference.   The independence of regulatory agencies, like the Federal  Communications Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission,  who are responsible for protecting public health and safety, would be  severely compromised. The aptly named independent agencies are entitled  to operate with more autonomy than Cabinet agencies and without undue  influence from Presidential administrations.   This is particularly troubling considering this administration's  track record on weakening States' rights by gutting Federal public  protections and blocking States from adopting stronger State level  standards and protections.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, can you tell me how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chairman, supporters of this bill will falsely claim that the  provision in H.R. 50 will close a loophole that will make independent  agencies accountable to the public.   But I want to make it clear that this provision will only give  presidents greater control over independent agencies and will create  needless uncertainty in the decision-making process of independent  regulatory agencies.   It is also unclear how reducing the independence of these agencies  addresses unfunded mandates. Instead, it is clear that the real goal is  simply to undermine their independence. For these reasons, I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment and remove this harmful provision.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
