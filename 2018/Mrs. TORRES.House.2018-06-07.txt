 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this rule makes 39 amendments in order to the  appropriations bill we have been considering this week.   Unfortunately, this appropriations package is made up of three  individual appropriations bills. Also, in what is a surprise to us in  the minority, this rule also includes a surprising $15 billion in  rescissions--cuts--to programs our communities depend on.   Why aren't we given the opportunity to bring up these bills  individually? Considering that nearly 200 amendments were offered to  this package while many of us were working in our districts, it is  obvious to me that these bills would have benefited from a longer  debate.   This rule makes in order 39 amendments to the underlying package,  which includes H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water Development and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019; H.R. 5894, the Legislative Branch  Appropriations Act of 2019; and H.R. 5786, the Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019.   However, 59 additional amendments will not be given an opportunity to  be heard, including bipartisan amendments like the Cicilline-Poliquin  amendment to prohibit oil drilling on the Atlantic Outer Continental  Shelf or the Foster-Hultgren amendment to increase funding for the  Department of Energy's Office of Science or the Issa-Roybal-Allard  amendment to support programs that improve veteran access to care at  qualified health centers. Don't these distinguished Members of this  body deserve to have their amendments discussed, debated, and voted on?   This rule also makes in order H.R. 3, the GOP rescission package. Mr.  Speaker, this bill has not received a single hearing--not one. This was  a last-minute addition which gave no time for amendments to be  considered.   The closed rule, which is how the rescissions package comes to the  floor, pushes this Congress further into the record books as the most  closed Congress in history.   Before I speak more on that, I do want to take a brief moment to  highlight the bipartisan manner in which the appropriators acted in  crafting the Military Construction and Legislative Branch bills. This  is proof that, when this body wants to, we can work together and  produce legislation that results in broad, bipartisan consensus.   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill provides a $4.17  billion increase to the servicemembers we represent--specifically, a  $3.9 billion increase to the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Legislative Branch bill takes more steps we should have taken a  long time ago and provides additional resources for training and to  help with complaints on sexual harassment and violations of employee  rights. None of us here are immune to harassers, but at least this bill  moves us forward in addressing the bad behaviors of those who walk  among us.   This rule makes in order amendments to the Energy and Water  appropriations bill. However, this bill does not follow the same  bipartisan path. Instead, this bill is full of poison pill riders that  will ultimately make our time here a total waste, as those poison pill  riders mean that the Senate will ignore this package as it is written.   Incredibly, when most Americans are asking Congress to make  commonsense improvements to our Nation's gun laws, this bill goes in  the opposite direction. That is right. This Congress is finally acting  on guns--in a cowardly way, by expanding where guns can be brought onto  Federal lands, ignoring the cries and the calls from our children--our  children who are being murdered in their classrooms, our constituents  who are being murdered in movie theaters, our constituents who are  being murdered in concert halls in Las Vegas, Nevada, where people go  to get married, where people go to have fun, and, yes, they make babies  sometimes in Vegas too. But yet we are ignoring their calls for help.                                time  1300    It is amazing that we can go on months without meaningful reforms on  gun violence and now we take up a giant spending package that forces  Members to vote on yet another expansion of gun access. What are we  trying to do?   Again, a cowardice act to expand the use of weapons in our Federal  lands. For what? So we can go into the dens of bears and kill them--the  momma bears and the baby bears--while they are sleeping?   That is what we are doing in this Congress.   Perhaps that wouldn't be such a problem if we had a single open rule  on the House floor that would allow the House to work its will on this  or any other issue Members have with portions of this legislation.   Finally, this rule makes in order H.R. 3, President Trump's and the  GOP's rescissions bill. As I mentioned before, this bill saw no  hearings. Zero.   But perhaps just as troubling was Ranking Member Lowey's remarks in  our Rules Committee hearing last night about how the minority wasn't  even consulted prior to this bill coming to the floor, ignoring the  thousands of constituents that we represent. So, not only has this bill  skipped the normal appropriations process, Democrats have not been  given an opportunity to add the voice of their constituents.   Make no mistake, this is a highly partisan bill which does not  reflect the House's will. Instead, this is what our constituents hate  the most: a Congress that is most dysfunctional.   This bill makes significant cuts to programs that create jobs, grow  our economy, and provide healthcare to millions of children in a  transparent attempt to appear fiscally conservative after passing a tax  bill that added $1.9 trillion to the deficit and gave most of its  benefit to the wealthiest among us.   If we want to rescind something to balance the deficit, how about we  start with the $1 trillion budget-busting tax bill that was passed for  the wealthy. That irresponsible law is now the cause of Medicare and  Social Security going bankrupt decades earlier.   This bill is a political gimmick to hide the Republican majority's  gross mismanagement of our Nation's long-term fiscal health. While the  GOP tax giveaway benefited the wealthiest among us, almost half of the  cuts in this rescissions package are to the Children's Health Insurance  Program. Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker: the Children's Health  Insurance Program.   We have $7 billion eliminated from CHIP. That is right. They didn't  blink an eye at a $2 trillion giveaway to the wealthy, but yet they are  squeezing fractional savings from funds intended for children's health  insurance.   But that isn't the end of it. So that corporations and millionaires  can have a tax break, the House majority has decided to make a  collection of cuts that will impact every community: Cuts to economic  development; cuts to the Forest Service while the West of America is  burning; cuts to Indian housing programs, cuts to foreign assistance;  cuts to transportation while our infrastructure is crumbling; cuts to  public housing while the growing number of Americans grow homeless;  cuts to conservation; and cuts to advanced technology vehicle loans.   What is it that you want to do? Do you want to take us back to the  time of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble?  [[Page H4865]]    I know that my Republican colleagues will say that they aren't cuts  because the funding can't be used, but no Federal agencies were asked  if they needed a waiver to utilize this funding where they need it the  most. I doubt that my colleagues will say they couldn't use this in  their communities.   Well, let me put these cuts in the voice of the Great Gazoo: those  cuts are dumb and dumber cuts.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I must strongly oppose this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to allow the rewriting  of history. The majority has blocked over 2,000 amendments, and it is  only June.   Mr. Speaker, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  Appropriations Act would shortchange our veterans by subjecting funding  for their healthcare programs to onerous budget restraints. This would  force funding for veterans healthcare to compete with other important  veterans programs.   Therefore, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to include Representative Lamb's legislation,  H.R. 5805, to fix the VA Choice budget shortfall and Representative  Carter's amendment to MILCON-VA which includes more funds for vital  veteran healthcare initiatives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Lamb) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text  of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have no doubt of the importance of the legislation this rule makes  in order. However, I struggle to believe that this is the most  important work we could be doing today.   Instead, perhaps we can fix the broken immigration laws that  President Trump has cited as his reason for separating families and  children on our Nation's border. Fear and intimidation are no way to  make policy. The Trump administration has picked the cruelest way to  punish those who are fleeing violence.   The result is broken families and lost children. Since October, more  than 700 children have been inhumanely separated from their parents.  More than 100 of these children are less than 4 years old.   Using family separation as a scare tactic to prevent families from  coming to this country will never work, and it is in the same cruel  mindset as using rape as a weapon of war. These families come here  looking for one thing: shelter. Punishing a mother by separating her  from her child is not only immoral; it is inhumane. It goes against the  fundamental human right of the family unit.   Separating them from their parents is simply anti-American. However,  for some reason, President Trump has repeatedly said that he is bound  by the law to rip these families apart.                                time  1330                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, what is the law requiring the separation of  parents and children at the border?    Mr. Speaker, perhaps the reason the Speaker can't answer  is that the law simply doesn't exist. However, this is the United  States Congress. We make the laws. But unfortunately, this isn't what  we are doing here. No. Instead, we are taking up a bill to put more  guns on public lands and cut funding for energy efficiency research.  For this reason and many other concerns I have with the number of  amendments which were not made in order, I must oppose this rule.   This Congress is now the most closed Congress in history. It is  forcing its Members to vote on bills which haven't been given a real  debate. It is clear the majority is attempting to rewrite history.   Mr. Speaker, Canada did not burn the White House. The American people  know better. None of the work we do today will undo their deficit- busting bill, nor will it reunite the families the administration has  destroyed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment No. 20 to  division C of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.   This amendment is meant to address an issue we have in Ontario,  California. However, I expect many of the Members of this body have  experienced it in their own districts at some point.   In the Rules Committee hearing last night, I referred to this  amendment as giving the Secretary of Defense the ability to finish the  job, and that is precisely what we should expect from our service  branches when they close military bases in our districts during BRAC  rounds.   Ontario International Airport was the Ontario Air National Guard  Station, which was established in 1949. This facility remained in  operation for decades, assisting training and support for the Korean,  Vietnam, and countless other wars and conflicts.   In 1997, the facility was closed as part of the latest Base  Realignment and Closure process. This meant our Armed Services moved  out. But instead of the airport being able to use the newly vacant  land, the old site has sat largely unchanged for 20 years due to the  environmental hazards of demolition.   When military bases are closed, it can be devastating to our local  communities. At the very least, we should expect our service branches  to leave our communities in as good or better shape than they found  them.   In Ontario, California, old Air Force facilities have been left  standing at the Ontario International Airport. These abandoned  buildings have been overtaken by nature and look like the remains of a  lost civilization, with trees and animals roaming free at the remaining  site. This valuable but currently unusable space is hindering the  growth of the Ontario Airport, and communities around Ontario depend on  the airport.   My amendment would simply direct the Secretary to make available  funds from the existing BRAC funding made available in this legislation  to remove these old facilities.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill has funding for BRAC  closures. Before we proceed with any new closures, let's finish the job  on the old closures.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.
