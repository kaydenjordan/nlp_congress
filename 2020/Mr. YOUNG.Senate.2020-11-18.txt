 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote.    Madam President, in the Marine Corps, we have a motto:  Semper Fidelis. It means ``always faithful''--always faithful to our  Nation and to the brave patriots who have honorably served it.   Just last week, we recognized a day that is very special to me and I  think to all Americans--Veterans Day. On this important occasion, we  say thank you to our veterans, to those who have worn the uniform for  their courage and for their commitment to protecting our freedoms and  preserving our very way of life.   Their service, of course, should be an example to all of us. I try to  instill this in my children. It is something I discuss at school groups  oftentimes, encouraging people to think about maybe spending some time  in military service or finding other ways to serve their fellow  Americans.   Our veterans help keep us safe during times of great uncertainty and  unease--something all of us, I think, appreciate a little bit more  during this trying year.   The month of November also marks Military Family Appreciation Month.  Our military families don't always get the credit they deserve, but  they bear a very special and unique burden on behalf of our country  that, frankly, most of us cannot fully understand. They sacrifice their  peace of mind and their well-being on behalf of their neighbors, their  communities, and their fellow Americans, people they have never met-- What could be more beautiful than that?--because they believe in this  Nation and they believe in this country and the values that undergird  it.   Even though we can't begin to repay the sacrifices they make on our  behalf,  [[Page S7059]]  we can honor them, and we can express our gratitude. So this  Thanksgiving season, this time for counting our blessings and  celebrating how many of them we enjoy even amidst this global pandemic,  may we remember all that we are thankful for--every bit of it--and who  we are thankful for, as well--yes, our family members, our neighbors,  and our close friends, but I personally am thankful for our Active-Duty  servicemembers. I am thankful for Indiana's more than 400,000 veterans.  I am thankful for their selfless families.   I hope all Americans will join me today, this month, this  Thanksgiving, and every day thereafter and reflect on these men and  women, the fellow Americans who sacrifice so much on behalf of all of  us. Our country simply would not be the same without them; it arguably  wouldn't exist without the families who are prepared to sacrifice so  much.   So God bless our Active-Duty servicemembers, God bless our veterans,  and God bless our military families, and may God continue to bless this  great country, the United States of America.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent but had I been  present would have voted yes on rollcall vote 225, motion to invoke  cloture on the nomination of James Ray Knepp II, to be a United States  District Court Judge for the Northern District of Ohio.   It was necessarily absent but had I been present would have voted yes  on rollcall vote 226, on the nomination of James Ray Knepp II, to be a  United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Ohio.                            ____________________
