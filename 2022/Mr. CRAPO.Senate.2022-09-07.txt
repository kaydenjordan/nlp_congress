 Madam President, I honor the Idaho Hometown Hero  Awards for highlighting the spirit of philanthropy in communities  across our great State of Idaho. The award pays tribute to commitment  to improving communities across Idaho, while continuing to preserve and  promote the richness of our State and create a better world for all of  us in the future.   Doctors Fahim and Naeem Rahim, of Pocatello, ID, established the  Idaho Hometown Hero medal in 2011 to spotlight Idahoans who are  extraordinarily dedicated to hard work, self-improvement, and community  service. The Hometown Hero Award's mission statement focuses on  recognizing those who:         ``Exemplify a life dedicated to the Idaho way of hard work,       self-improvement, and community service.        Embody the spirit of philanthropy while showing remarkable       commitment in both their personal and professional lives to       improving communities across the State of Idaho.        Preserve, celebrate, and promote the richness of history,       tradition, and values of our great state while working to       create a better world for all of us in the future by the work       they do today.        Share gifts with the community to boost recognition of the       great State of Idaho.''    The Hometown Hero Medal highlights that Idaho is an incredible place,  but it is the people of Idaho who make it a great State. I could not  agree more. Thank you to the Rahims, the award's committee members, the  volunteers, and other organizations for drawing attention to good works  in our communities.                            ____________________
