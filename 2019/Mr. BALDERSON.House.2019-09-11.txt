 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this body's  consideration of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the  USMCA, which has the support of both of our neighboring nations; the  majority of our Nation's Governors, including Ohio's Governor Mike  DeWine; more than 600 trade group organizations across the Nation; our  current administration; a significant number of my colleagues both in  the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate; and myself.   The USMCA will support tens of millions of jobs across the United  States. In my home State of Ohio, more than 428,000 jobs are supported  by trade with Canada and Mexico.   The livelihood of my constituents is directly impacted by the success  of trade with our neighboring nations. Last year, nearly $28 billion  worth of goods and services were exported from my home State of Ohio to  Canada and Mexico.                                time  1900    These exports consist of iron, steel, motor vehicle parts, and  machinery, much of which come from my district in central Ohio.   Ohio is also the 12th largest agricultural exporting State. USMCA  will make important improvements to secure greater market access for  our farmers and will ensure the fair treatment of Ohio's agriculture  products in the marketplace.   With $28 billion in economic value and 428,000 Ohio jobs on the line,  we simply cannot afford for the USMCA to fail. It is time to pass USMCA  now.  [[Page H7660]]
