 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, February 2, 2022.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       As you know, despite our collective efforts to encourage       Members to vote on the Senate floor in a timely manner, votes       are often left open well beyond the allotted time,       frustrating a majority of Members from both sides of the       aisle. Often, the outcome of the vote is not in doubt.        With this in mind and in order to expedite floor votes, we       are instructing the Presiding Officer to close any vote in       which: (a) one of the signatories below is the last remaining       vote; and (b) the Member's vote would not change the outcome.       However, on any particular vote, if a signatory requests that       the vote be held open, they may do so by providing notice to       their Cloakroom.            Sincerely,          Thom Tillis, Angus S. King, Jr., Christopher A. Coons,             Roy Blunt, Shelley Moore Capito, Patrick J. Leahy,             Kyrsten Sinema, Jon Tester, Ron Johnson, Amy Klobuchar,             Jon Ossoff, John Barrasso, Patty Murray, Sheldon             Whitehouse, Rick Scott.          Mark R.
