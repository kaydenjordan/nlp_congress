 Madam Speaker, the biggest tax increase for small  business in over 50 years--let me say it  [[Page H6109]]  again--the biggest tax increase for small business in over 50 years.  This is what President Biden and my colleagues across the aisle are  proposing in order to pay for part of their multi-trillion-dollar  spending package.   The President and the Democrats have proposed a range of options that  will hurt economic growth and fall on the backs of small businesses,  like raising the corporate tax, raising the individual tax rates,  taxing unrealized capital gains, and giving the IRS authority to spy on  Americans' bank accounts.   In announcing the tax increases, the Biden administration said their  agenda: ``Will protect 97 percent of small business owners from tax  increases, while delivering tax cuts to more than 3.9 million  entrepreneurs.''   But here is the problem. It doesn't add up. The statement doesn't add  up. It doesn't hold up to the scrutiny. The reality is that  approximately 1.4 million small businesses are structured as C  corporations, meaning that they will be subjected to the proposed 28  percent corporate tax rate, as opposed to the current rate of 21  percent.    Let's talk about S corps. If you are not familiar with the S corp or  the LLC, an individual small business owner's taxes flow through the S  corp. So what is going to happen? They are going to increase the  individual tax rate. What will that mean? S corps and LLCs will see an  increase in the amount of taxes that they are paying.   Add in, as my other colleagues have already brought up this evening  on Special Orders, rising inflation rates, increased cost of goods and  services, shipping delays, labor shortages, and these small businesses  will find themselves in a hole. They are trying to jump start  themselves right now out of a pandemic, and we are going to tax them  more? It makes absolutely no sense.   For nearly a decade, I was the owner of a small business. If you  would have told me in 1990, when I started my small business, that I  would be facing labor shortages, tax increases, and supply delays,  guess what? I wouldn't have started a small business. You would be out  of your mind to start a small business under those types of  circumstances.   And guess what? We are seeing that happen in my home State of  Wisconsin. The restaurant industry, gyms, manufacturers, construction  companies, they are all struggling right now. If you are back in the  district and you are talking to people and you are at a chamber meeting  or you are at some type of specific association related to an industry,  they will continue to tell you we are in trouble. Yet, the Biden  administration and the Democrats are looking at tax increases on these  small businesses.   We must give small businesses a chance to succeed. This trillion- dollar reconciliation package and the subsequent tax increases do just  the opposite.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly want to save  small businesses, they will drop the spending plan, cut taxes for small  businesses, replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and drop the  arbitrary vaccine mandate. That is what would get employees back to  work.   These small-business owners deserve an opportunity to chase the  American Dream. As it stands, this reconciliation package will take  that opportunity away from them.                                time  1830
