 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 297) to require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a  study on the establishment of, and the potential land that could be  included in, a unit of the National Forest System in the State of  Hawaii, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 297         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 297, sponsored by my  Committee on Natural Resources' colleague, Representative Ed Case of  Hawaii.   Madam Speaker, this legislation would require the Secretary of  Agriculture, in coordination with the Hawaii Department of Land and  Natural Resources, to conduct a study to identify lands in the State of  Hawaii that merit inclusion in the National Forest System.   Hawaii is one of the most ecologically diverse places in the world,  home to 10 of the 13 world climate zones, with ecosystems ranging from  the deserts to tropics, where plants and animals that found their way  to Hawaii evolved like nowhere else. The study would consider how a  Hawaii national forest could contribute to the conservation of this  biodiversity not found elsewhere in the National Forest System.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 297 provides the first step in establishing a  national forest in Hawaii and a basis for bringing together local  stakeholders to move forward the conversation on how to responsibly  establish a national forest in Hawaii that benefits both Hawaii's  island communities as well as the National Forest Service.   Madam Speaker, as we continue to work towards the Biden  administration's effort to protect 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters  by 2030, and identify solutions to our climate and biodiversity crises,  I hope we can all see the value in taking this step towards protecting  Hawaii's unique forest resources and its native species.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his positive  comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr.  Case).    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Westerman  from Arkansas, for his positive comments and bipartisan spirit, and I  thank Mr. Case.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 49) to designate the National Pulse Memorial located at 1912  South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 49         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL PULSE MEMORIAL.         (a) In General.--The Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South       Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, is designated as the       ``National Pulse Memorial''.        (b) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial       designated by this section is not a unit of the National Park       System and the designation of the National Pulse Memorial       shall not require or permit Federal funds to be expended for       any purpose related to that national memorial.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise, along with Representative Demings and  Representative Murphy from central Florida, in strong support of our  bill, H.R. 49.   Nearly 5 years ago, 49 angels lost their lives and 53 others were  injured when a deranged gunman opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in  Orlando, Florida.   You can see here photos of those who we lost, lives cut short.   This horrific act of hate and terror against our LGBTQ and Latino  community, African-American community, and Anglo community could have  divided us, but we came together stronger than ever before.   Orlando swore as a community to never forget those we lost that  night. Their stories, their images, their memories, and their spirits  must live on in our hearts.   We were all there for vigils in Orlando, where the bell rang 49 times  for those angels we lost, and I am honored to say, across this Nation  and all 50 States, and many countries, we saw vigils also recognizing  it, which is why it is so critical that this is a national memorial,  because it was truly a national and international tragedy.   To honor the fallen and survivors of this tragedy, I join my  colleagues to introduce landmark legislation to designate the Pulse  nightclub as a federally recognized national memorial site. This  designation as a nonaffiliated National Park Service national memorial  would not require Federal funds, but it would honor the 49 lives taken  on June 12, 2016, as well as the survivors, the first responders who so  heroically came to the rescue of so many others, and the entire central  Florida community.   Together, we will open minds and hearts. We will make the Pulse  Memorial a national symbol of hope, love, and change.   I would like to, again, thank my amazing colleagues, Congresswoman  Val Demings and Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, for joining me in  leading this important legislation, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Westerman  from Arkansas, for his bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, Chair  Takano, for taking the pilgrimage to the Pulse Memorial, along with me  and others and listening and paying respects. So I appreciate that.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline) for making the pilgrimage and paying his respects at the  memorial.   Madam Speaker, at this time, I have no further requests for time, and  I would inquire whether my colleague has any remaining speakers on his  side.    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and our colleagues across the aisle for  their bipartisan support of this really important bill for our Nation.  I thank also Representatives Demings, Murphy, Cicilline, and Takano for  their support here today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 478) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to take certain  land located in Pinal County, Arizona, into trust for the benefit of  the Gila River Indian Community, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 478         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Blackwater Trading Post Land       Transfer Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Blackwater trading post land.--The term ``Blackwater       Trading Post Land'' means the approximately 55.3 acres of       land as depicted on the map that--        (A) is located in Pinal County, Arizona, and bordered by       Community land to the east, west, and north and State Highway       87 to the south; and        (B) is owned by the Community.        (2) Community.--The term ``Community'' means the Gila River       Indian Community of the Reservation.  [[Page H2221]]         (3) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled ``Results       of Survey, Ellis Property, A Portion of the West \1/2\ of       Section 12, Township 5 South, Range 7 East, Gila and Salt       River Meridian, Pinal County, Arizona'' and dated October 15,       2012.        (4) Reservation.--The term ``Reservation'' means the land       located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation       created under sections 3 and 4 of the Act of February 28,       1859 (11 Stat. 401, chapter LXVI), and Executive orders of       August 31, 1876, June 14, 1879, May 5, 1882, November 15,       1883, July 31, 1911, June 2, 1913, August 27, 1914, and July       19, 1915, and any other lands placed in trust for the benefit       of the Community.        (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. LAND TAKEN INTO TRUST FOR BENEFIT OF THE GILA RIVER                     INDIAN COMMUNITY.         (a) In General.--The Secretary shall take the Blackwater       Trading Post land into trust for the benefit of the       Community, after the Community--        (1) conveys to the Secretary all right, title, and interest       of the Community in and to the Blackwater Trading Post Land;        (2) submits to the Secretary a request to take the       Blackwater Trading Post Land into trust for the benefit of       the Community;        (3) conducts a survey (to the satisfaction of the       Secretary) to determine the exact acreage and legal       description of the Blackwater Trading Post Land, if the       Secretary determines a survey is necessary; and        (4) pays all costs of any survey conducted under paragraph       (3).        (b) Availability of Map.--Not later than 180 days after the       Blackwater Trading Post Land is taken into trust under       subsection (a), the map shall be on file and available for       public inspection in the appropriate offices of the       Secretary.        (c) Lands Taken Into Trust Part of Reservation.--After the       date on which the Blackwater Trading Post Land is taken into       trust under subsection (a), the land shall be treated as part       of the Reservation.        (d) Gaming.--Class II and class III gaming under the Indian       Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) shall not be       allowed at any time on the land taken into trust under       subsection (a).

The description       shall, on publication, constitute the official description of       the Blackwater Trading Post Land.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 478, introduced by our colleague, Representative    Tom O'Halleran from Arizona, authorizes the United States to place  55.3 acres of historically and culturally significant land into trust  on behalf of the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona.   This parcel of land is commonly referred to as the Blackwater Trading  Post Land, because it once contained the Ellis family's Blackwater  Trading Post which sold goods to members of the Gila River Indian  Community since the 1930s.   After purchasing the trading post in 2010, the community found around  1,000 cultural artifacts on the property, including 126 Akimel O'odham  baskets. Following this discovery, the community decided to apply to  take the parcel of land into trust.   However, legislation is required for this exchange, as the  community's 2004 water settlement explicitly requires that any lands  located outside of the community's reservation boundaries be taken into  trust through congressional action.   Passage of H.R. 478 will ultimately allow the community to preserve a  piece of their heritage by incorporating this contiguous parcel of land  into its reservation land base.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative O'Halleran for his work  on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    In closing, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation for the Gila River Community of Arizona, as corrected.  I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) who knows the State  very well.   I urge support of the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona's  incorporation of this additional land. I thank Representative  O'Halleran for his leadership and the bipartisan support of the ranking  member, Mr. Westerman from Arkansas.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 810) to amend the National Trails System Act to direct the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the feasibility of  designating the Chief Standing Bear National Historic Trail, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 810         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CHIEF STANDING BEAR NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL                     FEASIBILITY STUDY.         Section 5(c) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C.       1244(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(xx) Chief standing bear national historic trail.--The       Chief Standing Bear Trail, extending approximately 550 miles       from Niobrara, Nebraska, to Ponca City, Oklahoma, which       follows the route taken by Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca       people during Federal Indian removal, and approximately 550       miles from Ponca City, Oklahoma, through Omaha, Nebraska, to       Niobrara, Nebraska, which follows the return route taken by       Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 810, introduced by Representative Fortenberry  from Nebraska, would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  study on the feasibility of designating the Chief Standing Bear  National Historic Trail.  [[Page H2222]]    The proposed trail would extend approximately 550 miles from  Niobrara, Nebraska, to Ponca City, Oklahoma, tracing the route taken by  Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people during Federal Indian removal  and their return to Nebraska.   The trail would commemorate and elevate the story of Chief Standing  Bear, including the trial and historic 1879 court case where he became  the first Native American to be recognized as a person in a Federal  court.   The trail would memorialize the courage, honor, and fortitude of  Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people as they struggled to return to  their homeland to bury the son of Chief Standing Bear--serving as a  reminder of their fight to achieve justice, freedom, and equality.   I would like to thank Representative Fortenberry for championing this  important legislation and for his efforts to bring about a greater  understanding of our U.S. history and Tribal sovereignty.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I wholly support this bill, and I thank the  leadership of Mr. Fortenberry from Nebraska and the ranking member, Mr.  Westerman from Arkansas.   This is a fitting honor for human rights and Tribal sovereignty. I  urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1688) to amend the Indian Child Protection and Family  Violence Prevention Act.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1688         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Child       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. INDIAN CHILD PROTECTION AND FAMILY VIOLENCE                     PREVENTION ACT AMENDMENTS.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1688, introduced by Representative Ruben Gallego  from Arizona, our outgoing subcommittee chairman--and I appreciate his  leadership on that--amends and reauthorizes several programs within the  Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act in order to  improve the prevention, investigation, treatment, and prosecution of  family violence, child abuse, and child neglect involving Native  American children and families.   There is an enormous need for family violence prevention and  treatment resources in Tribal communities. Native children experience  child abuse and neglect at an elevated rate, which leads many to  require special education services, to be more likely to be involved in  the juvenile and criminal justice systems, and to have long-term mental  health needs.   Passage of H.R. 1688 will create technical assistance programs in the  Bureau of Indian Affairs, allow for urban Indian organizations to  partner with  [[Page H2224]]  Tribal governments, and ensure culturally competent care.   I thank Representative Gallego for introducing and championing this  vitally important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1688.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We had extensive hearings on these issues in the Subcommittee for  Indigenous Peoples of the United States, and it became clear we needed  resources and technical assistance to protect Native American children  and families in addition to what they are getting now.   I thank our outgoing chair, Mr. Gallego, for his leadership on this;  the dean of the House, Representative   Don Young, for his amazing  leadership in working together; former Member Cook, who participated in  these meetings extensively; as well as now-Secretary Deb Haaland, one  of the first Native American women to serve in the Congress. I thank  Ranking Member Westerman for helping us get this done in a bipartisan  fashion.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2208) to restore an opportunity for tribal economic  development on terms that are equal and fair, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2208         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and       Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas Equal and Fair Opportunity       Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT.         The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian       Tribes of Texas Restoration Act (Public Law 100-89; 101 Stat.       666) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 301. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preclude or       limit the applicability of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act       (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2208, introduced by Representative Veronica  Escobar from Texas, amends the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and  Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act of 1987 to clarify  that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act applies to both the Pueblo and  the Tribe.   The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas was federally terminated in  1954. This wrong was followed in 1968 by termination of the Ysleta del  Sur Pueblo, also known as the Tigua Tribe. Congress rightfully restored  both the Pueblo and the Tribe by enacting the aforementioned  Restoration Act of 1987.   The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted just one year later, in  1988. The framework that it created should have applied to both the  Pueblo and the Tribe, just as it did to every other Tribe.   However, since the Restoration Act was passed at a time when Indian  gaming was just emerging and Federal regulations had not yet been  implemented, it contains a section regarding gaming.   We know from the Congressional Record that the intent of this section  of the Restoration Act was to clarify Indian gaming policy at the time,  not to completely prohibit gaming on these lands in perpetuity.   But that is what is occurring. The language in the Restoration Act  has been used by the State of Texas to repeatedly stymie the Pueblo's  and the Tribe's ability to engage in class II gaming, much to the  detriment of the economic health and well-being of both the Pueblo and  the Tribe.   Additionally, the only other federally recognized Tribe in Texas, the  Kickapoo Traditional Tribe, is allowed to operate a class II gaming  facility, as they were restored by Congress in 1983, without any type  of gaming restrictions.   H.R. 2208 remedies this inequality by clarifying that the Pueblo and  the Tribe, like the Kickapoo, have the same rights and responsibilities  under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act as virtually every other  federally recognized Tribe in the United States.   This legislation confers no new or special rights to the Pueblo or  the Tribe, nor does it in any way limit the existing rights of the  State of Texas. This is simply a matter of parity and fairness, and I  urge adoption of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both Representative Escobar and Representative  Gonzales for their leadership to right this wrong, this injustice.   I thank the dean of the House, Representative Young, for his very  informative history lesson on the legislation. I also thank Ranking  Member Westerman for his bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
