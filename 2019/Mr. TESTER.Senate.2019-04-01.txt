 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize one of  Montana's smallest but greatest counties.   Treasure County in southcentral Montana celebrates its 100th  anniversary this year. ``Montana's Hidden Treasure,'' Treasure County  is bordered by the Yellowstone River and contains rolling hills,  pastures, and sugar beet farms.   It is also home to some of Montana's most unique buildings, including  the Yucca Theatre in Hysham, a 1931 Spanish Mission-style beauty that  David and Jim Manning built to give residents hope during the Great  Depression.   The folks in Treasure County are used to fighting for recognition. At  the time of its inception, neighboring counties thought the citizens  were trying to syphon tax revenue from larger counties surrounding it.   But the residents of Treasure County were adamant their county be  recognized, and in 1919, Hysham was named the county seat.   Since, Treasure County has been home to thousands of farmers,  ranchers, Montana's longest serving legislator, and even NASA astronaut  Frank Borman, as well as the deer, antelope, pheasants, geese, turkeys,  grouse, sage hens, and ducks that have called this area home for  millennia and that add to the natural splendor of this beautiful place.   I wish to honor Treasure County and all its people, to congratulate  them on 100 great years. I know the next 100 will be even  better.                            ____________________
