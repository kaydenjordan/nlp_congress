 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to begin with, the resolution that is presented before  us is 100 percent accurate, and I completely agree with it.   We have had uncertain funding for going on almost 8 years now for the  Department of Defense. It has been a series of continuing resolutions,  two government shutdowns, multiple threatened government shutdowns, and  an unbelievable amount of uncertainty. From one month to the next, the  Pentagon does not know how much money they have to spend. That  uncertainty, without a doubt, has undermined our ability to provide an  adequate national security for this country.   So I agree with the maker of this motion that budget certainty would  help enormously in terms of preparing our national security--well,  preparing the men and women in our Armed Forces to face the threats  that are in front of us. Beyond that, there was a lot said in the  opening remarks there that I don't quite agree with.   Also, it is really important to sort of understand the context. Why  are we in this situation? Why do we have budget uncertainty year after  year?   I don't agree that it is simple incompetence or Congress just isn't  feeling like doing its job. We have deep-seated differences of opinion  about where to spend our money, and also, we have no fiscal policy as a  country.   Well, that is not true, actually. Our fiscal policy is really rather  clear. We want a balanced budget; we want tax cuts; and we don't want  to cut spending.    Everything you need to know about why we have this problem can be  contained in three votes that the United States House of  Representatives took over the course of about a 4-month period. As I  tell you about these three votes, I want you to know that 134  Republican Members of Congress voted for all three of these things.   Number one, a roughly $2 trillion tax cut. Number two, a budget deal  that increased spending by $500 billion. Some of that was for defense;  a lot of it wasn't. Then, in the ultimate irony, a week later, those  134 Members of Congress, Republican Members of Congress, voted for a  constitutional amendment to balance the budget. They want to cut taxes  by $2 trillion; they want to increase spending by $500 billion; and  they want a balanced budget.   And, oh, by the way, we are roughly $22 trillion in debt and running  up a deficit that is projected to go up over $1 trillion going forward.  That is not a responsible fiscal policy.   Now, I serve on the Armed Services Committee with all of my  colleagues who are here today, and I hear the same things that  Congresswoman Cheney hears about how our military is suffering under  the uncertainty.   The readiness crisis is 100 percent real. It is getting better as we  have gotten some funding the last couple years, but it is still a major  challenge. But the reason for all of that is because of decisions that  are made on the front end. You can't cut taxes by $2 trillion--after,  by the way, over the course of the 15 years prior, we had already cut  them by multiple trillion dollars--and then stand up and say DOD  doesn't have enough money. You cut revenue and then complained that you  don't have enough revenue. It doesn't really make sense.   The second point that I would make is it is not just the Department  of Defense that is suffering under budget uncertainty. There are a  whole bunch of different examples. I won't go into all of them, but the  entire discretionary budget suffers under this uncertainty. And one big  chunk of the discretionary budget is infrastructure, the bridges and  roads and airports and a whole bunch of other things that basically  enable our economy to function, which generates revenue and helps pay  for things like national security.   Also, we have got bridges collapsing all over the country. There are,  literally, United States citizens who have died as a result of our lack  of investment in infrastructure.   So it is not just the Department of Defense. If we are going to  address the uncertainty, if we are going to address the problems with  dealing with our national security strategy, we have to address fiscal  policy.   For going on 8 years now, we have been having this conversation in  the Armed Services Committee, and most times my Republican colleagues  sternly rebuke me for raising issues that are supposedly not directly  related to the Armed Services, saying: We are the Armed Services  Committee. We are not here to talk about the debt or the deficit or  infrastructure or any of that other stuff.   Well, it all goes together, and what we as a congressional body have  to do is come up with a plan that actually makes sense, that actually  there is money for. If we do that, then we can have the stability for  the Department of Defense.   Now, I will tell you, if we are $22 trillion in debt--and the deficit  is projected to be pretty close to $1 trillion this year and quickly  north of $1 trillion going forward--we are going to have to deal with  that problem or there is not going to be as much money as we'd like for  defense or infrastructure or education--or anything, for that matter.   So we have to address the fiscal irresponsibility of our budgeting  process across the very long period of time, and certainly we can't  keep cutting taxes.   Now, as far as what does that National Security Strategy look like,  as was described, we face an incredibly complex threat environment. I  agree with that.   I don't agree that getting rid of the Iran nuclear deal so that Iran  can pursue nuclear weapons with absolutely no inhibition whatsoever is  a step forward in the right direction, nor do I agree that sitting down  with Kim Jong-un and agreeing, basically, to back off of a whole bunch  of things and getting nothing in return--I know that, in the  President's mind, North Korea is denuclearized, but they are not. They  haven't taken a single, solitary step in that direction.   Lastly, the final point I want to make is the complex threat  environment that we face is extraordinarily difficult. I will tell you  one thing of which I am 100 percent confident. There is no way that, on  our own, the United States of America can confront that threat  environment.   We need allies. We need friends. We need countries that are willing  to work with us to meet the national security threats that we face,  which is why the trip that the President just took is so troubling. He  spent the first part of it telling our allies, basically--sorry, I  can't say that on the floor--just saying that he didn't need them,  insulting them over and over and over again, allies that we are really  going to need to meet the threats not just from Russia, but China, the  terrorism threat that was described.   Our NATO allies are going to be crucially important to that, and the  President, at one point, said he's not even sure why we are in NATO,  insulted the EU and insulted all of our allies, and then turned right  around and sided with Vladimir Putin against our intelligence  communities, against our Justice Department, on the subject of Russian  interference in our election.   So, in a complex threat environment, you don't want to make it easier  for a country like Russia that threatens us and make it more difficult  for countries ranging from Canada to Germany to Great Britain, who  actually want to work with us, to meet that threat environment. So, on  that point, we need more allies, and we certainly don't need to take  the side of a dictator who  [[Page H6288]]  is threatening our country over our own intelligence agencies. That is  not in the best interest of national security.    Overall, we have to have a fiscal policy. We can have the argument  about the defense budget all we want, but if we keep cutting taxes and  have no policy whatsoever to get our budget even close to under  control, we are not going to have the money to spend on our national  security needs or other things.   Now, I will close it out with this. General Mattis, Secretary Mattis,  likes to say, ``We can afford survival.'' That is a nice phrase.  Unfortunately, it is a little bit unclear on what it means because,  what do you have to spend to survive? By and large, DOD doesn't engage  in that sort of black-and-white way of looking at it: We spend this  money, we survive; we don't spend this money, we die.   What they do, and what they've said over and over again, is they  manage risk: If we don't spend the money here, that increases the risk  by this amount.   I think that is a better way of looking at it. It is not a matter of  whether or not we can afford survival, because we don't know exactly  what China is going to do or Russia or any of these other folks are  going to do or how we are going to manage it. It is a matter of  managing risk.   It is very true that, if we continue to have an uncertain defense  budget--heck, I would submit, if we continue to have an uncertain  fiscal policy and an uncertain infrastructure budget, we are increasing  the risk of our country's ability not so much to survive but to prosper  and live in a peaceful world.   So this resolution is fine. It is horribly insufficient to actually  give us the certainty and predictability in our budget that we need. To  get there, we need to honestly address the fiscal challenges that our  Nation faces and come up with a coherent fiscal policy that takes into  account all the needs of our country in a balanced and coherent way so  that we manage those risks in the best way possible and in the best  interests of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume  [[Page H6289]]    Mr. Speaker, just a couple of quick points. The Department of Defense  budget is 18 percent of the overall Federal budget, and you would be a  pretty bad businessperson if you looked at your books and said that a  thing that takes 18 percent of the budget has nothing do with the  deficit. It all adds up piece by piece. It absolutely is a big part of  what contributes to us having a deficit and a debt, so we cannot ignore  what we spend on Defense and how it impacts everything else.   Now, you can make that policy decision that, you know, defense is  just so much more important than infrastructure or healthcare or  education or Social Security or Medicare or whatever, but to say that  it doesn't impact the debt and the deficit is not, well, fiscally  accurate.   And second, as far as tax cuts are concerned, yes, President Obama  cut taxes repeatedly and by way, way too much and contributed to this  problem. Most notably was in 2012 with the permanent extension of all  of the Bush tax cuts. So, we did that, and then with the stimulus  package back in 2009, there was about a $400 billion tax cut.   We have repeatedly, in this Congress--and I didn't vote for any of  that. We have repeatedly in this Congress prioritized tax cuts over the  men and women who serve in the military. That is what I find so ironic.  We hear all these complaints about how we are underfunding the  military, the complaints about readiness, and what the gentleman from  Alabama said, when he talked about the impact that this is having on  the men and women who serve, he is absolutely right. The continuing  resolutions are devastating to the way we try to function within the  Department of Defense.   I will again submit that they are also devastating to every other  aspect of our discretionary budget, and that should not be ignored. But  to cut taxes by trillions upon trillions of dollars and then look up  and say, Gosh, how come we don't have enough revenue to fund our  defense is hypocritical.   All I am asking is: Make a choice. If, in fact, we need to spend the  amount of money on DOD that you are all saying we are, then let's raise  the revenue and pay for it, okay. That is fine. That is a choice. But  to both say, we are going to give away massive tax cuts primarily to  the wealthiest people in this country, who, by the way, have been doing  quite well for quite some time, and then come up and say, Gosh, it is  just so irresponsible that we are not funding defense, that is not  consistent and it is not a fiscal policy.   And, again, I will come back to the fact that this is all very well  and good. I mean, what all these resolutions are saying is if we could  just pass the Defense Appropriations bill, then everything would be  fine. We have a $4 trillion plus budget. We have multiple layers of  problems here. If we do not address the underlying fiscal issues that  we are facing that I have described, then the men and women who serve  in our military will face the brutal uncertainty that is very  accurately described by my Republican colleagues over and over and over  again.   We have to address the underlying issue, not just come out and make  empty statements about how we want to support our men and women in the  military after putting in place a budget and a tax policy that makes it  next to impossible to do that. We have to deal with the issue up front  so that we are in a position to actually provide what my colleagues  have said we need to provide.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's motion. It is part of the  same discussion we had on the previous resolution, and I, as I said,  completely agree. The lack of certainty on the continuing resolutions  has negatively impacted the Department of Defense and our readiness.  There is absolutely no question about it. The only thing I would debate  today is: What is the best way to address that problem? How do we  honestly get at it?   These resolutions would suggest that if we simply fund defense and  ignore everything else, then we will be fine. I think the way we got  into this mess is instructive, and it is also going to be helpful in  terms of how we get out of this mess going forward.   It is worth noting, at the end of this, we talked a little bit about  tax cuts and how one thing doesn't have to do with the other. Tax cuts  do not increase revenue. If they did, we would have the easiest job in  the world. Also, a tax rate of zero would generate the most revenue for  the United States Government. Obviously, that is not true.   Now, it is true that tax policy, depending on how it is structured,  can be more encouraging to investment. But we have never had lower tax  rates on the Federal level than we have right now. After all of the  Bush tax cuts, as I mentioned the tax cuts under President Obama, and  now the tax cuts under President Trump, all of that has added up to a  massive decrease in our revenue, and that is part of the equation.   When President Bush put the tax cuts in place in 2001, for three  consecutive fiscal years after that, we had a real dollar decrease in  the amount of revenue that the Federal Government took in.   Now, I also understand that taxes are always a burden on the people  who have to pay them. If we are running government well, we are going  to try to keep those taxes as low as is humanly possible. But if we are  going to meet the needs of government, we have to raise revenue.   What we have heard today is a very, very compelling case for how,  over the course of the last decade, we haven't met the needs of  readiness within the Department of Defense. So, again, I simply urge us  to make a choice here. If we want to cover these costs, then let's  raise the revenue and pay for it, and not pretend with this fantasy  that somehow cutting the amount of revenue you take in is going to  increase the amount of revenue you are going to take in. It doesn't  work that way, and it certainly doesn't work in the current economic  environment.   The second thing I would say is, while national security is  critically important, it is not the only thing we do that is important.  And that is the other thing that worries me about this debate. We  massively slash revenue so we have less money to play around with, then  we make the case for why we need to massively increase our defense  budget, and everything else that the Federal Government does just sort  of drifts away as an afterthought.   There are a lot of examples of this. I used infrastructure in the  previous debate, and I will use a different example this time, the Fred  Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It is not in my district, but it is  just across the street from my district in Seattle, Washington.   It is doing incredible work right now on cancer. They are literally  this close to, in some cases, curing it. They have come up with a new  way for dealing with blood cancers--taking the white blood cells out of  the body, reenergizing them, and putting them back in--that has  achieved truly miraculous results.   Fred Hutch gets an overwhelming amount of their funding from the  National Institutes of Health, from the Federal Government. The budget  that President Trump originally proposed last year would have cut  funding for Fred Hutch by 75 percent.   So while we are caring about national security, I think we also have  to care about, well, curing cancer. It is not irrelevant. It actually  saves lives and makes a difference.   Lastly, I do, as I said earlier, worry about a view of the world that  says, basically, the entire world is out to get us and we have to spend  as much money as is humanly possible here in the United States to  defend ourselves.   We face threats. There is no question about that. We need a National  Security Strategy and a national security budget to meet those threats.  But in order to really create a safer and more prosperous world, we  need to build alliances so that we are threatened by fewer people and  so that we have more friends who will help us deter those who do  threaten us. This is a point that Ms. Cheney made that I completely  agree with.   Deterrence is incredibly important. In a place like North Korea, will  Kim Jung-un attack South Korea? Or will Iran attack? If they feel like  they face a credible deterrent, they won't, and the U.S. needs to be  part of that. But our allies need to be part of that as well.   Here, Russia is a great example. If Russia feels that NATO is weak,  they will be emboldened. We already are seeing what they are doing in  Ukraine. Estonia, Latvia, and other countries in Eastern Europe feel  threatened by Russia. They need to know that the United States stands  with our allies in Europe in order to deter that aggression and stop  the war before it happens.   That does not all fall on the United States defense budget. It falls  on us having friends and allies who can back up our credible  deterrence.   Lastly, I just close by saying that we certainly face the threats we  face. It is worth noting that we still, in the United States, spend way  more money every year on defense than any of our adversaries, than any  other country in the world. So it is not just a matter of money; it is  a matter of having a smart strategy and spending that money well.   I am pleased that--knock on wood--this is supposed to be the first  year in forever that the Department of Defense will actually have a  full audit of where they spend their money. But making sure the money  that is spent is spent efficiently and effectively is also part of  having an adequate national security budget. So I worry that,  basically, we say, look, all we have to do is spend as much money as  the Pentagon wants and everything will be fine. I think it is a lot  more complicated question than that. Again, it comes back to having a  sound fiscal policy and a sound national security policy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is interesting, and I agree, that the fundamental  point is that we need to make sure that we adequately provide for, in  this case, what the resolution is focused on, the Navy and the Marine  Corps. As I have agreed throughout, adequate readiness for them is  incredibly important. The CRs and the budget fiasco that we have had  have not provided that.                                time  1500    What I am trying to do is, rather than just an empty resolution that  says, gosh, it would be great if we actually looked after you, to talk  about the policy steps that are going to be necessary to actually do  that. So I think that is an incredibly important part of this debate.   Now, we can have every resolution all day long saying we want to cure  cancer, we want to bring peace to the world. That is great. But what  are the steps that are going to be necessary, in this case, to get to  the point where the Navy and Marine Corps has the adequate funds that  they need, or at least has predictability for what they are going to be  able to do, because we have been having these discussions about how,  gosh, we ought to do this, and then we don't.   I am trying to explain to the people who serve in the military and  everybody else exactly why we don't; instead of just giving them empty  promises saying we would really like to help you, it just seems like  year after year, somehow we don't. We don't, for all of the reasons  that I have listed in terms of fiscal policy going forward.   The other thing that I would like to point out is, Obama is no longer  President. Donald Trump is President. And it seems to me like the one  thing the Republican Party would want to do, they would love to have  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to kick around for, like, ever. But  you are actually in charge now; so why don't you be responsible for the  policies that we have right now.   And I just, I couldn't believe that I heard the Representative from  Wyoming say that America is now projecting strength. If there was ever  an example of the President of the United States projecting the most  embarrassing, abject weakness I have ever seen than what President  Trump just did with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, I can't think of it.  And quite frankly, a number of Republican commentators that I have seen  talk over the last 24 hours can't think of it either.   So I know it is incredibly comforting, from a policy perspective, to  blame everything, absolutely everything, that has gone wrong in the  world on President Obama, but he is not in charge anymore.   Donald Trump is in charge. The Republican Party is in charge of the  House and the Senate, and it is time to focus on policies that are  going to move us forward and advance our interests; and not just feel  comfort in the fact that we can sort of rewrite history and blame  President Obama for absolutely everything that has gone wrong.   It is a big, complicated, and difficult world for President Trump. It  was for President Obama. We need to work together. We need to find ways  to confront the challenges we face in a thoughtful way. Simply blaming  the past president for absolutely everything isn't going to get us  there.   So, again, let me just conclude by saying I completely agree. The  issue that needs to be addressed is to make sure that we have adequate  readiness for all of the men and women who serve in the military.   We are only talking about the Navy and Marine Corps. As I think the  gentlewoman said, we are going to talk about the Air Force and the Army  next week. I think we should talk about all of them at the same time,  because it is all equally important. But to get there, we need to have  a strategy that is actually sustainable, instead of one that is based  on hope.   And to my mind, that is the worst thing that we can do to the men and  women who serve in the military is say we want you to do all of this,  and we don't really have the funds to do it, so you are going to have  to figure it out as you go. It would be far, far better to say, look,  here is, realistically, where our budget is at. Here is, realistically,  what we can do.   Give them that task, and then they will be trained and equipped to do  it, instead of being asked to do more than we are willing to provide  money for.   And it is one thing if this was just 1 year. It is one thing if we  had a surplus. But we don't. We have the budget environment that we  have. So if we are going to get to the point where we adequately  address readiness and address the issues that are being raised, then we  need to be realistic about what we can do and, like I said, not keep  blaming past administrations for things; actually try to implement  policy right now that is going to make sure that we have the strongest  national security policy we can, and that, again, the men and women who  serve in the military, at a minimum, are trained and equipped to do the  missions that we are asking them to do; that we don't ask them to do  missions that go beyond the funds that we provide for them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have had the broader debate, so let me just say very  quickly I agree with the resolution brought forward by Congressman  Gallagher; that the budget uncertainty definitely impacts readiness and  impacts the ability of Marines, in fact, the entire Department of  Defense to fight adequately.   I do believe, as I have said earlier, that we need to get at the  underlying fiscal issues that have created that, taking us all the way  back to the Budget Control Act and why it was passed in 2011 in the  first place. We need to get at a fiscal policy in this country so that  we can adequately and predictably fund, certainly the Department of  Defense, certainly the Marine Corps, but I would say the entire Federal  budget in a way that puts us in a much stronger position as a country.   Mr. Speaker, I support the resolution, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I really want to  thank Congressman Yoho. We have worked together on this bill. We have  also worked together as co-chairs of the Caucus for Effective Foreign  Assistance. This bill really shows the bipartisan support on the  committee.   I certainly want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for  their work, as well, towards a very important goal, and that is to make  more effective use of U.S. foreign aid and foreign development.   It is a crucial tool right now in the world. We need as many friends  and as many partners as we can find in the world. Development through  USAID and other agencies is a crucial way that we build the  relationships and, as has been mentioned by all three of the previous  speakers, as importantly, build the capacity of our partners to have a  strong economy and to grow.   What this bill does is it makes our foreign investment policy better,  more cohesive, and more robust. It enables that agency to invest in the  projects that are necessary to help it be successful by expanding what  it can do, by expanding its ability to work with other partners, to  work with the private sector, and, crucially, to take an equity stake  in some of their investments, something that current law prohibits.  This will greatly expand their ability to find projects across the  developing world to invest in and help grow these countries and move  them forward.   The overall goal of foreign aid is to make sure that there,  hopefully, at some point, are no countries in the world that can't  provide for their people, to go after poverty, to reduce it wherever we  can.   There are a lot of different projects that are important to foreign  aid. Certainly, global health, education, and direct assistance all  play a crucial role. But I would submit that nothing is more important  than enabling these countries to develop their own economy by giving  them the capital they need to invest in projects and grow businesses so  that they become self-sustaining partners.   This bill does a crucially important job in making sure that the U.S.  contribution to that effort is as effective as it possibly can be. It  lives up to the name of our caucus, effective foreign assistance. This  is critically important.   A lot of times people think of foreign aid as being, well, that is  just sort of a leftwing issue. Well, I want you to know there is true  bipartisan support in this Congress by Republicans and Democrats to  improve the quality of our foreign aid.                                time  1730    I thank Congressman Yoho for his leadership on that. He has done a  great job in making sure that this is a bipartisan issue because it is  crucial that we reduce poverty and improve security across the globe,  and it is also crucial that the U.S., as the largest, strongest economy  in the world, plays a strong role in that effort.   This bill will put us in a better position to do precisely that. I  will also say, I think this is but the first of many efforts that we  can have on improving the quality of foreign aid, of making it more  effective and more robust. It is worth noting that this bill also  expands the amount of money that is available to our foreign lending.  It gives them more money to deal with.   I strongly support this bill, this bipartisan effort, and I  appreciate Congressman Yoho's leadership. I look forward to continuing  to work with him on this and many other issues.                                General Leave
