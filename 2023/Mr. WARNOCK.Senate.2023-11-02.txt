 Mr. President, today I have the honor of celebrating the  exceptional contributions of Ms. Sherri A. Berger as she departs the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Throughout her  distinguished career, Ms. Berger has been a tireless champion of public  health and a catalyst for positive change.   From her early days as an epidemiologist to her current role as  senior counselor, Ms. Berger has been devoted to the mission of the  CDC. This includes her leadership in establishing the Center for  Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which harnessed the power of data,  expert modeling, and high-quality communication to meet the needs of  public health decisionmakers.   I celebrate Ms. Berger's dedication to public service, and I  congratulate her on an extraordinary tenure at the CDC.                            ____________________
