 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  certainly for his leadership on this very important bill.   I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korean Sanctions  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to highlight the provisions that are  the product of the hard work of the Financial Services Committee's  Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. The inclusion of these  provisions will undoubtedly assist our government's anti-money  laundering and counterterrorist financing efforts.   For instance, this bill includes language directing the President,  acting through the Secretary of the Treasury, to develop and maintain a  national strategy for combating the financing of terrorism and related  forms of illicit financing.   The opportunistic nature of terrorist groups, combined with the  emergence of financial technology, creates new challenges for our law  enforcement community and their efforts to disrupt terror finance.   The national strategy should also seek to enhance partnerships with  the private sector that prevent and detect illicit financing, and  increase efforts to facilitate compliance with our anti-money  laundering and counterterrorist financing laws.   I would like to commend Congressman Ted Budd for introducing the  National Strategy for Combating Terrorists, Underground, and Other  Illicit Financing Act, which is almost entirely incorporated in section  2 of the underlying legislation.   I would also like to recognize Congressman Pearce and Congressman  Pittenger, the chairman and vice chairman of the Terrorism and Illicit  Finance Subcommittee of our committee, whose leadership on these issues  has been instrumental to achieve the legislation that is before us  today.   Mr. Speaker, we know that Thomas Jefferson once famously said: ``The  price of liberty is eternal vigilance.'' And that is indeed true.   Thanks, in no small part, to the hard work of the Subcommittee on  Terrorism and Illicit Finance, the bill before us today ensures that we  remain vigilant to address the evolving threats to our financial  system. I am proud to support it and I encourage all Members to support  it.   Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership today on this bill  and in our committee.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 468, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 111) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating to  ``Arbitration Agreements'', and ask for its immediate consideration.  [[Page H6269]]    The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans want something different in their  Nation's Capital. They want to change the toxic culture in Washington,  D.C., that for far too long has allowed unaccountable bureaucrats to  overreach and overregulate.   The best way we can change Washington is to begin to drain the  bureaucratic swamp, but it is not easy because we have seen in the last  6 months the swamp fights back. The most recent example of this is a  rule issued by one of the swampiest of Washington bureaucracies, the  Orwellian-named Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   We all know that this is a rogue agency with a checkered past, chock- full of rampant allegations of abuse, racial and gender discrimination,  and Big Government nannyism, which constantly makes credit more  expensive and less available to hardworking Americans.   Mr. Speaker, so radical is this agency and so extreme in lacking  accountability that a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of  Appeals declared the Bureau's governing structure unconstitutional.   Now, this unaccountable bureaucracy has joined forces in an unholy  alliance with one of the Democratic Party's favorite special interest  groups; namely, the trial lawyers lobby. And this unholy alliance will  specifically deprive consumers of a low-cost, easy way to resolve legal  disputes that can be accomplished without hiring trial attorneys.   What the Bureau and the wealthy trial lawyers want is to take away  arbitration for consumers and, instead, force them into class action  lawsuits, which just so happens to require consumers to hire the very  trial lawyers who will benefit most from this rule.   Americans were promised a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but,  instead, they obviously got a trial lawyer enrichment bureau. Oh, by  the way, the director of this swampy bureaucracy rushed this regulation  onto the books because it is widely reported he is on the way out the  door to run for political office in Ohio.   Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker, one accountable bureaucrat has decided  that he knows better than the American people, and he has acted  unilaterally to dictate the terms of contracts in a way that will  actually increase consumer costs and reduce consumer choice. In a free  and Democratic society, no one unelected individual should possess this  much power.   Mr. Speaker, making consumers pay more for less is the exact opposite  of consumer protection, but it is exactly what this regulation means  for every American.   This regulation will perpetuate a justice gap that takes away a  quicker, less expensive legal option for low-income and middle-income  Americans.   Even the CFPB's own study says this: the Bureau's own study found  that 87 percent of the class actions it examined resulted in no  consumer benefit whatsoever. In the mere 13 percent that actually  provided some benefit, Mr. Speaker, the average payout per consumer was  $32.   How much did the trial attorneys make?   31,000 times that amount.   So, again, Mr. Speaker, we have an average payout of $32 for the  consumers and millions for the trial attorneys. So no wonder the  powerful trial attorneys lobby is so eager to see this rule go into  effect.   The Bureau's own study also concludes that arbitration is less  expensive for consumers and up to 12 times faster than litigation.                                time  1530    Consumers who obtain relief in arbitration recovered in a CFPB study  an average of $5,389. Again, Mr. Speaker, compare that to $32 the  average consumer received under the CFPB study.   Now, we are about to hear from some Members on the other side of the  aisle that somehow consumers will lose their day in court and that  somehow big banks will be helped. The CFPB's own study shows that not a  single class action it examined, not a single one, resulted in trial by  a judge or a jury. So no consumer got his or her day in court under the  Bureau's preferred class actions. Instead, we know consumers are far  more likely to obtain decisions on the merits in arbitration.   With this rule, we once again see our colleagues in the other party  hurting small community banks and credit unions. I have a statement  that has been published already from the Independent Community Bankers  of America. They are not Wall Street. This is small town community  banks, and their statement says they strongly oppose the CFPB rule.   Also, I have a statement from the Credit Union National Association-- again, Mr. Speaker, not Wall Street, but credit unions, our  neighborhood credit unions. They say that the CFPB's rule will limit  options for resolving disputes and could increase the number of  frivolous lawsuits and that credit union members ``could suffer when  costs rise and resources are depleted as a result of this rule.''   Indeed, the CFPB, itself, estimates its final rule will increase  costs for American businesses over $1 billion per year. That is money  that our community banks and credit unions won't be able to lend to our  small businesses, to our families, and to American workers.   The CFPB's rule is bad for consumers, it is bad for community banks,  it is bad for credit unions, and it is bad for our economy. Washington  should be focused on creating more jobs, not more class action  lawsuits.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is time to fight the bureaucratic swamp. It is  time to pass the resolution offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus). I appreciate his leadership in helping protect consumers  instead of enriching trial lawyers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), who is the sponsor of the  legislation and vice chairman of our Financial Institutions and  Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Pennsylvania  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) be allowed to control the  remainder of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Luetkemeyer) for yielding, and I appreciate his leadership on this  issue, as I do the gentleman from Pennsylvania as well.   Mr. Speaker, since 1925, this institution, the United States  Congress, has recognized the right of consumers to engage in  arbitration, which we know for so many consumers is their avenue for  redress of grievance. We know that this has been upheld on multiple  occasions by the Supreme Court. We have almost 100 years of precedence.  And now this rogue agency, the Orwellian-named CFPB, decides to  promulgate a rule, and it is not even an agency. Mr. Speaker, it is one  unelected, unaccountable individual who has decided that Americans no  longer have the right to contract, they no longer have the right to  decide that they would prefer to arbitrate instead of go through a  class action lawsuit.   Mr. Speaker, let's let people know what this is truly about. What  this is about is the trial attorneys relief act. Theirs are the voices  that we are hearing on the other side of the aisle, and we are hearing  them loud and clear, because what we know is that, in class action  lawsuits, consumers end up with almost nothing and the trial lawyers  make out like bandits.   Even in the CFPB's own study, they figured out that those who go  through class action are doing well to get $32.35, yet the trial  lawyers make out with millions. We also know in the CFPB's own study  that those who went through arbitration ended up with settlements of  $5,389.   Mr. Speaker, here are just a couple of different class action  lawsuits that have happened recently. A Dell Computers class action  lawsuit: $500,000 for class members, $7 million for the lawyers; Subway  sandwiches: $50,000 for the class members, $500,000 for the trial  attorneys.   Oh, here is a good one, Mr. Speaker, Coca-Cola class action: $0 for  class members, $1.2 million for the lawyers; L.A. Fitness  International: $7,000 for class members, $200,000 for lawyers.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are not foolish. It is time to drain  the swamp and to start off with the bureaucracy that is taking away  their rights to have dispute resolution through arbitration. They are  tired of seeing others go and kowtow to the trial lawyers lobby in this  town to give them what they want. It is time to make sure that  Americans' consumer rights can be protected, and so it is time that we  pass this Congressional Review Act for all Americans.
