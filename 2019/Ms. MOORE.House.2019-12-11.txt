 Mr. Speaker, I am just so thrilled and excited to be  reintroducing my Social Security reform bill, the Social Security  Enhancement and Protection Act of 2019.   Today, our prized Social Security program is at risk. Currently,  Social Security is fully funded until 2035 but faces a financial  shortfall after that.   And while there is broad agreement that we need to take steps to  improve the fiscal outlook for Social Security, there is not enough  attention given to the need to improve the system so that it works  better for vulnerable populations, including women, people of color,  and low-income people. My bill would both improve benefits and extend  the program's solvency.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to three critical  components of my bill:   My bill would modify the special minimum benefit to credit workers  for up to 5 additional years of work to reflect the years workers  provide care for a child under 6 years old. This, of course, is  especially important for women. We need to value caregiving and  acknowledge that this uncompensated labor is not free. Mother work is  work.   My bill also extends the benefit eligibility for children of retired,  disabled, or deceased workers who are full-time students enrolled in  college or vocational schools up to the age of 26 years old.   In this knowledge-based worldwide economy, this benefit needs to be  reinstated. It was particularly helpful to students of color, low- income families with parents working who were at higher risk, those  with parents who were blue-collar workers, and women.   My bill also provides additional benefits for all beneficiaries of  any income age 20 years after their retirement. People who live beyond  the age of 85--God bless them--tend to be more likely to be financially  vulnerable, even with their Social Security benefit. They may have  exhausted their savings by this point or have more serious health  problems that may have been a drain on their finances or have faced any  number of financial strains.   Mr. Speaker, Social Security has become one of the hallmarks of our  safety net, and I urge my colleagues to improve this system, which has  been an integral part of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, Social Security is the North Star of humane public  policy in the United States, and I would invite all of my colleagues  the opportunity to cosponsor this legislation and vote for the Social  Security Enhancement and Protection Act of 2019.                            ____________________
