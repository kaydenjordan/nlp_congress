 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend Alabama  citizens' right to fair representation and equal apportionment under  the United States Constitution.   In some recent censuses, the Census Bureau counted illegal aliens,  and indications are they will count illegal aliens again in the 2020  census. This potentially illegal practice puts Alabama at significant  risk of losing a congressional seat when the 2020 census  reapportionment occurs for the 2022 elections.  [[Page H4288]]    For this reason, the State of Alabama and I have filed suit in  Federal District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against the  United States Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau to require  them to exclude illegal aliens when they conduct the 2020 census.   Specifically, the State of Alabama and I challenge the legality of  the Department of Commerce's residence rule, which counts everyone,  including illegal aliens, in America's population count.   If the roughly 15 million illegal aliens in America--no one knows for  sure how many there are--were dispersed throughout the United States in  equal proportion to each State's population, then no State would be  disadvantaged in congressional representation and this discrimination  issue would be moot.   However, the difference in illegal alien population between States is  dramatic. According to Department of Homeland Security 2014 estimates,  46 percent of America's illegal aliens live in just three States.  California, with the greatest concentration of illegal aliens,  estimated at 2.9 million, has roughly four more Congressmen due to  apportionment that counts illegal aliens. Reapportionment of House  seats and electoral votes is a zero-sum proposition: one State's gain  is another State's loss. With an estimated 65,000 illegal aliens,  Alabama citizens, and citizens of many other States as well, lose  proportional representation because of various open borders policies of  some States.   The exact effects of the illegal alien population on the  apportionment of Congressmen is complex based on the Method of Equal  Proportions formula that is used to minimize the percentage difference  in population per Congressman.   But one thing is clear: Simulations of the apportionment process,  using current population projections, suggest Alabama is at great risk  of losing a congressional seat if the Census Bureau counts illegal  aliens.   As with anything in the United States Constitution, the census should  be read, understood, and strictly administered according to its  original intent. The 14th Amendment protects the rights of citizens to  fair and equal representation. Any deviation in this process threatens  the right of each American citizen to fair and equal representation in  Congress.   We cannot allow a small number of States to cheat the rest of America  by promoting illegal immigration and then, as a reward for their  lawless conduct, to receive greater proportional representation in  Congress and the electoral college.   Mr. Speaker, the question is clear: Should congressional  representation be based on the number of American citizens or expanded  to include the number of illegal aliens?   I cannot speak for anyone else in Washington, D.C., but for me. And,  as for me, I side with American citizens, not illegal aliens and  illegal conduct.   America is a Republic, and the essence of being a Republic is respect  for the right of American citizens to equal protection and equal  influence over congressional elections.   Any attempt by the Census Bureau to undermine American citizens'  equal protection and equal influence over congressional elections must  be opposed. That is exactly what the State of Alabama and I are doing  by filing this action on behalf of Alabama citizens.                            ____________________
