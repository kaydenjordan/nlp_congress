 Mr. Speaker, people in suburban communities benefit from  convenient, reliable public transportation to urban areas. It allows  them to move to more affordable neighborhoods while maintaining access  to the economic opportunities in the city.   This is evident in part of my district, where a one-seat ride on the  east side of the Hudson River in New York makes it easy to get off the  roads and commute by train between Westchester County and New York  City.   Unfortunately, Rockland County, on the west side of the Hudson, lacks  direct rail service to the city, making the commute deeply inconvenient  and the area a more challenging place to live.   My amendment would commission a study on the economic benefits of  one-seat ride commuter rail service between urban and suburban  communities. This study would help Federal, State, and local  governments plan for expansion of direct rail service to communities  like Rockland County and identify areas where improvements are not only  feasible but necessary.   I urge support for my amendment because communities like Rockland  deserve convenient, reliable public transportation to urban areas like  New York City.
