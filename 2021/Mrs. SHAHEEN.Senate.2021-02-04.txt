 Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No.  834, as modified, and speak for 30 seconds and then turn the mic over  to my colleague Senator Murkowski, who is the cosponsor of this  amendment.    Mr. President, this amendment supports organizations  serving survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child  abuse. As we know, because of COVID, those survivors and families have  been hit particularly hard, and there has been very little money that  has gone to support them. This amendment would say very strongly we  need to do better.   Senator Murkowski.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
