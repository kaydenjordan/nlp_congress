 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Youth  Mentoring Month, which we celebrate in January.   Established in 2002, Youth Mentoring Month celebrates the powerful  impact of mentoring relationships and raises awareness about the need  for more caring adults to become mentors in their communities.   In 2006, I created a career development and mentorship program at  Constitution High School in Philadelphia and, throughout the years, I  have served as a mentor many times over.   We often talk about mentoring in terms of the benefits to young  people, but what surprises so many people about mentoring is the  emotional satisfaction and benefits to the mentor. Whether it be  through a classroom, an arts program, or a local youth sports team,  mentors provide young people with the guidance and encouragement they  need to find success and reach their full potential.   As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Youth Mentoring Caucus  with Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler, I look forward to  celebrating and promoting mentoring programs across our country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I, too, have to agree with the ranking  member of the Rules Committee that this does raise serious questions  for our institution and assure him that this is not a move taken  lightly, but our colleagues have left us no choice.   Historically, the parties have policed themselves. Even as recently  as 2 years ago, our Republican colleagues removed a Member from  committees after he made a series of false and despicable statements,  which were less serious than the conduct we consider here.   But, apparently, that was the old GOP. In the words of Republican  Senator John Thune from South Dakota, the party of ``limited government  and fiscal responsibility, free markets, peace through strength'' has  become the ``party of conspiracy theories and QAnon.''   No matter how much our colleagues here today say that they disapprove  of the conduct of the Representative from Georgia, they must realize  that she is now the face of their party.   If today's House Republican caucus wants to embrace this behavior,  the majority does not. The Member in question has advocated for  insurrection and violence against elected officials and children, has  challenged the safety of Members and our Capitol Police, and has  promoted fringe conspiracy theories that damage our work.   Such behavior would not be tolerated in any other workplace, and it  cannot be tolerated in the people's House.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know this. While they  have been careful to distance themselves from their Member's remarks  and actions, they have not shown the courage to hold a Member of their  own party accountable when they don't have the shield of a secret vote.   They force us to take this action to stop the spread of conspiracy  theories, lies, and hate in the Halls of Congress.   This isn't canceling the Representative from Georgia's voice. It is  about accountability. There is no right to committee assignments, but  if a Member conducts himself or herself in so disgraceful a way that  she brings discredit upon Congress, and her own party cannot address  the problem, then the House, as a whole, has to deal with it.   I urge my colleagues to recognize what the public has recognized in a  bipartisan manner, that the indecent behavior of this Member is a  threat to Congress and our government.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  arranging this really important Special Order hour.   Every day, we are so grateful for the hard work and support of our  congressional staff. Many of them are young enough to be my children,  but they serve Congress and our country with brilliance and honor every  single day.   This evening, I want to read a letter signed by nearly 400  congressional staffers to their Senators because they don't often have  a voice on this floor, but their words are so raw and so heart- wrenching.   Here is their letter, titled ``An Open Letter to Members of the U.S.  Senate.''   ``We are staff who work for Members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S.  House of Representatives, where it is our honor and privilege to serve  our country and our fellow Americans. We write this letter to share our  own views and experiences, not the views of our employers. But on  January 6, 2021, our workplace was attacked by a violent mob trying to  stop the electoral college vote count. That mob was incited by former  President Donald J. Trump and his political allies, some of whom we  pass every day in the hallways at work.   ``Many of us attended school in the post-Columbine era and were  trained to respond to active shooter situations in our classrooms. As  the mob smashed through Capitol Police barricades, broke doors and  windows, and charged into the Capitol with body armor and weapons, many  of us hid behind chairs and under desks or barricaded ourselves in  offices. Others watched on TV and frantically tried to reach our bosses  and colleagues as they fled for their lives.   ``On January 6, the former President broke America's 230-year legacy  of the peaceful transition of power when he incited a mob to disrupt  the counting of electoral college votes. Six people died. A Capitol  Police officer--one of our coworkers who guards and greets us every  day--was beaten to death. The attack on our workplace was inspired by  lies told by the former President and others about the results of the  election in a baseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast  by the American people.   ``Our Constitution only works when we believe in it and defend it. It  is a shared commitment to equal justice, the rule of law, and the  peaceful resolution of our differences. Any person who doesn't share  these beliefs has no place representing the American people, now or in  the future. The use of violence and lies to overturn an election is not  worthy of debate. Either you stand with the Republic or against it.   ``As congressional employees, we don't have a vote on whether to  convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at  the Capitol, but our Senators do. And for our sake, and the sake of the  country, we ask that they vote to convict the former President and bar  him from ever holding office again.''   It is signed by nearly 400 congressional staff.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record their letter and  their signatures.         An Open Letter to Members of the U.S. Senate:  We are staff       who work for members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of       Representatives, where it is our honor and privilege to serve       our country and our fellow Americans.
