 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy.   I was listening to our friend from Louisiana, and I sympathize with  much of what he was saying. I have been working on flood insurance  reform for 20 years.                                time  1300    We are caught in a dynamic here where it is never really good enough  and there are challenges for people who played by the rules at the  time.   The problem is that we are not doing a good job of evaluating, moving  forward, and making the changes. It is true that some of this has an  impact on Louisiana. I am sensitive to that. But at the same time,  there are policies that have been resisted by some of those same state  leaders.   We must swallow hard and understand that we are on a path here that  impacts people all across the country. We do not have accurate flood  maps, and people resist updating them. We have many people who are  paying far less than the actuarial costs for their flood insurance.  There are millions more who are subsidizing all this because they are  paying unfair premiums. We do not invest in pre-disaster mitigation. We  will save $4 in disaster relief for each dollar we invest upfront to  protect property and lives.   I am prepared to support the underlying bill. It is not perfect.  There are changes that I would make. I understand some of the  challenges that people are going to suggest in terms of the impact on  some lower-income citizens. I sympathize with that, but the answer is  not to continue to keep people in harm's way. The answer is not to  rebuild people's homes right back where they are going to be putting  their property and their families at risk. We  [[Page H9196]]  should not continue to resist reform, because it is hard. Ultimately,  that adds to the price tag and it adds to the dislocation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman  has expired.    Mr. Speaker, it is important that we don't lose an  opportunity to start changing this situation.   When the floods came in Houston, I got calls from some reporters  because I had been dealing with problems in Houston going back 20  years. This is an example of where we failed to deal with repetitive  flood loss and where we have watched unchecked sprawl put millions of  people at risk for greater harm.   This bill isn't perfect, but I hope that it starts the process where  we can come together as it goes through the legislative process. I hope  we can make adjustments to start us along that path, and that we start  swallowing hard, making sure that everybody gives up a little.   The Federal Government needs to invest more. People need to stop  building in harm's way. We need to do a better job of flood recovery  and pre-disaster mitigation. I think this bill represents a good faith  start along that path, and I hope we can use it as a foundation for  further progress.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in  yielding me this time.   I have enjoyed listening to the debate back and forth. There is no  area in Congress that I have spent more time on, over the course of the  last 20 years, than dealing with flood insurance. I was the author of  the last major piece with our former colleague, Doug Bereuter. I agree  with much of what was said on both sides.   There are remaining significant problems. Insurance is not priced  properly. It is not that it is too expensive or it is too cheap, it is  not priced properly. We have some winners and losers now, but too many  people are subsidized by the majority.   We are not doing all that we can. The Federal Government ends up  holding the bag for billions of dollars for unnecessary flood damage  with storm after storm after storm; and, by the way, there are more on  the way.   It doesn't have to be this way. Part of the problem is that because,  inevitably, when we talk about reform, it costs money, and there are  some people who end up paying more. It is easy not to update the maps.  It is easy not to have people pay actuarial rates. It is easy not to  force local governments to do their job and not allow building in  harm's way.   I strongly agree that, in times past, low-income and minority people  were subjected to real problems and more flooding than they should have  been. But now is the time to try and pivot and do something about it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of groups that are  supporting this legislation.         National Association of REALTORS (NAR), National       Association of Home Builders (NAHB), Property and Casualty       Insurers Association of America (PCI), American Insurance       Association (AIA), Reinsurance Association of America (RAA),       Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers (CIAB), National       Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU),       Financial Services Roundtable (FSR), Mortgage Bankers       Association (MBA), American Land Title Association (ALTA),       The SmarterSafer Coalition, National Wildlife Federation       (NWF), National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), National       Apartment Association (NAA), Community Mortgage Lenders of       America (CMLA), Commercial Real Estate Finance Council       (CREFC), Real Estate Services Providers Council, Inc.       (RESPRO), The Real Estate Roundtable, Leading Builders of       America, The Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI), Building       Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) International.        The Realty Alliance, Habitat for Humanity, Institute of       Real Estate Management (IREM), International Council of       Shopping Centers (ICSC), Association of Bermuda Insurers and       Reinsurers (ABIR), Wholesale & Specialty Insurance       Association (WSIA), Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council       (SBE Council), Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship       (CRS), Coalition to Reduce Spending, American Consumer       Institute, CCIM Institute, Council for Affordable and Rural       Housing, NAOIP, The Commercial Real Estate Development       Association, National Association of Real Estate Investment       Trusts (Nareit), National Affordable Housing Management       Association, National Association of Housing Cooperatives,       National Leased Housing Association, Taxpayers for Common       Sense, R Street Institute, National Taxpayers Union (NTU).     Mr. Speaker, the list is an interesting collection.  It includes environmental groups, consumer groups, housing advocates,  businesses, fiscal watchdogs, and taxpayer  [[Page H9235]]  advocates. And all of them don't agree with every detail. Many of them  would identify with some of the debates, but they agree that this bill  is a step in the right direction, and we should use it.   What we vote on today--and I hope that it passes, I am going to vote  for it--is not the last word. As it wends its way through the  legislative process, if we all do our job of making it better, we can  have that high-five moment that I think we all look forward to.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.
