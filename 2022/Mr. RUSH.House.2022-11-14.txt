 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the committee, my good  friend Congresswoman Maloney.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3655, the Civil Rights  Cold Case Investigation Support Act of 2022. This bill is the Senate  companion to my bill, H.R. 6818, and I am pleased beyond measure to  support its passage on the floor today.   Four years ago, Mr. Speaker, Congress passed my bill, the Civil  Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018, into law. That law  created a collection of civil rights cold case records to be disclosed  to the public, helping to resolve by bringing closure to the more than  100 unsolved cold cases from the civil rights era. It was designed to  bring some small measure of comfort to families and communities that  have waited far, far too long for answers about the loss of their loved  ones so many decades ago. I hope today's passage will bring some sense  of closure to these families.   A crucial part of that bill was the creation of the Civil Rights Cold  Case Records Review Board, which serves as an independent oversight  agency that reviews requests to delay making civil rights cold case  records public.   President Biden has appointed, and the Senate has confirmed, some  wonderfully qualified nominees to the board, but since the previous  administration failed to appoint any members to the board, the board is  about to run out of its legislative time before it can truly bring its  mission to fruition.   Mr. Speaker, the bill passed in the Senate, and I see no reason why  the House cannot pass the bill today. I urge passage of the bill today.
