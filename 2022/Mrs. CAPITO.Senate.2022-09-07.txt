 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of a West Virginian who triumphantly fought for our  country during World War II. J. David Bailey, who was recently awarded  the highest French recognition--the Legion of Honor--is one of the  oldest surviving veterans of the Battle of the Bulge. His story is an  extraordinary example of the American philosophy to fight for freedom  around the world.   David was born in Bluefield, WV, on January 3, 1922. At the age of  21, he, like 16 million other Americans, answered the call to fight  against tyranny. He became a dedicated member of the battalion of the  U.S. Army's 422nd Regiment, 106th Infantry Division.   On December 16, 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge,  the bloodiest and largest battle of World War II, David and his entire  battalion were imprisoned by German troops east of St. Vith, Belgium.  Ultimately, he escaped imprisonment to rejoin his fellow soldiers and  went on to serve in other campaigns, including northern France and the  Army of Occupation. He was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army on  November 24, 1945.   In recognition of his honorable service to our country, David has  received the Combat Infantry Badge, two Bronze Stars, four Battle  Stars, and four service ribbons, as well as the Order of St. Maurice  Medallion from the National Infantry Association. He also appeared on  the cover of a victory edition of the military publication ``Stars and  Stripes.''   David has also been a key figure in preserving the history of World  War II throughout the years. At one point, he served as the national  president of the Battle of the Bulge Association. On January 25, 2022,  at the age of 100, David was one of several veterans to lay the wreath  at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arlington National Cemetery  to commemorate the end of the Battle of the Bulge. He also attended the  opening ceremonies of the World War II Memorial, the 70th anniversary  of V-E Day in 2015, and he was also the personal guest of President  Barack Obama at the White House for the Veterans Day ceremony in 2011.  [[Page S4472]]    J. David Bailey's life has been dedicated to the service of our  country, and the impact that he has had will be remembered for years to  come. I am proud to call him a fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor decorated  West Virginian Benjamin Portaro. Mr. Portaro recently received the  French Legion of Honor for his service in France during World War II.   Born in a small village in Italy, Mr. Portaro's family immigrated to  the United States searching for the American dream. Mr. Portaro's  father, Pete, found work in the coal mines in Anmoore, WV, where the  family would settle down. The Portaros prospered in Anmoore, where  young Ben began school and helped his parents learn English.   As a young man, Benjamin Portaro began work as a construction  contractor, working for a local carbon plant in Anmoore. In 1943 Mr.  Portaro entered the Army and was sent to Europe where he would fight on  the frontlines in France. Promoted to staff sergeant under General  George Patton, Mr. Portaro was sent to the Battle of the Bulge.   It was during the Germans' last major offensive that Mr. Portaro was  wounded and captured by the Nazis. Taken as a prisoner of war, Mr.  Portaro was forced to march for miles in the dead of the winter, as  many of his fellow prisoners starved to death. Months later, Mr.  Portaro and another prisoner decided their best chance at survival  would be trying to escape. After dark, they hid in ditches until they  could run away from their captors. After 3 days, Portaro and his friend  were rescued by the American Army. At this point, Mr. Portaro weighed a  mere 100 pounds. After being rescued, Benjamin was transported to a  hospital for treatment and eventually made it back home to Anmoore,  where he would spend his life working for and with veterans and  prisoners of war.   Mr. Portaro has received many medals for his service, including the  Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Prisoners of War medal, WWII  Honorable Discharge, American Campaign, Yankee Division badge, WWII  Victory Medal, European Campaign, Army Good Conduct Medal, Combat  Infantry Badge, and Staff Sergeant Badge.   Mr. Portaro and his wife Claire had 7 children, 14 grandchildren, and  14 great-grandchildren. After 69 happy years, Claire passed away in  2011. Ben continues to live in West Virginia and is an inspiring voice  and story to all.   Mr. Portaro's story is one of sacrifice, hope, and courage. He is a  proud West Virginian and a great representative of our State. I am  proud to represent Mr. Portaro and thrilled that, after so many years,  he still calls West Virginia home.                            ____________________
