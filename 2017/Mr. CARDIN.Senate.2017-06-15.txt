 Well, first, to Senator Corker. There is a reason Members  want to serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We had a long  list of Members who wanted to join our committee in this Congress.  Quite frankly, I think the reason they want to join is not only the  challenges we have globally but the fact that this is a committee that  works bipartisanly and respects the views of every single Member, both  Democratic and Republican, on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   The bill we have before us reflects that--in the best tradition of  the U.S. Senate and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is  due, in large part, because of the talent, leadership, and commitment  of our chairman. I thank Senator Corker for allowing us to reach this  very important moment in the U.S. Senate, to be able to vote on a bill  that is consequential for America's national security.   I believe this is the first major bill we have had on the floor of  the U.S. Senate, the first bill we have had amendments to, and I concur  in the Senator's observations that our leaders allowed us to let the  process work in the best traditions of the U.S. Senate.   It is difficult for many of us to explain how the Senate operates at  times. It really is difficult, but it is a body which respects the  rights of each Member, and they have certain abilities to slow things  down or bring us to a stop, and the process doesn't work the way it is  supposed to work, but this bill has been handled very quickly on a  major subject because we respected the rights of every single Member of  the U.S. Senate. It doesn't mean we reach total agreement. We didn't,  but we have a bill that accomplishes three very important things:   First, it stands up to the aggression of Russia and Iran. Yes, we  have been talking about this--and I am glad Senator McCain is on the  floor. Senator McCain has been one of the most ardent crusaders to  point out the risk factors of Russia to our national security and that  of our allies.   I started with Senator McCain in January. We sat down, and he  informed me why we had to do certain things and make it very clear and  not have any ambiguity because Russia would run right through that  ambiguity. Thanks to that initial leadership, we have those provisions  in the underlying bill. There will be no ambiguity as to what Congress  is saying in regard to Russia's behavior.   I also acknowledge we have a review process in here. Senator Graham  brought that to our attention very early in the process in January so  Congress can insert itself.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    That review process will give Congress the right role to  review executive actions so we are stronger, working together. It also  gives the President a stronger hand in negotiating with Mr. Putin and  Russia because Congress has said: You must accomplish certain  objectives, such as getting Russia's aggression to end in Ukraine or  get Russia to stop supporting war crimes in Syria, to stop interfering  with our democratic election systems. That is what we say, and we are  very clear about that.   Then we take the third step, which I think is very important; that  is, provide the wherewithal of U.S. leadership, working with our  European allies, to protect our democratic institutions.   All of that is included in the bill that we are going to have a  chance to vote on in a few minutes, and I want to thank all who were  involved. I am going to include staff who worked so hard on this.   They were here 24/7 putting this bill together--Damian Murphy, in my  office; Margaret Taylor; and Jessica Lewis, Dana Stroul, Lowell  Schwartz, Sean Bartlett, Chris Barr, John Ryan, Leslie Bull, Danny  Ricchetti, as well as Todd Womack, Rob Strayer, David Kinzler, and Ben  Purser.   They were extraordinary in helping us reach this day.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 2, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 147 Leg.]                                  YEAS--98       Alexander      Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Boozman      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Coons      Corker      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Enzi      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Flake      Franken      Gardner      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Harris      Hassan      Hatch      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Heller      Hirono      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kaine      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Leahy      Lee      Manchin      Markey      McCain      McCaskill      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Perdue      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Scott      Shaheen      Shelby      Stabenow      Strange      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--2       Paul      Sanders           The bill (S. 722), as amended, was passed, as follows:                                   S. 722         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

IMPOSITION OF TERRORISM-RELATED SANCTIONS WITH                     RESPECT TO THE IRGC.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The IRGC is subject to sanctions pursuant to Executive       Order 13382 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to blocking       property of weapons of mass destruction delivery system       proliferators and their supporters), the Comprehensive Iran       Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22       U.S.C. 8501 et seq.), Executive Order 13553 (50 U.S.C. 1701       note; relating to blocking property of certain persons with       respect to serious human rights abuses by the Government of       Iran), and Executive Order 13606 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note;       relating to blocking the property and suspending entry into       the United States of certain persons with respect to grave       human rights abuses by the Governments of Iran and Syria via       information technology).        (2) The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (in       this section referred to as the ``IRGC-QF'') is the primary       arm of the Government of Iran for executing its policy of       supporting terrorist and insurgent groups. The IRGC-QF       provides material, logistical assistance, training, and       financial support to militants and terrorist operatives       throughout the Middle East and South Asia and was designated       for the imposition of sanctions by the Secretary of Treasury       pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note;       relating to blocking property and prohibiting transactions       with persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support       terrorism) in October 2007 for its support of terrorism.        (3) The IRGC, not just the IRGC-QF, is responsible for       implementing Iran's international program of destabilizing       activities, support for acts of international terrorism, and       ballistic missile program.        (b) In General.--Beginning on the date that is 90 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President       shall impose the sanctions described in subsection (c) with       respect to the IRGC and foreign persons that are officials,       agents, or affiliates of the IRGC.

This title may be cited as the ``Countering Russian       Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017''.   Subtitle A--Sanctions and Other Measures With Respect to the Russian                                 Federation       SEC. 211. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) On March 6, 2014, President Barack Obama issued       Executive Order 13660 (79 Fed. Reg. 13493; relating to       blocking property of certain persons contributing to the       situation in Ukraine), which authorizes the Secretary of the       Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to       impose sanctions on those determined to be undermining       democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine or       threatening the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and       territorial integrity of Ukraine. President Obama       subsequently issued Executive Order 13661 (79 Fed. Reg.       15535; relating to blocking property of additional persons       contributing to the situation in Ukraine) and Executive Order       13662 (79 Fed. Reg. 16169; relating to blocking property of       additional persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine)       to expand sanctions on certain persons contributing to the       situation in Ukraine.        (2) On December 18, 2014, the Ukraine Freedom Support Act       of 2014 was enacted (Public Law 113-272; 22 U.S.C. 8921 et       seq.), which includes provisions directing the President to       impose sanctions on foreign persons that the President       determines to be entities owned or controlled by the       Government of the Russian Federation or nationals of the       Russian Federation that manufacture, sell, transfer, or       otherwise provide certain defense articles into Syria.        (3) On April 1, 2015, President Obama issued Executive       Order 13694 (80 Fed. Reg. 18077; relating to blocking the       property of certain persons engaging in significant malicious       cyber-enabled activities), which authorizes the Secretary of       the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and       the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on persons       determined to be engaged in malicious cyber-hacking.        (4) On July 26, 2016, President Obama approved a       Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident       Coordination, which states, ``certain cyber incidents that       have significant impacts on an entity, our national security,       or the broader economy require a unique approach to response       efforts''.        (5) On December 29, 2016, President Obama issued an annex       to Executive Order 13694, which authorized sanctions on the       following entities and individuals:        (A) The Main Intelligence Directorate (also known as       Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie or the GRU) in Moscow,       Russian Federation.        (B) The Federal Security Service (also known as Federalnaya       Sluzhba Bezopasnosti or the FSB) in Moscow, Russian       Federation.        (C) The Special Technology Center (also known as STLC, Ltd.       Special Technology Center St. Petersburg) in St. Petersburg,       Russian Federation.        (D) Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) in Moscow,       Russian Federation.        (E) The autonomous noncommercial organization known as the       Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing       Systems (also known as ANO PO KSI) in Moscow, Russian       Federation.        (F) Igor Valentinovich Korobov.        (G) Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov.        (H) Igor Olegovich Kostyukov.  [[Page S3517]]         (I) Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev.        (6) On January 6, 2017, an assessment of the United States       intelligence community entitled, ``Assessing Russian       Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections'' stated,       ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence       campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential       election.'' The assessment warns that ``Moscow will apply       lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the       U.S. Presidential election to future influence efforts       worldwide, including against U.S. allies and their election       processes''.       SEC. 212. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the President--        (1) should engage to the fullest extent possible with       partner governments with regard to closing loopholes,       including the allowance of extended prepayment for the       delivery of goods and commodities and other loopholes, in       multilateral and unilateral restrictive measures against the       Russian Federation, with the aim of maximizing alignment of       those measures; and        (2) should increase efforts to vigorously enforce       compliance with sanctions in place as of the date of the       enactment of this Act with respect to the Russian Federation       in response to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, cyber       intrusions and attacks, and human rights violators in the       Russian Federation.

Subtitle B--Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia       SEC. 251. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Government of the Russian Federation has sought to       exert influence throughout Europe and Eurasia, including in       the former states of the Soviet Union, by providing resources       to political parties, think tanks, and civil society groups       that sow distrust in democratic institutions and actors,       promote xenophobic and illiberal views, and otherwise       undermine European unity. The Government of the Russian       Federation has also engaged in well-documented corruption       practices as a means toward undermining and buying influence       in European and Eurasian countries.        (2) The Government of the Russian Federation has largely       eliminated a once-vibrant Russian-language independent media       sector and severely curtails free and independent media       within the borders of the Russian Federation. Russian-      language media organizations that are funded and controlled       by the Government of the Russian Federation and disseminate       information within and outside of the Russian Federation       routinely traffic in anti-Western disinformation, while few       independent, fact-based media sources provide objective       reporting for Russian-speaking audiences inside or outside of       the Russian Federation.        (3) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to       violate its commitments under the Memorandum on Security       Assurances in connection with Ukraine's Accession to the       Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at       Budapest December 5, 1994, and the Conference on Security and       Co-operation in Europe Final Act, concluded at Helsinki       August 1, 1975 (commonly referred to as the ``Helsinki Final       Act''), which laid the ground-work for the establishment of       the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, of       which the Russian Federation is a member, by its illegal       annexation of Crimea in 2014, its illegal occupation of South       Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia in 2008, and its ongoing       destabilizing activities in eastern Ukraine.        (4) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to       ignore the terms of the August 2008 ceasefire agreement       relating to Georgia, which requires the withdrawal of Russian       Federation troops, free access by humanitarian groups to the       regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and monitoring of the       conflict areas by the European Union Monitoring Mission.        (5) The Government of the Russian Federation is failing to       comply with the terms of the Minsk Agreement to address the       ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, signed in Minsk,       Belarus, on February 11, 2015, by the leaders of Ukraine,       Russia, France, and Germany, as well as the Minsk Protocol,       which was agreed to on September 5, 2014.        (6) The Government of the Russian Federation is--        (A) in violation of the Treaty between the United States of       America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the       Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range       Missiles, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered       into force June 1, 1988 (commonly known as the ``INF       Treaty''); and        (B) failing to meet its obligations under the Treaty on       Open Skies, done at Helsinki March 24, 1992, and entered into       force January 1, 2002 (commonly known as the ``Open Skies       Treaty'').       SEC. 252. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Government of the Russian Federation bears       responsibility for the continuing violence in Eastern       Ukraine, including the death on April 24, 2017, of Joseph       Stone, a citizen of the United States working as a monitor       for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;        (2) the President should call on the Government of the       Russian Federation--        (A) to withdraw all of its forces from the territories of       Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova;        (B) to return control of the borders of those territories       to their respective governments; and        (C) to cease all efforts to undermine the popularly elected       governments of those countries;        (3) the Government of the Russian Federation has applied,       and continues to apply, to the countries and peoples of       Georgia and Ukraine, traditional uses of force, intelligence       operations, and influence campaigns, which represent clear       and present threats to the countries of Europe and Eurasia;        (4) in response, the countries of Europe and Eurasia should       redouble efforts to build resilience within their       institutions, political systems, and civil societies;        (5) the United States supports the institutions that the       Government of the Russian Federation seeks to undermine,       including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the       European Union;        (6) a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization is critical       to maintaining peace and security in Europe and Eurasia;        (7) the United States should continue to work with the       European Union as a partner against aggression by the       Government of the Russian Federation, coordinating aid       programs, development assistance, and other counter-Russian       efforts;        (8) the United States should encourage the establishment of       a commission for media freedom within the Council of Europe,       modeled on the Venice Commission regarding rule of law       issues, that would be chartered to provide governments with       expert recommendations on maintaining legal and regulatory       regimes supportive of free and independent media and an       informed citizenry able to distinguish between fact-based       reporting, opinion, and disinformation;        (9) in addition to working to strengthen the North Atlantic       Treaty Organization and the European Union, the United States       should work with the individual countries of Europe and       Eurasia--        (A) to identify vulnerabilities to aggression,       disinformation, corruption, and so-called hybrid warfare by       the Government of the Russian Federation;        (B) to establish strategic and technical plans for       addressing those vulnerabilities;        (C) to ensure that the financial systems of those countries       are not being used to shield illicit financial activity by       officials of the Government of the Russian Federation or       individuals in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle who       have been enriched through corruption;        (D) to investigate and prosecute cases of corruption by       Russian actors; and        (E) to work toward full compliance with the Convention on       Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in       International Business Transactions (commonly referred to as       the ``Anti-Bribery Convention'') of the Organization for       Economic Co-operation and Development; and        (10) the President of the United States should use the       authority of the President to impose sanctions under--        (A) the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of       2012 (title IV of Public Law 112-208; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note);       and        (B) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act       (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C.       2656 note).       SEC. 253. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         The United States, consistent with the principle of ex       injuria jus non oritur, supports the policy known as the       ``Stimson Doctrine'' and thus does not recognize territorial       changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions       and occupations of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Eastern       Ukraine, and Transnistria.

SEC. 292. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF                     ARTICLE 5 OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY.         (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:        (1) The principle of collective defense of the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is immortalized in       Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in which members       pledge that ``an armed attack against one or more of them in       Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against       them all''.        (2) For almost 7 decades, the principle of collective       defense has effectively served as a strategic deterrent for       the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization       and provided stability throughout the world, strengthening       the security of the United States and all 28 other member       nations.        (3) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in       New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the Alliance agreed       to invoke Article 5 for the first time, affirming its       commitment to collective defense.        (4) Countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization have made historic contributions and sacrifices       while combating terrorism in Afghanistan through the       International Security Assistance Force and the Resolute       Support Mission.        (5) The recent attacks in the United Kingdom underscore the       importance of an international alliance to combat hostile       nation states and terrorist groups.        (6) At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, the member countries       of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization decided that all       countries that are members of NATO would spend an amount       equal to 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense       by 2024.  [[Page S3528]]         (7) Collective defense unites the 29 members of the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization, each committing to protecting       and supporting one another from external adversaries, which       bolsters the North Atlantic Alliance.        (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--        (1) to express the vital importance of Article 5 of the       North Atlantic Treaty, the charter of the North Atlantic       Treaty Organization, as it continues to serve as a critical       deterrent to potential hostile nations and terrorist       organizations;        (2) to remember the first and only invocation of Article 5       by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in support of the       United States after the terrorist attacks of September 11,       2001;        (3) to affirm that the United States remains fully       committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will       honor its obligations enshrined in Article 5; and        (4) to condemn any threat to the sovereignty, territorial       integrity, freedom, or democracy of any country that is a       member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                              Amendment No. 255    Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  title amendment at the desk be agreed to.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The amendment (No. 255) was agreed to, as follows:         Amend the title so as to read:        ``An Act to Provide Congressional Review and to Counter       Iranian and Russian Governments' Aggression.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, April was National Minority Health Month.  I point that out because I have worked with many of my colleagues in  order to advance minority health.   We have done some very important things in recent years that I am  very proud of, and many of those are included in the Affordable Care  Act. I know that Senator Carper and Senator Blumenthal will be on the  floor; Senator Carper is here now. They have been instrumental in  advancing quality healthcare for all Americans, but we do recognize  that we have a special role in regard to historic discrimination on  minority health. I was pleased that the Affordable Care Act included  the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities so  that we could have a focal point at NIH to deal with the historic  problems and have a game plan to advance that.   I was also pleased that the Affordable Care Act provided coverage for  minorities in greater numbers because when we looked at the number of  uninsured, the number of minorities were a much higher percentage than  the general population of uninsured. When we looked at inadequate  coverage, we saw the same numbers. So we have made advancements.   In April, historically, I had filed a resolution in order to  acknowledge the progress we made and to continue our commitment to make  sure that all Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare  and that we do not discriminate. That resolution had always cleared  without any difficulty until 2017. For reasons I cannot explain, there  were Republican objections, and we were not able to adopt the  resolution commemorating minority health month.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of that  resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Promoting minority health awareness and supporting the       goals and ideals of National Minority Health Month in April       2017, which include bringing attention to the health       disparities faced by minority populations of the United       States such as American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asian       Americans, African Americans, Latino Americans, and Native       Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.        Whereas the origin of National Minority Health Month is       National Negro Health Week, established in 1915 by Dr. Booker       T. Washington;        Whereas the theme for National Minority Health Month in       2017 is ``Bridging Health Equity Across Communities'';        Whereas, through the National Stakeholder Strategy for       Achieving Health Equity and the HHS Action Plan to Reduce       Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, the Department of       Health and Human Services has set goals and strategies to       advance the safety, health, and well-being of the people of       the United States;        Whereas a study by the Joint Center for Political and       Economic Studies, entitled ``The Economic Burden of Health       Inequalities in the United States'', concludes that, between       2003 and 2006, the combined cost of health inequalities and       premature death in the United States was $1,240,000,000,000;        Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has       identified 6 main categories in which racial and ethnic       minorities experience the most disparate access to health       care and health outcomes, including infant mortality, cancer       screening and management, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,       HIV/AIDS, and immunizations;        Whereas, in 2012, African American women were as likely to       have been diagnosed with breast cancer as non-Latina White       women, but African American women were almost 40 percent more       likely to die from breast cancer than non-Latina White women;        Whereas African American women are twice as likely to lose       their lives to cervical cancer as non-Latina White women;        Whereas African American men are 60 percent more likely to       die from a stroke than non-Latino White men;        Whereas Latinos are 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed       with diabetes by a physician, and are 40 percent more likely       to die of diabetes, than non-Latino Whites;        Whereas Latino men are 3 times more likely to have HIV       infections or AIDS than non-Latino White men;        Whereas Latina women are 4 times more likely to have AIDS       than non-Latina White women;        Whereas, in 2014, although African Americans represented       only 13 percent of the population of the United States,       African Americans accounted for 43 percent of HIV infections;        Whereas, in 2010, African American youth accounted for an       estimated 57 percent, and  [[Page S3538]]       Latino youth accounted for an estimated 20 percent, of all       new HIV infections among youth in the United States;        Whereas, between 2005 and 2014, the number of Asian       Americans diagnosed with HIV increased by nearly 70 percent;        Whereas, in 2014, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders       were 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV than non-      Latino whites;        Whereas Native Hawaiians living in the State of Hawaii are       5.7 times more likely to die of diabetes than non-Latino       Whites living in Hawaii;        Whereas Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are 30       percent more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than non-      Latino whites;        Whereas, although the prevalence of obesity is high among       all population groups in the United States, 42 percent of       American Indian and Alaskan Natives, 41 percent of Native       Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, 40 percent of African       Americans, 31 percent of Latinos, 24 percent of non-Latino       whites, and 11 percent of Asian Americans are obese;        Whereas, in 2013, Asian Americans were 1.2 times more       likely than non-Latino Whites to contract Hepatitis A;        Whereas, among all ethnic groups in 2013, Asian Americans       and Pacific Islanders had the highest incidence of Hepatitis       A;        Whereas Asian American women are 1.3 times more likely than       non-Latina Whites to die from viral hepatitis;        Whereas Asian Americans are 3 times more likely than non-      Latino Whites to develop chronic Hepatitis B;        Whereas of the children living with diagnosed perinatal HIV       in 2014, 65 percent were African American, 15 percent were       Latino Americans, and 11 percent were non-Latino whites;        Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has       identified heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes as       some of the leading causes of death among American Indians       and Alaskan Natives;        Whereas American Indians and Alaskan Natives die from       diabetes, alcoholism, unintentional injuries, homicide, and       suicide at higher rates than other people in the United       States;        Whereas American Indians and Alaskan Natives have a life       expectancy that is 4.4 years shorter than the life expectancy       of the overall population of the United States;        Whereas African American babies are 3.5 times more likely       than non-Latino White babies to die due to complications       related to low birth weight;        Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Native babies are twice       as likely as non-Latino White babies to die from sudden       infant death syndrome;        Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Natives have 1.5 times       the infant mortality rate as that of non-Latino whites;        Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Native babies are 70       percent more likely to die from accidental deaths before       their first birthday than non-Latino White babies;        Whereas only 5 percent of Native Hawaiian and Pacific       Islanders, 6 percent of Asian Americans, 8 percent of       Latinos, 9 percent of African Americans, and 14 percent of       American Indians and Alaska Natives received mental health       treatment or counseling in the past year, compared to 18       percent of non-Latino whites;        Whereas marked differences in the social determinants of       health, described by the World Health Organization as ``the       high burden of illness responsible for appalling premature       loss of life'' that ``arises in large part because of the       conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and       age'', lead to poor health outcomes and declines in       longevity;        Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act       (Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 119)--        (1) has reduced the uninsured rate for minority communities       by at least 35 percent;        (2) has helped further combat health disparities for low-      income individuals through coverage expansions in the       Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) and the individual health insurance       marketplaces; and        (3) provides specific protections and rights for American       Indians and Alaskan Natives, 21.4 percent of whom lack health       insurance;        Whereas, despite the substantial improvements in health       insurance coverage among women overall, women of color are       more likely to be uninsured;        Whereas, in 2012, 36 percent of Latina women, 29 percent of       American Indian women, 23 percent of African American women,       19 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women, and 14       percent of non-Latina White women were uninsured;        Whereas community-based health care initiatives, such as       prevention-focused programs, present a unique opportunity to       use innovative approaches to improve health practices across       the United States and to sharply reduce disparities among       racial and ethnic minority populations: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of       National Minority Health Month in April 2017, which include       bringing attention to the severe health disparities faced by       minority populations in the United States, such as American       Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, African Americans,       Latino Americans, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific       Islanders.     I thank Senators Menendez, Blumenthal, Brown, Hirono,  Markey, Klobuchar, Van Hollen, Booker, Peters, Duckworth, and Carper  for their help in regard to minority health and the resolution.
