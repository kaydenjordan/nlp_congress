 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Cornyn and Gardner ask counsel for the  President:         What are the consequences to the Presidency, the       President's constitutional role as the head of the executive       branch, and the advice the President can expect from his       senior advisers, if the Senate seeks to resolve claims of       executive privilege for subpoenas in this impeachment trial       without any determination by an article III court?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the Senators for the  question.   The Supreme Court has recognized that the confidentiality of  communications with the President is essential--keeping those  communications confidential is essential for the proper functioning of  the government.   In Nixon v. United States, the court explained that this privilege is  grounded in the separation of powers and essential for the functioning  of the executive for this reason: In order to receive candid advice,  the President has to be able to be sure that those who are speaking  with him have the confidence that what they say is not going to be  revealed, that their advice can remain confidential. If it is not  confidential, they would temper what they are saying; they wouldn't be  candid with the President; and the President, then, would not be able  to get the best advice.  [[Page S655]]    It is the same concern that underpins the deliberative process aspect  of executive privilege. Even if it is not a communication directly with  the President, if it is the deliberative process within the executive  branch, people have to be able, before coming up with a decision, to  discuss alternatives, to probe what other ways might work to address  the problem, and to discuss them candidly and openly, not with the  feeling that the first thing they say is going to be on the front page  of the Washington Post the next day, because if you don't have the  confidence that what you are saying is going to be kept confidential,  you will not be candid, you will not give your best advice, and that  damages decision-making. It is bad for the government, and it is bad  for the people of the United States because it means the government and  the executive branch can't function efficiently.   So there is a critical need for the executive to be able to have  these privileges and to protect them, and that is why the Supreme Court  recognized that in Nixon v. United States and pointed out that there  has to be some very high showing of need from another branch of  government if there is going to be any breach of that privilege.   That is why there is an accommodations process. The courts have said  that, when the Congress and the legislature seek information from the  executive and the executive has confidentiality interests, both  branches are under an obligation to try to come to some accommodation  to address the interests of both branches. But it is not a situation of  simply that the Congress is supreme and can demand information from the  executive and the executive must present everything. The courts have  made that clear, because that would be damaging to the functioning of  government.   So here, in this case, there are vital interests at stake. And one of  the potential witnesses that the House managers have raised again and  again is John Bolton. John Bolton was a National Security Advisor to  the President. He has all of the Nation's secrets from the time that he  was the National Security Advisor, and that is precisely the area, the  field, in which the Supreme Court suggested, in Nixon v. United States,  there might be something approaching an absolute privilege of  confidentiality in communications with the President: the fields of  national security and foreign affairs. That is the crown jewel of  executive privilege.   So to suggest that the National Security Advisor--well, we will just  subpoena him, and he will come in; that will be easy; there will not be  any problem--that is not the way it would work because there is a vital  constitutional privilege at stake there, and it is important for the  institution of the Office of the Presidency, for every President, to  protect that privilege, because once precedents start to be set--if one  President says: Well, I will not insist on the privilege then; I will  let people interview this person; I will not insist on the immunity-- that sets precedent. Then the next time, when it is important to  preserve the privilege, the precedent is raised, and the privilege has  been weakened--and is forever weakened--and that damages the  functioning of government.   So this is a very serious issue to consider. It is important. The  Supreme Court has made it clear for the proper functioning of the  executive branch, for the proper functioning of our government. And  there would be grave issues raised attempting to have a National  Security Advisor to the President come under subpoena to testify. That  would all have to be dealt with, and that would take some time before  things would continue.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Hawaii.
