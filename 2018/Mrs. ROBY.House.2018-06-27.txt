 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for  H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act.   Over the last year and a half, our unified government has taken the  necessary steps to unleash the economy and foster growth here in the  United States. Because of this work, our economy is strong today.   Now we must do the work required to ensure that our military is  strong, too, especially after the damaging sequestration cuts and  funding limitations placed on our military by the previous  administration. As a member of the Defense Subcommittee of the  Appropriations Committee, I have been proud to have a seat at the table  through this process. I appreciate the leadership of Chairwoman Kay  Granger as we work to properly fund our military.   I am grateful to serve Alabama's Second District that is home to  Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base and Fort Rucker. I am proud that this  bill provides the resources to support their critical missions.   Mr. Speaker, one of Congress' most fundamental constitutional  responsibilities is to provide for the common defense. This bill  fulfills that responsibility and ensures that our military remains the  tip of the spear. I will proudly vote for H.R. 6157 to properly fund  our military.                            ____________________
