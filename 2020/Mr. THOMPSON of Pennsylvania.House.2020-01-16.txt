 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Braden Zukowski of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. Braden is a  high school senior at Knoch High School. He is the son of Brad Zukowski  and Shauna Braun-Zukowski.   I am pleased to announce that Braden recently accepted a fully  qualified appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis,  Maryland.   Braden is a shining example of what leadership looks like. His hard  work and dedication to excellence in and out of the classroom are the  qualities that will make him a great midshipman. I am confident that he  will continue to excel during his time at the Naval Academy.   Not only is Braden a leader in the classroom, he has also excelled in  sports, serving as captain of the Knoch High School swim and cross  country teams. He is also an active member of the chemistry, Spanish,  history, and robotics clubs, as well as a National Honor Society  member.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Braden's decision to join our Nation's Armed  Forces, and I wish him the best of luck in his new venture.                            ____________________
