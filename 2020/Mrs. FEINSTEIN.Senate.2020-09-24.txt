 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  to stop the fraudulent sales of guns online. While some technology  companies have banned selling of firearms and ammunition on their  websites, the problem persists.   For example, Facebook banned selling firearms. Nonetheless, between  last April and June, it reportedly still had to remove 1.3 million  pieces of content from its website that violated Facebook's terms of  service related to gun sales.   In order to circumvent the terms of service, sellers are using new  tactics, like misrepresenting guns as ``stickers,'' to get around these  restrictions.   An August 24, Wall Street Journal article explored how gun sellers  are specifically using this new tactic on Facebook's Marketplace.   According to the article, sellers are using ``a new tactic [that]  involves posts purporting to sell stickers, alongside images of gun  makers' logos.''   However, when contacted, these sellers admitted that they're actually  selling guns.   Even more troubling, the article said the recent ``boom'' in  Americans buying guns ``has been attributed to the new coronavirus  pandemic, civil unrest related to the killing of George Floyd and  efforts in some cities to defund the police.''   As a result, there has been a recent spike in failed background  checks.   Politico reported in July that: ``The number of people trying to buy  guns who can't legally own them has skyrocketed.''   For example, in February, the background check system blocked 9,700  sales.   In March, the system blocked 23,692 gun sales--more than double the  previous month and the previous March.   The bill I'm introducing today addresses this problem by making it  illegal for gun sellers to circumvent websites' terms of service as yet  another way to avoid a background check.   It would make it a Federal crime to sell guns on websites like  Facebook ``by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations  of promises.'' Doing so would be a felony with a maximum of five years  in prison and a $250,000 fine.   I also want to thank Senator Menendez for joining with me to  introduce this legislation.   His efforts to keep technology companies accountable for the  proliferation of firearms on their platforms has been vital in  addressing the problem.   Our bill today is part of a larger effort that needs to be taken to  stop the plague of gun violence hurting this country.   But I hope others will join us in this commonsense effort.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms.          Klobuchar, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Reed):   S. 4732. A bill to conduct a study on the spread of COVID-19-related  disinformation and misinformation on the internet and social media  platforms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
