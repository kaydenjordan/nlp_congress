 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  a truly great public servant. Mr. Bradley Karmen served 41 years at the  Department of Agriculture, most recently as associate deputy  administrator of Farm Programs at the Farm Service Agency.   Put in perspective, President Lincoln established the Department of  Agriculture in 1862, and Brad Karmen worked there for nearly one-third  of the Department's entire existence.   Ironically, Brad is a city kid, having grown up on Long Island. He  would be the first to tell you he knew nothing about agriculture or the  Federal farm policy that he would help fashion over the course of  nearly a half century. It is not an exaggeration to say that no  regulation cleared the Farm Service Agency or farm law was enacted  without Brad's careful eye and wise counsel.   Madam Speaker, I don't know how a Long Island kid with no knowledge  of agriculture or farm policy came to dedicate his professional career  to helping the American farmer, but I am sure grateful he did.   Thank you, Brad, for your distinguished career of public service.  Godspeed.                            ____________________
