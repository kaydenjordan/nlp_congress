 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 667, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3312) to amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act to specify when bank holding companies may be  subject to certain enhanced supervision, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.

SEC. 5. EXISTING ASSESSMENT TERMINATION SCHEDULE.         (a) Temporary Extension of Existing Assessment.--        (1) In general.--Each bank holding company that, on the day       that is 24 months following the date of the enactment of this       Act, has total consolidated assets equal to or greater than       $50,000,000,000, has not been identified as a global       systemically important bank holding company pursuant to       section 217.402 of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, and       has not been subjected to a determination under subsection       (l) of section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act, shall be subject to assessments by       the Secretary of the Treasury to the same extent as a bank       holding company that has been so identified or subjected.        (2) Considerations.--In making assessments pursuant to       paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury shall take into       account differences among the bank holding companies subject       to such assessment, based on the considerations for       establishing the prudential standards under section 115 of       the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act       (12 U.S.C. 5325).        (3) Limitation on amount of assessments.--The aggregate       amount collected pursuant to paragraph (1) from all bank       holding companies assessed under such paragraph shall be       $58,000,000.        (4) Payment period options.--The Secretary of the Treasury       shall offer the option of payments spread out before the end       of the 48-month period following the date of the enactment of       this Act, or shorter periods including the option of a one-      time payment, at the discretion of each bank holding company       paying assessments pursuant to paragraph (1).        (5) Assessments to be made in addition to any other       assessments.--The assessments collected pursuant to paragraph       (1) shall be in addition to, and not as a replacement of, any       assessments required under any other law.        (b) Treatment Upon Determination.--A bank holding company       assessed under this section shall no longer be subject to       such assessments in the event it is identified as a global       systemically important bank holding company pursuant to       section 217.402 of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, or       subjected to a determination under subsection (l) of section       165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act. Any prior payments made by such a banking       holding company pursuant to an assessment under this section       shall be nonrefundable.       SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The amendments made by this Act shall take effect after the       end of the 18-month period following the date of the       enactment of this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for  1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Financial Services.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Al Green) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 3312, the  Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017.   This very important piece of legislation was introduced by my friend,  Mr. Luetkemeyer, who serves as chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee,  and is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Members of the House. In  fact, Mr. Speaker, the bill was approved in October by the Financial  Services Committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 47-12, so  strong, Mr. Speaker, that even a majority of Democrats on the committee  voted to support the bill.   This bill reforms what Republicans and now many Democrats acknowledge  is a flawed and arbitrary framework under the Dodd-Frank Act to  designate so-called systemically important financial institutions, also  known as SIFIs. In fact, one of those Democrats who acknowledges that  it is a flawed and arbitrary framework is none other than former  chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, the  very Frank of Dodd-Frank, the coauthor of the Dodd-Frank Act. He,  himself, has said that this provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that many  of us are trying to reform today is ``arbitrary'' and ``a mistake.''  Those are his words, Mr. Speaker, not mine.   That arbitrary and mistaken provision is Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits- all standard that subjects banks with $50 billion or more in assets to  the same costly and cumbersome SIFI regulatory standards as trillion- dollar global systemically important institutions.   We should take note that this flawed standard has now been criticized  by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve Board  Governor Dan Tarullo, former Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry,  and many other Obama appointees. In other words, Mr. Speaker, it is  that bad.   Mr. Luetkemeyer's bipartisan bill--again, very strong bipartisan  bill--replaces this inflexible, flawed, $50 billion threshold that has  been criticized by so many with a series of well-established, critical  standards that more accurately measure systemic importance.                                time  1515    Specifically, his legislation requires the Federal Reserve to review  a financial institution's size, interconnectedness, global cross- jurisdictional activity, and complexity, before determining whether the  institution should be subject to heightened SIFI regulatory standards.   In other words, this bipartisan bill tailors regulations based on a  bank's  [[Page H10222]]  actual level of risk, instead of Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all system  that ensnares smaller regional and midsize banks that, essentially,  have simple community bank lending models. These banks are not globally  complex Wall Street banks and shouldn't be treated the same.   It simply doesn't make sense to subject small regional and midsize  banks with only $50 billion in assets to the same expensive and  cumbersome SIFI regulatory regime as a bank like JPMorgan Chase, which  has $2.5 trillion in assets. Based on size alone, the $50 billion bank  is just 2 percent, 2 percent of JPMorgan Chase's size.   What does make sense, Mr. Speaker, is to base the regulation of these  financial institutions on their actual risk profile rather than their  asset size alone, which is exactly what Mr. Luetkemeyer's strongly  bipartisan bill will do.   Now, while I personally do not support the SIFI architecture at all  and do not believe any financial institution in America should be  designated too big to fail, it is important that we always continue to  work to find bipartisan reforms where we can find them and improve  current law, and the legislation before us today represents a good  faith effort to do exactly that.   Let's keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, this is simply not a debate over an  arcane definition in law. It is about the real world effect these  regulations have on the U.S. economy and the working men and women whom  we represent.   Let me share with my colleagues what the Small Business and  Entrepreneurship Council has to say about the importance of the bill  that we are debating today: ``Access to working and growth capital  remains a challenge for many entrepreneurs and small businesses. H.R.  3312 would improve the lending environment and unleash capital by  alleviating inappropriate requirements imposed on regional and midsize  banks under Dodd-Frank. Midsize and regional banks, which many startups  and small businesses have counted on for lending, have been negatively  affected by this Dodd-Frank arbitrary trigger.''   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. They deserve a  healthy economy with growing paychecks, better jobs, and a brighter  future. It is time to restore economic growth fueled by capital flowing  from America's banks to American communities across our Nation.   So I urge my colleagues to correct this widely acknowledged mistake  in Dodd-Frank, even acknowledged by former Congressman Barney Frank  himself, and put into place real, discernible, critical standards, and  help our struggling small businesses on Main Street. Let's pass H.R.  3312.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott).   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as the Democratic lead on  this bill, it is very important for me to point out that I worked very  closely with Chairman Barney Frank and the Obama administration, both  of which admitted at the time that it was a mistake, a blunt  instrument, to be able to just put an arbitrary figure of $50 billion  and say they are a threat to our financial stability.   No. Our banking system deserves better than that. The American people  deserve better than that. It is not the amount of money that you have  got in your assets that caused the problem; it was what they were doing  that caused the exposure.   So we want to substitute the $50 billion to make sure that we have a  five-point test that the Feds will give that will be able to determine  if they are a threat to our security and then tailor a program of  advanced supervision that would prevent them from causing us this  problem.   It is a great bill. It is time we corrected it, and I ask all of my  colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to do the right thing for  the American people, and let's have a resounding ``yes'' vote for this  SIFI bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who is the Republican sponsor of the  legislation and the chairman of our Financial Services Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chairwoman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, in order to better balance the time on  each side, may I inquire if my colleague anticipates having speakers on  the bill.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I do anticipate additional  speakers, and I will be making comments myself.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to yield me  time?   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Pardon?    Is the gentleman prepared to yield me time?   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield time. Yes, of course.    Is the gentleman prepared to yield me time?   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield time. Yes, of course.    How much time does the gentleman yield me?   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield.    I inquire of the gentleman how much time is he  yielding? I don't wish to be cut off.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield you such time as I may deem necessary,  if you will take time.   Well, you may use your own time.    I am going to respectfully decline the opportunity.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the arbitrary numbers that they  have they don't care to defend.   Let's talk about the one-size-fits-all accusation, if you will.   Mr. Speaker, I have a source, and it is the Department of the  Treasury, which indicates that we have a tiered system, and we actually  have five different tiers. These tiers will allow banks to be  classified as small, midsize, regional, international active, and G- SIBs.                                time  1545    There is a tiering system, but within the tiering system, we have  given the regulators the authority to tailor rules to fit banks within  the system.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague mentioned institution failure. I was here.  I know what happened in 2008. I understand why we have Dodd-Frank. We  don't have Dodd-Frank because Mr. Dodd and Mr. Frank woke up one  morning and decided that they would like to regulate banks to the  extent that they were regulated.   We have Dodd-Frank because we had a crisis. We had Dodd-Frank  developed because of exotic products, the 327s and the 228s, which had  teaser rates that would allow persons to get into loans that had fixed  rates for 3 years or 2 years, and then they would have 27 years of  variable rates or 28 years of variable rates.   This was the exotic product that a good many people had and could not  get out of because, quite frankly, they also had a prepayment penalty  that would coincide with these teaser rates.   It was a time of great crisis for banking.   We also had the so-called credit default swaps, which were just  another way of laying off bets. Banks found clever ways to lay off  their bets that they thought were risky.   We had no-doc loans, negative amortization. You could pay as much as  you wanted and would add to the principal what you didn't pay, which  means that you would end up paying a lot more for your loan than you  initially started out owing.   We had interest-only loans: just pay the interest, let the loan  continue to increase in value.   There was no firewall between commercial banking and investment  banking. They finally got Glass-Steagall. Took them decades to do it,  but they did.   Then we had the dastardly yield spread premium, which would allow the  person who was servicing you, the loan originator, to qualify you for a  loan at 5 percent, come out and shake your hand and say: Good news, you  now have a loan for 10 percent.   That was all lawful, but Dodd-Frank ended all of this.   We have Dodd-Frank because we had a deregulation era, very much  comparable to what we are about to go through now. Banks were regulated  to the extent that they couldn't do all of these things, but we  deregulated, just as we are about to do it now, and we will get back to  the future, where banks will not have the liquidity necessary, where  the credit risk that they take will be unreasonable.   This is a bill that belongs on the trash heap of history. I adamantly  oppose the bill. I believe that it is time for us to take the stand  that the American people want us to take, not the stand that the big  banks would have us take.   This is a big bank bonus. The big banks love this bill. Thirty banks  are going to be relieved of their obligation to let us know how to put  them out of their misery in the event that they are about to bring the  banking system down. Thirty banks. These are big banks, $500 billion  max. Big banks.   These banks will continue to give us their stress test so that we can  know what their liquidity is and understand their credit worthiness by  virtue of the loans that they make.   This bill is what the big banks want, but not the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, first I would like to  thank Congressman Green for his leadership. He is a member of the  Financial Services Committee, who is dedicated to the proposition that  we can and should work very hard to implement Dodd-Frank.   He has done a wonderful job in representing all of the people of this  country when it comes to this issue of whether or not we are going to  allow the biggest banks in this country to revert back to the practices  that they have been involved in historically, where it caused us to be  into a situation that caused the recession in 2008 or whether or not we  are going to honor the work of Dodd-Frank and the reforms that were  instituted and be about the business of fairness and justice.   I want to thank Mr. Green for his work, for his leadership, and for  managing this most important legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3312, the Systemic  Risk Designation Improvement Act.   At a time when big banks are doing very well and the industry made  record profits--more than $171 billion last year--and business lending  has increased 75 percent since Dodd-Frank was signed into law, now is  not the time to eliminate critical safeguards and reduce oversight of  many of our largest banks.   H.R. 3312 will roll back the enhanced prudential standards that  currently apply to the 30 of the largest banks with more than $50  billion in assets. These are some of the most important  [[Page H10226]]  rules in Dodd-Frank, like enhanced capital and stress testing that are  critical to maintaining a safe and sound banking system that supports  the broader economy.   Proponents of this bill argue that Dodd-Frank imposed a one-size- fits-all approach to any bank over $50 billion. But the law makes clear  that the Fed should tier and tailor its rules to differentiate between  even these large banks ``on an individual basis or by category, taking  into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity,  financial activities (including the financial activities of their  subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board  of Governors deems appropriate.''   There is no one-size-fits-all mandate and the Fed has indeed tailored  these rules. For example, the prudential rules for a trillion-dollar  bank are much tougher compared to those that apply to a $250 billion  bank and considerably more so compared to a $50 billion bank.   Yet, after 18 months, this bill would exempt 30 of our largest banks  from enhanced oversight, and it replaces the $50 billion threshold with  a cumbersome, discretionary process led by the Federal Reserve along  with the FSOC. We have a similar process for designating non-bank  financial bank companies, like AIG, which have posed a systemic risk.  So it is strange that Republicans are now pushing a similar approach  after they repeatedly blasted the same FSOC designation process for  being arbitrary, opaque, unfair, and unworkable.   Those designations were heavily litigated, if not blocked in court,  as these new designations by the Federal Reserve and the FSOC would  likely be. Currently, there is only one non-bank designated by the FSOC  through this process, so we should expect there would be hardly any  designations through H.R. 3312.   Who are these 30 massive banks that stand to benefit?   These banks collectively hold more than $5 trillion in assets or one- fourth of all banking assets in the United States. Of the 30 banks, 12  of them are foreign banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Credit  Suisse, and UBS. These banks have violated a wide range of U.S. laws,  including anti-money laundering and unlawful trading practices, so I  have no clue why Congress should even consider doing those banks any  favors.   For all the talk about helping out small community banks that serve  our customers well in our rural and underserved neighborhoods, there is  not a single provision that helps out these thousands of community  banks and their customers. While some characterize this bill as helping  ``medium-sized'' banks, the medium-sized bank has only about $200  million in assets or roughly 250 times less than the massive banks that  benefit by this bill.   More troubling, instead of helping community banks, the bill would  make it easier for the largest banks to acquire smaller ones,  accelerating a 30-year consolidation trend.   Reasonable people can disagree on how best to dial up or down some of  these enhanced standards and tier them more effectively--and I know my  colleagues have good intentions--but this proposal goes way, way too  far in reversing strong oversight of the Nation's largest banks. Even a  Senate bill that resembles Chairman Hensarling's ``Wrong Choice Act''  is far less aggressive, raising the $50 billion threshold to $250  billion, although even that proposal would be damaging.   Let me close by emphasizing that H.R. 3312 represents one of the  largest rollbacks of sensible rules for many of our largest banks,  including a dozen foreign banks, at a time when the industry is making  record profits, and such a bill would hurt and make it harder for  community banks to compete.   For these reasons, I strongly urge Members to oppose this bill, H.R.  3312.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, what is the amount of time  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green) has  10\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling)  has 11 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Financial  Services Committee and our Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a very hardworking member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I might point out to the ranking member  that she should read her mail, since I responded to her letter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson), a hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I happen to have the letter in my hand.  I would be happy to share it with the ranking member if she has  misfiled it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  GOTTHEIMER), a Democratic colleague.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas, for  coming to the floor. I know how busy he is with his impeachment  activities, so we are glad he has had an opportunity to come and share  his views on this particular bill.   He spent a lot of time telling us who wasn't for the bill, but he  didn't tell us who was for it. And I would, once again, inform my  friend, my colleague from Texas, that not only is every single  Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee for this  bill, but a majority of the Democrats on the committee are for this  bill. Perhaps that is why he could find so few Democrats to speak out  against it.   So what we have heard, Mr. Speaker, is my colleague and the ranking  member vociferously defend the whole idea that there should be  institutions that are too big to fail. As they defend the Dodd-Frank  Act, Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that, yet again, the big  banks have gotten bigger. Under their regulatory scheme, the big banks  have gotten bigger and the communities banks have become fewer.   And now what they are telling us is: Oh, no, we have got to protect  this regime.   Well, I don't believe in it. But what I do believe in, Mr. Speaker,  and what Mr. Luetkemeyer believes in, is that we need to try to find  some bipartisan solutions, some common ground, to try to make some  common sense out of some of these regulations.   What is fascinating to me is so many of the Obama-era regulators have  said this $50 billion threshold makes no sense. Usually, my Democratic  colleagues will quote Mr. Tarullo, they  [[Page H10229]]  will quote Janet Yellen, or they will quote Mr. Curry. Well, all of  them have said that the $50 billion threshold is essentially arbitrary  and does not work.   So, at the end of the day, what it is doing, Mr. Speaker, is putting  in an additional regulatory burden on banks that pose no systemic risk  to our economy, making it more difficult to extend credit to  hardworking Americans who need it. But for people who just voted  against tax relief for hardworking Americans, I guess that is what I  would expect.   Now they want to make sure that they don't have tax relief, they  don't have mortgages, and they don't have credit cards. That is what  they are defending, Mr. Speaker, and it is wrong.   On a bipartisan basis, today, I believe we are going to vote for H.R.  3312 and make some sense out of this SIFI rule, and we will have a  better America tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 667, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. For what purpose does the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Al Green) seek recognition?   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind my colleague  that he will have another chance to vote on impeachment and to ask for  a recorded vote.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not recognized for debate.   The question now is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on passage of H.R. 3312 will be followed by 5-minute votes  on:   The motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1536, by the  yeas and nays; and   Agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 288,  nays 130, not voting 13, as follows:                               [Roll No. 694]                                 YEAS--288       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Beatty      Bera      Bergman      Beyer      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Blunt Rochester      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (IN)      Brown (MD)      Brownley (CA)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Cardenas      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Clay      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Connolly      Cook      Cooper      Correa      Costa      Costello (PA)      Courtney      Cramer      Crawford      Crist      Cuellar      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Delaney      Demings      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Esty (CT)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foster      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Gonzalez (TX)      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gottheimer      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green, Gene      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Heck      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
