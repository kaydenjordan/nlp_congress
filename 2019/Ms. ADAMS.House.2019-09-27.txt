 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate a  talented young woman who has served as my chief of staff for North  Carolina's 12th District for nearly 5 years, Rhonda E. Foxx.   While her career path will be taking on a new chapter beyond my  office, without question, Rhonda has been an extraordinary and  extremely valued member of my leadership team.   An energetic, innovative, creative thinker, Rhonda's bold leadership  and talented initiatives guided Team Adams to cultivate new  possibilities in higher education, diversity, and tech; as well as  signature cooperative-inclusive partnerships between students and  businesses and corporate and tech sectors, and historically Black  colleges.   I, along with the entire Adams team, our stakeholders and our many  partners are grateful for her leadership and her service, and extend to  Rhonda E. Foxx our best wishes, and Godspeed.   Mr. Speaker, I say, well done, Rhonda. I thank her.                            ____________________
