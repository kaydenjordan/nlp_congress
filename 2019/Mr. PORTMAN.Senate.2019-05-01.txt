 Mr. President, I would like to join my colleague from  Iowa and my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Scott, to talk about  opportunity zones.   Senator Scott has shown incredible leadership on this issue. He has a  big heart, and he has a passion for dealing with communities that have  been left behind.   The tax reform bill we passed is doing a great job in growing the  economy. If you look at the numbers, they are unbelievable. In the  first quarter, there was a 3.2-percent economic growth. That is exactly  twice what was projected by the Congressional Budget Office, a  nonpartisan group in Congress, before tax reform was passed. Now tax  reform has passed, and growth is twice as fast.   By the way, the same is true with job creation. Over the last year,  we have created twice as many jobs as was projected before tax reform  was passed. There is no question but that tax reform has helped  stimulate development, helped stimulate economic growth, and helped  stimulate jobs. Actually, what is most exciting to me is that it has  also increased wages for people in Ohio and around the country.   Wages have increased higher in the last year than they have in the  previous decade. You have to go back to before the great recession to  find wage growth like we have seen. Wage growth is great across the  board, but it is particularly encouraging that there is slightly more  wage growth among what is called nonsupervisory jobs--think about  middle-class jobs and blue-collar jobs. So this thing is working, and  it is working well.   However, the fact is, the prosperity we are seeing is not evenly  spread. There are some communities that haven't recovered since the  great recession, and those are the communities--low-income communities  that have been stubbornly poverty stricken--that the enterprise zones  and opportunity zones are meant to focus on. It is a critical tool, and  it is in the tax legislation. It is designed to help encourage  investment and therefore job creation in these communities.   As I was listening to others talk earlier, they talked about States  that are identifying urban communities and rural communities that are  most in need. I will tell you that in my State of Ohio, we now have  320--320--census tracts that have been identified. When I am traveling  around the State, it doesn't take me long to find one of these census  tracts and to talk with people who are excited about it.   It allows investors and companies to defer paying these capital gains  taxes, and, in some cases, if they make a commitment for long enough to  invest additional money, they can avoid the capital gains tax  altogether. This is working, and over time it is going to create more  investment in these communities.   Throughout the past year, I have been traveling to Ohio and talking  to people about this. In Youngstown, OH, and in Cleveland, OH, we had  roundtable meetings with investors, businesses, and community leaders,  and what I have heard is that people are excited about it. They think  there is great potential here. To ensure that it works like it is  supposed to work, we have to make sure everybody is involved, and that  does include economic developers and all levels of government, not just  the businesses and investors who are interested in getting the tax  incentives. We have to work together to make sure these programs work  and do expand opportunities in these communities.  [[Page S2550]]    By the way, I want to highlight the promising work Ohio has done to  bring everyone to the table to ensure that happens. Specifically, last  week, Governor DeWine announced the creation of a new website to serve  as a one-stop shop for businesses, investors, and economic development  officials who are looking to invest in Ohio's opportunity zones. The  website includes an interactive map that shows investors where the  projects are around the State, streamlining the flow of capital into  these areas that need it most. These are the kinds of things we need to  be able to ensure that this works properly.   I am also encouraged by the ongoing implementation of this program by  Secretary Mnuchin and the Department of Treasury. Since the  implementation process began, I have been urging the Secretary to issue  taxpayer-friendly regulations and rules with regard to this. In other  words, look at our intent--what we intended to do--which is, again, to  create more jobs and economic opportunities in these zones. This  includes a letter we sent, which was bicameral--meaning both the House  and the Senate--and bipartisan to Treasury that named a number of  concerns we had about where we were up to that point in terms of the  regulations. We asked for some further guidance on a number of  threshold questions that investors were asking about, including  clarifying an onerous proposal that was out there that opportunity zone  businesses have to make 50 percent of their revenues within their  specific zones. That doesn't make sense for some businesses. I mean,  think about a restaurant that is going to be built in an opportunity  zone. If they don't get 50 percent of the revenue from people who live  in that community, that is not necessarily a bad thing. We want to be  sure they are hiring people from that community, but it may be that  this 50-percent rule does not work for all of these businesses,  including the ones that are going to sell to the outside or maybe even  sell to other countries from an opportunity zone.   A few weeks ago, Treasury issued a second set of regulations that  took important steps to responding to each of the requests we laid out  in our January letter. I am pleased to see that, specifically, they  addressed the 50-percent revenue requirement, providing safe harbors  that seem to allow operating businesses to generate revenue outside of  their opportunity zones without the risk of losing those tax  incentives. Again, I commend the Secretary and the Department for  taking these steps. We need that kind of certainty in order to ensure  we take full advantage of this great opportunity. With the release of  these new regulations, many more investors are going to have certainty  to start making these investments in struggling communities throughout  Ohio.   Overall, I am excited about the benefits of this new tax incentive,  and I am committed to doing everything I can do to make sure Ohio  communities benefit from it.   Thank you.   I yield back my time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia, who just  gave us some great memories about Dick Lugar--one of the truly great  Senators who served here in the last half century. He was a friend and  was someone whom so many of us looked up to.   One of the things he did that was special to Ohio was that he became  totally devoted to his college, Denison University. He served on the  board until his death. He was the longest serving board member ever, I  am sure. He not only served on the board, but he showed up. Denison  University, which is in my State of Ohio, is very grateful for his  service, and as a neighbor from Indiana, again, I miss him, and I  appreciate him.                       Remembering Joseph H. Head, Jr.    Mr. President, I am here to take a moment to pay honor to a mentor of  mine who was also one of the great Ohioans, Joseph H. Head, Jr., who  was known for his leadership, for his unwavering loyalty to his city of  Cincinnati, OH--my hometown--for his vision, and for all of his  contributions. He was a tireless contributor to our community. In fact,  I would describe Joe as a kind of one-person chamber of commerce for  Greater Cincinnati. He loved his city, and he loved to help young  people. I was a beneficiary of that.   I first met Joe when I was either in junior high school or just  getting into high school. As usual, he was very direct. He came up to  me and asked me about my future. I had no idea what my future was going  to be.   He asked: Have you ever been to a law firm?   I said: No, I have not.   None of my family had been lawyers, and I hadn't had any experience  with that.   He said: Why don't you borrow a tie from your father and come down to  my law firm.   What do you say to that?   So I said: Yes, I will do that.   I remember I was a little intimidated, but I went downtown with my  tie on--it was a little bit long for me--and I had an interesting visit  with Joe Head.   Then, when I was in college, Joe Head gave me my first job in  politics. It was an internship with then-Congressman Bill Gradison. Joe  Head had been the chairman of his efforts and suggested that I work for  him.   Bill Gradison was a Republican from my hometown, and 16 years later,  I succeeded him in Congress. Trust me, I had no clue that I was going  do that at the time I interned for him, but that door was opened by Joe  Head.   I went on to practice international trade law after going to law  school. Again, a lot of that was because of Joe Head, being exposed to  the law through him. I then came back to Cincinnati and worked in his  law firm, Graydon Head & Ritchey, where he was managing partner.   Lo and behold, George H.W. Bush got elected President and asked me to  come to Washington to work in the White House as Associate Counsel to  the President. Joe Head encouraged me to do that, but he also  encouraged me to come home when I was done. In fact, at the farewell  party sending me off to Washington from the law firm, there was a large  card that was presented to me, and Joe Head wrote on that card: ``Come  home when you are done.'' That was great advice, maybe some of the best  advice I ever took, because I did go home, went back to the law firm,  and became a partner in that law firm.   I had not expected to run for Congress, but, again, Bill Gradison had  resigned unexpectedly, and Joe Head, of course, chaired my campaign.   He was a guy who didn't just benefit people like me; he benefited  everybody in Greater Cincinnati because he was so involved throughout  his life.   In 2016, he and his wife Louise were honored with the Jake Davis  Award from the Greater Cincinnati Foundation. That is a big deal. It is  an annual award given to only one community-minded citizen or couple  who volunteer their time and leadership skills to make Greater  Cincinnati a better place to live and to work. Joe certainly lived up  to that.   Just a couple months ago, Joe also received another big honor, and  that was the highest honor of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of  Commerce called the Great Living Cincinnatian Award. I had the honor of  being there to watch him receive that award. He received it for his  community service, his leadership, and his lifetime of helping others  in the community--all of his distinguished accomplishments.   Joe also served his country. Prior to his service to our community,  he served in Germany with the U.S. Army's artillery division for a  couple of years. He also had the Midas touch in law and in business,  both as the  [[Page S2557]]  managing partner at the Graydon Head & Ritchey law firm and then as CEO  and chairman of the Atkins & Pearce company, an industrial textile  business.   His active service on area boards was where he really distinguished  himself. I got into the habit of just calling him Chairman because he  chaired everything. He chaired the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of  Commerce, the Children's Home of Greater Cincinnati, the Christ  Hospital Board, the Fine Arts Fund for Cincinnati, and the Cincinnati  Business Committee. I know I have missed a number of entities,  institutions, and nonprofits he chaired. The point is, no one was a  bigger booster or bigger contributor to our community.   I think I can speak for a lot of people when I say that we are going  to miss his dedication, his humor, his wisdom, and his uncanny ability  to articulate and define issues. He was an impressive leader, a dear  friend, and a truly great Cincinnatian.   To his extraordinary wife, Louise, of 60 years; to his children,  Lisa, Jeb, and Andy, and their spouses, Nirvani, Jack, and Melanie; to  his grandchildren and his one great-grandchild, Jane and I send our  condolences. We are thinking about you. Joe was so proud of each and  every one of you.   May we all endeavor to embrace Joe's extraordinary commitment to his  community and carry on his profound legacy.   Godspeed, Joe Head.   Mr. President, I would now like to yield to my colleague from  Delaware who has just come to the floor, and I would like to speak  after him.    Mr. President, first, I say thanks to my colleague from  Delaware for the touching tribute to Chris and his service in the U.S.  Navy.   I am here to talk about our economy, what is going on out there, and  how we can do a better job of bringing people off the sidelines and  into work. They are needed.   Right now we have an incredibly strong economy. We just learned in  the first quarter of this year that the economy grew by 3.2 percent.  That is strong and way above expectations. In fact, when you look at  the expectations that were set by the Congressional Budget Office,  which is a nonpartisan group that analyzes what is going to happen in  the economy going forward, prior to the tax bill being signed into  law--that is, the tax reform and tax cuts from the end of 2017--they  said this first quarter growth would be 1.6 percent. It is interesting.  It was exactly twice the economic growth than was projected before the  tax bill.   By the way, before the tax bill, they also made a projection on jobs.  Over the last year, we have produced just about exactly twice as many  jobs--a little more than that--than was projected. The tax cuts and the  tax reform have worked, along with regulatory relief, to give this  economy a shot in the arm. That is so important.   I will say that when you look at what happened in the first quarter  of this year, the 3.2 percent is great, but it would have been even  better had we not shut down the government. I say that because we have  some new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office that say that the  level of GDP this first quarter would have been 0.2 percent more if we  had not had the government shutdown late last year, which was the  longest government shutdown in the history of our country. So it would  have been 3.6 percent instead of 3.2 percent. Wow, that would be  terrific. I guess I bring that up only because I think it is time for  us, again, to prepare for the potential of our having another impasse  year at the end of this fiscal year on September 30. I hope we will  avoid going into another government shutdown. It just doesn't make  sense. It is shooting ourselves in the foot.   There is legislation called the End Government Shutdowns Act. Almost  all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have now sponsored that  legislation. It just avoids our going into a shutdown but still allows  us to continue to move forward on our spending and, over time, reduce  that spending until we get our act together and do the appropriations  bills here. Again, there is good news in terms of job growth in the  first quarter.   The other thing I think is really important and may be the most  important statistic of all is the fact that wages are going up for the  first time in a decade. Really, in Ohio, for a decade and a half, we  have had flat wages--higher expenses but flat wages. It is really  frustrating to the families who are working hard and doing everything  right but can't get ahead. Over the last year now, we have seen wage  increases. A 3.4-percent wage increase is the strongest we have seen  since the great recession. I love the fact that this wage growth is  happening not just among higher paid individuals but, actually,  primarily among what is called nonsupervisory employees. That is how  the Department of Labor terms it. These are blue-collar jobs. These are  middle-class jobs. These are jobs of people who, again, have had a  tough time making ends meet. I know in my State most people work  paycheck to paycheck, and it is great to have that higher wage come in.   We passed tax reform because we believed it is the right thing to do  for our economy, for employers, for investment, and we have seen that  positive impact. I have had over two dozen townhall meetings and  roundtable discussions in my State, talking to employers, usually  smaller businesses, about what happened to them with regard to tax  reform. Every single one of them said the same thing: We have  reinvested in the business. We have invested in technology, in new  equipment, and we have invested in our people. In some cases, that  means better benefits. In two cases, small businesses acknowledged to  me that they weren't providing healthcare before the tax cuts, and now  they are because of the savings from the tax cut. They have also  invested in people's 401(k)s and other benefits. That is what is  happening out there in terms of the business side of the tax reform and  tax cuts.   In addition to that, there are also a lot of Americans who now have  more of their hard-earned money coming home. Their paychecks are better  because of the middle-class tax cuts that are in the legislation. For  Ohio, this amounted to $2,000 per year, on average, for a median-income  family. I know there has been a lot of discussion by others saying:  Well, really, these tax cuts didn't happen. Yes, they did. They did.  That is a fact. Most people I represent have seen a tax cut, and a lot  of those individuals saw their overall tax liability go down--not just  that the monthly checks were better, but on April 15 they had better  news. Let me give you some facts about that.   According to H&R Block, which is probably the firm that handles more  middle-class tax returns than any other firm in the country, the  average Ohioan saw a 23.3-percent decrease in their overall tax bill in  2018. This is from H&R Block. They also said that there is a 2.3- percent increase in the average refund in Ohio. I know there has been a  lot of discussion about this back and forth, and early on people were  concerned about their refunds. These are the numbers. These are the  facts from H&R Block. Overall, about 90 percent of middle-class  Americans received a tax cut in 2018, which means more money in their  pockets to pay down student debt, to save for retirement, to take a  long-awaited family vacation, and to be able to, again, achieve  whatever their dream is in life.   The economy is growing, creating jobs, and wages are rising. That is  all  [[Page S2559]]  good news. But with more jobs there is a problem that has developed,  and that is a lack of workers. I can't go anywhere in Ohio--and I just  had a bunch of meetings in Ohio, talking about this--where people don't  tell me: We don't have enough qualified workers to fill the jobs that  we have. Some people call it the skills gap, and that is true in Ohio.  We have a mismatch between the skills that are out there--the skills  that people who are looking for jobs have--and the jobs that are  available. If you go on the OhioMeansJobs website right now, you will  see about 145,000 jobs being offered. When you look at them, these are  good jobs. A lot of them, though, require a certain level of skill.  Some are information technology jobs, coding jobs. Some are skilled  manufacturing jobs, like machining or welding. Some of the jobs are in  bioscience, healthcare jobs, technicians. The problem is we don't have  the people who have the skills to fill those jobs. That is a shame for  those individuals who aren't achieving their hopes in life because they  aren't getting those good jobs and certainly for our economy, which  would be even stronger if we had more people to fill those jobs.    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the Department of  Labor, 7.3 million U.S. jobs are currently vacant, again, largely  because of the shortage of qualified workers. The National Skills  Coalition estimates that nearly half of all job openings between now  and 2022 will be what they call middle-skill jobs. This means jobs that  require education beyond high school, like a certificate program, but  not a 4-year degree. The supply of skilled workers in this category-- students pursuing post high school certifications--still falls way  short of what the industry demand is.   This is why career and technical education is important. CTE is part  of the answer to this. If you are in high school and looking for an  opportunity, check out your career and technical academy. In many high  schools, it is combined in one CTE program. It is a great opportunity.  It will give you the knowledge and training necessary to succeed in  your career.   I am the cofounder and the cochair of what is called the Senate CTE  Caucus. We have been working to raise awareness of this issue, so many  of my colleagues have now joined this caucus because they go home and  see the same thing. How do we connect our hard-working Ohioans to good- paying jobs, and how do we strengthen these CTE programs to make them  more affordable and more accessible?   One answer is legislation recently reintroduced by Senator Tim Kaine  and me. It is called the JOBS Act. It is really very simple. It says we  should be allowed to use Pell grants not just to pay for college but to  pay for shorter term certificate programs. These have to be qualified  programs, programs that provide real credentials to people. Right now,  with the Pell grant, if it is a program of less than 15 weeks, you  can't use it. So low-income students all over the country are told: You  can go to college. That is great. We are going to encourage you to do  that, incentivize you to do that, but you can't get this short-term  training program that can get you the job right away.   In Ohio, if those students graduate--and most don't--their average  debt is $27,000 compared, again, to the opportunity to go through the  short-term training program, get the job, and begin to make money to  buy the car, to be able to buy a small home or at least to rent an  apartment and not be in your parents' basement, and to be able to move  ahead with your life and your family. So career and technical education  is a great opportunity, and the JOBS Act would make it much more likely  that people would take that opportunity.   By the way, the community colleges around the country love the JOBS  Act. I believe it is their top priority this year. Why? Because so many  of them are now offering these certificate-based programs because they  are responding to the needs of the community and what the businesses  are telling them they need.   It is going to be different in every community, by the way, and that  is good. There is no ``one size fits all.'' In some communities in  Ohio, because we are a big manufacturing State, it is welding, and it  is machining. In other places around the country, it might be something  else. It might be for the fishing industry, the oil and gas industry,  or bioscience. All across Ohio I have seen how these programs are  working and could work even better if we had the JOBS Act.   Last week I toured Venture Products. It is a family-owned company  that designs and makes tractors. They make an incredible product called  the Ventrac. They have a really impressive facility, and it was great  to see them and their success. The company has benefited from tax  reform and has made additional investments in its business and its  workers with their tax savings, just like all of these companies that I  have gone to visit all over our State.   After the tour of the company, we had a roundtable discussion. It was  with educators--people from the local community college and career and  technical education folks who came in--also business people and people  from the area who were involved in economic development because they  are very concerned that without the workforce they can't expand the  businesses in this community in Ohio. We talked about the need to  strengthen CTE programs, and we talked about the JOBS Act. All of them  agreed that this would be really helpful and helpful right now.   I also had a visit at the Central Ohio Technical College. The  investiture ceremony took place last Thursday, and I had the chance to  meet the new president, Dr. John Berry. There are a lot of exciting  things happening at this career and technical college.   They work pretty closely with Ohio State, which is terrific. So you  have Ohio State, a 4-year college, and a great series of graduate  programs, working directly with these community colleges that focus on  skills training. They are expanding their programming, which will help  to meet the needs of today's workforce. The JOBS Act, according to  them, will greatly benefit the students who are using these shorter  term programs to put them on a path to a good-paying job.   In Walnut Creek, OH, I spoke at the Eastern Ohio Development  Alliance's annual meeting in Hockley County. This meeting represented  counties from all over eastern and southeastern Ohio. We talked about a  lot of things, including the shortage of skilled workers, because it  comes up again and again. In this case, Ohio has this wonderful  opportunity with the Marcellus and the Utica Shale finds to develop our  natural gas and our wet gas and our oil industry, but they need  workers. We don't want to have workers coming in from out of State,  frankly. We want to develop our own Ohio workforce, and we can only do  that with skills training because a lot of these jobs require skills  that are not available in Ohio today.   In Columbus, last week I spoke at a reentry conference. This is an  annual conference talking about how to get people going from prison  into our communities with the job skills they need and the mental  health and drug treatment they need to be successful. Again, it all  came down to this issue of workforce training being so important, both  because it helps people to get a job and not go back into the prison  system and also because getting a job is an essential part of so many  successful recovery programs for people who have drug and alcohol  addiction and want to be able to participate in our economy. This gives  them meaning and purpose in life and helps with their recovery.   I was in Knox County at a roundtable discussion. Again, in this case,  it was with first responders, local elected officials, and the  leadership of their mental health and recovery organization there.  Their board there is focused on dealing with the crystal meth problem.  It has almost pushed the opioid problem to the second most troubling  drug problem in the community. They still have overdoses from opioids.  They are still concerned about that. Crystal meth has now come in with  a vengeance--pure crystal meth from Mexico. Their big issue is how to  get people in recovery and successful recovery. Again, the issue of job  training came up. How do you give people the skills they need to get a  job, and how do you incorporate job skills in a recovery program,  again, so people have a reason to turn their life around to get  [[Page S2560]]  back with their family. That purpose and meaning come from a job, so  often.   So it was an opportunity to talk about the need for us to develop the  workforce to meet the needs of our communities and the opportunity to  talk about the need for the JOBS Act. I am really pleased that the JOBS  Act is in the President's budget this year. I thank President Trump and  his administration for including that. It makes all the sense in the  world. The higher education bill will be reauthorized this year, we all  hope. That is certainly the plan. If that happens, it is the perfect  place for having the JOBS Act included.   Senator Kaine of Virginia and I are the coauthors of this  legislation. We are hopeful that our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will join us in this legislation and help us to get it in the  Higher Education Act. I know that it is a priority of many members of  that committee, and Chairman Alexander, in particular, has a passion  for ensuring that we have the training we need out there to get people  the jobs to let them achieve their dreams in life.   Passing the JOBS Act will give us an opportunity to help so many  Americans have better opportunities, and, just as importantly, it would  enable us to help our economy right now because the biggest concern I  hear is no longer the taxes. People love the tax cuts and tax reform,  and they love the regulatory relief, but they are looking for skilled  workers. This is an opportunity. Let's seize it. Let's keep growing our  economy and help Americans fulfill their God-given potential.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am here on the floor to talk about an  American hero.   General Douglas MacArthur once said, ``Duty, Honor, Country. Those  three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you  can be, what you will be.'' Those words--duty, honor, country--are  exemplified through the life and legacy of Lieutenant Colonel Richard  Cole.   Lt. Col. Cole, who went by Dick, was born and raised in my  grandfather's hometown, Dayton, OH. He graduated from Steele High  School and completed 2 years of college at Ohio University before  enlisting in the Aviation Cadet Program of the U.S. Army Air Corps in  November 1940. He commissioned as a second lieutenant in July 1941 and  received his pilot wings at Randolph Field in Texas. From there, he  joined the ranks of the 34th Bombardment Squadron of the 17th  Bombardment Group.   Soon after, Lt. Col. Cole became one of the 80 volunteers who signed  up for the Doolittle Mission, which was to become the first offensive  strike on mainland Japan during World War II. In a turn of fate, a  Japanese vessel spotted the USS Hornet, forcing the mission to commence  a day early. Therefore, what was originally planned  [[Page S2566]]  as a 400-mile trip to mainland Japan turned into a 645-mile journey to  the target, putting the pilots in grave danger because the planes did  not have enough fuel to reach their destination.   Lt. Col. Cole served valiantly as Lt. Col. James Doolittle's co- pilot, and together, they led the squadron of 16 Army Air Force bombers  from the Hornet to Tokyo. The squadron succeeded in bombing their  target, but as predicted, his plane ran low on fuel and they were  forced to bail out over China. His parachute worked, and he landed in a  tree, where he spent the night and climbed down in the morning. He  ultimately found some Chinese students who took him to Doolittle. After  the raid, Cole went to India, helped establish the dangerous Hump  flying route and flew more than 100 missions carrying cargo, earning  three Distinguished Flying Crosses. The Doolittle Raiders received the  Congressional Gold Medal in 2015 and donated it to the National Museum  of the U.S. Air Force in Ohio.   The raid provided a psychological lift back home and marked a turning  point in the Pacific theater of the war. He was humble about his role  in this mission and chalked it up to duty. In 2016, when remembering  the raid, he said: ``We were the only B-25 crew operating for months.  We were going on that mission whether we wanted to or not. That  straightens out that fairy tale.'' He was awarded the Distinguished  Flying Cross for heroism for this mission.   Cole remained in China to continue flying bombing and transport  missions through the end of the war. He is the only American serviceman  of the 16 million who served in World War II to have flown in three  elite groups: the Doolittle Raiders, the Himalayan Hump Route pilots,  and the 1st Air Commandos.   After retiring from a distinguished 26-year long career in the U.S.  Air Force, he spent much of his time as an ambassador for the Air Force  and Doolittle Raiders. He traveled the country to keep the history and  legacy of the Doolittle Raiders alive and honor those who served beside  him.   On April 9, Lt. Col. Cole passed away at the age of 103 years old.  What an incredible life. He captured the hearts of everyone who met  him, and he will forever be remembered as a hero who faithfully  executed his duty for our Country.   Godspeed, Lt. Col. Dick Cole.                            ____________________
