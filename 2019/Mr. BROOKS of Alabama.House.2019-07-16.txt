 Mr. Speaker, the President is Commander in  Chief. His highest constitutional duty is protecting American lives.   As of 2016, so-called refugee admissions from the Middle East, Near  East, South Asia, and Africa accounted for 80 percent of so-called  refugee admissions into America.   I say ``so-called refugees'' because the United Nations states no  country is obligated by international law to take refugees from a  country in which they are already protected.   The result of America's flawed policy? America is the world's top  refugee resettlement country on the planet.   In a 2015 Breitbart interview, I opposed these dangerous refugee  policies and stated: ``Barack Obama wants to endanger Americans by  importing people, some of whom undoubtedly will resort to terrorism and  killing Americans at some point in the future.''   Consistent with my view that importing unvetted people from  terrorist-laden countries threatens American lives, the House, in 2015,  passed a law requiring a full FBI background investigation for alleged  Iraq or Syria refugees. The bill died in the Senate while under an  Obama veto threat.   In 2017, a newly elected President Trump stated: ``In order to  protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to  this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding  principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who  do not support the Constitution or those who would place violent  ideologies over American law.''                                time  1015    ``In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in  acts of bigotry or hatred, including `honor' killings, other forms of  violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice  religions different from their own.''   As expected, socialist Democrats and their fake news media allies  reacted by calling President Trump names rather than supporting  policies that save American lives.   For example, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: ``This week, I joined  my colleagues on the steps of the Supreme Court to fight the  President's reprehensible order. . . . The values illustrated were in  stark contrast with the President's unconstitutional, immoral, and  dangerous ban on refugees and citizens of Muslim countries coming into  the United States.''   Predictably, a radical, leftist judge restrained President Trump from  protecting American lives. Fortunately, a later President Trump refugee  and travel policy was approved by the Supreme Court as ``squarely  within the scope of Presidential authority.''   As would be expected, this decision was ridiculed with hysterical  headlines from the left. NBC News stated, ``The Supreme Court's travel  ban decision adds to its legacy of legitimizing racism.''   Protecting Americans from terrorism is ``reprehensible,''  ``immoral,'' ``racism''? This is all ignorant and baseless socialist  Democrat and fake news media slander intended to stifle rational  debate.   But truth eventually wins out. Recently, an unvetted so-called Syrian  [[Page H5831]]  refugee who entered America 3 years ago was charged with terrorism.  According to an affidavit filed in Pittsburgh Federal court, the FBI  investigation of Mustafa Mousab Alowemer ``revealed that Alowemer  plotted to bomb a church located on the north side of Pittsburgh . . .  using a weapon of mass destruction, i.e., an explosive device.''   According to Alowemer, his motivation to detonate a device at the  church was to ``support the cause of ISIS and to inspire other ISIS  supporters in the United States to join together and commit similar  acts in the name of ISIS.''   Fortunately, the FBI stopped Alowemer from blowing up a church and  slaughtering innocent American Christians. Unfortunately, American  lives are still at risk from terrorists masquerading as refugees.   Mr. Speaker, I ask: How many dead Americans does it take to cause  open-border advocates to secure our borders and protect American lives?   Unfortunately, no one knows because socialist Democrats have shown  there is no amount of American blood on their hands that will cause  them to protect American lives by securing America's borders.                            ____________________
