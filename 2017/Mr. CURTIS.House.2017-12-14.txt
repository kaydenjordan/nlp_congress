 Mr. Speaker, the House is in the midst of historic tax  reform. Now that the House and Senate have almost reached agreement, I  would like to take a moment to express a few ideals that I hope will be  guiding principles as we complete this process.   The final tax bill should cut taxes for all Americans while also  retaining important incentives making homeownership, raising a family,  and obtaining higher education possible.   Additionally, the bill should continue to uphold American values by  encouraging our people to be generous and charitable.   The lowering of our corporate tax rates is critical. As a former  business owner, I know firsthand the difficulty of the tax burden.   Most importantly, the bill must help working American families keep  more of their hard-earned money.   I am confident that Congress will deliver on its promise to simplify  the Tax Code and to cut taxes for all Americans. I know that this  historic legislation will spur economic growth and prosperity.                            ____________________
