 Madam Chair, I rise having an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of an important  issue: preserving veterans' choices over their prosthetic services.   While I am prepared to withdraw this amendment--we have had  discussions about that--I would hope that I can continue to work with  the chairwoman as we move to conference on improving the underlaying  report language.   Last year, the VA released a draft proposed rule which would have  significantly curtailed veterans' choices in how they receive their  prosthetic or orthotic care.   While we appreciate the Secretary's efforts to address the concerns  of the veterans, I remain concerned that the proposal does not go far  enough to protect veterans' ability to select high-quality, convenient,  and efficient services from community-based providers of their choice.   This proposal would have upended more than 60 years of successful  partnership between the VA and local prosthetists who contract with the  VA and have long-term relationships with their patients. This long-term  relationship is critical for the unique, patient-centered care needs of  prosthetics services.   I would also like to thank my colleague, Representative Rutherford,  for working on this issue with me.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz) to at least assure me that we can continue to work on this  issue together.    Madam Chair, based upon that and, also, an understanding  of the chairwoman's willingness to at least look at how we can find an  adequate solution to meet the needs of our servicemembers who have  given their all for our great country, I am willing to continue working  on that.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I am willing to  withdraw this amendment.
