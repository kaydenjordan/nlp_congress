 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a recent survey reported that 50 percent of  people in this country consider themselves living paycheck to paycheck,  and one third of these people say they are just $400 away from  financial crisis. That is not acceptable.   Unfortunately, after 8 years of economic stagnation under the Obama  administration, living paycheck to paycheck is starting to feel like  the new normal for most Americans. But it doesn't have to be. We have  the resources to be the strongest economy in the world. American  workers and job creators are as dynamic and creative as ever, and they  can get our economy thriving again. In order to get them to do that, we  need to clear some obstacles in their path. That starts with reforming  our complicated and outdated Tax Code, which has increasingly been  strangling our economy.   This month, Republicans in the House and Senate are making  comprehensive tax reform one of our top priorities. After weeks of  work, last week leaders from the Senate, the House, and the White House  unveiled the framework that will guide our final tax reform  legislation.   The framework is built around Republicans' five principles for tax  reform: first, providing tax relief for the middle class; second,  increasing wages, jobs, and economic growth; third, keeping good-paying  jobs here at home in America; fourth, increasing American  competitiveness in the global economy; and, finally, fifth, simplifying  the Tax Code. The framework outlines our plans to provide relief for  middle-class families.   First, we will lower rates for hard-working Americans. By collapsing  the seven income tax brackets to three, we will ensure that working  families get  [[Page S6273]]  to keep more of what they earn. Our plan will also expand the child tax  credit and make it available to more families, and our plan doubles the  standard deduction, which will provide significant relief for those who  need it the most. Under our plan, a family making $24,000 a year will  no longer owe any Federal income taxes. All of these measures will  provide direct relief to working families.   Just as important for families, however, is the other half of our tax  reform plan, which involves creating the kind of economic environment  where hard-working Americans can thrive--the kind of environment where  Americans have access to good jobs, higher wages, and more  opportunities.   Over the past few weeks, I have come to the floor to talk about  Republicans' tax reform principles and have highlighted some of the  ways our tax reform plan will improve the economic outlook for American  families. Last week, I talked about our third principle, reforming our  Tax Code to keep those good-paying jobs here at home. This week I would  like to spend a few minutes talking about our fourth principle, which  is keeping American businesses competitive in the global economy.   In order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need our  businesses to thrive. Thriving businesses create jobs, provide  opportunities, and they increase wages and invest in workers. Right  now, though, our Tax Code is not helping businesses thrive, and it is  making it more difficult for American businesses with an international  footprint to compete in the global economy.   Our Nation has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized  world--at least 10 percentage points higher than the majority of our  international competitors. It doesn't take an economist to realize that  high tax rates leave businesses with less money to invest, less money  to spend on wages, less money to create new jobs, less money to devote  to research and development of new products and services, and less  money to put back into new property or equipment for those businesses.  This situation is compounded when an American business has  international competitors that are paying a lot less in taxes than you  are. It is no surprise that U.S. businesses struggling to stay  competitive in the global economy don't have a lot of resources to  devote to creating new jobs and increasing wages.   On top of our high business tax rates, there is another major problem  with our Tax Code that puts American businesses at a competitive  disadvantage globally--our outdated worldwide tax system.   What does it mean to have a worldwide tax system? It means that  American companies pay U.S. taxes on the profit they make here at home,  as well as on part of the profits they make abroad once they bring that  money back home to the United States. The problem with this is that  most other major world economies have shifted from a worldwide tax  system to a territorial tax system.   In a territorial tax system, taxes are paid on the money earned where  it is made and only there. You are not taxed again when you bring money  back to your home country. Most American companies' foreign competitors  have been operating under a territorial tax system for years. So they  pay a lot less taxes on the money they make abroad than American  companies pay. That leaves American companies at a disadvantage.   Foreign companies can underbid American companies for new business  simply because they don't have to add as much in taxes into the price  of their products or services. When foreign companies beat out American  companies for new business, it is not just American companies that  suffer. It is American workers. That is why a key part of the tax  framework that Republicans unveiled last week involves lowering our  massive corporate tax rate and transitioning our tax system from a  worldwide tax system into a territorial tax system. By making American  businesses more competitive in the global economy, we can improve the  playing field for American workers.    There are a lot of other things we are going to do to help hard- working families and American workers, from improving the tax situation  for small businesses to helping family business owners, farmers, and  ranchers like those in my home State of South Dakota by repealing the  death tax.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to complain about  our plans to repeal the death tax. They complain that it is not  something to really worry about since they claim relatively few estates  are expected to actually have to pay the tax. Well, I would like them  to come and talk to some of the farmers and ranchers in my State of  South Dakota. Some of these farmers and ranchers are paying tens of  thousands of dollars a year in an effort to avoid having their families  hit by the estate tax when they die. Why? Because they know that  without careful and costly planning, if the Federal Government comes  around after their death demanding a staggering 40 percent of their  estate, their children won't have the money to pay the government  without risking the farm or the ranch.   Farming and ranching is a land-rich but cash-poor business. Farmers  and ranchers own valuable land, but they are only earning cash on the  crops they grow or the livestock they raise on that land. So while  their overall farm or ranch may have a substantial value, the amount of  money they have coming in is relatively small and subject to the swings  in the market from year to year. Too often, when farmers and ranchers  die, the vast portion of their estate is made up of their land, while  actual disposable income is a very small part of it. If they don't take  measures to avoid having their family hit by the death tax, the family  will have no choice but to sell off some or all of their land to pay  the government, which means, in many cases, losing the family's farm or  ranch. And the same situation faces other types of family-owned  businesses across the country where the value of the estate is tied up  in that business.   Removing the threat of the death tax for family-owned businesses,  farms, and ranches would free up resources that these business owners  could invest in their businesses and in our economy instead of on  complex estate plans, insurance, and expensive tax professionals.   Before I move on, let me just remind everybody that when we talk  about the death tax, we are talking about double and sometimes triple  taxation. The money the government is taxing has already been taxed at  least once. It boggles the mind that some think that a person's death  is justification for taxing his or her income a second or a third time.  Death should not be a taxable event. When someone dies, they shouldn't  have to see the undertaker and the IRS at the same time.   Our Tax Code is increasingly strangling our economy and placing heavy  burdens on hard-working American families. If we want to improve the  economic situation of American families, comprehensive tax reform is  essential.   Republicans in the House and the Senate are continuing to work on the  final draft of the bill that we will take up later this fall. I look  forward to passing comprehensive tax reform that will help American  families thrive, that will create greater economic growth, better  paying jobs, higher wages, and bigger paychecks for American workers.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
