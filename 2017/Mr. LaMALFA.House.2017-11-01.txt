 Mr. Chairman, nationwide, this year has been the most  expensive year on record, with over $2 billion spent to combat fires  that have burned almost 9 million acres of land.   As of October 29, State and Federal firefighters responded to 8,300- plus fires, covering over 1.1 million acres in California alone, nearly  doubling the amount of acres burned in 2016.   A complete lack of forest management in California has left our  forests more combustible than ever, leading to one of the worst  wildfire seasons in our State's history. That is why the bill of my  colleague, Mr. Westerman, H.R. 2936, is very important.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act includes what I believe to be  critically important reforms in forest management, such as expedited  environmental reviews and the availability of categorical exclusions  for forest management activities to help achieve these goals.   Our Federal lands are hurting. They are in desperate need to be  managed in order to not have these disasters each and every year. We  can either thin the trees and the brush out, or watch them  [[Page H8333]]  go up in smoke every year and become part of our brown skies, instead  of the blue skies that we would normally enjoy.   We can't afford this inaction anymore. We need to move this  legislation and clean up California's forests for all.    Mr. Chairman, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a  colloquy with the chairman to seek a clarification on the applicability  of the provisions in title I and title II of this bill to national  forest lands.   As my colleagues know, the State of California has been on fire. We  have all seen the devastation across the State, ranging from the Sierra  Nevada to the Bay area, and even the wine country. Even today, CalFire  and Forest Service personnel remain deployed on fires across the State.   Ensuring that the Forest Service returns to active management of our  forests is critical to promoting forest health and helping reduce the  risks and likeliness of catastrophic wildfires that we have seen  already this year.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act includes what I believe to be  critically important reforms to forest management, such as expedited  environmental reviews and availability of categorical exclusion for  forest management activities, to help achieve these needed goals.   In California, there are six national monuments managed by the Forest  Service or jointly between the Forest Service and BLM. Oftentimes,  management activities in these areas are highly restricted, which only  leads to hazardous fuels buildup and increased risk  [[Page H8338]]  of catastrophic fires. We see the results every year in the West.   H.R. 2936 clearly identifies certain national forest lands that these  provisions do not apply to. This includes wilderness areas, national or  State inventoried roadless areas, or areas where timber harvesting is  prohibited by statute.   However, it is my belief that provisions of this bill, Mr. Chairman-- based on the definition of National Forest System lands in the bill-- apply to all other Forest Service lands not explicitly prohibited in  the bill.   Respectfully, I would like to clarify with the chairman that it is  his intent that provisions in title I and title II of H.R. 2936 apply  to all other Federal lands managed by the United States Forest Service.  This includes national monuments managed by the Forest Service.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his work on this critical  bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment made in order by the  rule.    Mr. Chairman, believe it or not, according to Federal  agencies, the wildland firefighter does not exist. That is correct.  There are men and women around this Nation who work daily to protect  our communities from the fires that devastate especially the Western  United States, but they are not allowed to call themselves  firefighters.   Instead of ``firefighter,'' the Forest Service, BLM, and other  agencies use bureaucratic terms like ``forestry technician,'' which  fails to recognize the dangers they face and the sacrifices they make  to protect others.   My amendment, which I am pleased to offer with my colleague,  Representative Mark DeSaulnier from California, represents a bill we  have both sponsored, H.R. 3907, as well; which seeks simply to  designate these brave men and women the title they have earned by  directing the Office of Personnel Management to create employee classes  designated as ``wildland firefighters.''   Mr. Chairman, 15 ``technicians'' have passed away this last year  fighting wildfires. Several of them are from California. It is  unconscionable that, while they perished fighting fires, the agencies  that employ them refuse to call them firefighters. We should take  action to rectify that failure, and I urge Members to consider our  bill, H.R. 3907, to do so.   However, Mr. Chairman, I know that there is additional work to be  done with the very bureaucracies which refuse to use the term  ``firefighter'' with last-minute concerns and clarifications needed so  that the firefighters indeed don't lose benefits, and I note that we  will be back.   Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment from  further consideration at this time.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness I rise tonight to  honor the passing of Stanley Coolidge and his fiancee, Roseann Hannah.   Their lives were tragically lost on October 9, 2017, while trapped in  their northern California home as it was destroyed by wildfire. What  began as the faint smell of a distant fire quickly turned to tragedy as  the area surrounding Stanley's longtime home was ignited rapidly by a  fast-approaching fire. As Stan and Roseann attempted a hurried  evacuation, the house was engulfed by flames before they could escape.   Stan was a retired attorney, born in San Francisco, but lived his  last 50 years in the mountains of Loma Rica, California. Roseann was a  resident of Grass Valley, California. Both she and Stan were very  valued members of their communities.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the Coolidge and Hannah families as  we ask the Lord's blessings for comfort and healing at this very  tragic, very sad time, as well as the families of all who we have lost  as a result of the fires in the West.   Stan and Roseann, you will be missed.                            ____________________
