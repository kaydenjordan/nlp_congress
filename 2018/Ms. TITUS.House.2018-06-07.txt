 Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Kihuen for yielding and  for his leadership on this issue.   Earlier this evening, we heard from the distinguished Member from  Illinois, who continues to push the ``Yucca or bust'' policy of the  last 36 years.   He claimed that the Nevada delegation is trying to circumvent the  adjudication process to determine if Nevada should be the dumping  ground for the Nation's highly radioactive nuclear waste.   He said Congress should reject another amendment to save $190 million  from being thrown away on this failed proposal because we should let  the licensing process play out without some preconceived outcome.   Well, I am sorry, but that is just more BS. If he really believed  that, he would be joining us in support of amendment No. 32, which  strips the unnecessary policy rider that prohibits closing down the  already-shuttered Yucca Mountain.   It predetermines that Yucca Mountain will be the Nation's nuclear  waste dump and handcuffs the administration from choosing another site  regardless of what any studies show.   If we are serious about solving this problem, we should change  direction and allow consent-based siting. We could start that process  today and right now by supporting this amendment.
