 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of placing  Buffalo's DL&W Terminal on the National Registry of Historic Places.   Built in 1917 to accommodate bustling freight and passenger rail, the  long-dormant train shed is a vital component to Buffalo's renaissance.   Positioned along the Buffalo River at the foot of Main Street in  downtown Buffalo, the massive structure is undergoing a transformation,  including construction of a new Metro Rail station on the ground floor.   Historic designation will make planned private sector development of  the second floor eligible for Federal and State historic tax credits.   A nomination would allow the DL&W Terminal to join the list of over  250 historic tax credit rehab projects injecting $1.2 billion into  western New York over the last two decades.   I urge the National Park Service to support the submission of the  DL&W Terminal, advancing a critical linchpin to the revitalization of  Buffalo's downtown waterfront.                            ____________________
