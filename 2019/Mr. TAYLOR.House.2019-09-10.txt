 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate the  University of Texas at Dallas on 50 years of educating students in  north Texas.   In 1969, Texas Governor Preston Smith signed legislation to  officially establish the University of Texas at Dallas as part of the  UT system. Not only has UT grown immensely in the last 50 years, but  our community takes great pride in the university's Tier One status.   Today, UTD offers over 140 degrees and helps young people follow  their dreams by providing them with a top-notch education. What was  once vast prairie land has become a hub of higher learning and an  opportunity for students to learn across the country.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the  University of Texas at Dallas on a wonderful 5 days of academic  excellence. Whoosh.                            ____________________
