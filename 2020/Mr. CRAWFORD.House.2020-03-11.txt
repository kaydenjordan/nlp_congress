 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the USA  FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020.   I would also like to associate myself with the comments of my friend  and colleague from Utah (Mr. Stewart).   I also acknowledge and applaud the efforts of the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes), whose tenacity brought this to  bear. I appreciate his leadership on this issue.   This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that makes urgent and  necessary reforms to the FISA process, which, as Inspector General  Horowitz found 3 months ago, was misused to conduct illegal  surveillance on Carter Page, a U.S. person.   This bill enhances requirements on the FBI and DOJ to ensure all  applications are accurate and complete. This bill creates a compliance  officer at the FBI who is directly responsible for making sure FBI  agents are following the law.   This bill heightens criminal penalties to deter bad actors and other  layers of review to root them out.   Finally, the bill reauthorizes three counterterrorism tools that are  significantly important to our national security.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support this bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote  from my colleagues.
