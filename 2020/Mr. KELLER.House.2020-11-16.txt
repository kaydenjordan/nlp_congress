 Mr. Speaker, last week I had the honor of presenting  Korean Ambassador of Peace Medals to Korean war veterans and their  families in Towanda, Pennsylvania. The Korean Ambassador of Peace Medal  is an honor from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea for American  veterans who served in the Korean war.   One of the greatest parts of representing Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District is hearing our veterans' stories of service and  sacrifice for our Nation. As the names of these heroes are read on the  House floor, it is my hope that their legacies echo through these Halls  and across America for generations to come:   Glen Ellis, United States Navy;   Silas Mills, United States Army;   Charles Miller, United States Army;   Kent Edsell, United States Marine Corps;   Nicholas Williams, United States Navy;   Edward Moritz, United States Army;   Earl Mayo, United States Army;   Carlton Repsher, Jr., United States Army; and   Keith Haight, Sr., United States Marine Corps.   It is incumbent upon us to honor these individuals and reflect on  their heroism in the name of liberty and our American way of life.                            ____________________
