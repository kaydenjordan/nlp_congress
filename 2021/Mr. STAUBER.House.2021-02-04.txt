 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this  opportunity.   I rise with my colleagues today out of serious concern for the well- being of America's workers and American energy independence.   Under the Trump administration, America came first. The priority was  lowering energy costs for Americans and ending our supply chain  dependency, along with supporting high-wage jobs in the energy  industry.   Sadly, within just 2 weeks, Joe Biden has started destroying much of  that progress and setting our Nation back. President Biden's executive  orders have ended high-wage pipeline jobs on Keystone XL. He has banned  oil and gas development on Federal lands and forced America to rejoin  the unfair Paris climate agreement which gives a free pass to polluters  like India and Communist China.   His actions have serious consequences for my rural district and  districts like mine.   In my district, gas prices have started to dramatically increase as  Joe Biden keeps punishing American families with executive order after  executive order.   In fact, since November 30, the gas prices have already risen $0.32  and counting. A 60-mile round trip for work is not uncommon in northern  Minnesota. Already, that is a $244 a year increase per driver. Imagine  what it will be like for middle class families if these increases  continue.   Furthermore, Joe Biden's executive order canceling critical projects  like the Keystone XL pipeline sends a chilling message to union members  nationwide, including in my district where many are currently working  to replace the Line 3 pipeline.   Many workers are asking themselves: Will Joe Biden cancel their job  next? And what about those individuals who were employed with a good- paying, high-quality job working on pipelines or in oil fields on our  Federal lands?   Because of Joe Biden's anti-jobs agenda, these individuals are not  only being denied a living wage, but the dignity of work. Meanwhile,  they will still need to put gas in their vehicles.   Prices will keep rising and the gas they use won't be produced by  hardworking Americans any longer. Instead, they will be purchasing gas  for their trucks from hostile countries like Russia, Venezuela, and  China, all of which signed the Paris climate agreement, but not one of  these countries has met their obligation.   Madam Speaker, Joe Biden's unilateral executive orders are harmful.  It may not be understood here in the Beltway, but my constituents know  that these executive orders mean job loss and higher energy costs for  the American family.   It has been less than a month and Joe Biden has already made his  agenda very, very clear. American jobs, American families, and American  energy independence are no longer first.   At this time of economic uncertainty, I urge the Biden administration  to change their reckless course. I urge the Biden administration to  abandon the failed Obama-era policies and support an all-of-the-above  energy strategy that will create jobs, keep energy costs low, and  maintain our energy independence which will enhance our national  security.   And by working together to support energy jobs and reduced dependence  on foreign nations, we have the chance to create a tomorrow with  unimaginable potential.                                time  2015
