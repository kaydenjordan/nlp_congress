 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the North Carolina General  Assembly voted to pass an extreme, partisan gerrymander of our State's  congressional map.   To be clear, this is Republican legislators trying to handpick their  own voters and predetermine the outcome of elections before they ever  happen.   This is not a new practice. In nearly every State, partisan  gerrymandering has been used as a tool by politicians to manipulate  electoral outcomes with surgical precision.   It doesn't matter who is doing it--Democrats or Republicans-- gerrymandering is bad for democracy. It is time to end gerrymandering  and implement a nonpartisan, independent redistricting commission in  every State.   We need to pass the Freedom to Vote Act now.   By taking politicians out of the redistricting process, we can  restore fairness and ensure that voters are the ones choosing their  politicians, not the other way around.   No matter what happens, I am going to keep fighting for North  Carolina. It is time to restore faith in our government, end  gerrymandering, and protect the right to vote for every single North  Carolinian.                            ____________________
