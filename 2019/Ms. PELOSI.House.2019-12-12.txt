 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan, a  leader in the freshman class, for yielding time and for her  extraordinary leadership in so many ways.   It is just so invigorating to see the freshmen Members of this class  taking  [[Page H10138]]  the lead on this important legislation. Many of us just came in from  the steps of the Capitol where, again, the freshmen Members took the  lead.   Following up on a promise made last year during the election, For the  People, we will lower the cost of healthcare in America by lowering the  cost of prescription drugs. H.R. 3 does just that, named for our great  and departed--may he rest in peace--Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs  Now Drug Act.   This is very, very important. And it may come as news to some of our  Republican friends who were saying things to the contrary, but this is  a product of the work of three committees in Congress.   I thank Chairman Pallone of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,  Chairman Richie Neal of the Committee on Ways and Means, and  Bobby  Scott, chair of the Committee on Education and Labor, for their  relentless and persistent work on this lifesaving legislation where  many freshmen are speaking now, controlling the time.   But in the course of the debate of yesterday, under the aegis of the  committees of jurisdiction, many of them spoke at that time as well,  demonstrating their leadership on this issue, making it a reality on  the floor of the House. Again, I thank them for their bold urgency to  lower the cost of drugs.   The crushing burden of prescription drugs is an issue that impacts  every family in America. Much talk is given around here about having a  seat at the table. The most important seat at the most important table  is the kitchen table of America's working families where they enjoy  family, but also address challenges that face them, whether it is in  their health or in their financial health and how that is related.                                time  1030    This legislation today speaks to that important table of concerns.   In my travels across the country, I have seen grown men cry about how  they cannot meet the needs of their families when it comes to  prescription drug costs, a spouse with a long-term illness, children  with chronic diseases, and the rest.   Prescription drug prices are out of control. The price of insulin  invented nearly a century ago--when people say we have to cover our  research costs--doubled from 2012 to 2016 because of Big Pharma.   Many people use it. A lot of people buy it. Let's increase our  profits, they say.   Americans are paying four times or more for what Big Pharma charges  for the exact drugs in other countries.   While Big Pharma companies reap record-breaking profits and  multibillion-dollar windfalls from the GOP tax scam, 58 million  Americans couldn't afford to fill a prescription they needed to stay  healthy in the past year--58 million Americans.   Thirty-four million Americans know a loved one who died from not  being able to afford a treatment that they needed.   We face medical, economic, and moral crises that demand that we act  and that we act boldly.   Yes, they have a motion to recommit. I think it was appropriate that  the Republicans have the opportunity to put an alternative on the  floor, incremental pieces, not going to the heart of the matter. How  dare they ever think of enabling the Secretary to negotiate for lower  prices, which is the heart of the matter.   We have been trying to do this for a number of years. Today, we will.   Last year, again, we made the promise For the People, that we would  lower the cost of prescription drugs. We are finally giving Medicare  the power to negotiate lower drug prices.   Some Republicans say it is un-American for the Secretary to be able  to negotiate for lower prices--un-American--then making those lower  prices available to the hundreds of millions of Americans with private  insurance, too.   We are insisting that American seniors and families shouldn't have to  pay more for our medicines than what Big Pharma charges for the same  drug overseas. I say that again. H.R. 3 means lowering the cost of  medication for Americans with leukemia by more than 70 percent. It  means lowering the cost of medication for arthritis, which more than 50  million Americans have, by almost 75 percent. It means lowering the  cost of asthma medication for 25 million Americans with this condition  from $1,500 to $270.   Yesterday, we had Mr. Riordan testify at our press conference. The  cost of his medication for asthma, in his case, was over $60,000 a  month. Eighty percent of it was covered by Medicare, but he had to pay  over $4,000 a month.   Can you absorb that? $4,000 a month for a drug that you are supposed  to take four times a month? He was taking it twice a month, once a  month, or not at all, not a healthy thing to do, but reaping big  profits for Big Pharma.   Under H.R. 3, some commonly used insulins could cost as little as  $400 a year.   With the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, we put  more money back into the pockets of seniors and hardworking families.  We drive down insurance premiums, making it easier to afford coverage.   When we lift the immense burden of drug costs on employers, the CBO  says American businesses can expect bigger paychecks and salaries for  their workers.   H.R. 3 also represents the most transformative expansion of Medicare  since its inception.   Now, many people on the other side of the aisle did not support  Medicare at its inception, but this is a vast improvement because we  are investing more than a half-trillion dollars--that is with a T-R--a  half-trillion dollars that we are saving by lowering out-of-control  prices and investing in historic new benefits for vision, dental, and  hearing for Medicare beneficiaries for the first time.   With these huge savings, we are also investing in new research for  new treatments and cures and fighting the opioid epidemic, as the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose) pointed out, and in the community  health centers that deliver quality healthcare to so many Americans.   Advocacy groups representing tens of millions of Americans, seniors,  retirees, patients, providers, faith leaders, businesses, and the men  and women of labor, and more, support H.R. 3.   AARP wrote to Members of Congress this week and said: ``This  important legislation is a bold step toward lowering prescription drug  prices and improving Medicare for seniors and families across the  country. . . . H.R. 3 will help more Americans afford their  prescription drugs and get the care they need to stay healthy.'' They  said that in their support of the legislation.   There is every reason in the world for Republicans to join us in  passing this bill. The bill delivers on President Trump's promise to  the American people. In his words, he said: ``When it comes time to  negotiate the cost of drugs, we are going to negotiate like crazy.''   Negotiation is what this bill is about. The Republican substitute is  what this bill is not about, and that negotiation is the heart of the  matter.   The President also said: ``It's unacceptable that Americans pay  vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs,  often made in the exact same place. This is wrong; this is unfair; and  together, we will stop it.''   Actually, in creating this bill, and working with the committees to  do so, we were working with the interests of the White House, the  administration, on all of this.   I don't know where it happened, but somewhere along the way,  negotiation and the rest fell by the by, and that, again, could be  attributed to I don't know what.   Democrats named H.R. 3, as I mentioned, in honor of Chairman Elijah  Cummings, our North Star who worked across the aisle and down  Pennsylvania Avenue--he met with the President--to lower prescription  drug prices.    In honor of Chairman Cummings, and for the sake of the millions of  Americans struggling with high prescription drug costs, I urge a strong  vote on H.R. 3 to lower drug costs now for all Americans, for the  people. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
