 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Scott McLean, the  founder and executive director of Pathway to Freedom, for being awarded  the 2018 Marie Interfaith Civic Leadership Award. This award is given  annually to recognize citizens whose work addresses important community  issues in Arkansas.   Scott created the Pathway to Freedom program in 2011 with the goal of  changing prison culture and breaking the cycle of recidivism in our  State. The program provides educational, values-based prerelease  services to prisoners, while also preparing inmates to reintegrate into  society and return to being a productive citizen.   Pathway to Freedom seeks to transform prisoners' lives with an 18- month prerelease residential program through a contract with the  Arkansas Department of Corrections. It also provides, importantly, 12  months of mentoring and support once our prisoners shift back to  society.   I extend a hand of gratitude and congratulations to my good friend  Scott and the entire Pathway to Freedom program for their selfless and  worthwhile investment in our citizens and our State's future.                            ____________________
