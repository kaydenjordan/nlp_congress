 Madam Speaker, since his first day in office, President  Biden's decisions to halt construction of the border wall and reverse  effective Trump border policies have had disastrous consequences. Every  day, we see new videos and reports of humanitarian and national  security crises at our southern border.   On top of the massive influx of illegal aliens, President Biden's  open border policies have also created an equally concerning crisis,  the overflow of fentanyl into America. Tragically, every community in  our Nation has been impacted.   President Biden's failed policies have turned every State into a  border State. This is not a rural or urban issue, it is an American  issue, and one that requires the full force of the Federal Government  to address.   Fentanyl seizures increased 134 percent in fiscal year 2021. That is  enough fentanyl to kill every American, not once, not twice, but seven  times.    President Trump's policies were effective. During his administration,  Washington Democrats tried to politicize border security. Now that  President Biden's policies have created a crisis, they are trying to  ignore the issue.   These crises will continue to worsen until the Biden administration  is forced to re-implement the Trump policies that worked. We will  continue pressuring this administration to do exactly that.
