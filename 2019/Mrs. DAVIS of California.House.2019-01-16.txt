 Madam Speaker, this Trump shutdown is  forcing servicemembers and retirees to go without pay.   Yes, our President is withholding Coast Guard pay because of his  reckless demands. Who does that?   A constituent wrote to me: As a Coast Guard retiree, I am facing no  pay during the shutdown. It is outrageous that, after 26 years of  service, I face financial troubles due to my country not facing its  obligations.   I agree. This is unacceptable for those who served our country, and  it is unacceptable for those currently serving and not getting paid.   Can't we agree that supporting the Coast Guard is better than having  a stalemate on a political issue?   We must take action to help our servicemembers and hardworking  government employees, and our whole economy, which is being hurt even  more than we thought.   Madam Speaker, how can the President think it is a good idea for  national security to not pay those who protect us?                            ____________________
