 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to complete my remarks prior to the vote.  [[Page S2205]]     If the Senator--first of all, I want to associate  myself with the comments of the Senator from Montana, and I wanted to  ask a question because I--look, I hear from my cattlemen about this all  the time.   I think the issue is, they think they are going to get a price, they  think they are going to grow beef, they think that they are going to  have some certainty in this marketplace, only to find, at the last  minute when the beef is about to be delivered to the packing house, the  packing house comes up with a scheme or scenario to drop their price  after our growers have made these investments. Is that right?    Well, I thank the Senator from Montana for articulating  this issue.   Too much market control, not enough transparency, and our growers  basically get stuck with having invested costs never to recuperate them  because somebody used that market power to basically lower those costs.  And, you know, we have seen this a lot. We have seen them import a ton  of Canadian beef right at this very moment, right when they are about  to deliver U.S. product into the meat packing plants: Oh, we just  dropped the price because we got so much supply because they just let a  lot of supply in from Canada.   So this--the gentleman from Montana is talking something that is  existing in other aspects of our economy too. So I am very glad that we  are trying to better police these markets and do a good job. And I know  you and the Senator from Mississippi have focused on this issue, and we  very much appreciate you doing that.   Well, Madam President, we are about to go to conference on the United  States Innovation and Competition Act and the House America COMPETES  Act. Boy, this is a long time coming. I want to thank Leader Schumer  and my colleague Senator Wicker, also Senators Young and Cornyn and  other Members who worked hard to help us reach an agreement so that we  can have this process today.   Obviously, I hope my colleagues will vote yes to compound this motion  and go to conference and allow for these various motions to instruct.   It has been 324 days since the Senate passed this bill on June 8,  2021, and it has been 488 days since we authorized the CHIPS Program. I  am here to implore my colleagues to get this done today and to say that  we need to move faster.   We just heard yesterday from Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who  said even in Ukraine, weapon replacement is being hindered by a lack of  chips. We know that we are facing other problems. I am talking about  Beijing with further lockdowns. What does that mean? It means fewer  people producing products. It means more serious supply chain issues.  So if you are serious about America's competition, Americans being  allowed to build more and invest more in the United States, onshoring  of our manufacturing supply chains, our competitiveness, then you want  to vote yes and go to conference.   We have had so many letters in the last month--the American Society  of Engineering Education, tech companies that believe in the  competition and the opportunity that we have seen--writing us and  saying to please get this legislation done. We have seen used car  prices shoot up 40 percent because semiconductor shortages have  basically created havoc in the automotive market.   And it is clear that our European and Asian counterparts aren't  waiting. They are moving ahead trying to deal with this supply chain  shortage because as the Secretary also told us yesterday, the shortage  is well defined. We know that it is going to last well into the future;  that is, there is demand.   So the question for the world economy is, Are you going to try to  meet that demand? And the answer is, there are a lot of people who are  going to try to meet that demand.   The question is, Are we going to try to meet that demand? The longer  we wait, the longer we take to meet that demand, the more the  investment is attracted to go somewhere else.   Now, the United States of America believes in having the leading edge  in semiconductor production, and we are excited that the next  generation of chips can do so many things for the smart appliances;  smart tools; clean energy economy; obviously, the communications  economy; the next generation of all sorts of technology as it relates  to our telecom sector. But we need to get this bill done. We need to  resolve the differences between the House and the Senate. And we need  to have bipartisan support to show that the U.S. Senate can function  legislatively on an issue that is not a mandatory or annual bill but a  process by which an issue, presented to us as a nation--supply chain,  competitiveness, manufacturing issues--that we can get the job done.   We in the United States pride ourselves on being a nation of  inventors. We are a leader in global technology. We know that we can  solve our problems by solutions that we, together--business and labor  and government and R&D investment--can bring the best ideas to fruition  and help us as a nation.   But we have to show that we, Democrats and Republicans, House and  Senate, can master the next step in the innovation process. That is  what these underlying bills do. It basically allows us to dust off our  R&D skills and say: Let's do more translational science.   So we have had lots of letters from people supporting tech hubs-- investments of universities working with business in a centralized  location to solve engineering problems and move ahead. We have the  Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program. And many of our small and  medium-sized businesses that need access to technology and supply chain  data to better compete in a global economy and provide security want  this legislation.   So the risks of inaction are too great to ignore. The U.S. Innovation  and Competition Act is clearly part of our supply chain solutions. I  urge my colleagues to not only help us by invoking cloture and going to  conference but help us resolve these issues in a timely fashion so we  can send a price signal about the investments that we want to make in  the United States of America to make our Nation and our manufacturers  more competitive.   With that, I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
