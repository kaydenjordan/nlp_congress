 Mr. Speaker, thank you for demonstrating that the House  of Representatives stands with the people of Iran and condemns the  country's brutal regime.   I rise today to applaud the Iranian people, who are struggling for  dignity, human rights, and economic security under a shadow of  oppression. We are a hemisphere away, but our hearts are with the brave  men and women who are raising their voices in hopes that they will  finally be free from the reins of tyranny.   The Iranian people are protesting the abuses of the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps, and we must support their outrage by  severely punishing and containing the IRGC with suffocating sanctions.   We must work with our allies to help Iranians communicate on the  internet without restrictions. We must broadcast footage from  protestors and hold authorities accountable for abuses.   America is an enthusiastic friend of the Iranian people. We are  thrilled to support their aspirations for justice and liberty, and we  stand with them as they take to the streets and demand an end to  oppression.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The time of the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) has expired.
