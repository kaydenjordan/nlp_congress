 Madam President, today I honor Fred Kelly Grant. In  March, our Nation unfortunately lost a reasoned, dedicated, and  outstanding advocate for locally driven decision-making. However, Fred  leaves a lasting remembrance in the extraordinarily positive impact he  had on so many people.   Fred, who was born in South Carolina and grew up in Idaho, earned a  degree in history at the College of Idaho before earning his law degree  at the University of Chicago Law School. His early career included  serving as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Baltimore from 1963-1965. He  then served as Assistant State's Attorney for Baltimore City, where he  was appointed chief of the organized crime division. He then practiced  criminal law in private practice before returning to Idaho and serving  as counsel for two former Idaho Governors, Cecil Andrus and John Evans.  He also served as law clerk for Judge Edward J. Lodge from 1975-1980,  and he provided legal, political assistance to local governments,  businesses, and individuals throughout his career. Further, Fred served  on multiple commissions, authored books, and led organizations. This  includes him helping to start the Stand and Fight Club focused on  preventing regulatory agencies from doing economic harm to rural  America.   Countless people all around the country were influenced and helped by  Fred. Fred was a long-time Idaho lawyer, but his influence and know-how  reached far beyond our Idaho borders. In a 2017 Washington Times  Article, Fred was aptly characterized as an ``unsung hero of rural  America.'' He gave needed weight to requiring the Federal Government to  coordinate with localities when implementing new rules. He emphasized  local policy and local plans as drivers of the economy. Fred championed  this effort in Idaho and nationally, extending important information  and experience to other local governments across the nation. In so  doing, he advanced the ideal of those closest to the land rightly  driving natural resources and environmental solutions.   This emphasis on locally driven, collaborative land management  decisions was the central focus of the Owyhee Initiative. Fred  masterfully provided local leadership at a critical time in the  history--and future--of Owyhee County. The Owyhee Initiative, ushered  into law through the hard work and strength of purpose of Fred and  other Owyhee Initiative partners, maintains a thoughtful balance of  multiple uses required for the betterment of an amazing part of our  great state and country. The collaborative efforts furthered in the  Owyhee Initiative remain an example of the great achievements that are  possible when we all come to the table and work through the differences  to find the common ground.   My staff and I knew him best during the many years of sustained  effort on the Owyhee Initiative, yet we are aware that his life reached  many people well beyond that important work. Many have shared messages  describing Fred. The tributes share words in common: perseverance,  remarkable intelligence, created lasting friendships, wisdom, deeply  caring, empathetic, perceptive, quick wit, and love. All of these  characteristics and more are but a start in describing Fred.   For me, perhaps the sense of personal respect and understanding I had  for Fred are what seem most powerful. The previously mentioned  Washington Times article from three years ago, included a quote from  Fred stating, ``I'm tempted all the time to retire . . . But, I truly  believe in this nation and I think there are too few people who  understand and believe in the core principle of the federal republic,  and if we lose that, I believe we lose what makes the Constitution the  most perfect instrument of government that's ever been created.'' He  lived this and left a lasting charge for all of us never to let up in  smartly pushing back against Federal supersession of local decision- making. I extend my deepest sympathy to Fred's widow, Carol, and all of  Fred's family and friends. We all miss Fred and are grateful for his  life, legacy and friendship.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor J. Kirk Sullivan,  who had a long-time, distinguished career in principal Idaho industries  and politics.   Kirk was born and raised in Greenwood, SC. His alma mater is Clemson  University, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in  Chemistry and a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. Throughout his life,  Kirk continued to support Clemson along with other educational  institutions, especially in Idaho. As he began his career, Kirk went to  work for FMC Corporation in South Charleston, WV, and met his wife,  Betty. Over their 59 years of marriage, the couple had two children,  Hal and Kim, and three grandchildren, Matthew, Adam, and Sara. In 1965,  Kirk and Betty moved to Pocatello. Kirk's obituary reads, ``Kirk had a  deep love for the State of Idaho and chose to make this place his home  for 50 years.'' After the Sullivans moved to New York for a 1-year FMC  work opportunity, they thankfully returned to Idaho, where Kirk went to  work in Boise for Boise Cascade Company. In 1998, Kirk retired as the  vice president of governmental and environmental affairs, after a 28- year career with the company.   Kirk in no way was idle in retirement. In 1999, he cofounded  consulting firm Veritas Advisors, and he served as chairman of the  Idaho Republican Party from 2004-2008. In addition to his remarkable  career, Kirk's obituary reads, ``Kirk shared his treasure and talents  with countless non-profits, state-appointed boards, and political  organizations. Dozens of those organizations have honored his work for  them and those accolades will always be cherished by his children and  grandchildren. He humbly loved knowing he was contributing to others'  lives.''   Kirk's passing in early April came at an especially challenging time,  as families have had to postpone memorials in the wake of the novel  coronavirus  [[Page S2377]]  pandemic. I extend my deep condolences and prayers to Betty, their  family, and friends. Kirk is described in his obituary first as a  loving husband, father, and grandfather. Additionally, Kirk was a  pillar of Idaho industry and politics, thought-leader, and friend, who  no doubt boosted and inspired countless budding leaders and efforts  throughout our great State.                            ____________________
