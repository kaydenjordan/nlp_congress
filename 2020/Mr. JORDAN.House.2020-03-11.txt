 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   I rise in support of the reform legislation.   This bill is not perfect, as the chairman said. It does not contain  every reform that I would like to see or the reforms that I advocated  for and many others advocated for, but it is a start. Most importantly,  this bill is an improvement over what currently exists, over the status  quo.   The legislation begins to address the problems that we saw with the  FBI's illegal surveillance of Trump campaign associate Carter Page.   On December 9, 2019, the nonpartisan Justice Department inspector  general released a 400-page report detailing the FBI's misconduct and  the failures in its warrantless surveillance of Mr. Page.   Congressman Meadows and I urged our Democratic chairman to hold  hearings on this report, but they were not interested.   Still, I hope all of my colleagues had a chance to read the inspector  general's report because it should concern every single American.   Remember, if our law enforcement agencies can do this to a President,  imagine what they can do to you and me.   The Justice Department inspector general found 17 significant errors  or omissions in the FISA warrant applications for Mr. Page. Said more  plainly, they lied to the court 17 times.   They didn't tell the court important information, like the guy who  wrote the dossier was being paid for by the opposition party's  campaign. They didn't tell the court the guy who wrote the document,  the dossier, that they used to get the warrant was ``desperate'' to  stop Trump and had communicated that to the Justice Department.   The inspector general also found 51 factual assertions made to the  FISA court that were wrong or unsupported. It detailed how the FBI was  too eager to rely on phony political opposition research conducted by  Christopher Steele and, as I said, funded by the Democrats.   According to the inspector general: ``The FISA request form drew  almost entirely from Steele's reporting in describing the factual basis  to establish probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a  foreign power,'' which was not true.   The inspector general determined that the FBI did not have  corroborating information to support the specific allegations made  against Mr. Page. In fact, Steele was feeding the FBI gossip and  innuendo as proof of wrongdoing. Then, the FBI used that information,  as I said, to spy on an American citizen, without corroborating the  information.   This is a great misuse of immense power that our Federal Government  agencies have, and it is a severe abuse of trust.   Now, there has been a lot of talk about accountability for this  misconduct, and I absolutely agree. There needs to be accountability at  all levels.   The inspector general found that an FBI attorney actually doctored a  piece of evidence. An FBI attorney did this. He doctored a piece of  evidence that he used to obtain the warrant to spy on Mr. Page.   The attorney took an email that would have cut against the  surveillance order on Mr. Page and changed its meaning. He changed its  meaning 180 degrees so that it would support the surveillance. This is  totally unacceptable.   The same FBI lawyer who the inspector general found to have shared  anti-Trump text messages with his colleagues, writing all kinds of  things--``the crazies won finally,'' ``viva la resistance''--this  attorney went on to serve on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team  investigating the debunked allegations about Russian collusion.   The FBI's misconduct on FISA is not limited to junior staffers, as  some of my colleagues have asserted. Such rampant and flagrant abuse  can occur only because of senior leadership failures: Director Comey,  Deputy Director McCabe, and General Counsel Jim Baker.   In fact, the inspector general said as much in his report. Here are  his words: ``In our view, this was a failure of not only the  operational team, but also of the managers and supervisors, including  senior officials, in the chain of command.''   It is no coincidence that the two most senior FBI officials involved,  Director Comey and Deputy Director McCabe, were both referred for  criminal prosecution by the inspector general for wrongdoing related to  the investigations.   We cannot forget this background because that is why this reform  legislation--again, while not everything we hoped for--is a necessary  first step.  [[Page H1629]]    This bill would add several requirements to ensure a FISA application  is complete and accurate. It requires the Attorney General to sign off  on a FISA investigation of an elected official or candidate for Federal  office. It forces the Justice Department to fire anyone who knowingly  hides information from the FISA court. And the bill enhances  congressional oversight of the FISA process.   It also allows the FISA court to appoint an amicus in cases involving  political activities of a U.S. person. Because the FISA process is ex  parte--meaning, of course, the U.S. person is not represented--I hope  the appointment of the amicus will help the FISA court to protect the  civil liberties of U.S. persons.   Like I said, I think we can and should do more, and I look forward to  working with the chairman toward that end. But right now, this bill  would improve the civil liberty protections of U.S. citizens.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will just real quickly say that the gentlewoman is exactly right.  People should be prosecuted. It was so bad in the Carter Page  application. Here is what the former chief judge of the FISA court  said:         The frequency with which representations made by FBI       personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by       information in their possession and with which they withheld       information detrimental to their case calls into question       whether information contained in other FBI applications is       reliable.    Put in plain English: You lied so much, how can we trust any other  representation you have made to the court?   That is what this legislation is designed to begin to address and  protect American citizens who will be in front of this court.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Sensenbrenner), who has been a strong advocate in this area and former  chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire of the Chair how much time  the minority has remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.  [[Page H1632]]    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman from North Dakota just articulated,  the bill is better than where we are currently--no call detail records,  amicus kicks in if there is a First Amendment concern of any American  citizen who is in front of the court. The penalties are real: You lie  to the court, you omit information from the court, or you go leak  information about the application you submitted to the court, there are  enhanced penalties.   There is the transcript provision. There is now a transcript that  will be given to the intelligence community. That is a good step,  knowing that somebody is going to be looking at what you are doing and  is going to see it in a real timeframe is important.   The annual assessment from the IG, the same IG who just told us 3  months ago that the FBI went to the court in the Carter Page  application and lied 17 times, that individual, Mr. Horowitz, will be  doing an annual assessment; compliance office within the Department of  Justice so that there are more people looking at the application on the  front end, hopefully, we don't have as many problems; and finally, as  the chairman indicated, no cell site GPS location indication without a  warrant--those are victories for the American citizen. It is not as  much as we would like, but it is a darn good first step.   Madam Speaker, I urge people to support the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
