 Today, I am joined by Senators Warren, Brown, Van Hollen,  and Gillibrand to introduce legislation to ensure that at least one  Federal Reserve Governor has demonstrated primary experience in  supporting or protecting the rights of workers.   Our legislation is not the first to require a member of the Federal  Reserve Board of Governors to have a particular area of expertise.  Indeed, as part of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization  Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 93-4 and was signed into law  on January 12, 2015, Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to  require at least one of the seven Federal Reserve Governors to be an  individual ``with demonstrated primary experience working in or  supervising community banks.'' Our legislation would ensure that  workers get the very same representation that community bankers already  have on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.   As we all are aware, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of stable  prices and maximum employment. Our bill is designed to better ensure  that future Boards of Governors continue the current Board's focus on  its full employment mandate as evidenced by its explicit  acknowledgement last August in its revised Statement on Longer-Run  Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that ``maximum employment is a  broad-based and inclusive goal.'' This reflects the Fed's  ``appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly  for many in low-and moderate-income communities,'' with policy  decisions to be informed by the Board's ``assessments of the shortfalls  of employment from its maximum level'' rather than by ``deviations from  its maximum level'' as in its previous statement. While this may not  seem like a huge difference, it is reflective of the Board's ``view  that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak  of inflation.''   To put it more simply, this current Federal Reserve ``will remain  highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for  the benefit of all Americans,'' and our legislation seeks to ensure  that future Federal Reserve Boards will continue to do the same.   COVID-19 has shown us just how essential workers are to our economy  and our physical well-being. We all know grocery store workers, nurses,  firefighters, delivery workers, and other workers in both the public  and private sectors who, despite the risk to their own health, have  been literally holding together the fabric of our society and economy  so that we can make it safely to the other side of this public health  emergency. As such, they too deserve at least one member of the Board  of Governors with demonstrated primary experience in supporting or  protecting the rights of workers. I thank the AFL-CIO, Columbia  University Professor and Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, MIT Professor  and Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Simon Johnson,  and Georgetown Law Professor Adam Levitin for their support. and urge  our colleagues to join in pushing to enact this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Ms. Sinema):   S. 1475. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the issuance  of permits under title V of that Act for certain emissions from  agricultural production; to the Committee on Environment and Public  Works.
