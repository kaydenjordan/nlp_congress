 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4712, the so- called Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   Despite what its supporters would have us believe, this legislation  would do nothing to enhance protections or enhance the quality of care  if an infant is born after an attempted abortion. What it would do,  however, is directly interfere with the doctor's medical judgment and  dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all  circumstances, which could, in fact, put infants' lives at greater  risk.   Let me say at the outset of this debate very clearly, it has always  been the law that healthcare providers cannot deliberately harm newborn  infants and that they must exercise reasonable care in their treatment  of such infants. The bill's implications that providers who provide  abortions routinely act in a callous or criminal manner that would  result in an infant's death or that a provider who performs an abortion  somehow cannot be trusted to take adequate measures to save a living  baby's life is insulting and untrue.   In opposing this bill. I do not oppose in any way proper medical  treatment for newborn infants, whatever the circumstances of their  birth, but determining the proper treatment is for medical  professionals to decide, not politicians in Congress.   When I supported the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act in 2002, my  reasoning and the reasoning of my pro-choice colleagues was simple:  Killing an infant who is born alive either by an act of omission or  commission is infanticide. It was, is, and always should be against the  law, and we saw no harm in reaffirming that fact.   That law passed Congress with bipartisan support precisely because it  was harmless, even if it was also useless, since it did not change the  preexisting law in any way. The bill specifically just reiterated  existing law in florid language and did nothing to interfere with a  doctor's medical judgment or to cause needless harm.   Unfortunately, the bill before us today puts children's lives and  health at risk. It requires doctors to immediately ensure  transportation and admission of the infant to a hospital in all cases,  with no regard as to whether doing so is in the best interest of the  child's health and well-being.   This mandate effectively overrides the case-by-case exercise of  professional medical judgment by healthcare providers and replaces it  with a blanket rule enforceable with criminal penalties. Such a ham- fisted approach fails to consider the fact that, in many cases, it may  be safer and more conducive for the infant's health to care for the  infant where it was born rather than transporting it many miles away.  But this bill assumes that Congress knows better, and it imposes a new  obligation on providers that, rather than saving lives, could put  infants at risk.    I am sure that such a result is not what the bill's supporters  intend, but all too often, this is what happens when Members of  Congress try to dictate a physician's exercise of professional medical  judgment.   Perhaps if this bill had gone through regular order, we could have  avoided this unfortunate situation, but there has never been a  committee markup or a hearing on this bill. I would have welcomed the  opportunity to hear from expert witnesses on best practices and  standards of care for infants. Members could have offered amendments  and perfected the bill to ensure that it achieves our common goal of  providing the best, most medically appropriate care to infants and  their mothers.   I am disappointed but not surprised that my colleagues rushed this  bill to the floor when there is no evidence at all that doctors  currently are failing to provide an appropriate level of care and a  chorus of provider groups oppose the bill.   This is clearly an effort to have this vote coincide with the  presence of many anti-choice demonstrators in Washington. Sadly, rather  than protecting infants, my Republican colleagues are putting them at  greater risk in the service of politics.   I cannot support H.R. 4712 because it mandates a particular course of  treatment: immediate transport to a hospital, which may not be  appropriate in  [[Page H562]]  every case and may be medically dangerous in certain cases. It abandons  the practice of considering the best medical interest of infants and  their mothers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this ill-conceived  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the ranking Democrat on the  Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is a member of the  Judiciary Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his  leadership in serving on this committee, and I thank Mr. Cohen for his  very eloquent explanation.   Let me say that I stand with these women, Jenny R., Kathy L.,  Lindsey, and Taias, women who have experienced the tragedy of losing a  child, wanting a child, and wanting the protection of Roe v. Wade. I  stand with these women.   I rise today to again ask the question: Why do we divide over the  wonderment of birth?                                time  1000    I am reminded of H.R. 2175, passed in 2002, the Born-Alive Infants  Protection Act, which was widely supported.  [[Page H564]]    Now, we come on the eve of a failed administration in its first year  to stand as if we are doing something for those who are coming here-- and I have great respect for their position of pro-life--but it doesn't  mean that we must undermine the Constitution, add mandatory minimums,  make up needs where there are no needs. That is what this particular  bill does.   This amendment to H.R. 4712 is clearly involving and intruding into a  process between the mother, the doctor, the family, and her God. There  is no evidence of lawbreaking that has been uncovered that necessitates  congressional involvement.   Abortion is a proven safe, legal, and humane practice. It has to be  that way under the law. But we are in the middle of violating the  Constitution and the Supreme Court cases by passing this legislation:  up to 5 years in prison, a threat of financially crippling lawsuits,  and, of course, shutting down those health facilities that we  absolutely need.   Let me be very clear: we should be dealing with this shutdown that  the Republicans are planning and moving forward. The reason we should  be dealing with the shutdown is because law enforcement officers have  no money, our clinics have no money.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Wagner). The time of the gentlewoman  has expired.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, passing by the Capitol Police, it  made me think of my own law enforcement officers in Houston, Texas.  Because we do not have a budget, we do not have appropriations, we are  about to shut down the government. We have a CR. There is no funding  for police officers. There is no funding for the desperate people who  have been impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma. No funding  whatsoever.   I salute the Senate and the Senate Democrats for standing firm for  those people. There are no moneys for federally qualified health  clinics. There are no moneys for children's health insurance.   You are not doing your job, and here we are trying to create  mandatory minimums on a bill that is not necessary. I believe we should  try to keep this government open with the right kind of law.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4712, the ``Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.''   First of all, the majority's failure to govern and address the  priorities of the American people is staggering as we are faced with a  fourth continuing resolution finding ourselves four months into the  fiscal year.   The majority has yet to come up with a long term spending bill rather  than an incomplete stop gap that only covers the government until  February 16.   Republicans have wasted time creating the GOP Tax Scam and now  Republicans are still wasting time debating this anti-women bill once  again while there is no DACA solution and hundreds of thousands of  immigrants who have grown up in this country and greatly contribute to  society are facing unfair deportation.   I strongly oppose this latest attempt by the Republican House  majority to limit women's rights to safe and legal abortions.   H.R. 4712 amends the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act--a 2002 law  that the pro-choice community did not oppose.   This bill, however, adds penalties to the law and an entirely new  section in which Congress attempts to intrude directly into medical  practice of abortion care for anti-choice ideological purposes.   Anti-choice lawmakers say this new bill is necessary because some  babies ``survive'' abortion procedures.   They cite the now-discredited videos attacking Planned Parenthood as  their evidence.   Of course, such allegations are untrue: newborns already have many  legal protections, and there is no similarity between safe, legal  abortion care and infanticide.   This bill is a solution in search of a problem.   No evidence of lawbreaking has been uncovered that necessitates  congressional involvement.   Abortion practice is safe, legal, and humane; any evidence of  wrongdoing can and should be handled under existing law.   If there is ever a case of harm or mistreatment of newborns, then of  course, it should be investigated and prosecuted.   No such case exists here.   That makes it even clearer that H.R. 4712 must have other purposes;  we believe the bill's true goals are to inflame the public with  outrageous accusations, to interfere with medical care, and to  intimidate doctors out of practice.   This legislation is consistent with the assaults that the Trump  Administration and anti-abortion members of Congress in both the House  and Senate have been undertaking throughout the 115th Congress and show  no signs of ending.   The bill intrudes into medical practice, its mandate is so broad and  the penalties so severe--up to five years in prison and the threat of  financially crippling lawsuits--that one can only conclude that H.R.  4712 hopes to intimidate abortion providers out of practice.   This interference in medical care could also cause tremendous  additional grief to some families making difficult decisions in  heartbreaking cases.   We would not tolerate similar intrusion by politicians into any other  medical specialty; abortion care is no different.   Finally, it is important to put this legislation into the proper  context.   We are in the midst of an unprecedented assault against reproductive  rights: this bill is just one in a litany to restrict a woman's right  to choose while using women as political pawns with an extremist, anti- choice base.   Instead of spending time attempting to roll back women's  constitutionally protected rights, this House should be advancing  legislation that will reform our truly broken immigration and criminal  justice systems.   The bill before us is offered for a simple purpose; to sensationalize  opposition to abortion and serve as a political decoy to shut down our  government.   The United States Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago, in Roe v.  Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), that a woman's constitutional right to  privacy includes her right to abortion.   Since this landmark decision, abortion rates and risks have  substantially declined, as have the number of teen and unwanted  pregnancies.   Restricting all access to reproductive and women's health services  only exacerbates a woman's risk of an unintended pregnancy and fails to  accomplish any meaningful overthrow of Roe v. Wade.   In recent years, state policymakers have passed hundreds of  restrictions on abortion care under the guise of protecting women's  health and safety.   Fights here in Congress have been no different.   In my state of Texas a law that would have cut off access to 75  percent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged  before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 2015.   On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional  a Texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that  provided the fail range of services would be required to have a  hospital-style surgery center building and staffing requirements.   This requirement meant that only 7 clinics would be allowed to  continue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to  women.   Texas has 268,580 square miles only second in size to the state of  California.   The impact of the law in implementation would have ended access to  reproductive services for millions of women in my state.   In 2015, the State of Texas once again threatened women's access to  reproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10  healthcare providers in the state of Texas.   The Supreme Court once again intervened on the behalf of Texas women  to block the move to close clinics in my state.   It seems every month we are faced with a new attack on women's access  to reproductive health care, often couched in those same terms.   But we know that's not really the case.   If my colleagues were so concerned about women's health and safety,  they would be promoting any one of the number of evidence-based  proactive policies that improve women's health and well-being.   Instead, they are attacking Planned Parenthood in a back-handed  attempt to ban abortion.   That is their number one priority. This is certainly not about  protecting women's health, it's about politics.   Just as the 1988 Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel  (or the Blue Ribbon Commission) sought to separate the question of  ethics of abortion from the question ethics of using fetal tissue from  legal elective abortions for medical research when laying the  foundation for the 1993, NIH Health Revitalization Act (which passed  overwhelmingly with bipartisan support), we must separate the personal  views of abortion from the legal issues of federal compliance.   Namely, the NIH Health Revitalization Act prohibits the payment or  receipt of money or any other form of valuable consideration for fetal  tissue, regardless of whether the program to which the tissue is being  provided is funded or not.   A limited exception, and crux of the applicable issue of legality,  lies with provision allowing for reimbursement for actual expenses  [[Page H565]]  (e.g. storage, processing, transportation, etc.) of the tissue.   Planned Parenthood repeatedly maintains and supports that their  affiliates involved with fetal tissue research comply with this  requirement.   In fact, of the 700+ affiliate health care centers across the  country, only 4 Planned Parenthood affiliates currently offer tissue  donation service and of those 4, only 2 (California and Washington)  offer fetal tissue donation services--that's 1 percent of all Planned  Parenthood service centers.   The California affiliate receives a modest reimbursement of $60 per  tissue specimen and the Washington affiliate receives no reimbursement.   It is worth noting that fetal tissue has been used for decades.   Since the 1920's researchers have used fetal tissue to study and  treat various neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries, diabetes,  immune deficiencies, cancers and life-threatening blood diseases.   One of the earliest advances with fetal tissue was to use fetal  kidney cells to create the first poliovirus vaccines, which are now  estimated to save 550,000 lives worldwide every year.   The most widely known application in the field of human fetal tissue  transplantation has been the treatment of Parkinson's disease.   Many of our other common vaccines, such as polio, measles, chicken  pox, rubella and shingles, have been developed through the use of fetal  tissue or cell lines derived from fetal tissue.   When looking at the 1 percent of health care providers involved in  fetal tissue donation and research, and no clear credible proof of  illegal activity, it is obvious that attacks on Planned Parenthood are  wholly misguided.   Planned Parenthood has one of the most rigorous Medical standards and  accreditation processes in the country.   It is the only national provider that has developed a single set of  evidence-based Medical Standards and Guidelines that define how health  care is provided throughout the country.   Guidelines are developed and updated annually by a group of  nationally-renowned experts, physicians, and scientists, including  medical experts from Harvard and Columbia.   Planned Parenthood affiliates must submit to accreditation reviews  that include 100 indicators (or high level areas of review) and over  600 individual Elements of Performance (or measures for review). Half  of these relate to the provision of medical care and patient safety.   Violations of mandatory reporting regulations are subject to  disciplinary action, up to and including termination.   It is no secret that the Center for Medical Progress is an extreme  anti-choice organization with a goal of outlawing legal abortion  procedures in this country.   To achieve that goal, they have shamelessly targeted Planned  Parenthood and the funding that provides healthcare services to  millions of women every year.   They continue to use deceptive tactics and secret videos to try and  undermine Planned Parenthood.   Just like Live Action, the Center for Medical Progress is not a group  that can be taken credibly.   The Center for Medical Progress is simply recreating a history  doctoring and manipulating video intended to create misimpressions  about Planned Parenthood.   It is a coordinated effort by anti-choice forces--not only on Planned  Parenthood or a woman's right to choose, but on women's health care  across the board.   Hundreds of thousands have already spoken up, including leading  groups and communities such as the growing voice of our millennial  generation.   My colleagues should be doing more to connect our youth and women to  services that help them reduce their risk of unintended pregnancies and  STD's, and improve their overall health through preventative  screenings, education and planning, rather than restricting their  access to lawfully entitled family-planning and private health  services.   I urge all Members to vote against this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), a former member of the  Judiciary Committee.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to H.R. 4712.   This bill would allow the Federal Government to override a doctor's  medical judgment, without exception. It is motivated by politics, not  science.   First, this bill reiterates current law, which already protects all  newborns from medical negligence. Second, the criminal penalties in  this bill go above and beyond current law and are clearly intended to  intimidate doctors. This isn't sound medical practice. This is politics  impeding a doctor's medical judgment.   And what is more, this intimidation would endanger newborns. This  bill would require all newborn infants to be immediately transferred to  the nearest hospital, but not all hospitals have neonatal units, or it  might be harmful to move the infant immediately. Clearly, the intent is  not to protect newborns but to stir outrage.   This bill is a solution in search of a problem. It is unnecessary,  redundant, and part of a broader attack on women's health and  reproductive rights from this Chamber and the Trump administration.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  ranking member for his extraordinary leadership and for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4712.   In the past year, the usual Republican stream of anti-woman, anti- choice policies has turned into a flood.   Today's vile bill is based on myths and lies and is designed to  intimidate doctors from providing abortions.   I would like to remind my colleagues that for 45 years, the Supreme  Court has upheld a woman's constitutional right to access a legal  abortion, and that current law already protects infants, as well it  should.   But Republicans would rather play politics with women's lives than  rely on science and the law.   This bill seeks to criminalize legal medical services and put  extreme, anti-choice ideology between a woman and her doctor.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, in what other  circumstance would we ever tolerate denying, delaying, or interfering  with legitimate and legal medical care?   This must stop.   Protect women from this political charade. Allow doctors to take care  of their patients.   Please vote ``no'' on this unfair, vile bill.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. McEachin).   Mr. McEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Nadler for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4712.   This act is a continuation of the House Republicans' decadelong  attempt to rob women of their constitutional right to safe, legal  abortion care. The bill we are considering today, however, takes these  attacks on women a step further.   H.R. 4712 seeks to supersede doctors' professional judgments,  imposing unnecessary, and potentially harmful, new standards of care.  Violation of these extreme standards will result in harsh criminal  penalties.   This bill seeks to intimidate doctors. If passed, it will discourage  them from providing care and make it harder for patients to receive the  help they need.   That is why it is opposed by respected medical organizations, such as  the American College of Obstetricians  [[Page H568]]  and Gynecologists, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the  National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, and many  others.   It is simple: healthcare decisions should be between a woman and her  doctor.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.   Mr. McEACHIN. Madam Speaker, again, it is simple: healthcare  decisions should be between a woman and her doctor.   Politicians are not medical experts and have no place interfering  with the provision of compassionate, evidence-based care.   Madam Speaker, I am an attorney and you can trust me with a lot of  things, but a medical decision on someone else's behalf is not one of  them.   As we mark the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we should be  advancing policies that help women and families, rather than  restricting access to healthcare they need and deserve.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4712.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire if the other side is ready  to close?    Madam Speaker, may I inquire if the other side is ready  to close?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I end this debate by reiterating the point I made at  the beginning. This legislation would do nothing to enhance protections  or the quality of healthcare if an infant is born after an attempted  abortion.   The 2002 law reaffirmed that it has always been, and is now, against  the law to intentionally kill or harm a newborn infant whatever the  circumstances of its birth.   The other side has referred several times to the case of Dr. Gosnell.  Dr. Gosnell is now in jail under a sentence of life imprisonment  without parole, plus 30 years, convicted of first-degree murder without  this bill, because it is already against the law not to give proper  care or, God forbid, to murder a baby born alive.   The law already requires the highest standard of care for all  newborns. This bill does nothing new to protect infants in any respect.   The bill, however, is not harmless. Rather, by demanding the  immediate transportation of the newborn to a hospital, regardless of  the medical or other circumstances, it would place the lives and health  of some newborn infants at risk.   The bill directly interferes with a doctor's medical judgment and  dictates a particular course of action that may be harmful to the  newborn in the particular circumstances. That is why a coalition of 13  healthcare provider groups, joined by a coalition of 25 additional  health, civil rights, and women's rights groups, strongly opposes this  bill. As the providers note, the bill wrongly ``injects politicians  into the patient-physician relationship, disregarding providers'  training and clinical judgment and undermining their ability to  determine the best course of action with their patients.''   Let me add one other thing. This bill does not interfere, in any way,  with the rights secured by the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.  That decision guarantees the right of a woman to choose an abortion if  she wishes.   It does not, nor does any other law or any other provision, negate  the command of the law that everyone respects that any newborn child,  whatever the circumstances of its birth, must be cared for in the best  possible medical way, and, of course, deliberately killing it would be  first-degree murder.   This bill does not change this, but this bill does do harm by  presenting risk to certain newborns by demanding their immediate  transport to the hospital when it may be harmful to their health to do  so.   We should listen to the healthcare professionals, we should respect  their judgment, and the House must reject this seriously flawed bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
