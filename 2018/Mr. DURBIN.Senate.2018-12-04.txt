 Mr. President, several years ago, after his 3-year-old  daughter Robin passed away from leukemia, George Herbert Walker Bush  wrote to his mother about how much he loved and missed his little girl.  It is a beautiful, almost heartbreaking letter. Near the end, he wrote  about his daughter's continued presence in his life and the life of his  family. He said: ``We cannot touch her and yet we feel her.''   President Bush himself has now passed beyond our reach. Yet,  knowingly or not, we all feel the difference he made in the Nation and  in the world. Many of us feel that deep longing for a ``kinder,  gentler'' Nation that President Bush promised in his inaugural address  30 years ago.  [[Page S7264]]    George Herbert Walker Bush was an American patriot who devoted his  life to his family and to his country. On his 18th birthday--6 months  after Pearl Harbor--he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and became one of the  youngest aviators in the history of the Navy. He was discharged 1 month  after Japan's surrender, but he never stopped serving America.   There is a book entitled ``Flyboys'' that tells the story of the  squadron George Herbert Walker Bush was a part of and the deadly  mission they were given in the South Pacific. He flew some 58 missions  as a Navy pilot. On his last assignment, he was shot down, and two of  his crew were killed in that confrontation. Fortunately for us and for  him, he was rescued by a submarine. There is a grainy, black-and-white  film of his being fished out of the ocean by the American submarine  that is still an inspiration to this day.   As the 41st President of the United States and the father of the 43rd  President, he was the linchpin of a political dynasty that spanned four  generations. He already had a lifetime of public service before he  became President--as a Texas Congressman, Ambassador to the United  Nations, Envoy to China, Director of the CIA, and Vice President to  Ronald Reagan.   Despite his extraordinary achievements, he was a man of remarkable  humility. If his syntax sounded a little choppy at times--and Dana  Carvey made a fortune imitating him--it was partly due to the fact that  George Herbert Walker Bush had difficulty using the words ``I'' and  ``me.'' When he was a young boy, his mother taught him that those were  the words of braggarts. Riding in the Presidential limousine through  streets lined with cheering crowds, he once told a fellow passenger:  ``They're not clapping for me; they're clapping for the office of the  President.'' That was exactly how he thought it should be.   I was still a rather new Congressman when George Herbert Walker Bush  was President. I sure didn't agree with all of his policies, as my  voting record demonstrates, but that is a discussion for another time.  As President Bush's own life shows us, there is a time for politics,  and there is a time to put politics aside and to recall the exceptional  lifetime of service he gave to our Nation.   President Reagan helped hurry the end of the Cold War, but it fell to  President George Herbert Walker Bush to successfully navigate the  aftermath.   When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, he insisted there would be no  gloating or triumphalism from his administration.   His low-key approach helped set the tone for our NATO allies, and it  helped make possible the peaceful end of the Soviet Union. Never before  had such a heavily armed empire ended with so little turmoil or  bloodshed in its final days. In the 2 years before the collapse of the  Soviet Union, President Bush and then-Soviet President Mikhail  Gorbachev successfully negotiated the START nuclear arms treaty. Under  President George Herbert Walker Bush, we saw the largest reduction in  nuclear weapons in history, and America and the world are safer today  because of it.   If you want to see the world's enduring respect for President Bush,  look at the statesmen and stateswomen expected to attend his memorial  service tomorrow at the National Cathedral. Among them are Mikhail  Gorbachev, his partner in historic change, and German Chancellor Angela  Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany.   It is said that the Germans today credit George Herbert Walker Bush  more than any person for their successful reunification. He knew that  America is stronger when we work with partners than when we imagine we  can somehow go it alone. When Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990,  George Herbert Walker Bush methodically assembled an international  coalition to push them back.   He left his mark on domestic policy as well. He fought for and in  1990 signed the Americans with Disabilities Act--one of the greatest  civil rights laws in our Nation's modern history.   President Bush was a committed conservative and a Texan by choice. He  had close ties to the oil industry, but he believed in science. What a  welcome change it would be in Washington today if his party felt the  same. President George Herbert Walker Bush understood that poisoning  our planet is not just unfair to future generations, it is bad for  business, and it is bad for our economy. He helped build bipartisan  support--this Republican President helped build bipartisan support--and  signed the Clean Air Act of 1990, strengthening the Federal  Government's role and protecting the very air we breathe. He signed the  Global Change Research Act of 1990, establishing an interagency Federal  council to improve understanding of global change and to devise a plan  to reduce the risks of climate catastrophe. What a sharp contrast to  the current administration. George Herbert Walker Bush's work was the  work of a leader.   Between 1980 and 1990, America's budget deficit tripled to $220  billion, driven largely by the Reagan-era tax cuts. In 1990, with a lot  of criticism, President Bush had the courage to sign a tax increase--as  President Reagan had before him--to help pay down the deficit for  future generations. He put the interests of future generations ahead of  his own short-term political advantage, and he paid a heavy price in  the next election. He may have even lost because of it. Years later, he  received a Profile in Courage Award for that leadership.   In his inaugural address, President Bush said that the real strength  and greatness of America came from ``a thousand points of light''--the  countless acts of decency and compassion we show to each other and to  those in need. In his post-Presidential years, he remained a committed  advocate for volunteerism, community, and national service. He was  active in domestic and global humanitarian activities, often alongside  former President Bill Clinton, an old political opponent turned ally.   In 1995, after a domestic terrorist bombed the Murrah Federal  Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people and injuring 680 more,  the National Rifle Association sent out a fundraising letter denouncing  the Federal agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as  ``jack-booted thugs.'' Former President George Herbert Walker Bush  reacted with anger. He denounced that vitriol by the NRA as ``a vicious  slander on good people.'' He publicly resigned his NRA lifetime  membership, placing conscience ahead of political calculation.   Like John McCain and others who have personally experienced the  terror of war, George Herbert Walker Bush did not confuse politics with  war. He did not mistake political opponents for enemies. He understood  that people can have differences of opinion and both still love the  country.   Our sadness at losing him seems partly a reflection for our own deep,  deep yearning as a nation today for the kind of leadership and  character and integrity and honesty and courage that he brought to the  Office of Presidency.   In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln pleaded with a  nation on the knife's edge of war. He said:         We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.    Lincoln urged us to be guided ``by the better angels of our nature.''   In his own inaugural address, President George Herbert Walker Bush  also spoke of all Americans as friends. Let me read two short sections  of his remarks.         My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are       not the measure of our lives. In our hearts, we know what       matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger       car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense       of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a       citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better       than he found it. And what do we want the men and women who       work with us to say when we're no longer there? That we were       more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we       stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a       moment there to trade a word of friendship?    President George Bush went on to say:         America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in       high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose       today. It is to make kinder the face of the nation and       gentler the face of the world. . . . My friends, we have work       to do.    As a tribute to George Herbert Walker Bush, who lies in state in the  Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol--the 32nd person to be so honored in our  history--let us try to remember we are not enemies but friends, and may  we summon the courage, the wisdom, and the humility to put the  interests of our Nation and our world ahead of self-interest.  [[Page S7265]]    In closing, my wife Loretta and I send our deepest condolences to  President Bush, his family, and all who knew and loved him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 1830, a family of dirt-poor farmers  moved to Illinois. In the previous 14 years, this family had moved from  Kentucky to Indiana, always eking out a bare subsistence. In Illinois,  they hoped their luck might finally improve.   After helping his father establish a small farm, the family's 21- year-old son struck out on his own. In the little village of New Salem,  he found work as a shopkeeper, postmaster, and a member of the Illinois  State Legislature.   On April 15, 1837, that young man moved to Springfield, Illinois'  capitol. There, this self-taught man began a successful law practice.  He married, and he and his wife welcomed four sons. His 23 years in  Springfield were the happiest of his life.   When he left his adopted hometown in the late winter of 1861, he told  the friends and neighbors and well-wishers who crowded to the train  depot to see him off: ``To this place, and the kindness of these  people, I owe everything.'' He hoped he would return one day, but it  wasn't to be.   On April 15, 1961, 28 years to the day after he first arrived in  Springfield, President Lincoln was killed by an assassin's bullet. He  died just days after the end of the Civil War, the ``fiery trial''  through which he had steered our Nation--the cataclysm that finally  ended America's original sin of slavery.   Most historians rate Abraham Lincoln as America's greatest President,  and I agree. We who live in Illinois are proud to call our State ``The  Land of Lincoln.''   Illinois had entered the Union as America's 21st State only 11 years  before Lincoln's father Thomas moved his family there.   Yesterday, Tuesday, December 3, Illinois celebrated our 200th  anniversary as a State. To commemorate this historic anniversary,  Senator Duckworth and I introduced a resolution that passed the Senate  earlier this year. An identical resolution was introduced in the U.S.  House of Representatives, where Abraham Lincoln served one term in the  late 1840s.   Let me tell you about my home State. Illinois stretches from the  Wisconsin border in the north to the Kentucky border in the southeast.  The southernmost point in our State, the town of Cairo, Illinois, lies  farther south than Richmond, VA.   We also border Lake Michigan to the northeast, Indiana to the east,  Missouri to the west, and Iowa to the northwest. You could fit  Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Albania, and Cyprus inside Illinois'  borders; that is how large Illinois is.   If Illinois were an independent nation, our economy, valued at over  $820 billion, would be the 19th largest economy in the world, just  ahead of Saudi Arabia.   We are the fifth-largest economy among U.S. States, and we are among  the top States in exports, value-added manufacturing, and agricultural  income.   The deep black soil of much of northern and central Illinois is among  the finest in the world. More than 75 percent of Illinois is still  covered by farms, more than 72,000 of them.   While this year marks Illinois 200th anniversary as a State,  societies have flourished in Illinois for over a millennium.   Near Collinsville, IL, across the Mississippi River from St. Louis,  is the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, the remains of the most  sophisticated prehistoric native civilization north of Mexico.   Historians estimate that Cahokia was first settled around 700 A.D. By  1250 A.D., Cahokia was larger than London. The flat-topped pyramids  built by its inhabitants are as tall as the Great Pyramid of Giza.   Next came the Illinois Confederation, about a dozen Native American  Tribes. The first Europeans to reach Illinois, French explorers,  arrived in the 17th century. Most of the French Illinois following the  nearly decade-long French and Indian War in the mid-18th century. Then  came the English settlers and colonists from many of America's 13  original States.   In the 1840s, Illinois, like most of America, experienced great waves  of European immigrants, starting with the Germans and Irish, followed  by immigrants came from Poland, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Sweden,  Austria, and Russia.   During World War I, the Great Migration began, the steady flow of  African Americans from the Jim Crow South to the major industrial  centers of the North, and Chicago was the Mecca of the Great Migration.   You can see and hear and taste our immigrant roots in the vibrant,  ethnic neighborhoods of Chicago and in cities and towns and villages  throughout our State.   Illinois is home to many firsts. In February 1865, Illinois became  the first State to ratify the 13th Amendment, outlawing slavery and  involuntary servitude in America.   The first skyscraper in the entire world was built in Chicago in  1885. The world's first Ferris wheel debuted at the Chicago World's  Fair in 1893. Chicago gave the world the first televised presidential  debate . . . the first successful open-heart surgery . . . and the  world first self-controlled nuclear reaction.   Evanston, the home Northwestern University, is also the birthplace of  the ice cream sundae. The first McDonald's in the world was in Des  Plaines. Lake Michigan is the largest body of freshwater in a world  that is fast running out of water.   Illinois is a land of ingenuity and invention. In 1900, after vents  threatened the safety of Chicago's water supply, engineers built a  series of canal locks that actually reversed the flow of the Chicago  River, a feat that was named a ``civil engineering monument of the  millennium'' by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1999.   Illinois inventors have contributed to inventions from meatpacking  and blood-banking, to the farm silo, the zipper, the vacuum cleaner,  the mechanical dishwasher, the wireless remote control, and the cell  phone.   Illinois has sent its sons and more than a few of its daughters to  fight for this Nation in war after war.   Today, it is home to 20,000 Active-Duty members of America's Armed  Forces, 24,000 members of the reserved forces, and more than 643,000  veterans who risked their lives to protect all of us.   My partner in this body, Senator Tammy Duckworth, is a proud example  of the courage and dignity and self-sacrifice of Illinois veterans.   Let me tell you about some of the other remarkable men and women  Illinois has given to our world.   They include champions of justice such as Jane Addams, the first  American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for her work a century  ago founding Hull House and helping poor families, especially immigrant  families, to achieve their American dream.   Other Illinois champions of justice include Clarence Darrow, the  legal champion of underdogs, and Betty Bloomer, whose courage in  helping to reduce the stigma surrounding both breast cancer and  addiction has saved untold numbers of lives. The world knows her better  as First Lady Betty Ford.   Illinois comedians from Jack Benny to Robin Williams, John Belushi,  and Richard Pryor have made the world laugh. Illinois singers and  musicians, including Miles Davis, Sam Cooke, Nat King Cole, Mahalia  Jackson, and the Staple Singers, have made the world sing and dance-- and maybe even work for justice and peace. Illinois storytellers,  including Walt Disney and Ernest Hemingway, have captivated viewers and  readers for generations.   In the field of sports, the Chicago Cubs have taught generations of  fans the virtue of patience, going more than a century before once  again winning the World Series in 2016.   Chicago has more than its share of sports champions. The Chicago  Bears won the Super Bowl in 1986. The Chicago White Sox won the World  Series in 2005. The Chicago Blackhawks clinched the Stanley Cup in  2010, 2013, and 2015.   The Chicago Bulls, led by the legendary Michael Jordan, won the NBA  championship every year from 1991 through 1993 and from 1996 through  1998.   Illinois is the home State of President Ronald Reagan, and the  adopted  [[Page S7266]]  home State of President Barack Obama, America's first African-American  President.   It is also home to the first African-American woman ever to serve in  this body, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.   The author and poet Carl Sandburg, another son of Illinois, wrote,  ``Nothing happens unless first we dream.''   In Illinois' 200 years as a State, its sons and daughters have never  stopped dreaming of ways to make life better and fairer, and working to  make those dreams come true.   As we begin our third century as a member of this great Union, we  intend to continue that proud tradition.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, one of our most preeminent oral historians  of our time turns 100 on December 7. Timuel Black was born near the end  of World War I and has been the keeper of the soul of the south side of  Chicago to this very day. World War I was supposed to be the war to end  all wars, but we know some of America's greatest wars were yet to come.  Tim Black was on the frontlines of many of those fights. As a  historian, as an activist, and a humanist, he fought and continues to  fight for the dignity of people and a better future.   Professor Black was born in 1918, in Birmingham, AL, the son of  sharecroppers and grandson of slaves. At 8 months, his family moved to  Chicago, joining the first wave of migration of African Americans from  the Deep South to the North. His family settled in an area of Chicago  then-called the Black Belt. It is now known as Bronzeville.   Tim would go on to celebrate and shape the history of Chicago's Black  Belt. To Tim, this is sacred ground. But first, he went to Burke  Elementary School and DuSable High School. His classmates included Nat  King Cole; future publisher and founder of Jet and Ebony Magazine, John  H. Johnson, the first African American on Forbes' 400 most wealthy; and  future Mayor Harold Washington. Don Cornelius and musician Sonny Cohn  also were among the many famous students of DuSable High School.   It was on his birthday in 1941 that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. The  U.S. Army drafted Tim into a segregated army 2 years later. In the last  2 years of World War II, Tim experienced the worst of the war. He  participated in the Normandy invasion, the Battle of the Bulge, and the  liberation of Paris. He earned four battle stars. But it was what he  saw while liberating the Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp, that  altered the way Tim saw the world. The horrors of the human capacity  for cruelty at Buchenwald filled Tim with despair.   He returned to Chicago, resolved to fight for human rights and human  dignity. He earned an undergraduate degree from Roosevelt University  and a master's degree from the University of Chicago. Tim started his  professional career as a social worker, but he quickly discovered that  his real love was, in his words, ``teaching young men and women about  the world they live in and how to be responsible citizens of that  world.''   For 40 years, Tim did just that through his teaching positions at  DuSable and other Chicago public schools, as well as Roosevelt  University, Columbia College Chicago, and schools in the City Colleges  of Chicago system.   Tim also has spent his life on the frontlines of the struggle for  human rights and dignity. At age 13, he walked his first picket line to  protest the refusal of White-owned businesses in Bronzeville to hire  Black clerks. As an organizer in labor and social justice movements of  the 1940s and 1950s, he worked with Paul Robeson and W.E.B. Dubois.   Tim helped establish the Congress of Racial Equality and the United  Packinghouse Workers of America labor union. I might not be where I am  today were it not for Tim's work because it was the Packinghouse union  that helped me work through college.   In December of 1955, Tim was watching television when he first saw an  inspiring man in Montgomery, AL. He hopped on a plane to meet him. A  year later, Tim convinced him to come to Chicago. This was the first  time Dr. Martin Luther King would speak in the city. Tim then helped  organize the Freedom Trains that carried thousands of Chicagoans to  hear Dr. King roar ``I Have a Dream'' in Washington, DC, in 1963. In  1966, Tim was right there with Dr. King when an angry mob attacked him  in Chicago's Marquette Park. Whenever there was a good fight against  Jim Crow housing, segregated public beaches, job discrimination, or the  shortchanging of Black students in public schools, you would always  find Tim Black.   There is one student of Professor Black we all remember. A couple of  decades ago, a young community organizer who had just returned to  Chicago with a Harvard law degree asked Professor Black to teach him  about organizing people so they could create a better life for  themselves and their children. The young organizer and Professor Black  became friends over the years. It was my privilege to invite Professor  Black and his wonderful wife Zenobia Johnson-Black to be my guests as  that community organizer swore an oath to become the President of the  United States. I could not have had a better guest to see the history  that he had helped make possible as Barack Obama became our first Black  President.   Tim may have retired from teaching years ago, but we are all still  students in his never-ending classroom. His three-volume history of  Chicago's Black Belt, entitled ``Bridges of Memory,'' is the story of  the great Black migration to Chicago from the Deep South, told by those  who made that journey and by their descendants. His home in Hyde Park  is an incomparable museum of stories about every place he has lived in  Chicago. The theaters he first heard Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and  Billie Holliday are still alive and well in memories to be shared.   Happy birthday, Tim Black. Generations have grown up with a better  appreciation of their homes and the history they inhabit because of  you.  [[Page S7274]]                                ____________________
