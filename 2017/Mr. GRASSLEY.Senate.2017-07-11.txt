 Mr. President, I am going to speak for about 5 minutes.  Before I begin, I will reference an item that I ask unanimous consent  be printed in the Record following my speech.   I rise to share real stories of real hardships from hard-working  families in my home State of Iowa. Seven years ago, Americans were  promised that the Affordable Care Act would make health insurance  cheaper and healthcare more accessible. Well, I will not pretend to  break any news here. The facts speak for themselves: ObamaCare is not  living up to its promises. When passing the law, the other side made  promises they knew could not be kept.   The irony is, the so-called Affordable Care Act is anything but  affordable. I have heard from many Iowans who tell me, in no uncertain  terms, that they cannot afford to buy health insurance because  ObamaCare is unaffordable. In fact, 72,000 Iowans can't even get help  from the exchange because there isn't an insurance company to service  them.   One Iowan wrote to me:         I am forced to pay $230 a month for a healthcare plan that       covers nothing until I reach $11,000 in deductible. So on top       of paying 100 percent of my medical bills anyway, now I also       have to pay for insurance I can't use.    How did we get to this point?   Seven years ago, I spoke right here on the Senate floor and predicted  what would happen to the cost of insurance if ObamaCare passed. So  let's go back to that period of time when I spoke in October of 2009.  This is my own quote from that speech:         And while some of the supporters of these partisan bills       may not want to tell their constituents, we all know that as       national spending on health care insurance increases,       American families will bear the burden in the form of higher       premiums. So let me be very clear, as a result of the current       pending health care proposals, most Americans will pay higher       premiums for health insurance.    That is the end of my quote from a speech in the Senate in October of  2009.   Now, I don't have a magic crystal ball, but it was easy to read the  writing on the wall. I knew that layers of new taxes and burdensome new  mandates in ObamaCare would lead us to where we find ourselves today: a  broken healthcare system that is not better off than it was 7 years  ago, and for millions of Americans--including those 72,000 Iowans--it  is much worse.   So where do we go from here? After 7 years of rising premiums,  soaring deductibles, and climbing copays, Republicans are committed to  fixing the damage caused by the Affordable Care  [[Page S3890]]  Act. Not only is it unaffordable for too many people, it is  unsustainable. ObamaCare is unable to fulfill its promises to the  American people.   Here is what every lawmaker in Congress ought to agree on: Insurance  isn't worth having if patients can't afford to use that insurance. The  facts are clear. A one-size-fits-all, government-run plan from  Washington, DC, is driving insurers out of the exchanges, driving up  premiums, driving away customers, and driving up the tab to the tax- paying public.   ObamaCare has overregulated, overtaxed, and oversold its promises to  the American people. ObamaCare has not healed what ails the U.S.  healthcare system. It is time to move forward.   Mr. President, I also want to speak about Medicaid for a moment.   Medicaid, as we know it, is not sustainable. The Federal Government  and States spent $553 billion on Medicaid in 2016. That amount is very  close to $593 billion spent on the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal  Government--our Nation's defense.   Every decade since Medicaid started, it has grown faster than the  economy. Medicaid is now unmatched as a driver of the deficit of our  country. We cannot sit by and leave this kind of debt to our children  and our grandchildren.   Dollars are not the only metric by which we measure Medicaid.  Medicaid is a program that should supply healthcare to diverse  populations and should have quality measured, but it does not.   Medicaid dollars should be spent efficiently, but they are not.  Activists in Washington, DC, are fighting to preserve the status quo  and, of course, in the process, scaring the daylights out of the  American people.   Yet Iowans tell me that there are waiting lists for Medicaid waivers  to obtain services for children with disabilities. Others tell me that  medicines that will cure diseases are rationed to be used only with  those with the most advanced disease. In other words, you have to get  really sick for Medicaid to cover medical expenses.   It is a fact that Medicaid is not working the way it should for  everyone. The time to act to preserve and improve Medicaid as the  safety net for the most vulnerable citizens is right now.   I am holding up a letter here because, under a Democratic President,  proposing to do what we are doing, 46 Democrat Senators wrote to  President Clinton and expressed their ``strong support'' for Medicaid  per capita caps. The letter went on to say that it would give States  the flexibility to achieve savings without cuts to essential services.  That is what the current proposal aims to do as well.   We are proposing per capita caps as a way to make sure tax dollars  are spent wisely on the most vulnerable people in our Nation. Medicaid  dollars should be spent on a child with cystic fibrosis who needs a  blockbuster drug. A person with severe mental illness should be able to  rely on Medicaid for care.   Medicaid cannot continue to be a limitless credit card for the States  to spend money without any accountability to the people who need it. I  urge my colleagues to put aside partisan dogma and work to solve this  problem for the American people.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 Washington, DC,                                                  December 13, 1995.      President William J. Clinton,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our strong       support for the Medicaid per-capita cap structure in your       seven-year budget. We have fought against Medicaid block       grants and cuts in the Senate, and we are glad you       acknowledge the importance of our position.        We support a balanced budget. We are glad you agree with us       that we can balance the budget without undermining the health       of children, pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly.        The savings level of $54 billion over seven years included       in your budget will require rigorous efficiencies and       economies in the program. However, after consulting with many       Medicaid Directors and service providers across the country,       we believe a reduction of this level is possible to achieve       without dramatic limits on eligibility or cuts to essential       services. States will need flexibility to achieve these       savings, and you have taken steps toward granting it in your       bill.        We were encouraged that your Medicaid proposal does not pit       Medicaid populations against one another in a fight over a       limited pot of federal resources.        We were further encouraged to hear Chief of Staff Panetta       relay your commitment to veto any budget not containing a       fundamental guarantee to Medicaid for eligible Americans.        We commend you on the courage you have exercised in making       these commitments to Americans eligible for Medicaid. There       is a bottom line when it comes to people's health; do not       allow the current Congressional leadership to further reduce       our commitment to Medicaid beneficiaries.        Your current proposal is fair and reasonable, and is       consistent with what we have advocated on the Senate floor.       We urge you in the strongest possible terms to hold fast to       these commitments in further negotiations. We are prepared to       offer any assistance you may need in this regard.            Sincerely,        Bob Graham; John Breaux; Jay Rockefeller; Herb Kohl;       Patrick Leahy; Frank R.
