 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  her leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join our entire caucus in saluting Congressman    David Cicilline, our longtime champion of the Equality Act, who has  been courageous, relentless, and persistent in his leadership for this  legislation.   We are proud to bring this important legislation to the House floor  under the leadership of the most diverse House Democratic majority-- nearly 70 percent women, people of color, and LGBTQ, with 224  cosponsors on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as many of us were gathered together nearly 5 years ago  to first introduce the Equality Act, that day in the LBJ room, on the  Senate side, named after the President who fought for and signed the  Civil Rights Act, we stood with an icon of the civil rights struggle,  our colleague John Lewis, the conscience of Congress.   The Civil Rights Act is a sacred pillar of freedom in our country. It  is not amended lightly. So how proud were we to be with our beloved   John Lewis and the Congressional Black Caucus--many of whom are here  now, Maxine Waters, Mr. Green, and others, thank you--as they gave  their imprimatur to the opening of the Civil Rights Act to end  discrimination against LGBTQ Americans.   And we remember John Lewis' life, we remember his words spoken at the  Pride parade in Atlanta. Shortly before being diagnosed with cancer, he  said, ``We are one people and one family. We all live in the same House  . . . `'   Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to pass this landmark legislation, we must  salute the countless advocates, activists, outside organizers and  mobilizers, who have for decades demanded full rights for all  Americans. Personally, my thoughts are with my friends, the late  Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who shared their lives together for  decades. I have spoken of them with their photo here on the floor year  in and year out.   They were members, as so many of us in San Francisco, who for decades  were engaged in civic engagement on many issues, including those issues  related to LGBTQ rights. They were an inspiration, teaching us to take  ``pride.'' And I say that with pride.  [[Page H653]]    When people say to me, ``It is easy for you to support LGBTQ equality  because you are from San Francisco where people are so tolerant.''  Tolerant? To me, that is a condescending word. This is not about  tolerance.   This is about respect. This is about taking pride for Phyllis and Del  and the older LGBTQ couples, for them, for LGBTQ workers striving to  provide for their families, and for LGBTQ youth struggling to find  their place, this is an historic, transformative moment of pride.   Here in the House, this pride goes back for many years. When we first  got the majority in 2006 and 2007, House Democrats had four goals  relating to equality. Passing a comprehensive hate crimes bill--and  when I say comprehensive, I mean, LGBTQ--``TQ''. ``T''. People said to  us at the time, Take out the ``T'' and you can pass this bill in a  minute.   I said, If we take out the ``T,'' we are not going to pass this bill  in 100 years because we are not bringing it up without the word  ``transgender'' in the bill.   We passed the bill with the help of Barney Frank, our former  colleague, and the family of Matthew Shepard who came here, touched our  hearts, and got the votes to help us pass the legislation.   Then we had ``Don't ask, don't tell.'' And under the leadership of  President Obama and the courage of so many Members--Patrick Murphy, our  former colleague and an Iraq combat vet leading the way here--we  repealed ``Don't ask, don't tell.''    Thank you, President Obama.   Mr. Speaker, securing marriage equality was done for us by the  courts. I took great pride in attending the oral arguments when that  was argued in the courts, and what a victory it was for liberty and  justice in our country when that decision came down.   Our next item on the agenda was something called ENDA, ending  discrimination in the workplace. Well, it is really called Employment  Nondiscrimination Act, hence the ENDA.   But then with the successes that we had, it was, Why are we just  talking about the workplace? Why aren't we talking about every place in  our society? And, hence, came forth ENDA which became the Equality Act,  finally, fully, ending anti-LGBTQ discrimination on employment,  education, housing, credit, jury service, and public accommodation. It  removes all doubt that sexual orientation and gender identity warrants  civil rights protection in every arena of American life.   Codifying the recent decision made by the U.S. Supreme Court in the  Bostock case, it takes a momentous step towards full equality that  brings our Nation closer to the founding promise of liberty and justice  for all enshrined in the preamble of our Constitution by our Founders  in their great wisdom--also, in our pledge to the flag. And it is sadly  necessary, I wish that it weren't. Sometimes I just wonder why it is.  But it is sadly necessary because many members of the national LGBTQ  community live in States where, though they have the right to marry,  they have no State-level nondiscrimination protections in other areas  of life.   Mr. Speaker, in more than 20 States, LGBTQ Americans do not have  specific protections against being denied housing because of their  sexual orientation or gender identity, and over 30 States lack  protections regarding access to education. Nearly 40 States lack  protections regarding jury service.   Mr. Speaker, passing the Equality Act in the last Congress was  historic, a day of hope and happiness for millions. Now, with the  Democratic Senate majority and President Biden in the White House and  Vice President Harris there as well, we will pass it once more and we  will never stop fighting until it becomes law. We will never stop  fighting until the Equality Act becomes law.                                time  1445    Let me conclude by returning to John Lewis and recalling his words  spoken on this House floor on the passage of the Equality Act the first  time. John Lewis said: We have a decision to end discrimination and set  all of our people free.   And set all of our people free. Today, with this legislation, we have  an opportunity to set all of our people free and to advance the future  of justice, equality, and dignity for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for the Equality Act,  salute Mr. Cicilline and Senate Merkley on the Senate side for their  leadership, and commend the distinguished chair of the Judiciary  Committee for once again bringing this to the floor. Thank you,  Congresswoman, for your leadership on this issue as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
