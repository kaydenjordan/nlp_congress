 Madam Speaker, today this House will consider  H.R. 3755. To me, this is a heartbreaking piece of legislation. It is  an assault on the most fundamental right of a person, and that is the  right to life.   Wednesday, I was thrilled with the news of the birth of my 21st  grandchild. Little Liberty is her name, although she wasn't really  little. She was 8 pounds, 14 ounces, and 22-and-a-half inches long. Her  life has started; she was born. However, that right given by God  happened long before the day she was born. She is a citizen of the  United States, and because of that, she has that right.   H.R. 3755 is also an affront to human rights. I have heard many of my  friends on the other side say: We only want in rare and uncommon  circumstances the right to have abortions.   But this bill does not do that. It enables and promotes something far  beyond that. It promotes the horrific practice of eugenics by ensuring  that abortions are allowed in cases of a possible congenital disorder.                            ____________________
