 Mr. Speaker, the average cost of a gallon of gas in my  hometown of Murphysboro, Illinois, is $3.60 and rising. That is not  all. Tonight's temperatures will dip down to about 29 degrees in  southern Illinois and families will be dialing up the thermostat.   Many of my constituents rely on propane to heat their homes during  these colder months. According to the Energy Information  Administration, midwestern families that use propane this winter can  expect to pay as much as 54 percent more in their heating bills;  potentially an additional $1,800 this winter.   Southern Illinois and southern Illinoisans are feeling that crunch.  Yet, many of my Democrat colleagues only care about passing their  socialist  [[Page H6083]]  spending spree with higher taxes on natural gas. As winter approaches,  we can't allow them to leave our families out in the cold.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. General  Bergman is doing a great job.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my friends and fellow veterans here  today to honor the generations of men and women who have served this  great Nation. From the Greatest Generation of veterans to the youngest  generation of veterans, we are undeniably lucky to have men and women  who are willing to lay down their lives for others.   This Veterans Day comes exactly 2 months after the 20th anniversary  of the 9/11 terror attacks.                                time  1945    In that sense, it is an even more poignant reminder than usual of the  sacrifices veterans have made so that we can be free. For 20 years,  soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, guardsmen, reservists, and Special  Forces units, in and around Afghanistan prevented another terrorist  attack on the homeland. For 20 years, they made the world safer. For 20  years, they gave the Afghanistan people a taste of freedom; the freedom  for Afghan women and girls to pursue education and a career; the  freedom to play sports, the freedom to be Christian; the freedom to  live without oppression and terror.   Like generations of veterans before them, they spent days, months,  and years thousands of miles from home. They missed births, birthdays,  weddings, funerals, anniversaries and holidays. They protected those  they will  [[Page H6117]]  never meet. They looked our enemies dead in the eye and refused to  accept defeat.   As a veteran, a father, and a grandfather of Active Duty  servicemembers, and the lead Republican on the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee, I could not be prouder of the millions of men and women who  selflessly answered our country's call throughout our history.   This Veterans Day, I encourage all Americans to pause and remember  those who have defended our way of life. Their service should always,  always be honored and celebrated. We owe them a debt of gratitude that  can never be repaid.   Last, and certainly not least, I want to share a message for those  who may be struggling. If you are a veteran or you know someone who is  a veteran who is going through a tough time, please reach out and ask  for help. It is the right and brave thing to do. Your service mattered.  You matter. The Veterans Crisis Line offers free, confidential support  to all veterans. Simply call 1-800-273-8255 and press 1. Once again,  that is: 1-800-273-8255 and press 1.
