 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Robert C.  Zimmerman, Jr., on being named the 2019 Person of the Year by the  Rotary Club of Sunbury, Pennsylvania. This recognition is well-deserved  for someone who has exemplified the attributes of public servant  leadership in our community for over 50 years.   Bob began his service to our community by serving our country in the  United States Marine Corps, then later in the U.S. Army Reserve. His  service also includes active work in community organizations like the  United Way, the Greater Susquehanna Valley Chamber of Commerce, and the  Sunbury Area Community Foundation.   For the last 43 years, Robert has been working in his family  business, Zimmerman Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, RAM, where he continued  Zimmerman's long tradition of treating customers like family.   On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District, I again congratulate Robert C. Zimmerman, Jr., on being named  Person of the Year by the Rotary Club of Sunbury, Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
