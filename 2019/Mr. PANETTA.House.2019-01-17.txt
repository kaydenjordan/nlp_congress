 Madam Speaker, good public policy depends on thorough  and accurate data. That is why this week's ruling by District Judge  Jesse Furman to block the administration from adding a citizenship  question to the 2020 Census is so important to my district on the  central coast and to our country.   The 2020 Census is more than just about where people live. It  dictates how our many, many boundaries are drawn.   The Census is enshrined in our Constitution, and it is a bedrock  responsibility of our government. But adding a citizenship question to  the Census with this administration in charge may scare people from  actually answering the questions, and that could result in inaccuracies  that jeopardize the disbursement of over $700 billion in funding for  essential services in our communities like roads, schools, and even  nutrition assistance programs.   This decision by the Federal judge is very good news, but we must  continue to work to live up to our responsibilities under the American  Constitution, and we can do that with a 2020 Census that depicts a  precise population count through accurate data, adequate area offices,  and appropriate and acceptable questions that everybody in all  communities can answer.                            ____________________
