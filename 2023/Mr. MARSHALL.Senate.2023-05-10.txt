 Madam President, I am proud to stand with my friend,  the senior Senator from the great State of Alabama, as he continues to  fight against the Department of Defense's attempt to circumvent  Congress and ignore existing Federal law which prevents the Department  of Defense facilities from being used to provide or facilitate  abortions for servicemembers.   The policy is immoral, taking the Department of Defense abortions  from less than 20 per year to over 4,000 abortions annually.   It is beyond me why the White House wants to pick this fight. The  policy is illegal. It forces taxpayers to subsidize abortion in  violation of Federal law. The policy is outside the Department of  Defense's mission to uphold and fight for life, not destroy it.   The Biden administration and Senate Democrats claim this is harming  our military readiness. With policies like this, they continue to  destroy recruiting. If readiness was truly a concern of theirs, they  wouldn't have discharged 8,000 troops for choosing not to take the  COVID vaccine, a vaccine with minimal benefits to an otherwise healthy,  young population.   Look, this policy is wrong, and until the military gets back to  providing for our common defense and out of the business of abortion, I  will proudly stand with Senator Tuberville.   I yield the floor.
