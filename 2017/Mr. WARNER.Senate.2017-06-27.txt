 Mr. President, let me join my colleagues on the Senate  Finance Committee and not only express my concern about how we got  here, but also acknowledge that an awful lot of folks in Virginia and a  lot of decent folks in North Carolina and folks across the country  breathed a little bit of a sigh of relief today. But that sigh of  relief was just the fact that we have a bit of a reprieve from a  proposal that, in my years here, I don't think I have ever seen--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia will suspend for a  moment.  [[Page S3789]]    If the Senators are going to carry on a colloquy, the Senator from  Oregon has to remain standing.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Again, I am here joining my Democratic colleagues from the Senate  Finance Committee.   I believe that folks in Virginia and, for that matter, folks across  the country got a reprieve today when the majority leader indicated  that we were not going to vote on the piece of legislation that he  brought forward, a piece of legislation which, as has been acknowledged  by the CBO, would take 22 million Americans off of healthcare, would  transfer close to $800 billion of costs currently borne jointly by both  the Federal and State partnership in Medicaid and then thrust that cost  upon the Governor of North Carolina, the Governor of Virginia, and a  host of others. I can't recall in my time here in the Senate where a  proposal has been as universally panned by organizations from the left,  right, center, and everywhere in between.   As perhaps the President is now acknowledging with the majority  leader and a number of other Republican Senators, using his own quote,  that ``nobody knew healthcare [was] so complicated.'' The fact is, the  vast majority of Members on both sides of the aisle have realized  healthcare is extraordinarily complicated. It is why it took years to  fashion the ACA and why there are many of us, again, on this side of  the aisle who continue to say we acknowledge, years after  implementation of the ACA, that there are many things that need to be  fixed, but the only way they are going to be fixed is if we do it in a  bipartisan fashion.   Instead, the legislation that we were going to vote on tomorrow would  have actually made healthcare much more expensive, less affordable, and  less accessible for a whole wide breadth of Americans. Don't take my  word for it; don't take these other elected officials' word for it.  Let's look at well-respected, bipartisan groups.   The American Cancer Society said that the bill the majority leader  put forward ``would be devastating for cancer patients and survivors.''  The American Medical Association said that the majority leader's  proposal violates the very first dictate of the Hippocratic oath, which  says ``do no harm.'' Obviously, this bill would have done a great deal  of harm. The American Academy of Pediatrics says ``The bill fails [our]  children.'' The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse says  the Republican proposal ``will crush efforts to end the opioid  epidemic.'' And the AARP says the proposal ``would leave millions,  including our most vulnerable seniors, at risk of losing the care they  need.''   But it is not just these leading healthcare organizations that have  come out uniformly and virtually universally against what the majority  leader had proposed. I am also hearing that from Virginians. On Monday  of this week, I attended an opening of the new PACE Program in Fairfax,  VA. The PACE Program--I know the ranking member on the Finance  Committee has been a big advocate of the PACE Program--is a program  that works in an extraordinary way at keeping seniors in their homes  rather than having them migrate to nursing homes. Well, folks at the  PACE Program in Fairfax were more than disturbed when they heard that  the majority leader's proposal cuts Medicaid by $772 billion. Medicaid  allowed so many folks to get access to healthcare, particularly if they  had individuals in their family who might have severe disabilities. The  majority leader's proposal, the per capita caps would actually take  away the amount of health insurance they could receive.   The truth is, Medicaid covers 28 percent of all Americans and covers  about 40 percent of all poor adults and seniors. In my State of  Virginia, for those folks in PACE or in nursing homes, literally two- thirds of seniors who receive any kind of care receive care through  Medicaid.   The cuts in this proposed bill would devastate our seniors and their  families, and the cuts will not save money because so much of this is  just the old-fashioned trickle-down that trickles down this  responsibility to States that, again, would have to either raise their  own taxes to take care of their responsibilities or, frankly, put out  seniors who receive this critical care.   Mr. President, I also want to share with you and my colleagues a  meeting I had last week with a series of families who came in. They had  children or adults who had devastating disabilities.   I heard in particular from Marlo Dean from Virginia Beach, who was  there with her 15-year-old son Dante, who has extensive health needs  because of a rare brain disorder. Dante had just received a Medicaid  waiver after being on the waiting list for 10 years. Ms. Dean, Dante's  mother, said:         Cutting Medicaid is not the right thing. It's not the       humane thing.    There were other families. Angie Leonard, who traveled from the  Roanoke Valley with her 22-year-old son Joshua, who has autism, said  that this is not what America ought to be about.   Rebecca Wood, who brought her daughter Charlie from Charlottesville,  said that she has private insurance, but she is wondering what would  happen when that private insurance hits its cap, a cap that had been  removed when we put in place the ACA. Again, Rebecca said: ``Our  country is better than this.'' Boy, oh, boy, is she right.   When our colleagues talk about cutting Medicaid, when they talk about  cutting it at the numbers they are talking about or putting caps back  in place, I hope they realize that this is more than about the numbers  of a government program. This is about providing support and services  to families facing the nightmare of chronic illness or crippling  medical illness and bills, quite honestly, that they can't pay on their  own. It is about peace of mind for these families.   I have said from the outset that there were mistakes made in the ACA,  and I stand ready to work with any Member of either side of the aisle  to make sure that we fix those mistakes. But this debate ought to be  about healthcare reform, not about providing the wealthiest in our  country a tax break they don't need or taking hundreds of billions of  dollars out of Medicaid.   I look forward--I hope our colleagues who come back from this meeting  with the President will come back with a renewed sense of cooperation  and collaboration. I know there are other members of the committee who  want to speak on this issue. I stand prepared to work with them and the  ranking member from the Finance Committee to do this right, but it  ought to be done in a way--whether it is Rebecca and her daughter  Charlie, whether it is Ms. Dean and her son--that they get a chance to  have their voices heard through a regular order process, where at the  front end of the process we can hear the concerns, get those concerns  vetted, and make sure legislation that gets brought to the floor is  fully vetted and actually improves the quality of care for Virginians  and Americans all across this country.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
