 Mr. Speaker, the failed policies that  President Biden chose to enact have created a national security, public  health, and humanitarian crisis on our southern border.   In the 1 month since title 42 has expired, we have seen the impacts  of President Biden's reckless policy decisions in action.   In April of this year, more than 70,000 illegal immigrants were  turned away under title 42.   Now, without the protections of title 42 in place, the influx of  illegal immigrants and the drugs smuggled by the cartels have  overwhelmed resources at Federal, State, and local levels.   Under President Biden's watch in the past 2 years, we have seen the  number of attempted entries by those on the terrorist watch list  skyrocket to over 100 a year. With 1.5 million known got-aways reported  by the Border Patrol, that number might even be higher.   We have seen an increase in overdose deaths from the deadly fentanyl  analogues smuggled across our borders.   We have seen reports of public schools being used as holding  facilities for migrants instead of being used for American students  already suffering from historic learning loss. This follows President  Biden's prolonged school shutdowns.   All of this amounts to a pattern of failure brought on by the Biden  administration's refusal to confront the crisis at our border head-on.   It is time to finish the construction of the border wall.   It is time to reinstate the remain in Mexico policies that protect  American citizens.   It is time for President Biden to finally address the crisis that his  administration has created with its open border policies.   That time is today.                            ____________________
