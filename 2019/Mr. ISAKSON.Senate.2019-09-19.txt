 Mr. President, today I would like to remember in  the record a longtime member of the U.S. Military Academy West Point's  admissions team, Ms. Joyce Adams.   For the last 39 years, Joyce Adams has served with distinction as  valued member of the West Point admissions family. From 1980 until  2002, Joyce Adams served as a candidate technician first in the mid- Atlantic region and later in the far West region. In this capacity, she  assisted more than 60,000 candidates navigate the West Point  application process.   In 2002, Joyce was promoted to be congressional nominations  specialist. In this position, she assisted all 541 congressional  offices in navigating the nomination process. During her more than 17  years as the U.S. Military Academy nominations specialist, Joyce  directly impacted more than 100,000 candidate nominations and earned  the respect and admiration of candidates, parents, admissions officers,  and Members of Congress.   In addition to this work, Joyce also volunteered to serve as the  candidate technician for all recruited athlete files. Thanks to her  hard work and attention to detail, all of West Point's varsity athletic  teams were positioned to compete at the highest level.   I have it on the highest authority from West Point that Joyce's  impact on the directorate of admissions, on the U.S. Military Academy  West Point, and on the Nation will be felt for years to come. The  candidates she assisted have risen to the highest levels of military  and civilian leadership, and she will be missed.                            ____________________
