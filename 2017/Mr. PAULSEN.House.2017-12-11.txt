 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the  Preventing Maternal Deaths Act. This bill would strengthen States'  abilities to combat pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths.   Unfortunately, the number of these deaths in the United States has  increased, according to the CDC. We also have the highest maternal  mortality rate of any developed country, and we are the only country  where maternal deaths continue to rise.   That is why this bill is so important: It helps States establish and  support maternal mortality review committees to examine the causes of  these deaths and then identify solutions that fit their community. It  addresses disparities in maternal health outcomes and offers these  committees the tools to collect the data they need to address--and,  hopefully, to eliminate--the causes of these unnecessary tragedies.   Minnesota's committee has already shown promise but would benefit  from  [[Page H9780]]  the additional resources this legislation provides.   Mr. Speaker, this bill enjoys bipartisan support and could reduce the  number of unnecessary pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated  deaths. By taking this important step, we can and will save lives.                            ____________________
