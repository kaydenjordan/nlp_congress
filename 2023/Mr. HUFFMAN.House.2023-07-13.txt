 Mr. Chairman, this is an extreme solution in search of a  problem that does not exist. The Department of Defense is not asking  for this huge loophole from the Endangered Species Act. They have never  asked for this, and they don't need it.   This year is the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act.  Since its enactment, the ESA has provided that all agencies of the  Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, should  conserve threatened and endangered species.   This amendment undermines that commitment, essentially writing the  Department of Defense out of the ESA. It broadly excludes all DOD  activities, including activities of defense contractors, from ESA  requirements.   It also constrains other Federal agencies from designating critical  habitat, one of the most essential tools under the Endangered Species  Act. This is habitat that is necessary for the recovery of an  endangered or threatened species.   There is zero evidence that the ESA is negatively impacting military  activities. In fact, in many cases, setting aside areas around military  bases for conservation actually helps the military by limiting other  types of development and uses around essential military areas.  [[Page H3553]]    Further, the Department of Defense already has a lot of flexibility  on how they can comply with the ESA.   We are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, and the Endangered  Species Act continues to be an essential, visionary, and critical tool  for keeping species from going extinct. It is a sad testimony to the  extremism of the House Republican majority that they are turning this  historically bipartisan NDAA into a bonfire of hate, bigotry, and  ignorance, and this amendment throws another log on that fire by trying  to use NDAA to gut one of our most vital and essential environmental  laws.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this terrible  amendment.
