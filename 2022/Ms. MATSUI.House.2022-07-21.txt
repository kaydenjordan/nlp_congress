 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8373, the  Right to Contraception Act.   Contraception is empowering. It gives people control over what  happens to their bodies and supports the freedom to plan a family.  Using birth control can shape an individual's life. Being able to  choose the contraceptive that is right for you impacts your future  health, education, employment, and economic security.   The Supreme Court's decision was a direct attack on abortion, and  Americans are now justifiably scared about the future of birth control.  Republicans across this country will continue their extreme assault on  basic freedoms. Justice Thomas made it clear that the Supreme Court  will do nothing to protect our fundamental rights from these  coordinated attacks.   I refuse to sit back and watch as Republicans regress our Nation to a  place where my granddaughter has fewer rights than her mother or I did.    Madam Speaker, I refuse to sit back and watch where  States can take away an individual's ability to make personal decisions  about their body, their life, and their future.   Madam Speaker, I implore you to really think about this and pass this  bill.  [[Page H6931]]
