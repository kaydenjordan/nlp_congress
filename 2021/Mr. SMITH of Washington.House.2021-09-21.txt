 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  667, I call up the bill (H.R. 4350) to authorize appropriations for  fiscal year 2022 for military activities of the Department of Defense  and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4350.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Madam Speaker, we have before us the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2022, and I highly recommend it to the Members of  the House and urge everybody to support this incredibly important and  very well put together piece of legislation.  [[Page H4794]]        The first thing I will say is thank you to all of the staff,  certainly on the Armed Services Committee, but the Rules Committee as  well, and the leadership staff. This has been a truly bipartisan  legislative process.   We had our markup in committee which lasted, I will do a little quick  math in my head, something like 16 hours. We considered over 800  amendments, with a variety of different variations, and we got that  number up closer to 1100. And then before the Rules Committee there  were, again, over 800 amendments submitted, and we have worked with  Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans, members on the  committee and off, to craft what I think is a very good piece of  legislation.   I think it is incredibly important, first of all, that we pass this  bill so that Congress continues to exercise its authority to exercise  oversight over the Department of Defense.   I know Members on both sides of this aisle have lamented throughout  the years the degree to which the executive branch has exerted more  power over the years, where the legislative branch has exhibited less.  Now, granted, you find that issue more troubling when the opposite  party is in charge of the White House, but we are all troubled by that  phenomena.   We need to exercise our authority; this bill does that. To my mind,  Congress does not pass enough authorizing bills, but we do do so in the  Department of Defense, and have done so for over 60 straight years, and  should do so again.   This bill, I think, is particularly important because we are at an  important moment in defense of this country and in dealing with our  role in the world. We have never faced a more complex threat  environment. We have threats from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and  transnational terrorist groups.   In addition, we are now coming out of 20 years of war fought in Iraq  and Afghanistan, both countries of which our military now is out and  not fighting those wars, and we have a whole bunch of change to deal  with.       At the same time, innovation has never been more important in  properly defending this country. We need to update and modernize our  armed forces, everything from our information systems, to our command  and control, to our platforms, to the support we give to our  servicemembers. I am very proud that this bill reflects those  priorities.   And the work has been done between Mr. Rogers and myself and members  of the committee to produce that product. And I want to take a moment  here to thank Mr. Rogers, the ranking member, he has been a terrific  partner in this process, as has his staff and as has his members.   I think this bill reflects those priorities. It figures out how to  improve our ability to update the military more quickly, to better buy  software, to better innovate, to better embrace the innovative  technologies that we need.   Madam Speaker, I want to particularly thank Mr. Langevin, as the  subcommittee chair, who has taken the lead on the AI task force that  looks at this question in great specificity. This bill really puts us  in a position to modernize the force as we need to.   One other crucial issue that we do in this is we address the issue of  sexual assault in the military that continues to be a scourge upon  service in the military. We have worked for years to try to address  this issue, we have not been successful.   This year, thanks in large part to the leadership of Congresswoman  Speier, we have updated the UCMJ to create a special victims'  prosecutor to give sexual assault and sex crimes the attention they  deserve to make sure that we are protecting the men and women who serve  in the military. It is a crucial aspect of this bill, and I strongly  urge Members to support it.   Lastly, let me just say that as you pore over this bill, everybody  here will find something that they do not like. Everybody here will  also find something that they wish was in there that is not. There is  no doubt about that, because it is a very large bill, and it was a  collaborative process.   But it is the nature of the legislative process that you don't get  absolutely everything that you want. I hope Members will keep that in  mind. But it is also the nature of the legislative process, in this  case, that we have produced a product that everybody in this House can  be proud of.   And, again, I want to thank my Republican counterpart. We have worked  together to produce this. I urge support from all Members. This is a  bill every Member, Democrat and Republican, can enthusiastically  support, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4350, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2022. There are certain provisions in the legislation that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on House       Administration.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on House       Administration does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the subject matters contained in the bill which fall       within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the       Speaker to name members of this committee to any conference       committee which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       4350 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.

In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Small Business       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its       Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       4350 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                             Nydia M. Velazquez,                                                           Chairman,      Committee Small Business.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                  Washington, DC, September 9, 2021.

Hon. Adam Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I write in response to your       committee's request, and concerning H.R. 4350, the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. Certain       provisions in the legislation fall within the jurisdiction of       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (the       ``Committee''), as established by Rule X of the Rules of the       House of Representatives for the 117th Congress.        In the interest of expediting floor consideration of this       important bill, I am willing to waive the Committee's right       to request a sequential referral. By doing so, the Committee       does not waive any future claim over subjects addressed in       the bill which fall within the Committee's jurisdiction. I       also request that you urge the Speaker to name members of the       Committee to any conference committee on the bill.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       4350 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor.

Hon. Adam B. Schiff,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Schiff: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2022. I agree that the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has valid jurisdictional claims to certain       provisions in this important legislation, and I am most       appreciative of your decision not to request a referral in       the interest of expediting consideration of the bill. I agree       that by foregoing a sequential referral, the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence is not waiving its jurisdiction.       Further, this exchange of letters will be included in the       committee report on the bill.            Sincerely,                                                        Adam Smith,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Rhode Island an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Golden), who is a member of the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), who is the chairman of the  Readiness Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego), the chair of the Intelligence and  Special Operations Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, at this time, I have no  further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.     Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I just want to agree with Mr. Rogers. This bill, as you can hear from  the Members speaking in favor of it on both sides of the aisle,  encompasses a lot of different provisions, all designed to make sure we  can adequately defend the country; and, most importantly, designed to  make sure that we protect the men and women who are serving us to  protect that country.   There are a lot of provisions in this bill focused on improving the  quality of life, including a 2.7 percent pay increase and significant  increases to improve things like childcare centers and barracks across  the country.   I think this bill does an excellent job of identifying the threats  that we face and putting ourselves in the best possible position to  meet those threats going forward.   Again, no bill is perfect. We disagree on things. Everyone will have  something in here that they wish were slightly different, but overall,  I think we can support this bill.   I do want to close by once again emphasizing, I know there is a lot  of angst about the amendments that have been ruled in order; but,  again, that is not unusual that we would deal with issues that are not  necessarily directly within our jurisdiction. We work with the  committees of jurisdiction in order to carry those bills. We will  continue to work on that.   I can say with confidence that there is no amendment that has been  ruled in order that we are going to debate on that should impact any  Members voting for this bill. This is a very strong bill. Do not forget  the underlying provisions in this bill that are so important to the men  and women who are serving this country, to the protections they need,  the protections they deserve, and the protections that it is our  obligation to provide for them and which I feel very, very strongly  that this bill does.   This bill deserves support from this committee. I urge a ``yes''  vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
