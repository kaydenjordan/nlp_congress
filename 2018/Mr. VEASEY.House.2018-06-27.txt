 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support a robust and innovative space industry. I also  believe that it is very important that we leverage the investment  taxpayers have allowed the Nation to make in its facilities and  workforce.   The bill before us today that is known as H.R. 5345, also known as  the American Leadership in Space Technology and Advanced Rocketry Act,  recognizes the rocket propulsion work of the Marshall Space Flight  Center and that center's role in helping to develop the next generation  of rocket propulsion capabilities. The Marshall Space Flight Center has  a long and storied history in rocket development dating back to the  huge Saturn V rockets that powered our astronauts to the Moon. That  tradition continues to this day.   Mr. Speaker, I support moving this bill out of the House floor, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5770]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support a robust and successful commercial  space industry. In that regard, I look forward to continuing to work  with my colleagues on policies that facilitate the Nation's continued  growth and leadership in space.   The bill before us today, H.R. 5346, known as the Commercial Space  Support Vehicle Act, will amend the statute to provide the Secretary of  Transportation with authority to license or permit space support  vehicles for space support flights such as crew training or research  and development that are related to space launch or reentry.   While I am not aware of any pressing need for this amendment at this  time, it may provide the industry with some additional flexibility.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, it is very important to point out, too,  that the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation is  sufficiently resourced to accommodate any additional work so that the  office can continue to focus on its core responsibilities of licensing  and permitting commercial space launch and reentry vehicles.   Mr. Speaker, I support moving the bill out of the House, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5905, the Department of  Energy Science and Innovation Act of 2018. This bill provides important  statutory direction to the Department of Energy's Office of Science,  which is our Nation's largest supporter of research in the physical  sciences. So it is impossible to overstate its importance to our energy  future and to our overall innovation enterprise.   This agency also operates more than 30 world-class scientific user  facilities, whose applications range from developing new materials for  next generation batteries, to new pharmaceuticals that will better  treat diseases, to even examining the fundamental building blocks of  the universe.   Much of this bill is derived from previous bipartisan, bicameral  agreements that were included in H.R. 589, the House-passed Department  of Energy Research and Innovation Act of 2017.   As we await Senate action on that legislation, I support moving  forward with additional language included in this bill that would  authorize upgrades to several important user facilities, direct DOE to  provide sufficient support to maintain our commitments to the ITER  international fusion project, and provide statutory authority to fund  low-dose radiation research as well as a promising computational  materials initiative at our national labs.   I also note that I am happy to see robust funding levels included in  this bipartisan bill, particularly for the Biological and Environmental  Research program, which supports critical research to reduce  uncertainties and better understand the impacts of climate change. I  strongly support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5906, the ARPA-E Act of  2018.   After years of successes and several independent assessments praising  ARPA-E's work, this bill is a welcomed development. It preserves the  mission and flexibility of the Agency while enabling it to consider  funding projects or technologies that can address DOE's monumental and  longstanding challenge of environmental cleanup at the legacy sites of  the Manhattan Project.   It also includes language from a bipartisan ARPA-E Reauthorization  Act that our committee's ranking member, Ms. Johnson, introduced last  year, which would ensure that sensitive business information collected  by the Agency remains protected. This will enable even greater private  sector engagement in its programs.   The ARPA-E projects have attracted more than $2.6 billion in private  sector follow-on funding. Mr. Speaker, 71 projects have formed new  companies, and 109 have gone on to partner with other government  agencies to further their research.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Lucas and Chairman Smith for  embracing ARPA-E's innovative model and joining our Members in  supporting its reauthorization. I support this bill and encourage my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5907, the National  Innovation Modernization by Laboratory Empowerment Act.   This bill would provide our national laboratories with the authority  to directly enter into certain research agreements with the private  sector, as long as those activities align with the laboratories'  strategic plans approved by the Department of Energy. This bill also  includes appropriate safeguards to prevent waste, fraud, or abuse of  this provision.   This language previously passed the House as part of bipartisan  legislation that we considered in the last Congress. I am happy to see  this important policy change is moving forward once again.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I encourage my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
