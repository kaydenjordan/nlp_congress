 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I have spoken repeatedly in recent  months about the tragic killing of Breonna Taylor in my hometown of  Louisville, the need for justice, and the healing work ahead for our  community.   Kentucky's attorney general, Daniel Cameron, conducted exactly the  kind of thorough and impartial investigation that justice demands.  Yesterday, that chapter concluded, and the grand jury conducted the  handoff to criminal prosecution. I have full confidence in the attorney  general's painstaking pursuit of facts and justice.   Many Kentuckians have channeled their continuing grief and anger in a  peaceful exercise of their First Amendment rights. But in Louisville  last night, we saw more of the lawlessness, riots, and violence that  have plagued American cities too often this year. Citizens' businesses  were vandalized, fires were set in the streets, and two officers of the  Metro Police Department were shot and wounded while protecting public  safety downtown. As of last night, one officer was still undergoing  surgery, but both were in stable condition. We are praying that both  will make full recoveries. One suspect is in custody.   Peaceful protests honor the memory of Breonna Taylor. Peaceful  protests move us toward justice. Smashing windows does not. Setting  fires does not. Rioting in the streets does not. Trying to gun down law  enforcement officers who were bravely serving their community is the  kind of despicable cowardice that must be met with the full force of  the law.   I sincerely thank all the Kentucky peace officers who continue to put  their lives on the line every single day. I hope and expect that our  Governor and mayor will take every necessary step to secure the  justice, peace, law, and order that every Kentuckian deserves.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on an entirely different matter,  President Trump has stated he will announce his nominee to the Supreme  Court the day after tomorrow. We do not yet know which legal all-star  from his list he will nominate, but strangely enough, we already do  know exactly what the far left will start shouting the instant--the  instant--she or he is introduced.   Isn't that a little curious, when you stop to think about it? A  confirmation process is ostensibly about the qualifications and  credentials of the nominee, so why is it that practically any citizen  could sit down at their kitchen  [[Page S5844]]  table right now, days--days--before the nomination, and write down in  advance the list of ludicrous accusations the far left has guaranteed  to be screaming by Saturday night? It is because year after year,  decade after decade, the far left's playbook stays exactly the same. To  them, a nominee makes no difference. Every time in 45 years--45 years-- that a Republican President has nominated someone to the Supreme Court,  the exact same set of cliched horror stories are wheeled out of  storage, dusted off, and paraded past the American people.   In 1975, President Gerald Ford put forward a nominee whom the left  blasted for his ``consistent opposition to women's rights'' and ``an  extraordinary lack of sensitivity to the problems women face.'' Who was  this far-right ideologue who was going to turn back the clock? Why, it  was the late Justice John Paul Stevens, who went on to lead the Court's  liberal wing for decades.   In 1987, it was time for an encore performance. A nominee from  President Reagan was absolutely savaged by liberal groups. The  president of one leftwing group insisted he was a ``sexist'' and ``a  disaster for women''--that would be Anthony Kennedy.   Once again, the sky did not fall. In fact, when Justice Kennedy  retired in 2018, the new head of the exact same liberal organization  stated they were ``saddened and alarmed by his retirement.'' The exact  same liberal outfit said the sky was falling in the 1980s because  Justice Kennedy had been nominated and that the sky was falling in 2018  because he was retiring.   In 1990, they got the band back together yet again. This time the sky  was falling for sure. President Bush had picked someone whose record  was ``very troubling,'' whose juris prudence would surely ``threaten to  undo the advances made by women, minorities, dissenters, and other  disadvantaged groups,'' whose confirmation would mean ``ending freedom  for women in this country.''   Talk about wearing out the volume knob. Oh, that was future Justice  David Souter, by the way. One slogan simply said--listen to this:  ``Stop Souter or Women Will Die.'' ``Stop Souter or Women Will Die.''  He, too, would go on to become a favorite Justice of many of the very  same groups.   But it has still never occurred to them to get their crystal balls  checked. The same unhinged attacks pour out every time, the same absurd  scare tactics every single time.   These people are the far-left version of that broadcaster who spent  20 years predicting different dates for the end of the world, raising  money, and just inventing a new date every time he was wrong.   Justice Scalia was unfit. Justice Thomas hated the rule of law.  Justice Alito was ``hostile to the rights of women.'' It is all one big  scam directed at the American people.   In 2005, one leftwing outfit cut a television ad that tried to link  our now-Chief Justice of the United States with a violent bombing of an  abortion clinic. Just how despicable can you get? Before this  disgusting ad was pulled off the air, it said a future Justice John  Roberts would ``excuse violence against other Americans.'' Chief  Justice Roberts.   Every single time--no matter how upstanding, no matter how qualified,  no matter their views, no matter their record--every nominee gets the  same insane treatment, so long as the President who nominated them is  not a Democrat--so long as the President who nominated them is not a  Democrat.   Oh, but when Democrats nominate people, none of this happens. When we  confirmed Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, I don't recall any angry mobs  stalking Senators. When we confirmed Justice Sotomayor, I don't recall  weeks of character assassination. When we confirmed Justice Kagan, I  don't recall the mainstream media declaring the death of democracy.   For half a century we have seen this double standard. When a  Democratic President makes a nomination, it is a nonevent by  comparison. The coastal political class and their friends in the media  allow our national life to go on like normal. But whenever a Republican  dares to nominate someone, the same people declare it a state of  emergency.   So, sadly, we already know what reaction we will see on Saturday:  fill-in-the-blank opposition. Remember, in 2017, we saw literal fill- in-the-blank opposition. Demonstrators wanted to assemble outside the  Court before they even knew who President Trump would name, so they  literally brought stacks of signs that said: ``Oppose (blank)!'' And  they brought markers so they could scribble in the name during the  President's remarks before the TV cameras got to them.   In 2018, moments after the President announced now-Justice Kavanaugh,  one leftwing group published a typically absurd statement declaring  ``Trump's announcement today is a death sentence''--``a death  sentence''--and ``white patriarchal supremacists now have free reign.''   The actual nominee was so irrelevant to their scam that they  literally forgot to fill in the blank. The very first line of their  press release condemned ``Donald Trump's nomination of XX to the  Supreme Court.''   So it is safe to say the American people can start writing their  bingo cards right now. We already know every outlandish claim and  unhinged attack we are going to hear.   In fact, former Vice President Biden has already cut to the front of  the line. Just yesterday, he offered the following assessment prior to  learning whom he was assessing: ``Women's rights as it relates to  everything from medical health care is going to be gone.'' This is  former Vice President Biden yesterday. Good luck deciphering what he is  trying to say. It sounds like more of the same old junk.   Perhaps the Nation will soon watch this man in his late seventies  condescend to explain women's healthcare to one of the brilliant women  whom President Trump indicates he is considering.   Fortunately, the far-left scam artists do not get a vote. The special  interest groups' fundraising appeals do not get a vote. The fate of  this nomination will be determined by the U.S. Senators whom the  American people elected to do this job: a fair hearing, a fair process,  and a fair vote on the actual nominee. Forget about fill-in-the-blank.                            ____________________     Madam President, for the information of my colleagues,  the vote on the confirmation of the Young nomination will occur at  11:30 a.m. today.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
