 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Herman Jenkins, a  native Floridian, African American, and World War II veteran who,  today, turns 100 years old.   Mr. Jenkins enlisted in the United States Army in 1943 when he was 24  years old, was stationed in northern France, and fought to defend  Western civilization against the Nazi regime.   He rose to the rank of corporal and received numerous recognitions,  including the Conduct Medal, the American Theater Ribbon, and a World  War II Victory Ribbon.   After being honorably discharged in 1946, he returned to Lakeland,  Florida, where he married his wife, Essie Mae Bryant, and together gave  birth to their daughter, Sheila.   Upon returning to Lakeland, Mr. Jenkins entered the retail industry  and enjoyed a successful career as a manager of several stores in our  community. He also owned his own photography business and continues to  be a skilled photographer, chef, and musician. However, his greatest  passion is being a loving husband to his wife, Essie, daughter, Sheila,  four grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.   Mr. Jenkins has made a permanent and positive impact in defending our  Nation and building our community, and for that, sir, I thank you. I  wish you a very happy birthday and hope that your next 100 years are  better than your last.                            ____________________
