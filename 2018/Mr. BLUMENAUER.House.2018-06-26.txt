 Mr. Speaker, there is a recent article in The New  York Times about the Koch brothers and its stealth campaign to try to  attack mass transit projects around the country. It was disturbing on  several levels.   First and foremost, it is misguided in terms of the economic impact.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that there is $4 of economic activity  generated for every $1 that is invested in transit. It increases  business sales, and it results in higher real estate values and jobs  created.   It is important to note that, right now, we have a road system that  is heavily subsidized by the general fund. The road user charge has  long since failed to pay for it. We have had to transfer $140 billion  just to keep the failing Surface Transportation Program afloat.   The Koch brothers argue, through their organization, that American  cities really don't have the population density to support mass transit  systems. That is false. It is clear that there are some very dense  systems serving Chicago and New York, but there are very successful  programs in Phoenix and Houston with much lower density that are  providing essential services.   It is important to remember who gets that service, because transit is  much less expensive for men and women to be able to have access to jobs  and employment. The average vehicle costs almost $10,000 a year to  operate. In most families, it is the number two item in the family  budget after housing. For many poor people, transportation is actually  ahead of housing.   Transit provides access to jobs, so that people don't have to spend  42 hours a year trapped in traffic behind the wheel of a vehicle, as  happens on average.   The notion that somehow we are going to be forced to look at a lack  of density, well, communities across the country in the metropolitan  areas are getting more and more dense. They are attracting young  people, retired people, and more economic activity in the 49 largest  metropolitan areas around the country. In those areas, transit is the  most cost effective and environmentally sensitive way of providing that  service, to say nothing of the fact that we kill almost 40,000 people a  year on our roadways. Transit is amazingly safe by comparison.   One of the most disingenuous arguments is that transportation  programs for mass transit are bad because they promote gentrification  of our cities. Look at that argument for a moment. One of the things  that is happening in cities across the country is that there is a new  urban renaissance. Young millennials are moving back to the cities.  Those are the engines of the economy. Aging baby boomers are finding it  much more attractive to move into those urban cores than to be isolated  out in the suburbs with a large-lot subdivision and forcing people to  burn a gallon of gas to buy a gallon of milk.    Those urban areas are our future. Not everybody is going to do it,  but the majority of people are. We ought to be investing in  transportation systems for our future, not undermining them by limiting  investments to transportation of the past.   We are in the process of a rapid revolution in transportation  technology and people's approaches. More and more young people,  actually, are choosing not to buy a car, which sits idle about 22\1/2\  hours a day and is very expensive. They are instead choosing transit,  ride-share, bike-share, and being able to have transportation when they  need it--Lyft and Uber--without having an anchor of an individual car  bearing down on them.   Frankly, gentrification is a function of how we plan and develop our  cities. That ought to be an invitation to think about how to do it  better, as many cities are doing now, not to undermine progress by  assaulting transit.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, today, I voted in support of H.R. 2083,  the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act. This was  a difficult decision.   I voted for this bill because I strongly support the recovery of wild  native fish populations in the Columbia River and its tributaries.  There is an immediate, serious risk to native steelhead, among other  fish, that this bill seeks to reduce.   I, however, do not view this bill as a wise long-term strategy for  salmon and steelhead recovery in the Columbia River Basin. While the  detrimental impacts of sea lions need to be addressed, human-caused  factors are the primary driver in the declining salmon and steelhead  populations. Instead of focusing on sea lions--another protected  species with an important role in our ecosystem--let's actually  confront the damage that we ourselves have caused. Pitting one  treasured species against another does nothing to address the damage  and obstacles that humans have forced upon this vital Pacific Northwest  ecosystem.   This will not be easy. The impediments are many--the impacts from  dams, habitat degradation, unprecedented climate disruption, and more.  Regional partners have been working for years to address these issues,  and thankfully our native fish are strikingly resilient. But we must do  much, much more. Let's have a real conversation about the actual causes  of salmon and steelhead decline and what we can do to meaningfully  contribute to their recovery.   While this bill may reduce some short-term stressors, it is not a  solution. Salmon and steelhead--iconic species in the Pacific  Northwest--will only recover if we come together to face the facts and  tackle the real issues that are our legacy--and our responsibility.
