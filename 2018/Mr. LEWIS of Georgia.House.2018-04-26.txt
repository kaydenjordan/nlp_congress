 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc #1  amendment package to H.R. 4, which includes my amendment (#2). I am  proud to offer an amendment that responds to a key and grave local  matter.   My amendment is simple: It would allow airports to use Federal funds  to buy generators for passenger areas of the airport, something they  currently are not able to do. It would also let airports separate  backup power from the main power lines, and to complete other projects  to prevent power outages using A.I.P. and P.F.C. funds.   As you know, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the  world's busiest airport, is located in my Congressional district. Last  December, an underground fire disabled both the airport's primary and  backup power supplies. This caused a power outage that lasted for 11  hours, cancelling hundreds of flights and stranding passengers and  employees on planes and in dark terminals.   Fortunately, no one was hurt, but this event raised important public  safety questions. The City of Atlanta and Georgia Power are looking  into what happened and what can be done to prevent a similar event from  occurring in the future. I look forward to their report. My common- sense amendment will give airports the flexibility they need to keep  the lights on and passengers safe.   Finally, and most importantly, Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to all the  police, firefighters, electricians, and airport, airline, and MARTA  employees for their work to assist stranded travelers. I would also  like to thank the tens of thousands of passengers who remained calm and  patient throughout this unprecedented ordeal.   I appreciate the support of the Chairman and the Ranking Member and  thank them and their staffs for working with me on this issue. I look  forward to continuing to work with them to keep the travelling public  safe.   I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment.
