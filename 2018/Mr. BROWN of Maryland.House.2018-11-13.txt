 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the  gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa).   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4033, the National Geologic  Mapping Act Reauthorization Act, a bipartisan, practical piece of  legislation.   I am proud to have cosponsored this bill with my friend from Colorado  and colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Lamborn.   Our bill would reauthorize the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping  Program for an additional 5 years, which is the primary source of funds  to produce geologic maps in the United States.   Even though most people are not familiar with geologic maps, it is  hard to overstate their importance.   Geologic maps are essential in supporting a variety of industries,  services, and activities that hold immense societal and economic value.                                time  1600    Geologic maps are used to locate groundwater resources and evaluate  groundwater quality leading to better land and habitat management  decisions.   Geologic maps help city planners, emergency responders, and  landowners assess how vulnerable an area is to sinkholes, landslides,  earthquakes, floods, and other deadly and destructive natural hazards.   Geologic maps enable the government and industry to locate and  develop mineral resources used for a variety of scientific applications  and in military technology and in consumer products.   Further, geologic maps provide valuable information that engineers  and developers use when designing and constructing highways, bridges,  tunnels, and other transportation assets.   In my home State of Maryland, the value and importance of geologic  maps are evident. Even though Maryland is a compact State, it has an  incredible variety of landscapes and geology stretching from the  beaches on the Atlantic Coast to the Appalachian Mountains.   This type of diversity in our geology demands a robust understanding  of the science and an extensive mapping of underground formations.   On top of this, Maryland is home to several institutions that rely on  the secondary and tertiary benefits of the USGS geologic mapping  program. The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Prince George's  County, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, and our military  cyber operations in Fort Meade all reap the rewards of a Nation that  has broadened its knowledge and capabilities by investing in geological  mapping.   There is no doubt the U.S. mapping program is vital to our Nation's  safety and prosperity, and I urge a vote in favor.
