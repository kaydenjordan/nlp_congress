 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller  General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the  effect on inflation.   Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's  spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by  Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide  transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.   The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration  accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's  executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.   Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous  effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies  passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has  decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to  record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made  it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.   This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will  pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million  Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent  decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more  than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for  everything because of leftwing extremist policies.   My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important  oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe  Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper  inflation crisis.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as  well as the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think it is perfectly reasonable to have a  report that looks into the spending that has been taking place for the  past 2 years and beyond.   This inflation is impacting millions of Americans across our Nation.  As I stated, American families will pay $8,581 in an inflation tax. We  should be looking into the impacts of the spending that is taking place  in Washington, D.C. Even if it is an estimate, we need to have an idea  of how this is impacting families and why we currently have  [[Page H2906]]  20 million families that cannot afford their utility bills and why we  have seen this 4.3 percent decline in real wages since Biden took  office. I would like to see that report.   Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  amendment No. 1.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in favor of my amendment, which will require the Comptroller  General to publish the GAO study of rules on its website.   My simple, straightforward amendment ensures that the American people  will be better informed of the regulations unelected bureaucrats are  imposing on them, costing as much as $2 trillion in compliance costs  and economic losses.   During the first year of this administration, the Biden White House  added more than $200 billion in new regulatory costs. Without my  amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's leftwing agenda  will not be seen by those impacted most.   This will provide transparency for the administration to answer to  the American people.   While the Federal Government continues to spend trillions of dollars  it doesn't have, inflation has hit a 40-year high. Everything we buy,  including food, gasoline, and so much more, costs more.   Instead of addressing these major economic concerns head-on, the  Democrats' solution is to keep imposing unnecessary regulations and  spending money we do not have.                                time  1230    The GOP majority has been empowered to hold this administration  accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much these  regulations are costing American families and small businesses.   Unnecessary government regulations and excessive red tape impose  crushing economic burdens on the people in my district and across our  great country.   Since Joe Biden took office, his administration and unchecked  bureaucrats are going full steam ahead on enacting a radical leftwing  agenda throughout unilateral executive action.   House Republicans should be working to cut wasteful spending, get to  the bottom of fraudulent payments made by the Federal Government,  support American energy production, and oppose tax increases proposed  by the Democrats.   Economic strength and job growth result from policies that unshackle  job creators, allow American ingenuity, and provide certainty.   My amendment ensures the legislative branch, and the American people  can provide proper oversight and no longer allow this administration to  go unchecked.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as well as the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of my amendment, which will  require the Comptroller General's Congressional Review Report to be  made available to the congressional committees of jurisdiction.   This simple, good-governance amendment allows Congress to take back  its Article I authority in our system of checks and balances. This will  provide transparency for the administration to carry out its  congressionally authorized duty.   By requiring the administration to submit its plan to the people's  House, we can provide important oversight and provide feedback. It is  time for the legislative branch to actually do its job rather than  ceding all the power to the White House and bureaucrats.   Our Founders were determined to create a government whose branches  work together. By requiring the Comptroller General to submit the  Congressional Review Report to the congressional committees of  jurisdiction of the rule, we will allow Members who know these issues  best to examine the real-life impacts of these executive regulations.   Congress needs to take back its power and advocate for the American  people we represent. My amendment will ensure these voices do not go  unheard. Hold this administration accountable and ensure Biden's streak  of unchecked power comes to an end.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of these amendments as well as  the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
