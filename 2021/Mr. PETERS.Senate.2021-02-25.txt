 Mr. President, I am proud to stand today in support of  Jennifer Granholm's nomination to be the next Secretary of Energy.   I have known Secretary-designate Granholm for many years, and I  served in her administration while she was Governor. There is no  question she is uniquely qualified to serve as Secretary of Energy. As  the Governor of Michigan, she led our State through an economic crisis.  She knows how to deal with multifaceted challenges and has a documented  record of strong leadership.   During her confirmation hearing, Jennifer Granholm outlined three key  missions that she wants to prioritize in her new role: one,  strengthening national security, particularly on nuclear  nonproliferation through the National Nuclear Security Administration;  two, supporting the research and development at scientific research  facilities all across our Nation; and, three, utilizing that research  to create new, good-paying jobs for Americans. All of these issues are  issues that Jennifer Granholm has been focused on throughout her entire  career.   As Governor, she worked to support groundbreaking research that is  conducted at Michigan's world-class institutions--research that is  constantly leading to new discoveries that will change the world to  create jobs and save lives. As Governor, Jennifer Granholm secured  bipartisan support to establish the 21st Century Jobs Fund, which  leveraged funding to diversify Michigan's economy, create jobs in clean  energy by attracting new business investments, and put Michigan on a  better path.   Those are the kinds of actions and investments that I look forward to  working closely with Secretary-designate Granholm on in the coming  months and in the coming years, and it is clear that she also  recognizes what must be done to advance our Nation's energy interests,  because she has already achieved results in Michigan.   If we are going to build back better, we must do so in a sustainable,  forward-thinking way that addresses climate change. That is something  President Biden's administration is committed to doing, and I know  Secretary Granholm is as well. I could not be more excited to say that  we will have a fellow Michigander leading the Department of Energy, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support her confirmation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
