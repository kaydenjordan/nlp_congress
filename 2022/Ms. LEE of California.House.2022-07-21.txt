 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 8373, of which I am a proud original cosponsor. I thank  Congresswoman Manning for her tremendous leadership and also Chairman  Pallone and Speaker Pelosi for bringing this bill to the floor.   As co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I know how important this bill  is, especially after the Supreme Court's recent decision overturning  abortion access.   Radical extremists have been clear that they will be going after  rights like contraception next, and that is just downright outrageous.   It is hard to imagine so many freedoms are being taken away: abortion  and contraception, no access to family planning, and, of course, no  support at all from Republicans for comprehensive sex education.   Everyone should have the freedom to make decisions about their  bodies, their lives, and their future. That includes the right to  choose which FDA-approved method of contraception is best for them.   The Pro-Choice Caucus, and many of us, have urged the FDA to make  birth control available over the counter. Safety and efficacy are  extremely important, and I urge the FDA to move quickly but carefully.  Birth control must be safe. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
