 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, since 2014, the Veterans' Affairs Committee has held  countless hearings focused on VA medical centers that were found to  have covered up wait times or failed to consistently provide high- quality healthcare to veterans.   Many of these failures were first brought to light by whistleblower  allegations and were later substantiated by Government Accountability  Office studies and VA inspector general investigations. Solutions to  these failures were only uncovered through multiple inspections of  medical centers' facilities, their policies, and their employees.   Congress relies on the hard work of medical inspectors and  investigators at the VA, the OIG, and the GAO to review allegations and  issue recommendations regarding how VA and Congress should work to  correct deficiencies at medical centers and hold VA officials  accountable. With limited resources, the inspector general and the GAO  have completed a staggering number of investigations and reviews that  have led to significant reforms of the VA system. They should be  commended for their excellent work.                                time  1400    The Enhancing Veteran Care Act gives the Secretary another tool for  developing solutions to problems at VA medical facilities. The VA  Secretary should be able to contract with nonprofit-nongovernmental  medical inspectors or auditors when deemed appropriate.   However, I strongly believe that granting the VA Secretary the  authority to contract with nongovernmental inspectors and auditors  should not result in cuts to the IG's or VA's budgets. We need to  ensure VA inspectors and the VA OIG have the resources to continue  their thorough and timely investigations.   I am also concerned about these nongovernmental organizations not  being required to follow Federal laws that require transparency. I  believe these nongovernmental bodies should be held to the very same  level of transparency as the IG, GAO, and VA investigators, including  requirements to publish their methods for conducting audits and reviews  alongside their findings and recommendations. Without transparency,  Congress and the public will not have the same level of confidence in  their findings.   If we had the opportunity to consider this legislation in committee,  we could have received testimony from VA, the IG, and GAO on this  legislation and done more to address concerns around transparency,  while also ensuring that investigative efforts are not duplicated. I  encourage the chairman to continue his inclusive approach by seeking to  bring all veterans related bills through committee for due  consideration.   However, these concerns will not prevent me from supporting the  Enhancing Veteran Care Act. I trust the Secretary will execute this  authority in a manner that supports and supplements government-led  investigations.   Veterans should have full confidence that they will receive high- quality healthcare at VA facilities. Rigorous and transparent  investigations and audits will help guarantee these high standards are  met.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), my good friend and ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  S. 1266, Enhancing Veteran Care Act.   Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs can contract with  qualified and accredited third-party nonprofits to investigate a VA  medical center for deficiencies in its facility. Only the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs, however, is directly capable of authorizing these  third-party investigations.   Unfortunately, this process is needlessly cumbersome and delays the  improvement of medical centers. This bill  [[Page H9643]]  is an important reform because it empowers Veteran Integrated Service  Network directors and VA medical center directors to initiate these  third-party reviews.   The Manchester VA Medical Center in my home State of New Hampshire  currently faces a number of questions regarding the services it  provides and the facilities it manages. While Secretary Shulkin has  initiated reviews of the facility, it took a number of whistleblowers  to put their reputation and jobs on the line to force action.   Legislation like the Enhancing Veteran Care Act could have  streamlined this process and made both the facility and the VISN more  accountable to the needs of veterans in New Hampshire. VA must be  better at assessing its own shortcomings.   Ultimately, veterans in the Granite State and across the country  deserve the highest standard of care.   I thank Senators Inhofe and Lankford for introducing this important  legislation. I thank Senator Shaheen, one of the lead Democratic  cosponsors of the bill, for helping advance this bill through the U.S.  Senate and being attentive to the needs of our Granite State veterans.   I proudly support this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to  support this bill and immediately send it to the President's desk.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  S. 1266, the Enhancing Veteran Care Act, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  S. 1266, the Enhancing Veteran Care Act, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
