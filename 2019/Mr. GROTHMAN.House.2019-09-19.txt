 Madam Speaker, prior to discussing the current state of  immigration law, I would like to yield some time to my good friend and  colleague, Congressman Duffy, who I think is going to address some  important issues of Congress tonight.   I hope everybody pays attention because I think, other than perhaps  lecturing us on logging and fishing and hunting, this will be his last  official speech as a Congressman for a few years.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy),  my colleague.                          Final Address to Congress     Madam Speaker, Congress, last week, got back from their  time in district in August, and quite a bit happened on the immigration  front since then; some good news, some bad news, but it is important to  address what Congress has yet to do.   I do want to point out the good news. So far this year, we have built  or rehabbed 66 miles of the wall on the southern border, and we are on  track to do another 390 miles by the end of 2020. When that is done, we  will have built 700 miles along the 2,000-mile border. Some more will  probably have to be done at that time, but we are, at last, doing this.   The other good news is that it is a tremendous wall. That wall is  going to be 30 feet high and 6 feet under the ground. I have been down  there looking at parts of that wall. There are things that we have done  on top of the wall that will make it still more difficult to get over.   I am told that, so far, four people have tried to get across the wall  and all have failed.   For those people who thought a wall does not work, I suggest that  they look at that wall that is currently being built.   I will point out; the USA will not be the first country to have  success with a wall. Israel along the Egyptian border  [[Page H7831]]  has a wall. India along the Bangladesh border has a wall; a wall, quite  frankly, a lot--a border a lot longer than the America/Mexican border;  and Hungary has a considerable border wall with Serbia.                                time  2000    All those other walls are effective. I am glad the United States is  finally getting going on the wall.   The next thing I will count as good news on the immigration front is  that I was able to attend a ceremony in which legal immigrants were  being sworn in, in Milwaukee. Every month in a city as small as  Milwaukee, about 400 new citizens are being sworn in. Neither Donald  Trump nor virtually any Republican who I am aware of wants to stop  those 400 new citizens coming here each month.   It is very exhilarating to talk to them. So many of them have already  founded their own businesses. Obviously, the rest already have jobs and  have spent a considerable amount of time working in this country and  are very proud to renounce the citizenship of their native land and  become American citizens.   Overall, we swear in 700,000 new citizens a year and have 4 million  people on work visas. But there is other news that probably can be  considered not quite as good. We had 64,000 people cross the border in  August. That is down from 144,000 in May, but it is still 20,000 more  than it was last year.   When we talk about 64,000 people being processed into this country or  processed at the border, we don't include other people who haven't even  been caught, and those are the most dangerous people of all.   Many of the people being processed on the border feel that they will  be able to come to this country through an asylum process legally. When  people are not checking themselves in at the border, it means they feel  they have to sneak through the border and probably have something to  hide.   While the Border Patrol doesn't know exactly how many people they are  not processing, they are guessing it is over 10,000 people a month.  That is certainly something that has to be addressed.   The next thing to talk about, as far as people coming across the  border, is why it is higher than it was a year ago, and why is that  still higher than it was 20 or 30 years ago?   Some people think the reason so many people try to come across our  border is that things are worse in other countries. That is not so.  There were times in the relatively recent past in which we had outright  civil wars in Central America. People did not come to the United States  even though there were civil wars in their home country because they  felt they couldn't. They felt the United States would enforce its  current immigration laws.   The reason we had so many more people try to get in here in the past  year is because the word was out in other countries. The word was out  among the cartels that escort so many people to this country that the  United States was not enforcing its immigration laws.   I was at the border again at the end of July, and it was interesting  to hear from the Border Patrol that at the time Donald Trump was first  elected, they were almost bored at the border. There was nobody trying  to come in here. Why was that? Because Donald Trump ran on immigration  reform and immigration stability, and they felt they wouldn't have a  chance to come to the United States.   The reason we had 64,000 people checked in at the border, plus who  knows how many sneaking across, in August is the word is still out in  other countries that the United States is not enforcing its laws.   The question is, what can we do to stop the floodgates of 60,000  people still coming here?   First of all, we need more personnel. As we have had a flood of more  people coming on the border, the Border Patrol has to spend their time  on paperwork, and the Border Patrol has to spend its time babysitting  children, not guarding the border. These new employees are less costly  than the Border Patrol.   I respect the Border Patrol so much after being down there three  times. Can you imagine, in the middle of the night, maybe finding 50  people and having to, in essence, arrest them yourself and escort them  back to the border?   We could use some personnel to do--I don't know what I can refer to  it as--the babysitting part of the job, the paperwork part of the job,  to free up the Border Patrol so they can enforce the border.   Secondly, this Congress that is so quick to spend money on anything  can give us more technology at the points of entry, and I would also  add more dogs at the point of entry, which do such a great job of  identifying people trying to sneak across.   Another thing that Congress should do is get rid of birthright  citizenship. When I was at the El Paso sector and saw people waiting to  come in, it was obvious there were a disproportionate number of  pregnant women coming into this country, which is what we have heard.  People 6, 7 months pregnant, whether they fly in from Asia or cross the  southern border, they come here because the United States is one of  only two of the, I believe, the 40th wealthiest countries in the world  to have birthright citizenship.   Donald Trump had promised to get rid of that when he first ran for  election, and I hope that is something he follows up on.   Another problem we have is that, right now, families are still  allowed in the United States under the Flores settlement after they are  here for maybe 20 days. If they were here for 60 days, they wouldn't be  able to sneak in this country and disappear into kind of the ether, but  they would be able to stay here until they have their court hearing. It  is so important for this Congress to pass a law saying that you can  keep these families at the border or not let them in the United States  for at least 60 days pending their court hearing.   While I talk about families at the border, I want to make some other  observations that the Border Patrol gave me. First of all, it  frustrates them that people coming here get such better healthcare than  people who are already here in America. The vast majority of us have  some sort of large deductible. They have copays. People coming from  other countries when they come to the border are given whatever they  want for anything wrong. I can understand that we don't want anything  bad to happen to people, but it is an inducement for more people to  sneak in here as long as we give away free medical care.    The next thing that we need is the ability to return children to  their parents. Under current law, we can return unaccompanied children  to their parents in Canada and Mexico. We cannot do that to Central  American countries. The Central American countries are frustrated that  we are taking their youth and bringing them to the United States.   These bills are available to be brought to the floor. It is time that  Congress act and say we are not going to tear apart families. If we  catch a 15-year-old coming into this country from Honduras, we should  be able to return them to their parents in Honduras. We shouldn't, as  under current law, be required to keep them in this country. It is kind  of the ugly America at its worst that we tear apart families and take  young children who have fled their parents.   The next thing that we have to do is we have to raise the standard of  credible fear. We cannot continue to have people come into this country  sometimes without the strongest evidence that they are genuinely in  fear of what is going on in their country, particularly because, right  now, immigration attorneys assist people in allowing them to come into  our country.   We need more money for ICE to remove illegal immigrants, particularly  illegal immigrants who are criminals. Donald Trump must be allowed to  continue on his plan of not letting people in this country if they are  probably going to wind up on public assistance or welfare. That would  be a disaster for their country.   If we do these things, I think we can finally secure our border.   Again, Donald Trump has done a lot on his own. He has reassigned  money that was originally going to the Department of Defense. He has  tried to change the way we deal with asylum. Congress has to step up  with President Trump and do something: hire more personnel at the  border; get more technology at the border; get rid of the  [[Page H7832]]  birthright citizenship; change the law so we can keep people at the  border for 60 days; return children, particularly unaccompanied  children, to their parents when they try to sneak in here; change the  standard of credible fear. Then we will go the rest of the way toward  having a good immigration system.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
