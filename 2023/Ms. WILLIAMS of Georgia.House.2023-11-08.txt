 Mr. Chair, I am proud to have introduced a  bipartisan amendment to the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations bill to highlight the importance of protecting election  workers with my friends, Congressmen Mike Levin, Juan Ciscomani, Sean  Casten, and Chris DeLuzio.   From the failed former President doxxing Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss  to the Fulton County election director, registration chief, and their  staff getting death threats and being called every racial slur  imaginable, my state has become ground zero for harassment and attacks  on election workers. Y'all, when I say Georgia is the center of the  political universe, this is not what I usually have in mind.   The Federal government needs to step up to protect election workers:  the foot soldiers of our democracy. They ensure our constituents'  voices are heard at the ballot box smoothly and efficiently, and ensure  we all get election results quickly and reliably. But because of the  constant attacks and harassment they face, election workers are leaving  their jobs at a terrifying rate, depriving our constituents of their  right to a well-functioning democratic system. That's why I'm so  grateful for this bipartisan group of Members who have come together to  advocate for anti-doxxing protections and data and physical security  resources for election workers, so that we support them the way they  support our democracy.
