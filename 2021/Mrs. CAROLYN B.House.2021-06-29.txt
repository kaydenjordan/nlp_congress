 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 504, I call up the bill (H.R. 2662) to amend the Inspector  General Act of 1978, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 2662.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I rise today to urge strong, bipartisan support for my bill, H.R.  2662, the IG Independence and Empowerment Act.   The work of inspectors general, who conduct independent oversight of  Federal agencies, continues to be a remarkable investment for American  taxpayers. For every dollar we spend on IGs, we get $17 back. And this  return could be even higher if we gave IGs additional tools, which is  exactly what this bill would do.   The IG Independence and Empowerment Act is a package of critical  reforms to protect IGs from political retaliation and obstruction. I  want to thank Leader Hoyer for his support and work on this bill, as  well as all the other cosponsors of the legislation.   The IG Independence and Empowerment Act also has the support of 14  good government groups. They wrote that the reforms in this legislation  ``have been crafted to address problems with inspector general  independence and authority long raised by Congress, civil society, and  our inspectors general. We strongly urge Congress to pass this  legislation to empower our independent watchdogs to serve the public  even more effectively.''   This bill would enhance the independence of IGs in several ways. Most  importantly, it would protect IGs from being fired simply for doing  their jobs. The bill would only allow an IG to be removed for a  documented cause, based on a defined list of nonpartisan reasons, such  as a knowing violation of  [[Page H3280]]  the law, abuse of authority, or gross mismanagement.   These removal protections come from a bill I introduced last year,  after the previous administration bullied, sidelined, and retaliated  against multiple IGs.   Last April and May, in six short weeks, President Trump fired or  sidelined four IGs and acting IGs who were simply doing their jobs.   On April 3, intelligence community IG Michael Atkinson was fired  after he provided a whistleblower complaint to Congress about President  Trump's now infamous call with Ukrainian President, part of the conduct  for which he was impeached by this body.   On April 7, President Trump removed Glenn Fine as Acting Defense  Department IG, which blocked IG Fine from serving as chair of the  Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, a committee I helped create  in the CARES Act to oversee trillions of dollars in Federal spending in  response to the coronavirus pandemic. IG Fine was simply doing his job.   On May 15, President Trump removed Mitch Behm as the Acting  Transportation Department IG and replaced him with an agency insider.  Mr. Behm was investigating Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao at  the time.   And, finally, that same day, President Trump fired State Department  IG Steve Linick, who, at the time, was investigating Secretary of State  Mike Pompeo for abuse of power and misuse of resources, and replaced  him with a political crony.   All four of these IGs were just following the law and the facts, yet  they faced blatant retaliation. This is just plain wrong.   President Trump's actions struck at the heart of why we have IGs, to  provide independent oversight and a check on executive branch waste,  fraud, and abuse.   No President should be allowed to retaliate against an IG for simply  doing their jobs, and the IG Independence and Empowerment Act would  ensure that IGs are protected from this kind of retaliation.   In a letter to congressional leadership after the IG firings by Mr.  Trump, nine former IGs wrote and said: ``Forcing inspectors general to  choose between doing their jobs with integrity and keeping their  positions is not an acceptable model of governance and oversight. We  therefore urge you to pass for-cause removal protections for all IGs.''   In addition, the IG Independence and Empowerment Act would ensure  temporary, acting IGs are independent and qualified by requiring the  acting IG to be the deputy IG in the same office, or another senior  official from the IG community if there is no deputy. This would  protect against the appointment of acting IGs with conflicts of  interest or who are acting as political appointees.   The IG Independence and Empowerment Act would further bolster IG  independence by requiring notification to Congress before an IG is  pushed aside and placed on non-duty status so that we in Congress can  support the independence of IGs.   The bill would also empower IGs by granting them the authority to  subpoena nongovernment witnesses to provide testimony. In many  investigations, testimony from nongovernment witnesses is essential. So  providing IGs with this authority is often the only way to root out  fraud or other wrongdoings.   In 2016, our former colleague, Mark Meadows, supported a similar  provision and highlighted that bill's procedural safeguards, which are  essentially the same in the bill we are considering today.   He stated: ``This bill provides the expanded authority that the IGs  have asked for, but with safeguards in place to make sure that they  protect against the possibility that an IG's investigation would  interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation, or do other harm.''                                time  1645    The IG Independence and Empowerment Act would also close a loophole  that prevents the Department of Justice IG from initiating  investigations into professional misconduct by DOJ attorneys.   This bill balances enhanced authorities and independence with new  accountability and transparency measures for IGs.   For example, the bill contains the bipartisan Integrity Committee  Transparency Act, which would require greater transparency from the  CIGIE Integrity Committee, the body Congress set up to investigate IGs.   Supporting IG independence has long been a bipartisan issue. Congress  must act now to protect and empower IGs so that they can perform the  duties Congress has entrusted to them without being retaliated against.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the IG Independence and  Empowerment Act and continue the bipartisan tradition of protecting and  strengthening IGs.   To my Republican colleagues who may say these efforts are about  attacking President Trump, I would respond with this: Joe Biden is the  President now.   I am supporting good governments reforms under a Democratic  administration because I believe in accountability no matter who the  President is and what party they come from.   We are talking about the future. This is about safeguarding  taxpayers' money and protecting the integrity of our government.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support these  critical reforms as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader  of the House, an important leader on this legislation, and a steadfast  leader on this and on so many issues before this body.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez), the vice chair of the Committee  on Oversight and Reform.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Porter), the vice chair of the  Subcommittee on Government Operations of the Oversight Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman from California for her amendment, her hard work on this  bill, and her leadership on the subcommittee and committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield the  gentleman such time as he may consume.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, first, I would  like to recognize the hard work of the chairman of the subcommittee. He  authored two proposals that were included in the bill and was a major  leader on it. I thank Mr. Connolly.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil  Liberties of the Oversight Committee and a member of the Select  Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis of the Oversight Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my dear friend and colleague,  for having great enthusiasm for oversight and combating waste, fraud,  and abuse. I would respectfully offer to him that the best way to  conduct that is to give the power to the IGs to conduct legitimate  investigations. What we have seen is that when there comes a legitimate  investigation, they are often moved aside, fired, or retaliated  against.   So, I welcome the gentleman's enthusiasm. I hope he will join with me  in supporting giving the power to IGs to conduct legitimate  investigations of waste, fraud, and abuse.   As I said in my opening remarks, for every dollar we spend on IGs, we  get back $17, really hundreds of millions of dollars back from their  oversight and work.   Madam Speaker, I want to remind the gentleman, as he knows from our  hearings, there are many provisions in this bill that are bipartisan,  several that Mr. Connolly just mentioned that we were working on. I  look forward to working with him and passing this bill.   It should be bipartisan. Oversight and accountability should be  bipartisan. I hope the gentleman joins us in voting for this important  bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier), the chair of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of  the Armed Services Committee. She also serves on the Oversight and  Reform Committee and is the co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how  much time is remaining?    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank my  colleague, Jackie Speier, for her tremendous work on this bill, and one  of the major provisions was a bill of hers that was incorporated into  it.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Ross),  a newly elected Member from the great State of North Carolina and a  member of the Judiciary Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Independence is the bedrock principle of inspectors general, and this  legislation would protect and enhance their critical work.   As I mentioned earlier, this legislation has the support of several  nonpartisan, good government groups, including the Project on  Government Oversight, the Government Accountability Project, Taxpayers  for Common Sense, and many, many others. It also contains several  bipartisan bills that are part of the overall inspector general reform  bill. I ask that the support letters from the good government groups be  included in the Record.                                                      June 28, 2021.        Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations write to       express our support for the IG Independence and Empowerment       Act (H.R. 2662) and to urge you to vote for this critical       legislation.        Our federal inspectors general (IGs) identify and       investigate waste, fraud, and abuse within the executive       branch. The importance of their work cannot be overstated.       Executive branch officials and Members of Congress from both       sides of the aisle rely on oversight conducted by inspectors       general to inform their policy-making. These watchdogs       continually return substantial savings for taxpayers. In       fiscal year 2020 alone, inspectors general identified       potential savings of approximately $53 billion. And perhaps       most importantly, inspectors general investigate and expose       abuses of power that may infringe on constitutional rights.        If enacted, this legislation would address critical       weaknesses in laws that have limited the effectiveness and       threatened the independence of these watchdogs.        For example, most inspectors general lack the authority to       compel former agency officials, subcontractors, or       subgrantees to cooperate with IG investigations. This has       limited the ability of our watchdogs to effectively review       federal programs for waste and fraud and to investigate       federal employees accused of misconduct. The IG Independence       and Empowerment Act would address this by giving inspectors       general the authority to compel testimony from former agency       officials, subcontractors, or grantees where that testimony       would be relevant to ongoing investigations.        Another weakness is that the president can fire these       watchdogs and replace them with unqualified or conflicted       individuals, exposing the work of these offices to       unnecessary political interference. The public and Congress       depend on inspectors general to ensure our federal agencies       are functioning effectively, but these watchdogs must be       confident they will not be fired for doing that job well. As       nine former inspectors general recently wrote to Congress,       ``Forcing inspectors general to choose between doing their       jobs with integrity and keeping their positions is not an       acceptable model of governance and oversight.'' The IG       Independence and Empowerment Act places reasonable limits on       when a president can remove an inspector general and who can       serve in the event of a vacancy, and will further insulate       the critical oversight offices from politics.        There are many other critical reforms in this comprehensive       legislation that have been crafted to address problems with       inspector general independence and authority long raised by       Congress, civil society, and our inspectors general. We       strongly urge Congress to pass this legislation to empower       our independent watchdogs to serve the public even more       effectively.            Sincerely,          Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington             (CREW), Common Cause, Demand Progress, Government             Accountability Project, Government Information Watch,             Mainers for Accountable Leadership, National Security             Counselors, Open The Government, Project On Government             Oversight (POGO), Protect Democracy, Public Citizen,             Stand Up America, Taxpayers for Common Sense, The             Digital Democracy Project.    MALONEY of New York. The reforms we are considering  today are only one part of the work Congress needs to prevent future  Presidents from abusing power. I also strongly support the broad  Protecting Our Democracy Act, which Chairman Schiff has spearheaded,  and I look forward to that bill's consideration very soon.   I do want to say that the Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis,  unlike the description from my good friend and colleague, has held 15  hearings of oversight. They have disclosed and recovered millions of  dollars of illegal spending or corrupt spending. There is a hearing  tomorrow, which will be the 16th hearing of the committee, and we  welcome you to join us at that subcommittee hearing if you so wish.   The inspector general community just, in general, has been attacked  in recent years. By passing this IG Independence and Empowerment Act,  Congress would send a strong message in the strongest terms that no  administration, regardless of President or party, can bully or  retaliate or act against an IG when the IG is doing their job. They can  only be removed for just cause, such as violating the law or gross  mismanagement.   In passing this legislation, we will be strengthening our democracy,  and we will send a strong message that Congress supports accountability  and an effective government.   I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill. It should be a  bipartisan bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 504, I offer amendments en bloc.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the amendment  offered by Congresswoman Cindy Axne would increase transparency when an  inspector general is removed.   This amendment would require the President or independent agency head  to provide Congress a detailed case-specific explanation when firing an  IG.   The amendment would also require the President or independent agency  head to provide to Congress the findings from an inquiry that led to  the IG's removal.   These requirements would enhance IG independence in addition to the  critical for-cause removal protections already in the bill.   The amendment offered by Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux would  enhance training requirements for inspectors general.   This amendment would ensure that IGs are trained in an important  aspect of their oversight work over Federal contractors.   The suspension and debarment process provides an essential tool to  hold Federal contractors accountable for waste, fraud, and abuse.   Federal procurement law and the suspension and debarment processes  are highly complex, and it is important that all IGs are well-versed on  these issues.   This training will help make IGs even more effective and efficient  and could lead to more taxpayer savings.   The amendment offered by Congressman Troy Carter would ensure IGs are  paid at an equitable level with senior staff in their office.   Through an unintended consequence in current law, IGs are sometimes  paid less than the senior staff in their own offices. This inequity  could lead to difficulty in attracting the most qualified people to be  IGs.   This amendment would add language to current law providing that IGs  have to be paid at least the same rate of pay as the highest paid  employee in the IG's office.   This simple change would help ensure that IGs are paid what they  deserve for the critical work they perform.                                time  1730    The amendment offered by Congressman   Tom Malinowski would balance  notification to Congress with the need to address an immediate threat.   The base bill would require that the President or an independent  agency head would notify Congress at least 30 days before placing an IG  on non-duty status.   This amendment would make an exception to that requirement if any  delay in that placement would mean a threat to people, property, or an  ongoing investigation.   This amendment would give the President or agency head flexibility in  the case of a documented threat, while ensuring Congress is notified of  any change to an IG status in advance whenever possible.   And, finally, an amendment offered by Congressman Ritchie Torres,  which would provide a needed review of all processes to ensure IGs are  held accountable.   This amendment would require the Government Accountability Office to  review existing processes for investigating allegations of IG  wrongdoing, including the processes of the CIGIE Integrity Committee.  The results of this review would provide Congress with critical  information to know how well these processes are working and how to  improve them, if needed.   IGs provide a critical check on waste, fraud, and abuse in the  government, and their own conduct must be above reproach.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this commonsense package  of amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter), one of the newest members  of our caucus. He serves on the Committees of Transportation and  Infrastructure and Small Business.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I support all of  the en bloc amendments, including Mr. Carter's, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in  opposition to this amendment    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, this amendment  would absolutely gut the bill. The amendment would strike the bill's  key protection for inspectors general against political retaliation by  eliminating the protection that would only allow an IG to be removed  only for a legitimate cause. Not for political retaliation, not because  a President doesn't like what they are doing or an investigation that  they have started, but only for mismanagement or illegal acts for  cause.   We saw last year how unlimited authority can be abused when President  Trump bullied and retaliated against two IGs who were investigating his  administration, including when he fired the State Department IG. These  protections are constitutional.   Last month, the Independent Congressional Review Service released an  analysis of congressional authority to limit the removal of IGs and  concluded that for-cause removal restrictions ``appear to be a  constitutionally permissible means of encouraging independence for most  IGs.''   Madam Speaker, this amendment would also gut the protection in the  bill against the appointment of acting IGs with a clear conflict of  interest. The amendment would strike a requirement that acting IGs come  from an Office of Inspector General. The Council of Inspectors General  for Integrity and Efficiency requested this reform, proposed by  Republican Representative Porter, as one of its top legislative  priorities in order to ``enhance the independence of OIGs.''   We saw serious abuses during the last administration. In both the  Department of Transportation and the Department of State, President  Trump named political appointees within the agency to serve as the  acting IG overseeing the same agency.   Finally, this amendment would strip from the bill an important reform  that would allow IGs to issue a subpoena to require individuals outside  of the Federal Government to provide testimony, if needed, for an  investigation. This has long been a priority for inspectors general to  allow thorough and complete investigations.   Madam Speaker, multiple IGs have reported that Trump administration  officials, including Jeff Sessions, have refused to cooperate with  investigations. No Federal employee should be able to simply avoid and  escape accountability by leaving government and saying, ``I just no  longer will testify or participate in finding the truth.''   These provisions were passed by the Committee on Oversight and Reform  and the House in 2018, in a Republican-led bill, and contained  carefully crafted compromises struck by Chairman Issa and Ranking  Member Cummings years ago.   Madam Speaker, this legislation provides procedural safeguards to  ensure that subpoena authority is not abused and it does not interfere  with ongoing investigations. For example, the bill will require an  inspector general to obtain the approval of a panel of three other  inspectors general in order to issue a subpoena for testimony.   A few IGs, including the Department of Defense IG, already have this  authority. The language I authored and that the Congress passed on a  bipartisan basis, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee was  provided testimonial subpoena authority when it was created as part of  the CARES Act last Congress.   There are many instances of former officials and nongovernment  employees avoiding IG interviews going back over a decade. For example,  IGs were unable to interview retired agents in the ``Fast and Furious''  investigation, and nongovernment witnesses to the Carter-Page FISA  warrant investigation.   This has never been a partisan issue before. In fact, the underlying  bill had many, many bipartisan pieces. So in a letter to the Committee  on Oversight and Reform, Department of Justice Inspector General has  also come out against this.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
