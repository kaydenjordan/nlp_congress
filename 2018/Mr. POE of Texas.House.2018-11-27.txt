 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, they have been the focus of legend and  lore, portrayed on radio shows and the silver screen.   It was this month, in 1835, the new Republic of Texas officially  created a law enforcement force of three companies, 56 men each, known  as the Texas Rangers. The Rangers wear a star made out of a Mexican  cinco pesos coin on their western dress, with, of course, the  ubiquitous cowboy hat.   Captain Bill McDonald said it best: ``No man in the wrong can stand  up against a fellow that's in the right and keeps on a-comin'.''   They are the oldest law enforcement agency in North America with  statewide jurisdiction. These Texas lawmen have always had a certain  swagger and a certain awe about them.   Legendary Ranger ``RIP,'' rest in peace, Ford said this: ``They did  right because it was right.''   And when the Dallas mayor needed to call in the big guns to prevent  an illegal prizefight, Captain McDonald answered the call. As the story  is told, the mayor asked: ``Where are the other rangers?''   McDonald replied: ``Hell, ain't I enough? There's only one  prizefight.''   Texas Rangers: One riot, one ranger.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong support  for this legislation of which I am an original cosponsor. I was proud  to work alongside Ranking Member Engel, Mr. Adam Smith, Mr. McCaul, and  Representative Keating on this legislation.   Around the globe today, Mr. Speaker, fractured nations are struggling  with conflict, violence, and a range of other challenges that degrade  security and prevent their internal development.   Weak states and ungoverned places anywhere in the world provide  opportunities for terrorism and instability to flourish. As a result,  these fragile states become national security concerns for our country.   Mr. Speaker, we need to solve problems in a smarter way so we don't  have to constantly deploy America's sons and daughters into harm's way  to fight more foreign wars. The United States has been at war  consistently for over 17 straight years. Maybe it is time we rethink  our philosophy of constant military involvement throughout the globe as  a first response to turmoil and unrest.   We need to address the underlying root causes of instability: treat  the disease, not just the symptoms. That is what this bill will do. It  will require the development of a whole-of-government approach to  targeting root causes of instability and conflict in the world's most  fragile regions before they require military interventions by the  United States.   Instead of parallel efforts that often respond to conflict with  short-term solutions, this bill will require long-term, coordinated  strategies that make our foreign assistance dollars more effective. It  will allow Congress to have more oversight of those foreign aid  dollars. The money we spend abroad must be designed to solve problems,  not endlessly consume resources by military conflict.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Engel for his leadership  on this critical issue. I do urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   I also want to take a moment to thank Ranking Member Engel for his  friendship and support and his work on the Foreign Affairs Committee  since I have been on the committee. I also want to thank Chairman  Royce, who will also be leaving Congress at the end of this session,  for his work.   As we have said numerous times, if more committees would work in a  bipartisan way to solve a specific goal--the long-term interests of the  United States being that goal--I think things would be better here in  the House. But I want to thank both of these Members for their  relationship with me and for working so hard to help America solve  these international problems in a bipartisan way.   And that is just the way it is.    Madam Speaker, I want to reiterate that when the  Foreign Affairs Committee meets and makes a decision, we do that almost  in unison, Republicans and Democrats, looking out for the best foreign  policy of the United States. And Chairman Royce and Mr. Engel, Chairman  Engel, will do a great job in leading that effort, as you have done in  the past when you were chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   I am proud to support Representative Kinzinger's bill, the Preventing  Destabilization of Iraq Act of 2018.   For too long, Iraq has been the center of chaos and instability in  the Middle East. While much of this is due to terrorist groups, its  expansionist, saber-rattling neighbor to the east also bears enormous  responsibility for undermining Iraq's sovereignty and security.   Iran is determined, in my opinion, to make Iraq a puppet state of its  tyranny. For years, Iran has armed and financed thousands of Iraqi  militia fighters loyal to Tehran to spread its influence and fight its  foreign wars. Many of these militiamen have American blood on their  hands as well as their own countrymen's.   Earlier this year, Iran's proxies in Iraq seized more seats in Iraq's  parliament and used violence to crush anti-Iranian protests.   This legislation codifies crucial authorities to target Iran's  destabilizing activity.                                time  1730    The bill also includes parts of my Iranian Proxies Terrorist  Sanctions bill, which calls for the designation of two of the deadliest  Iraqi militia groups backed by Iran: AAH and HHN.   These killers have attacked Americans, including firing rockets at  U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq as recently as this past August.   They have participated in Bashar al-Assad's slaughter of the Syrian  people and expressed a desire to attack Israel. War is in the mind of  the Ayatollah.   We must battle Iran in the arenas it hopes to control. Iraq is one of  those key arenas.   This legislation is a step towards confronting Iran's conquest of the  Middle East.  [[Page H9597]]    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this important  legislation and for the Senate to quickly bring it to the floor to help  stop Iran, the world's number one state sponsor of terror, from  spreading its violent hate.   And that is just the way it is, Madam Speaker.
