 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a few hours ago, I had the pleasure of  joining Secretary Raimondo and Senator Warner of Virginia for a tour of  the Micron Technologies manufacturing plant just outside Washington,  DC, in Manassas, VA. This is one of the great companies with facilities  that produce semiconductors on U.S. soil.   Secretary Raimondo, Senator Warner, and I were given a behind-the- scenes tour of how these advanced chips, or semiconductors, are made,  and we discussed some of the reasons why it is more expensive to build  these facilities in the United States.   The average American uses countless products every day that could not  function without semiconductors. For everything from cell phones, to  televisions, to cars and dishwashers, chips underpin our most-used  technology. As we become more technology dependent, it is going to get  nothing but more important. But it is not just consumer products; cell  towers, water treatment plants, agricultural equipment, our energy  grid--semiconductors make all of that possible.   These tiny technologies also play a huge role in our national  defense. When we send our troops on a mission by land, sea, air, or  even in cyber space, they need the best equipment available. Now more  than ever, the equipment can't function without these chips.   Just look at Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. This highly  sophisticated system of rocket interceptors is a great example of the  role that chips play in national security--not only ours but of our  allies' as well. We know that the number of civilian casualties that  would be caused if not for the protection of the Iron Dome for the  Israeli people would be significantly higher. I asked my staff to find  out how many semiconductors are actually in one of those interceptors  that knock out one of those rockets coming from Hamas. What I found out  is that every single one of these interceptors contains more than 750  different semiconductors.   So it is not hyperbole to say that there are life-and-death  consequences to a reliable semiconductor supply chain, but right now,  we are in a seriously vulnerable situation. Over the last two decades,  the United States has gone from producing roughly a quarter of the  world's semiconductors to about 12 percent. At the same time, China,  our rival, our competitor that we are talking about a lot this week and  last, has gone from manufacturing zero chips to now 16 percent of the  world's supply, and it plans to invest another $1.4 trillion in  semiconductor technologies.   Right now, China is building 17 fabs, or manufacturing facilities, in  China. We are maybe thinking about building one, through Taiwan  Semiconductor in Arizona, but it depends on our willingness and ability  to support that domestic manufacturing whether or not they actually  complete that currently planned manufacturing facility. But when we are  looking to our adversaries to supply the technology to power our most  critical devices and systems, it is a huge problem.    The global shortage we are seeing right now is a glimpse of what  things could look like and worse. The lack of supply has forced  companies across the  [[Page S3323]]  full range of impacted industries to scale back production or hit pause  altogether. We have seen that particularly in the car manufacture  business.   This shortage has led to some serious consequences. If companies have  to shut down production, which is happening right now, due to lack of  supply of semiconductors, there are hard-working Americans who aren't  able to earn a paycheck. This impact, as I have suggested, is now being  felt by autoworkers across the country.   But we have every expectation that in a few months things will get  back to normal. Those production lines will start back up, workers will  be back on the job, and life will carry on hopefully as normal.   But the bigger question we need to ask is how would we fare if our  supply chain to advance semiconductors was cut off entirely. Let's say  it is another pandemic or a natural disaster or, heaven forbid, a  military conflict in the South China Sea.   Nearly 90 percent of the world's chips are made in Southeast Asia. If  that supply was cut off for any reason, what would we do? The  consequences wouldn't be limited to a few bells and whistles on new  cars. It would impact our missile defense systems, the F-35--the fifth  generation Joint Strike Fighter--advanced weapons systems, quantum  computing, and the full range of equipment and technologies our  national defense depends on. If we don't have the ability to provide  our troops with the technology they need to be successful, what would  we do?   Well, the risks of carrying on business as usual are far too high for  us to even contemplate that scenario. There is a clear need to invest  in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and secure perhaps our most  vulnerable supply chain. As we continue to debate the most effective  ways to confront threats from China and bolster our national and  economic security, there is no question that funding to shore up  domestic semiconductor manufacturing is a must-do.   Last year, Senator Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, and I  introduced the CHIPS for America Act, and it was adopted by an  amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act with broad  bipartisan support on a vote of 96 to 4--a rare thing these days. That  bill became law earlier this year, and now we have the important job of  providing the funding for it, something I hope we can achieve through  the legislation that is before the Senate today.   During the committee consideration of the bill, an amendment was  added that would apply the controversial prevailing wage language to  this portion of the bill. Considering the current wages of U.S.  semiconductor manufacturing companies, it really is a nonissue. But  what is an issue is expansion of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage  provisions, not for public works but to private companies. And I  believe the inclusion of this provision includes some roadblocks on the  way to passage of this final legislation.   So last week I introduced the amendment to strike this unnecessary  and divisive provision and to protect the broad bipartisan support this  legislation has already received. A controversial provision that  doesn't even enact any real change is hardly a reason to let the  funding go down the drain, and it really is just an unnecessary  distraction. We don't need any other speed bumps in our ability to pass  this important bipartisan legislation.   I hope our colleagues will continue to work with us in good faith to  reach a compromise that will earn broad bipartisan support.   Last year the CHIPS for America Act, as I said, passed with a vote of  96 to 4, and there is no reason why this critical funding that we will  be voting on this week should be politicized now.                     Nomination of Chiquita Brooks-LaSure    Finally, Madam President, on another matter, this evening the Senate  will take up a procedural vote on the President's nominee for the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   CMS, as we all know, plays a vital role in providing healthcare to  our most vulnerable populations. More than 4 million Texans, including  half of our children, depend on the stability of our State's Medicaid  Program to provide healthcare for them and their families. And in  States across the country, Medicare funding is vital to the health of  our most vulnerable friends and neighbors for everything from an  emergency room visit to mental healthcare. But that could soon change.   The Biden administration has taken the unprecedented step of  rescinding an agreement with my State and the previous administration  to maintain the stability of our State's Medicaid Program. Under this  agreement, Texas was set to receive approximately $11 billion a year  over the next decade to provide healthcare for our underserved  population. Low-income individuals and those in rural areas are  especially reliant on this funding, as are those who need mental  healthcare. Mental and behavioral health providers alone receive about  $300 million a year.   When asked for the reasoning behind this dangerous and frankly  shocking move, rescinding a prior agreement extending our 1115 waiver,  CMS said it was to correct their administrative error--their error. But  two anonymous Federal healthcare officials, I believe, did something  that is all too rare here in Washington: They actually said the truth.  They explained the real reasoning to the Washington Post. They said it  was done ``to push state officials toward accepting the Affordable Care  Act's Medicaid expansion.''   So, in effect, the administration is doing something that the Supreme  Court of the United States said it cannot do, which is to hold a gun to  the head of the States and force them to accept Medicaid expansion. So  now what they couldn't do under the Supreme Court's decision, they are  trying to do now by holding our healthcare hostage in order to force  the expansion of Medicaid into our State. That is a choice left up to  the Governor and our elected legislature, not one to be made by  bureaucrats with the Department of Health and Human Services or CMS.    While patients in Texas may be the first ones caught in this  political game, I have no expectation that they will be the last. As a  matter of fact, there are only four States that don't have approved or  pending 1115 waivers, which is what we are talking about--four. There  are only four that don't have those. So every other State beyond those  four could be in the same situation my State is in, in the coming  months. Whether it is Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, South  Carolina, Missouri, Idaho--the list of States that could be impacted by  this life-and-death game of political chicken is a long one.   Of course, this all comes at a time when our healthcare system is  already in fragile condition after more than a year of battling COVID- 19. And the patients whose healthcare relies on the stability of the  Medicaid system are those who have faced the biggest challenges during  the pandemic.   I have asked the Biden administration to work with the State to  ensure that millions of impacted individuals won't lose access to  healthcare, but so far there has been little or no progress. The  administration has been unable to provide me any assurance that an  agreement could be reached before the end of this fiscal year-- something that would have dire consequences on our providers and  especially those in behavioral and mental health.   To state the obvious, the nominee to lead CMS, Ms. Brooks-LaSure, did  not personally rescind the Texas Medicaid waiver. As a matter of fact,  she hasn't been confirmed yet; so she couldn't. But before her  nomination could advance, Members of the Senate deserve a commitment  from the administration that it won't try to force the hand of other  States, including Texas, by putting the healthcare of millions of  vulnerable citizens on the line.   If we don't stand up now and push back on this reckless move, who  will be next? Which State will be next? How far will the administration  go to force States into enacting laws that they do not want to enact?   CMS funding is vital to the healthcare of millions of my constituents  and to the stability of our entire healthcare system. CMS cannot be  used as the administration's strong arm to coerce States into accepting  its political demands, which is all this is.   I appreciate Ms. Brooks-LaSure's experience in working with States to  develop these types of waivers and her willingness to meet with me on  this issue, but frankly this is a decision being made above her in the  food chain. But my State has not so far received  [[Page S3324]]  an assurance that this action will be rectified, and it looks like the  administration is intent on pulling the rug out from under our poorest  and most needy patients.   For that reason, I cannot support this nominee, and I urge my  colleagues to stand with me and, in doing so, stand up for the  healthcare of their most vulnerable constituents, too, and pushing the  administration to find an alternate and satisfactory path forward. If  the administration will take aim at the healthcare of 4 million  vulnerable Texans, they will do it to anyone.   I yield the floor.
