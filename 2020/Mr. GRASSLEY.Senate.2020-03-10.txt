 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute in morning business.    Madam President, as all Iowans know, I love history.  That brings me to the floor to honor March as Iowa History Month.   Here are some facts about Iowa. Since becoming a State in 1846, Iowa  has raised one President--that is President Hoover--and four Nobel  laureates, and is home to over 2,000 locations on the National Register  of Historic Places.   Our heritage is preserved by Iowans who do their good work through  maintaining Iowa's museums and historic sites. I encourage all of my  fellow Iowans to help pass on our history to the next generation by  taking advantage of the many programs hosted this month by visiting  www.iowaculture.gov.  I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
