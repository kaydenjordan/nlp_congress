 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I thank him  for his unbelievable leadership, along with the gentlewoman from New  York, Carolyn Maloney, our dear friend, who wore the fireman's jacket  for so long, and Peter King.   I am delighted to have been a member of the Homeland Security  Committee in those early days, banging my fist and joining them in  saying it must be done.   And I thank those who signed the authorization--President Obama,  twice. And I say today, there should not be one single person who does  not vote ``yes'' on this.   We have a beautiful rendition of the World Trade Center. We rebuilt  that beautiful edifice. We must rebuild these lives.   I am reminded in an article by Luis Alvarez, in his final days, as he  was talking to his family, he said, ``I am on the pile.'' They asked  him what he is walking in walking on the pile, Ground Zero, where he  went time and time again.   And along with him, there were individual family members who came  before our committee, those who were desperately in need, and to hear  the special master say: I may have to cut their benefits 50 to 70  percent.   Lila Norstrom, who was a student, and, as well, Anesta Maria St. Rose  Henry, the widow of Candidus Henry.    Lila Norstrom was a student, and she said no one  told them anything, but just go back to school.   Anesta Maria St. Rose Henry said she walks around missing her  husband, along with her children.   And so they are not just statistics; they are broken lives and  families. And 3,000 more will die as we go further into this time, as  3,000 died on that date.   And for those of us who were in this Congress on 9/11, we will never,  never forget.   To the young people today, be reminded of the heroes, firefighters,  police officers, volunteers. Let us never forget, and let us always  remember this bill and these heroes who are here, and that is James  Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and, now, Luis Alvarez.   Madam Speaker, let us never forget, and let us vote.
