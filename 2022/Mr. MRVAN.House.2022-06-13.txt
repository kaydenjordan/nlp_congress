 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support  for the continuation of section 232 steel tariffs for our domestic  manufacturers, our workforce, and our national security.   Indiana's First Congressional District is home to an incredible  foundation of steelworkers and the American steel producers who create  products that are essential not just to the strength of our national  economy but also to our national security.   It is necessary that the American steel industry has a level playing  field in our global economy so that our innovative companies and  skilled workforce can continue to lead the world in manufacturing the  most environmentally friendly and efficiently produced steel.   As co-chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, we have been  actively expressing our strong support for the continuation of section  232 steel tariffs. I look forward to continuing to work with my  colleagues and members of the administration to advocate for the value  of these current tariffs and ensure that we all recognize how unfair  trade and global steel overcapacity negatively impact our Nation's  future.                            ____________________
