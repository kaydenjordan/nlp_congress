 Mr. President, a short tribute and then maybe about an  8- or 9-minute speech that I have.   Today, I want to pay tribute to Iowa State Patrol Sergeant Jim Smith,  who courageously gave his life in the line of duty this past Friday.   Sergeant Smith, a 27-year Iowa State Patrol veteran and a tactical  team leader, put himself in harm's way on behalf of his fellow Iowans  last week, and it cost him everything.   Sergeant Smith is being remembered as a dedicated father, a loyal  public servant, a man of God who left a positive impression on  everybody he encountered.   I mourn for his family, fellow troopers, friends, and the entire  Independence, IA, community at this tragic loss.
