 It's not only a conspiracy theory, it is       completely debunked. You know, I don't know want to be glib       about this matter, but last year, retired former Senator Judd       Gregg wrote a piece in The Hill magazine saying the three       ways or the five ways to impeach oneself. And the third way       was to hire Rudy Giuliani.        And at this point, I am deeply frustrated with what he and       the legal team is doing in repeating that debunked theory to       the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over       and over again. And for clarity here, George, let me just       again repeat that it has no validity. The United States       government reached its conclusion on attributing to Russia       the DNC hack in 2016 before it even communicated it to the       FBI and long before the FBI ever knocked on the door at the       DNC. So a server inside the DNC was not relevant to our       determination to the attribution. It was made upfront and       beforehand. And so while servers can be important in some of       the investigations that followed, it has nothing to do with       the U.S. government's attribution of Russia to the DNC hack.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The theory ``has no validity.'' That is  what he said.   Dr. Hill, too, testified that White House officials, including Mr.  Bossert and former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster spent a lot  of time refuting the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory to President Trump.  Let's hear it.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Daniel GOLDMAN. Now, Dr. Hill, is this a reference to this       debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine interference in the       2016 election that you discussed in your opening statement as       well as with Chairman Schiff?        Fiona HILL. The reference to CrowdStrike and the server,       yes, that's correct.        Daniel GOLDMAN. And it is your understanding that there is       no basis for these allegations, is that correct?        Fiona HILL. That's correct.        Daniel GOLDMAN. Now, isn't it also true that some of       President Trump's most senior advisors had informed him that       this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election was       false?        Fiona HILL. That's correct.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. When she was asked if it is false, she  said: ``That's correct.''   If Vladimir Putin's goals, as Dr. Hill testified, were to deflect  from Russia's systematic interference in our election and to drive a  wedge between the United States and Ukraine, he has succeeded beyond  his wildest dreams. The alternative narrative of Ukrainian interference  in the 2016 election has now been picked up by the President's  defenders and the conservative media. It has muddied the waters  regarding Russia's own interference in our elections--efforts that  remain ongoing, as we have learned this week from reporting that Russia  hacked Burisma.  [[Page S498]]    If there were any doubt about how President Putin feels about the  President's conduct, you need only look to Putin's own words. His  statement on November 20 tells it all. He said:         Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in       U.S. elections. Now they're accusing Ukraine.    That is a short quotation from Putin, but it speaks volumes. Even  though President Trump knew there was no factual basis for the theory  that it was Ukraine that interfered in the 2016 election rather than  Russia and knew that Russia was perpetuating this theory, he still  wanted President Zelensky to pursue the investigation. Why? Because,  while Putin and Russia clearly stood to gain by promoting this  conspiracy theory about Ukraine, so did Donald Trump. He knew it would  be politically helpful to his 2020 election.   An announcement of an investigation by Ukraine would have breathed  new life into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainian election  interference was there in 2016, and it lent it great credibility. It  would have cast doubt on the conclusions of the Intelligence Committee  and Special Counsel Mueller that Russia interfered in the 2016 election  to help President Trump. And it would have helped eliminate a perceived  threat to the legitimacy of Donald Trump's Presidency, that he was only  elected because of the help he received from President Putin.   I now yield to Mr. Schiff.
