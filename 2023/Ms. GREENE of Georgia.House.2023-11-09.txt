 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of  rule IX, I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a  question of the privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Impeaching Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland  Security, for high crimes and misdemeanors.   Resolved, that Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland  Security, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and that the  following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United States  Senate.   Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of  the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of  the United States of America, against Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas,  Secretary of Homeland Security, in maintenance and support of its  impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.   Rather than adhering to an oath he took to defend and secure our  country and uphold the Constitution when he was sworn in as Secretary  of Homeland Security, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas has engaged in a  pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the laws of the United  States as follows:   Article II of the Constitution requires that the executive branch,  which today includes the Secretary of Homeland Security, ensure the  laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the President are  faithfully executed.   The Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367) requires that the  Secretary of Homeland Security ``maintain operational control over the  entire international land and maritime borders of the United States.''   In his willful admittance of border crossers, terrorists, human  traffickers, drugs, and other contraband, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas  has failed to maintain operational control of the border, thereby  violating the Secure Fence Act of 2006.   The Guarantee Clause set forth in Article IV, Section 4 of the  Constitution dictates, ``The United States shall guarantee to every  State in this Union a Republican form of government, and shall protect  each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature,  or of the Executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against  domestic violence.''   The Guarantee Clause clearly dictates that the Federal Government has  the constitutional duty and obligation to protect each of the States  from invasion.    Mr. Speaker, as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security,  Alejandro Mayorkas, has violated his oath to uphold this constitutional  duty by allowing the invasion of approximately 10 million illegals  across our borders. The ongoing invasion at our southern border is a  direct national security threat against the States and against the  citizens therein. Secretary Mayorkas has willfully abandoned his duty  to secure the border and protect States against invasion, thereby  violating Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution.   To wit, since Mayorkas has headed the Department of Homeland  Security, there have been approximately 10 million illegal border  crossers who have invaded our country at our border, this is broken  down between 8 million encounters and approximately 1.8 million known  got-aways who have evaded United States authorities and are roaming the  interior of the United States.   At least 280 people on terrorist watch lists caught while attempting  to cross the border between ports of entry.   Approximately 400,000 unaccompanied illegal children encountered at  the southern border, with at least 85,000 of these children having gone  missing.   At least 1,424 deaths of illegals at the southern border.   Approximately 73,000 special interest aliens arrested at our border,  which are aliens from a nation that promotes terrorist activities,  harbors terrorists, or poses a security threat to the United States.  This is the number arrested at the border, not counting however many of  the 1.8 million known got-aways are special interest aliens.                                time  1100    Approximately 659 special interest aliens from Iran;   Approximately 6,386 special interest aliens from Afghanistan;   Approximately 538 special interest aliens from Syria;   Approximately 3,153 special interest aliens from Egypt;   Approximately 12,624 special interest aliens from Uzbekistan;   Approximately 30,830 special interest aliens from Turkiye;   Approximately 1,613 special interest aliens from Pakistan;   Approximately 164 special interest aliens from Lebanon;   Approximately 185 special interest aliens from Jordan;   Approximately 123 special interest aliens from Iraq; and   Approximately 15,594 special interest aliens from Mauritania.   In fiscal year 2021, Customs and Border Patrol, CBP, seized  approximately 11,200 pounds of fentanyl. In fiscal year 2022, CBP  seized approximately 14,700 pounds of fentanyl. In fiscal year 2023,  CBP has seized a record of approximately 27,000 pounds of fentanyl.  Over 70,000 Americans died from fentanyl in fiscal year 2022. Fentanyl  is now the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and  45. Fentanyl kills approximately 300 Americans a day. This is the  amount of fentanyl that has been seized at the border, yet 300  Americans are still being killed by fentanyl poisoning every day. The  amount of unseized fentanyl has not even been taken into account.   The Constitution also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to  observe the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101. This law  requires Homeland Security to detain inadmissible aliens arriving in  the United States or illegal aliens presently in the United States.  Instead, the Department of Homeland Security, under Secretary Mayorkas,  has practiced catch-and-release policies, whereby illegals are  detained, but then released, without any mechanism to ensure they show  up to court for processing.   By terminating contracts for border wall construction, ending the  migrant protection protocols, remain in Mexico, unlawfully granting  categorical parole, and being complicit in ending title 42, Mayorkas  has made it easier for illegal people and drugs to enter the United  States, endangering American citizens, and has made it harder for CBP  to expel such threats.   Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, in his inability to enforce the law, has  engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with his duties as  a civil officer of the United States.   Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, in his failure to uphold the oath he  took, has, by his actions, lost the trust of citizens of the United  States to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.   Wherefore, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, thus warrants impeachment and  trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any  office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
