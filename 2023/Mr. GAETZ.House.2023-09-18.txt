 Mr. Speaker, I am not voting for a continuing resolution.  I am not voting to continue the failure and the waste and the  corruption and the election interference, and in some cases, the  efforts that could lead this country into world war III.   I oppose the CR authored by my friend and colleague from Florida,  Byron Donalds. The Donalds CR continues the Ukraine policy negotiated  by Speaker Pelosi and Mitch McConnell in the omnibus that conservatives  were against.   The Donalds CR is a permission slip for Jack Smith to continue his  election interference as they are trying to gag the former President of  the United States and the leading contender for the Republican  nomination.   The Donalds CR abandons the principle that it is only a review of  single-subject spending bills that will save this country and allow us  to tweeze through these programs and force these agencies to stand up  and defend their budget.   I say to my friends that we are approaching the days where we are  facing a $2 trillion annual deficits atop a $33 trillion debt. This is  unsustainable.    To just continue things with some facial 8 percent cut over 30 days  that will lead to no programmatic reform is an insult to the principles  we fought for in January.                            ____________________
