 Mr. Speaker, today I share the concerns of my  friends and neighbors in the 23rd District of New York, who have told  me about their struggles just to get by due to this administration's  reckless and disastrous policies.   President Biden's radical agenda has created an energy crisis that  hurts every American. In the last 12 months, over a third of American  households have sacrificed basic necessities so they could pay an  energy bill. Unfortunately, this will only worsen as the Energy  Information Administration projects that families will spend a 25-year  high for their energy this winter.   As Americans deal with the burden of higher energy prices and out-of- control inflation, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act added more  restrictions on Federal oil and gas leasing.   For the good of the American people and the safety of our Nation, we  must act now. Open our domestic oil and gas leases and stop the  burdensome regulations that are an assault on U.S. energy development.   I represent one of the most beautiful areas of America, but one that  gets very cold in the winter. This is a life-or-death issue for those  of limited means in the district I represent.                            ____________________
