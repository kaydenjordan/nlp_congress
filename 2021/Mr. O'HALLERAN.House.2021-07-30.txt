 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Maci  Reed, the 4-year-old girl from Pima, Arizona, who was swept away by  flood waters and tragically passed away this month.   Words cannot express the heartbreak and devastation of losing a  child, and Maci's loss is one that will be felt throughout her  community. I wish the Reed family strength and peace during this  immensely difficult time.   In the wake of this tragedy, I am heartened to see an outpouring of  love and support from countless in the community. I encourage every  Arizonan to continue to show kindness to their neighbors.   I also urge everyone to prioritize safety above all else during the  monsoon season. My wife and I are keeping Maci's family, loved ones,  and the entire Pima community in our prayers as they mourn her passing.                            ____________________
