 Madam Speaker, Tuesday morning, I had  the honor of being in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at the State capitol to  speak about my bill, Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. The House  Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee at the State legislature hosted  a panel to discuss my legislation that would increase milk options in  school lunchrooms across the country.   Later that morning, we gathered in the capitol rotunda with State  lawmakers and representatives of the dairy industry, dairy farm  families from throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to rally in  support of putting whole milk back in our schools.   Madam Speaker, dairy products like milk contain 9 essential nutrients  that can help reduce your risk of high blood pressure, osteoporosis,  and certain cancers. It is helpful with weight management. And whether  it is protein to help build and repair muscle tissue of active bodies  or Vitamin A to help maintain healthy skin, dairy products are a  natural nutrient powerhouse.   I was especially glad to participate in these events, because June is  National Dairy Month.    Proudly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is one of the largest milk- producing States in the Nation, and this annual tradition celebrates  the contributions the dairy industry and dairy farm families have made  to the world. It is my hope that, through this legislation, we will be  able to allow students to select the type of milk that they love best,  including flavored and whole milk.   This legislation is in response to changes made in 2010 to the School  Lunch Program. That year, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act amended the  nutrition standards and mandated that flavored milk must be fat-free.   This law, along with the lowest participation in the program, led to  an alarming decline in milk consumption in schools since 2010.  Declining milk consumption in schools not only impacts students where  they don't get the nutrition that they need, but also the dairy farm  families in rural communities across the Nation.   In addition to the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, I recently  introduced another bill with Congressman   Joe Courtney to expand milk  options for students and reverse the decline of milk consumption in  schools. The School Milk Nutrition Act of 2019 reaffirms and codifies a  recent regulation from the USDA by providing schools with the option to  serve lowfat milk with flavor, and it requires that milk offered is  consistent with the most recent dietary guidelines for Americans.   In November of 2017, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced  regulatory changes for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast  Programs, including a provision that provides schools with the option  to serve lowfat 1 percent flavored milk.                                time  0915    I urge my colleagues to sign on to these bills during National Dairy  Month and allow our students the option of consuming the type of milk  that they love with the nutrition that they need.   I thank the Pennsylvania lawmakers and members of the dairy industry  who stood together in Harrisburg on Tuesday in support of the Whole  Milk for Healthy Kids Act.

[[Page H4998]]    After trauma or a life-threatening event, it is common to have  reactions such as upsetting memories, increased jumpiness, or trouble  sleeping.   PTSD was not always properly understood by the medical professional  and society, but today there are great organizations and resources that  can help both individuals and professionals discover ways to identify  and manage PTSD symptoms and explore effective treatments.   PTSD is especially prevalent for those who have served in the  military, affecting nearly 30 percent of Vietnam veterans and up to 20  percent of veterans who served during the global war on terror. A  nonservicemember may be exposed to a single traumatic event that can  also cause PTSD.   Madam Speaker, as a former rehabilitation therapist, I have seen the  incredible strides that people with injuries can make with access to  appropriate rehabilitation. I applaud all the organizations that raise  awareness about this important issue during the month of June. There is  help and support for those who have PTSD.                            ____________________
