 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3589, the Greg LeMond Congressional Gold Medal, which I've had the  honor of working with Mr. Thompson of California on--a great partner  and advocate in recognizing Greg LeMond's achievements.   Mr. LeMond blazed a trail in American cycling, down which thousands  of American cyclists have followed.   Over a thirteen-year professional career, he raced to three wins at  the Tour de France, one of the most arduous events in endurance sports,  and became the first non-European to be crowned its champion. Even  today, facilities like the Silver Comet Trail in my district owe their  existence in part to Greg's legacy and excitement created by his  achievements.   Since his retirement, Greg and his wife Kathy have devoted thousands  of hours to advocating against doping in sports, promoting athletic  integrity, and serving others. As the lead Republican on the Financial  Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, which  includes anti-doping funding, I am only too familiar with the scourge  of doping in sports. Greg has earned 750 accolades over his career, and  while a Congressional Gold Medal may not rival a yellow jersey, I hope  we are able to provide him this recognition.
