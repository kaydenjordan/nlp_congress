 Mr. Speaker, the truth is that Republicans are  holding the Children's Health Insurance Program, 9 million kids, and  the Community Health Center program, 15 million people, hostage to  wreak even more havoc on our healthcare system and make children and  seniors sicker and undercut Medicare.   Paying for children's health insurance on the backs of seniors is  simply a disgrace. This bill would increase Medicare part D and part B  income-related premiums, charging higher income seniors the entire  cost. This is a structural attack on Medicare, and that is why the  AARP, which supports the Children's Health Insurance Program, opposes  this bill. Imposing a 100 percent premium is unfair because these  seniors already pay more, and it will drive many out of Medicare  altogether, undermining its solvency.   To make matters worse, the Republican income threshold is not based  on current income, but on a 2-year period. So, for example, seniors'  income is volatile, and if you sold your home, you could get a massive  premium penalty, even if you used the money you got from selling your  home to buy in to assisted living and that money wasn't available.   Income-related premiums are simply unnecessary. There are many other  ways to pay for the CHIP program without using Medicare as an ATM.  Democrats have offered reasonable alternatives, but Republicans opposed  all of them.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
