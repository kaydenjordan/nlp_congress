 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Overington  for his long record of legislative service to the State of West  Virginia.   Opting to retire, John won't be representing the people of Berkeley  County, West Virginia, for the first time in 34 years when the House of  Delegates convenes in Charleston next month.   John and I served together in the legislature for decades in the  eighties and early nineties. I came to know John as someone who has  always followed his conservative principles, even when it wasn't in  vogue.   During the 34 years he served in the minority, many of those votes  were lonely fights, but he never swayed from his staunch, unwavering  commitment to conservative principles.   After the 2014 election, the Republicans took the majority in West  Virginia Legislature for the first time in 84 years, and his  conservative values helped dictate a new agenda. He chaired the  Industry and Labor Committee and served as speaker pro tem.  [[Page H10514]]    I wish the best to John and his wife, JoAnn, as he retires from this  legislative service. Serving as a citizen-legislator can often be a  thankless task. The people of West Virginia owe him a debt of gratitude  for his decades of service and his dedication to West Virginia.                            ____________________
