 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining  votes be 10 minutes in length.    Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for May 2019. The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18. This information is  necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether  budgetary points of order lie against pending legislation.  [[Page S3045]]  The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the Congressional  Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of  the Congressional Budget Act, CBA.   This is my fourth scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can  be found in the Congressional Record for April 10, 2019. The  information included in this report is current through May 20, 2019.   Since my last filing, Congress has cleared only one measure, S. 1436,  a bill to make technical corrections to the computation of average pay  under Public Law 110-279, with significant budgetary effects. This bill  made changes to the calculation of retirement benefits for certain  employees who staff the dining services for the U.S. Senate. Those  services were privatized in 2008.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared tables A-C.   Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the fiscal year 2019 enforceable levels filing required by BBA18.  This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant  to section 302 of the CBA. Over the current 10-year enforceable window,  authorizing committees have increased outlays by a combined $3.4  billion. For this reporting period, 9 of the 16 authorizing committees  are not in compliance with their allocations. As a result of passage of  S. 1436, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration is now in  violation of its allocation for both budget authority and outlays over  the fiscal year 2019-2028 period.   Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for fiscal year 2019, displayed in this table, show that the  Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for the  current fiscal year. Those limits for regular discretionary spending  are $647 billion for accounts in the defense category and $597 billion  for accounts in the nondefense category of spending.   The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order  limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations  bills, CHIMPs. Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for  fiscal year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has enacted $15  billion worth of full-year CHIMPs for this fiscal year.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates that current-law levels are $2.9  billion above and $3.3 billion below enforceable levels for budget  authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $426 million below  the level assumed in the budget resolution. Further, Social Security  revenues are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2019, while Social  Security outlays are $4 million above assumed levels for the budget  year.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases  in fiscal year 2019 of $1,957 million, $427 million revenue loss,  $1,530 million outlay increase; over the fiscal year 2018-2023 period  of $3,373 million, $894 million revenue loss, $2,479 million outlay  increase; and over the fiscal year 2018-2028 period of $443 million,  $634 million revenue loss, $191 million outlay decrease.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  7, 2018. Since my last report, no new budgetary points of order were  raised.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2019    2019-2023  2019-2028 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry     Budget Authority....................     2,414      4,249      3,123     Outlays.............................     1,401      1,797         70 Armed Services     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs     Budget Authority....................        21        285        382     Outlays.............................        20        285        382 Commerce, Science, and Transportation     Budget Authority....................        41         77         91     Outlays.............................        11         74         90 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority....................         0        -10        -24     Outlays.............................         0        -10        -24 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority....................         2          4       -333     Outlays.............................         2          4       -333 Finance     Budget Authority....................       378      1,128       -889     Outlays.............................       159      1,120       -892 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority....................         0         -5        -20     Outlays.............................         0         -5        -20 Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          2          4     Outlays.............................        43         48         49 Judiciary     Budget Authority....................        13        209        497     Outlays.............................        13        205        492 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions     Budget Authority....................         0        -36        -84     Outlays.............................         0        -36        -84 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority....................         0          0          1     Outlays.............................         0          0          1 Intelligence     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority....................         4          3       -729     Outlays.............................     4,402      4,400      3,668 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Small Business     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0                                          -------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority................     2,873      5,906      2,019         Outlays.........................     6,051      7,882      3,399 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   TABLE B.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY                            APPROPRIATIONS \1\                [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       2019                                        ---------------------------------                                           Security \2\   Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........          647,000          597,000             Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee   Agriculture, Rural Development, and                   0           23,042  Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2019 budget and is       current through May 20, 2019. This report is submitted under       section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional       Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May       7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123).        Since our last letter dated April 10, 2019, the Congress       has not cleared any legislation for the President's signature       that affects budget authority, outlays, or revenues in fiscal       year 2019.            Sincerely,                                                     Mark P. Hadley                                        (For Keith Hall, Director).        Enclosure.

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do   not include $771 million in budget authority, and $767 million in estimated outlays. \c.\ For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a   result, current level does not include those items. \d.\ The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-5), as amended, extended several immigration programs   through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated   budgetary effects of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and   are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116-6 shown in the ``Appropriation Legislation'' portion of this   report. In addition, division H of P.L. 116-6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal   year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116-6, and at the direction of the   Senate Committee on the Budget, the budgetary effects of extending those immigration programs for the   remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the   ``Authorizing Legislation'' portion of this report. \e.\ Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget   publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first   published in the Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair   of the Senate Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original Aggregates Printed on May 7, 2018:..................        3,547,094        3,508,052        2,590,496 Revisions:     Pursuant to sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional               921                0                0      Budget Act of 1974......................................
