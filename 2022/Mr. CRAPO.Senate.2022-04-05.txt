 Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator    and Representative Russ Fulcher, I recognize the life of an  extraordinary Idahoan, Lane R. Williams, who passed away in February.  Lane was the former owner of Midvale Telephone Exchange and is  remembered for his commitment to advancing opportunities for others.  This includes his role in keeping the Weiser area north to McCall  connected through his telephone company.   His obituary reads, ``Lane left behind a legacy of championing the  underdog and empowering people by creating possibilities and  opportunities. He did this in part by being an educator of many,  including years spent working with migrant workers as a teacher. He  always believed that education was the key to empowerment.'' In 1977,  Lane took over Midvale Telephone Exchange from his parents and, with  his wife Mary Gaile, began expanding service to five Idaho communities  and to the remote Cascabel community in southern Arizona before  building four additional areas throughout Arizona. This expansion is  credited with enabling more than 4,000 people in rural areas to have  internet and phone service and employing over 45 people. In 2008, Lane  created an employee stock ownership plan, ESOP, and sold the company to  his employees to help ensure their continued employment and security in  retirement.   Lane was one of those industrious and inspiring people who figure out  ways to help and encourage improvements in their community, and do  [[Page S1977]]  them. Some years after his beloved wife Mary Gaile passed, he met his  wife Elsa Freeman, who again enlightened his life with love and  companionship. The two bought and restored the Midvale Mercantile. The  project's benefits to the community include, providing jobs, a local  grocery source, community kitchen, community garden, and lodging for  travelers. They also started Midvale Marketplace, Inc., a nonprofit  focused on identifying community needs; creating service, education,  and employment opportunities; and developing and supporting sustainable  economic growth. Lane was also instrumental in developing the Weiser  River Trail, and worked hard to maintain and improve the park and  trail.   As we recognize the good Lane Williams did for his treasured  community of Midvale and far beyond, we extend our deep condolences to  Lane's friends and loved ones, including his wife Elsa Freeman,  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. His love, compassion,  and open-heartedness will endure in the many lives he touched during  his life well lived.                            ____________________     Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator  Jim Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ  Fulcher, we honor Idaho's community colleges during this Community  College Month.   In order to meet the needs of a competitive job market, the  importance of providing Idahoans with the opportunity to enhance their  education has grown tremendously. Idaho's four community colleges are a  central part of preparing young people and adults for postsecondary  education, successful careers, and productive lives.   Our community colleges not only link students to Idaho's 4-year  institutions through cooperative agreements, but also provide dual  enrollment opportunities for students pursuing advanced learning while  in high school through partnerships with the K-12 sector. Through  collaboration with Idaho's business community, Idaho's community  colleges also help grow the skillset necessary to prepare students for  Idaho's workforce.   The recognition of April as Community College Month by the American  Association of Community Colleges and the Association of Community  College Trustees provides an opportunity to spotlight the valued role  of Idaho's community colleges in enhancing Idahoans' quality of life  and contributing to Idaho's economic success. We commend Idaho's  community colleges and the educators who inform and inspire through  these local assets for being a conduit for opportunities for so many  Idahoans.                            ____________________
