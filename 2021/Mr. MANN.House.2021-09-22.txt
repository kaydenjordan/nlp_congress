 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the priorities of  the Biden administration because they are not good for the American  people.   What are the administration's priorities as outlined by the  infrastructure package? It is not roads, bridges, highways, rail, and  waterways. Instead, their infrastructure plan is a Trojan horse for a  leftist wish list that will jam progressive policies like the Green New  Deal through this Congress at the expense of actual infrastructure.  Despite promises that this plan would be budget neutral, the CBO has  estimated it will increase our national deficit by $256 billion.   What are the administration's priorities as outlined in the  reconciliation bill? It is not fairness, but partisanship. Senator  Bernie Sanders said that under this budget no middle-income family  would pay more in taxes. That is not true. The reconciliation bill  includes damaging tax increases, falling largely on the shoulders of  middle-income families, small businesses, and family farms. This bill  would be the largest tax-and-spend measure in America's history and  would increase public debt by more than $4.16 trillion. It would also  allow the Federal Government to intervene even more in our daily lives  and kill countless jobs.   What are the administration's policies regarding ag policy? It is not  supporting the people who feed, fuel, and clothe all of us, but  eliminating their protections and taxing them out of their land. I  proposed an amendment on this very issue at the House Agriculture  Committee earlier this month that was not even considered by Democrat  leadership. I don't want to see farmers and ranchers taxed on their  generational property over and over again, which will destroy their  livelihoods. This administration demands more taxes, and their party  does what it often does and hammers rural America's middle class.  Farmers in my district understand perfectly well that the majority  party doesn't care about the issues they face while they work  tirelessly to keep the breadbasket of our Nation full.   Just yesterday, I spent 2 hours in the Ag Committee marking up a  resolution to retroactively designate July 2021 as National Blueberry  Month. Now, I like blueberries as much as the next guy, but I stand  before you in disbelief that this committee would rather name a portion  of the past after a berry than protect the future of farmers in this  country. These are backward priorities on full display.                          Abortion Bill is Horrible     Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition for H.R.  3755, which would federally legalize abortions on demand up until  birth.   This bill isn't just morally reprehensible. It also prohibits States  from passing their own laws acknowledging the humanity of unborn  children. It is a wicked path to accomplish a wicked end. This bill  would override both Federal and State laws adopted before and even  after its enactment. This year, 48 States have introduced a combined  289 pro-life bills, 89 of which have been signed into law. H.R. 3755  does not reflect the voice of the American people on the issue of  abortion. It reflects the voice of the abortion lobby.   This bill abolishes any law that regulates abortion in any way,  including laws that prevent sex-selection abortion and abortions based  on a Down syndrome diagnosis. By 12 weeks of age, babies have fully  formed arms, hands, fingers, feet, and toes and a functional  circulatory system and liver, and the capacity to experience  [[Page H4874]]  pain. All of this, astonishingly, at a weight of one ounce and a length  of 4 inches. I believe that life begins at conception. I support  adoptions, foster care, and crisis pregnancy centers. God knits every  one of us together in our mother's wombs. Life is a miracle, and I  believe that the right to it extends to the unborn in this country.  That is why I strongly oppose this horrible bill.                        Crisis at the Southern Border     Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention once again to  the disastrous situation that President Biden has created at our  southern border.   The first priority of any administration must be to protect the  homeland and keep Americans safe. We have brave Border Patrol agents  putting themselves in harm's way every day doing just that; and,  meanwhile, their calls for a complete southern border security system  are falling on deaf ears in Washington. They know that it would make  their jobs easier and our country safer, and the funds are already  appropriated. Why, then, is the administration forcing these agents,  who deserve our unwavering support, to do their jobs with anything less  than the most comprehensive technology available?   Across the globe from our southern border lies Afghanistan, where  there exists yet another disastrous situation President Biden created.  Make no mistake, the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is not an  isolated problem in a land far, far away. The Taliban could  redistribute their terrorists across the world in a matter of days, and  our southern border is about as secure as a welcome mat, inviting  terrorists who hate America to come and set up shop. President Biden  didn't just torpedo the stability of Afghanistan last month, he also  put Americans in danger, which highlights yet another need to address  the southern border crisis immediately.                            ____________________
