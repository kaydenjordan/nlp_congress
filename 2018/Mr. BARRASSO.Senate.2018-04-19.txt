 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the passage of  time and a particularly significant event in this Nation's history. In  a few short days, Tribal leadership, historians, community leaders, and  the public will gather at the Fort Laramie National Historic Site in  Wyoming to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the signing of the 1868  Treaty of Fort Laramie. As it did in the years preceding the signing of  the treaty, the area around Fort Laramie, WY, will again serve as a  place where cultures, minds, and governments meet.   Over its history, the Fort Laramie area was home to Tribes of the  Great Plains, represented a waypoint for emigrants as they traveled  West, and became an economic center as trade routes were established.  As conflict among Indian and non-Indian groups grew, Fort Laramie  became a military post to quell disputes.   History is marred by the years-long conflicts with Tribal  communities. The 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie and others like it were  intended to bring peace to whole regions of peoples. It took nearly 7  months to negotiate the contents of the treaty and gather signatories.  Among the more than 200 signatories were Tribal leaders, U.S.  Government officials, and military leaders. It is important to  recognize and remember those who signed in the hope that the treaty  would bring resolution to ongoing conflicts. Equally, we should reflect  on those who did not sign, as that omission is an important part of  this history.   Despite the signing of the treaty, conflict persisted. Today we must  continue to work to address the inequities that remain across Indian  Country. As those signatories of the treaty knew in 1868, treaties and  the trust responsibilities to which the U.S. Government committed  continue to shape modern relationships with the sovereign Tribes. True  government-to-government relationships and respect for Tribal  sovereignty are at the heart of Congress's responsibilities in helping  to ensure a brighter future for Tribal communities.   As they gather at Fort Laramie at the end of April, Tribes will share  their histories and cultures. Among the exchange of traditional  prayers, songs, and dances, Tribes will also lead discussions about the  future of Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights.   In the joint resolution passed during this year's session, the  Wyoming State Legislature appropriately recognized that `` . . . the  legacy of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie has had an impact in numerous  ways on the lives of Tribal members of Tribes party to the Treaty from  generation to generation since the signing. . . .''   Recognizing the 150th anniversary of the signing of the treaty  requires reflection and introspection, but should also inspire hope for  the future. The upcoming events at Fort Laramie National Historic Site  offer a unique educational opportunity to highlight the vibrant Tribal  cultures that have also endured for generations.   I am proud to recognize this important anniversary and reflect on the  150 years since the signing of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Historic  places and the documents inspired by a confluence of values and ideas  should not be forgotten. We must remember the events that led to the  signing of the treaty, and those that followed, and continue the  important work to develop strong relationships and be good partners  with sovereign Tribal nations.                            ____________________
