 Mr. Speaker, it is amazing how the Republicans can  make political drama appear smaller than life: major questions with  extremists are reduced to parody and political theater.   We may have averted catastrophe, but it doesn't mean there was not a  real cost to America. We should commit to never again allow such  political hostage taking. Instead, lay the foundation for using the  clear language of the 14th Amendment to avoid the debt ceiling  altogether.   We should collect billions of dollars already payable from some of  the wealthiest individuals and corporations. It would be a strong  signal about the fairness of our tax system.   It is ironic that Republicans are worried about pressing rich people  for taxes they already owe, but would subject poor people to more  harassment and meaningless paperwork.   We should instead concentrate on changing policies to reduce the  deficit. If there will be time limits on benefits, maybe we could start  with 20,000 rich farmers who got a million dollars a year or more for  37 consecutive years.   If we act in good faith, it shouldn't be so hard, and America will be  the better.
