 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Don Young Coast  Guard Authorization Act of 2022.   Congressman Young brought a distinct candor and a character to  Congress. This body and our country are better off thanks to his  service, and he will be dearly missed. I am proud to note that this  legislation authorizes $120 million for the construction of new  barracks at the United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May in  New Jersey.   The barracks project will expand opportunities for women to serve in  the Coast Guard as well as expand the training center's recruitment  capacity by 25 percent. The United States must project strength, and  this legislation will ensure that the United States is ready to address  the challenges presented by adversaries such as Russia and China.
