 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Ben Weaver, owner of SERVPRO, a damage restoration company in  Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, Cambria County, that specializes in fire,  water, and mold remediation.   Ben is an Army National Guard veteran, who was recently named the  Western Pennsylvania Veteran-Owned Small Business Person of the Year by  the Small Business Administration.   I was pleased to be back in Ebensburg recently to present a  commendation for this award. What started out as Ben in one truck as  his mobile office, has become a growing company of 22 employees, a  fleet of 20 trucks, and a 10,000-square-foot office building in  Ebensburg, with a second office opening soon in Indiana, Pennsylvania.   Ben was able to launch his business, thanks to the help of an SBA- backed 7(a) loan but attributes his success to being active in his  community. Ben mentioned that the community is like a family. He said,  ``in the end, people really want to do business with people they know-- their extended family.''   Madam Speaker, I applaud Ben's dedication. He is certainly deserving  of this award.                            ____________________
