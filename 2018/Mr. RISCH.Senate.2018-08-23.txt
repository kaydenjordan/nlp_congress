 Mr. President, my home State of Idaho is known for  its beautiful landscapes, outdoor recreation, and protected wilderness.  These natural wonders are enjoyed by native Idahoans and Americans from  across the country. Today I would like to recognize an innovative small  business that contributes to allowing further exploration of the  beautiful, remote areas of our Nation. As chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my distinct  pleasure to recognize SJX Jet Boats, Inc., as the Small Business of the  Month for August 2018. SJX Jet Boat, Inc.'s commitment to the quality  and performance of its shallow-water aluminum jet boat exemplifies  Idaho's entrepreneurial spirit and appreciation for the outdoors.   After several years of working in the aluminum jet boat building  field, SJX Jet Boats owner, Steve Stajkowski, created a concept for a  boat that could handle remote, shallow waters while maintaining a  strong structural design and functionality. While on a hunting trip in  Alaska, Stajkowski saw the need for a shallow-water boat that could  navigate the small bodies of water found throughout the State. Inspired  by the concept of combining high-speed performance with the offroading  aspects of boating, the SJX boat design began to take shape. He began  work on the very first inboard tunnel hull in 1998. Less than 10 years  later, after years of experimenting with many different designs, Steve  started SJX Jet Boats, Inc., in 2007. Located in Orofino, ID, SJX Jet  Boats is  [[Page S5913]]  located in the midst of shallow bodies of water and what is known as  the steelhead fishing capital of the world.   Whether for a hunter, fisherman, or an adventurist, SJX Jet Boats,  Inc., have honed their design through continuous research and  development in order to provide the best possible product. One of the  primary factors of boat design is the boat's durability. The make of an  SJX Jet Boat consists of a continuous weld, which prevents cracks and  creates a solid foundation. Because of this weld, along with the  innovative inboard tunnel hull, these boats are able to traverse water  as shallow as 4 inches. This inboard tunnel allows the jet to be  elevated off of the surface of the boat; therefore, any debris  potentially hitting the bottom of the boat is unable to reach the jet  itself. Testing of any new features for the boat are carried out by  Stajkowski himself, as a means of ensuring that new products will be  crafted to exceed customer expectations.   In addition to sport and leisure, the benefits of SJX Jet boats  extend beyond the recreational user. SJX Jet boats are customizable for  policing, search and rescue, fire, and other first responder  operations. A number of communities within our Nation are adjacent to  shallow waterways, streams, and rivers, and in these places, SJX Jet  Boats are preferred by some emergency organizations since they allow  for easier access to disaster victims in times of emergency. SJX Jet  Boats have repeatedly proven to be capable of reaching these stranded  residents. During a search and rescue mission during a flood in the  Philippines, approximately 1,200 individuals were rescued due to the  jet boat's capability to maneuver through large amounts of debris.  Thanks to the unique innovation of SJX Jet Boats, rescue missions like  these are much easier to carry out.   The State of Idaho is proud to be home to small businesses like SJX  Jet Boats. The ability of an SJX Jet Boat to operate in such remote  locations is an innovative feat that makes these boats truly one of a  kind. I would like to congratulate Steve Stajkowski and all of the  employees at SJX Jet Boats, Inc., for being named the Small Business of  the Month for August 2018. I look forward to watching your continued  growth and success.                            ____________________
