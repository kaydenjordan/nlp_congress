 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on the House floor to  congratulate the men's national soccer team on their win this past week  against Iran at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.   After missing out on the 2018 World Cup, the United States returned  this year for the first time in 8 years.   With draws against Wales and England to start the group stage, the  U.S. needed a crucial win against Iran to advance to the knockout  stage. The U.S. team delivered a 1-0 victory with a stellar goal by  Christian Pulisic and a staunch defensive performance from goalie Matt  Turner.   I know I join with my colleagues here in the U.S. House of  Representatives and fans across the country in congratulating the men's  national soccer team.   Throughout the World Cup, the team has shown class, respect, grit,  and patriotism, inspiring a new generation of fans and youth across the  country. Coach Gregg Berhalter and the entire team have made our  country so proud. I look forward to cheering them on tomorrow as they  face the Netherlands.   Go U.S.A. Beat the Dutch.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Wenstrup and Mr. Davis for  shepherding through this legislation.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 8876, the Jackie Walorski Maternal  and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act of 2022.   The MIECHV program has over 2,700 participants and has conducted over  17,000 home visits in my home State of Illinois, including in Peoria  and McLean Counties and throughout my district.   I understand how important it is to support families, women, and  children with evidence-based services to mitigate maternal and infant  mortality risk factors and improve overall health outcomes,  particularly in rural and underserved communities.   Evidence-based programs, including home visits by nurses, social  workers, or early childhood professionals, have improved maternal and  newborn health services that mothers and infants can count on to help  set them up for success in the future.   I also acknowledge and take a moment to recognize Congresswoman  Jackie Walorski, the former ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Worker and Family Support. She was a wonderful colleague and friend who  is deeply missed every day in this body. Passing this legislation today  is a recognition of Jackie's tireless advocacy for the renewal of  MIECHV and a testament to her remarkable legacy.   We honor her today by passing this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill and everybody in this body to honor  Jackie.
