 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2704, the  Improving VA Accountability to Prevent Sexual Harassment and  Discrimination Act.   I was proud to introduce this legislation alongside Congressman Chris  Pappas and Senator Maggie Hassan, as well as my fellow Iowan, Senator  Joni Ernst, who is a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor  herself.   Last year, a Government Accountability Office report exposed  disturbing failures at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to  handle sexual harassment and discrimination at the agency properly. The  report also revealed that between 18 and 27 percent of VA employees  experienced some form of sexual harassment at work between 2014 and  2016.   This is completely unacceptable.   This bipartisan, bicameral bill will improve the way sexual  harassment is  [[Page H2362]]  handled at the VA and will crack down on instances of harassment and  discrimination within the Department.   Nobody should feel unsafe at work. The care VA employees provide for  our veterans is absolutely critical, but they cannot provide that best  care, the care our veterans deserve, if they are suffering in a hostile  work environment.   Not only is this an accountability and workplace safety issue, it is  a disservice to our veterans who rely on the VA for high-quality care,  and a disservice to taxpayers who fund the Department.   We can do better, and this legislation will ensure that those who  serve our veterans feel safe at work so they can do their jobs  effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan legislation.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 2441,  the Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act.   I want to start off by thanking my colleague, Congresswoman Cindy  Axne, for introducing this legislation and for her leadership. I was  proud to join the gentlewoman and our entire Iowa delegation, as has  already been mentioned, to introduce this very important bipartisan  bill for our veterans.   Sergeant Ketchum from Davenport served our country honorably overseas  in both Iraq and Afghanistan. But let's be real: Not every war wound is  visible.   Many veterans struggle when they come home with serious mental health  challenges. When Sergeant Ketchum returned home from his tours, he  battled again; this time with post-traumatic stress disorder.   Sergeant Ketchum sought help at the Iowa City VA hospital but was  turned away. Shortly after, he did take his own life.   No veteran should be denied the help and the care that they need  after dedicating their lives to serving our country. No veteran should  ever be turned away like Sergeant Ketchum was.   Unfortunately, veterans who live in rural areas face increased  challenges and additional barriers to accessing the treatment that they  need.   Our legislation, named in honor of Sergeant Ketchum, will improve  access to mental health services for veterans in rural areas. Our  veterans put their lives on the line every day to protect our freedoms,  and we have a duty to ensure that they can receive high-quality  treatment once they return home from service.   We have a duty to ensure that our veterans know they aren't alone and  that we have their backs, regardless of where they live.   I am proud to work alongside my colleagues in Iowa to improve access  to mental health services for veterans in rural areas and to help  ensure that no veteran is denied the care that they deserve.   I urge all of our colleagues to support the Sgt. Ketchum Rural  Veterans Mental Health Act. Vote ``yes'' in honor of Sergeant Ketchum  and the thousands of veterans like him who need and deserve our  support.                                time  1545
