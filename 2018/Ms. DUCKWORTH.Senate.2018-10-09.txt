 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life  of Richard Gray.   Richard, 89, died in his sleep on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at his  Gold Coast home in Chicago.   Richard was the dean of Chicago art dealers, a collector, and  benefactor whose wide-ranging intellect, taste, and support helped many  of the city's most celebrated cultural institutions.   Richard prevailed in the bidding wars that brought Sue, the famed T.  rex, to the Field Museum, and he helped preserve the Farnsworth House,  the architectural jewel in Plano, IL, designed by Ludwig Mies van der  Rohe.   He dealt in works by Magdalena Abakanowicz, Willem de Kooning, David  Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Louise Nevelson, Picasso, Jackson Pollock,  and Mark Rothko. Today, the Richard Gray Gallery which he opened in  1963, operates from 875 N. Michigan and Manhattan. The gallery has a  warehouse on West Carroll Avenue in Chicago and also deals in Old  Masters.   He and his wife, the former Mary Kay Lackritz, were supporters of the  Chicago Humanities Festival, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Arts  Club of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Goodman Theatre,  WFMT, WTTW, and the Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago,  among other institutions.   He was born at Woodlawn Hospital, the middle of seven kids of Pearl  and Edward Gray. His father, a native of Siedliszcze, Poland, came to  America alone as a teenager and helped to start a business in  Providence, RI, cleaning buildings in that then-sooty city, eventually  coming to Chicago.   Richard studied architecture at the University of Illinois Urbana- Champaign.   Richard is survived by his wife Mary, his son Paul and his wife  Dedrea, his daughter Jennifer, his son Harry, brothers Robert and  Melvin, five grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.   Richard was a lover of the arts and a dear friend. I am proud to  stand here today to honor his legacy.                            ____________________
