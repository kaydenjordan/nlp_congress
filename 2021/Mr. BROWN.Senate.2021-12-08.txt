 Madam President, over the past couple of years, Ohioans  and Americans around the country have worked and sacrificed to get our  country through this pandemic. Among those who have risen to meet this  historic moment are the dedicated public servants on our Senate staff.  These patriots have given their all over these last 20 months to  protect Ohioans' health, to put money in people's pockets, to keep a  roof over people's heads, and to help our State and our country  overcome this health and economic crisis.   I would not have been able to do the vital work we have done in the  Senate without their expertise and dedication and talent, and we would  not be where we are today as a country--with rising wages, record job  growth, and lifesaving vaccines--without them. This holiday season, I  ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking these dedicated  professionals for their service to our country:         Ben Ashman; Mohammad Aslami; Blair Austin; Brian Ayers;       Diana Baron; Shilesha Bamberg; Sarah Benzing; Emily Blaydes;       Gabriel Bitol; Chad Bolt; Alyssa Brockington; Alea Brown;       Homer Carlisle; Dani Carlson; Megan Cheney; Min Cheng; Emily       Chipps; William Clayton; Beth Clodfelter; Beth Cooper; Alan       Cox; J.
