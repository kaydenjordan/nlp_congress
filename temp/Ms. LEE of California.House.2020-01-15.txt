 Mr. Speaker, first, I thank my colleague, who  is a bold and brilliant progressive here, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.  I thank her for organizing this Special Order tonight, but I also thank  her for her leadership and for hitting the ground running in the House  of Representatives. It has been quite remarkable to work with her and  to see how she understands the issues around peace and justice, that  peace and justice go together.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Schakowsky for her speech tonight  and for her presentation, for laying out the chronology and historical  record for how we got here and how we, unfortunately, were misled by  the lies of the Bush administration into this tragic, endless war. I  thank her very much for her leadership, for her friendship, and for  staying the course because this has been, what, 19 years now? We have  to repeal this authorization.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say to Representatives Pramila Jayapal and  Mark Pocan, who co-chair our Progressive Caucus, their tireless  leadership in the Progressive Caucus has really helped with making sure  that the public understands all the issues that we are dealing with as  it relates to global peace and security.   I chair the Progressive Caucus' Global Peace and Security Task Force,  and we are very clear on why we must stop a possible catastrophic war  with Iran and reassert our constitutional duty over matters of war and  peace.   Mr. Speaker, I invite all of my colleagues and the rest of the CPC to  support the repeal of the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of  Military Force. I am pleased that the House leadership has agreed to  bring my repeal of the 2002 AUMF to the floor in 2 weeks, and I  encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor that  legislation.   First, with regard to the 2001 authorization, 19 years ago, Congress  passed a 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, AUMF. It was  supposedly against Afghanistan, as it relates to the horrific events of  9/11.                                time  1745    It was a blank check, however, for endless war. It was a 60-word  authorization. It was totally open-ended.   Now we have a Congress where--or at least the House--less than 25  percent of current Members actually voted on that authorization, which,  of course, I adamantly opposed.   This authorization gives any President authority to wage limitless  war at any time, anywhere, for any reason, in perpetuity. According to  the Congressional Research Service, the AUMF has been used as a blank  check by three administrations to justify military force more than 40  times in 18 countries.   Mr. Speaker, I include the CRS report in the Record.        [From the Congressional Research Service, February 16, 2018]                                 Memorandum       Subject: Presidential References to the 2001 Authorization           for Use of Military Force in Publicly Available Executive           Actions and Reports to Congress.      From: Matthew Weed, Specialist in Foreign Policy Legislation,           7-4589.        This memorandum was prepared to enable distribution to more       than one congressional office.        This memorandum sets out information and analysis       concerning presidential references in public official       notifications and records to the Authorization for Use of       Military Force (2001 AUMF; Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C.       Sec. 1541 note), enacted in response to the September 11,       2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, in relation to       military and other action. It contains very brief discussions       of the relevant provisions of the 2001 AUMF, and the uses of       U.S. armed forces connected with 2001 AUMF authority, as well       as excerpted language and other information from the       notifications.        Use of Military Force Authorization Language in the 2001 AUMF         Section 2(a) of the 2001 AUMF authorizes the use of force       in response to the September 11 attacks:        Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.         (a) In General.--That the President is authorized to use       all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,       organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,       committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on       September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or       persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international       terrorism against the United States by such nations,       organizations or persons.        The 2001 AUMF does not include a specified congressional       reporting requirement, but states that the authorization is       not intended to supersede any requirement of the War Powers       Resolution, which does require congressional reporting for       initial and continuing deployments of U.S. armed forces into       imminent or ongoing hostilities.         Executive Branch Policy Concerning Utilization of 2001 AUMF                               Authorization         Prior to the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic       State that began in summer 2014, executive branch officials       made statements that included certain interpretations       concerning the 2001 AUMF, including the following:        The 2001 AUMF is primarily an authorization to enter into       and prosecute an armed conflict against Al Qaeda and the       Taliban in Afghanistan.        The 2001 AUMF authorizes the President to use military       force against Al Qaeda and the Taliban outside Afghanistan,       but such uses of force must meet a higher standard of threat       to the United States and must use limited, precise methods       against specific individual targets rather than general       military action against enemy forces.        Because the 2001 AUMF authorizes U.S. involvement in an       international armed conflict, the international law of armed       conflict informs the authority within the 2001 AUMF. This law       permits the use of military force against forces associated       with Al Qaeda and the Taliban as co-belligerents; such forces       must be operating in some sort of coordination and       cooperation with Al Qaeda and/or the Taliban, not just share       similar goals, objectives, or ideologies.        This interpretation of the scope of 2001 AUMF authority can       be seen to fit within the overall framework of presidential       power to use military force against those posing a threat to       U.S. national security and U.S. interests. In situations       where the 2001 AUMF or other relevant legislation does not       seem to authorize a given use of military force or related       activity, the executive branch will determine whether the       President's Article II powers as Commander in Chief and Chief       Executive, as interpreted by the executive branch itself,       might authorize such actions. In this way, similar U.S.       military action to meet U.S. counterterrorism objectives       might be interpreted to fall under different authorities, of       which the 2001 AUMF is just one, albeit important, example.        December 2016 Legal Framework Report on Use of Military Force         President Obama issued a report in December 2016 entitled,       ``Report on the Legal and Policy Frameworks Guiding the       United States' Use of Military Force, and Related National       Security Operations.'' Among other matters, the Report deals       with the legal justification for the United States' ongoing       use of military force against the Islamic State, which       according to the Report has taken place in the form of       airstrikes, military advising and training of Iraqi security       forces and Syrian rebel groups, and military activities of       U.S. special operations forces in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. The       Report asserts that such use of force is authorized by the       2001 AUMF, arguing certain factors as determinative:        1. The 2001 AUMF authorizes the President to use military       force ``in order to prevent any future acts of international       terrorism against the United States by such nations,       organizations, or persons'' who perpetrated or harbored those       who perpetrated the September 11, 2001 terror attacks against       the United States.  [[Page H279]]             2. Al Qaeda was identified as the primary organization       responsible for the September 11, 2001 attacks.        3. Organized, armed groups that are co-belligerent with Al       Qaeda against the United States are targetable under the 2001       AUMF pursuant to the law of international armed conflicts as       ``associated forces.''        4. With specific regard to the Islamic State, the United       States determined in 2004 that Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), the       predecessor organization of the Islamic State, was either       part of Al Qaeda itself or an associated force in 2004 and       has used force against the group under 2001 AUMF authority       since that time, including after AQI changed its name to the       Islamic State (or ISIL or ISIS).        5. The fact that the Islamic State has asserted a split       between itself and Al Qaeda does not divest the President of       his previous authority to use force against the Islamic       State, as the Islamic State's conflict with the United States       and its allies has continued.        6. Congress has supported military action against the       Islamic State by specifically funding the military campaign       and providing authority to assist groups fighting the Islamic       State in Iraq and Syria.     Records of Executive Actions and Presidential Reporting to Congress                         Referencing the 2001 AUMF         Since 2001, Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and       Donald Trump have referenced in public notifications the 2001       AUMF in connection with initiating or continuing certain       military or related actions (including non-lethal military       activities such as detentions and military trials), as U.S.       armed forces continue to counter Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and       violent extremist and terrorist groups designated as       associated with those two organizations. The notifications       reference both statutory and constitutional authority for the       President to take such action, as well as statutory       provisions requiring congressional notification, including       reference to provisions in the 2001 AUMF. As will be       discussed in detail below, the manner in which Presidents       have presented information on military deployments and       actions in these notifications, the constitutional and       statutory authority for such actions, and the reporting       requirements for such actions, have changed over time, making       it difficult to aggregate such information.     Notifications of Deploying U.S. Armed Forces and/or Using Military                 Force Involving Reference to the 2001 AUMF         Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump have provided formal       notifications of military deployments and/or action to       Congress at various times since enactment of the 2001 AUMF,       referring to that authorization to various degrees and ends.       While presidential reports to Congress concerning the use of       military force and other activities undertaken by the U.S.       armed forces initially provided a fairly simple and       straightforward discussion of actions and related       authorities, over time these reports became increasingly       detailed, complicated, and difficult to decipher with regard       to determining applicable presidential authority. At all       times, both Presidents have relied primarily on their       constitutional Article II powers as Commander in Chief and       Chief Executive. In many instances, reference to 2001 AUMF       authority has been supplementary and indirect; in only a few       cases has a President relied directly on 2001 AUMF authority       as justification for a military operation, deployment, or       other action.        Below are provided several tables of information concerning       presidential notifications and records of other executive       action referencing the 2001 AUMF. Each table provides:        a date of each notification or record;        the relevant military activity, location, and/or purpose of       such activities, as available;        the constitutional and statutory authority provided in the       notification or record as provided; and        the reference to applicable reporting requirements       precipitating each respective notification or record.        For Tables 1-8, each set out in its own section with       accompanying analysis, each table includes a group of       notifications that are similar in composition and content.       Each subsequent table and section, therefore, denotes a       change in composition of the notifications referencing the       2001 AUMF in some way.     Initial Reporting in the Aftermath of the September 11, 2001 Attacks         President Bush's reports to Congress concerning military       deployments in the weeks following the September 11, 2001       terror attacks were relatively concise, focusing on the need       to address the terrorist threat in the immediate aftermath of       the attacks, and the deployments and actions taken in       response to such threat. The first notification on September       24, 2001 references deployments to ``a number of foreign       nations'' in the ``Central and Pacific Command areas of       operations.'' Major military operations in Afghanistan had       not yet commenced. The second notification on October 9, 2001       includes similar information but also notifies Congress of       the commencement of combat against Al Qaeda and the Taliban       in Afghanistan. In these two notifications, President Bush       stated that he had taken the actions described pursuant to       his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief       Executive. In both notifications, he referred to the 2001       AUMF as evidencing the continuing support of Congress, but       did not specifically state he had taken such action pursuant       to 2001 AUMF authority. The President stated in these       notifications that he was reporting on these actions to       Congress consistent with both the War Powers Resolution and       the 2001 AUMF. It is possible to conclude that reporting       action consistent with the 2001 AUMF would mean that the       action was considered taken pursuant to 2001 AUMF authority.       See Table 1 below for more information and precise language       related to 2001 AUMF references in these notifications.     Mr. Speaker, I hope you look at this map, and  you will see exactly where the 2001 authorization has been used for  military strikes and force.   Two decades later, as outlined in the Afghanistan Papers, which I  hope the Speaker has read, published in The Washington Post, I believe  this was in December, the false justifications and inconsistencies led  to a 19-year, endless war--Washington Post, Afghanistan Papers.   The Pentagon consistently misled and lied to the American people  about our progress in Afghanistan. This endless war has caused  countless deaths of servicemembers, innocent civilians. It has cost  trillions of dollars. It has created repercussions throughout the  region and the world.   It is truly concerning, and I urge my colleagues to read through the  details of this report. Our own generals and ambassadors did not know  then, and still do not know what our strategy was or why we are still  involved in this war.   We must ask ourselves: Why are we putting our servicemembers into  harm's way?   Why are innocent civilians' lives in flux?   Why are we making our country less safe?   But it wasn't just in 2001 when we passed an open-ended  authorization. Next, in 2002, I stood here with my colleagues to urge  us not to rush to war in Iraq based on false intelligence, mostly,  weapons of mass destruction, and to vote against the 2002 AUMF.   I offered then an amendment to this authorization that would have  prevented this war by requiring that the inspectors go to verify that  there were weapons of mass destruction before military action. That  seemed reasonable. At least we should have had the data and the  information to justify the use of force.   But, of course, my amendment only received, I believe it was, 72  votes. Shame on us.   But if it had passed, it would have exposed the lie that the war was  based on. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.   So it is time to repeal that outdated authorization. And as I stand  here, as I have stood here so many times to say, the American people do  not want another catastrophic war of choice in the Middle East.   Make no mistake: The dangerous and reckless actions taken by  President Trump have brought us to the brink of an all-out war with  Iran. Since day one, Trump and his warmongering administration have  inched us closer to war with Iran. They have completely neglected  diplomacy at every turn.   Secretary Pompeo is the Secretary of State and should be our chief  diplomat. Instead, we see our chief diplomat promoting the use of force  in the Middle East.   Ending the effective and successful Iran nuclear deal, known as the  JCPOA, once again, this administration has made us less safe and has  allowed Iran to move forward to begin to look at how to develop a  nuclear weapon. That is outrageous, when we had verified the fact that  they had stopped this.   We have also, unfortunately, increased troop presence in the Middle  East and promoted a dangerous and maximum pressure campaign with Iran  and increasing economic sanctions.   This administration is giving Members of Congress and the American  people conflicting and contradictory information. We were told the  President authorized the assassination of General Soleimani due to an  ``imminent threat,'' as permitted by the War Powers Act.   Now Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is saying that he has seen no  evidence of an ``imminent threat'' and conducted the strike for  ``deterrence.''   Unfortunately, they can't even keep up with their lies.   Now, more than ever, Congress needs to exercise our constitutional  responsibility to stop these endless wars. That  [[Page H280]]  is why I am proud to have voted last week in support of Congresswoman  Slotkin's War Powers Resolution to limit the President's military  action regarding Iran and prevent this crisis from spiraling out of  control.   I am also pleased that my bipartisan bill, H.R. 2456, would repeal  the 2002 authorization. That is going to be taken up in 2 weeks.   The administration has falsely claimed that they can justify the use  of force against Iran by conducting assassinations and strikes in Iraq.  It doesn't make any sense.   My amendment to repeal the 2002 AUMF was included in the House-passed  fiscal 2020 NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act, and voted on a  bipartisan basis, but it was stripped by Republicans from the final  bill. And now, unfortunately, we know why Senator McConnell and the  Trump administration took that out of the NDAA. We understand their  strategy now as it relates to that and what happened in Iraq.   When Congress passed the 2002 AUMF before the invasion of Iraq, many  of us did not support it. It was intended, again, to address the  perceived threat posed by Saddam Hussein as it related to weapons of  mass destruction. U.S. military deployments and operations carried out  pursuant to the 2002 AUMF, dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom--remember  that?--officially concluded in 2011, no more.   Almost 18 years after the resolution's passage, we still have this  authorization on the books, and that isn't even being used in any  current military operations, and it shouldn't be used.   In 2 weeks, we will take up Congressman Khanna's bill, which I am  proud to cosponsor, to prohibit funds from being used for a war with  Iran absent explicit congressional authorization. We must do our job.   Mr. Speaker, we have known for years that there is no military  solution in the Middle East, and it is past time to return to a  diplomatic strategy with our allies.   We cannot allow this President's irresponsible and irrational  decisionmaking to drag us into an unnecessary and catastrophic war in  the Middle East. We must protect our national security, our brave  troops, our allies, people in the region, Iraqis, Iranians, everyone  who lives in the midst of harm's way, and we must protect the American  people.    So we ask the question each and every day now: Are we safer or less  safe than before this assassination and military strike? I suggest that  we are less safe, and we need to repeal the 2002 authorization to use  force.   We need to pass Congressman Khanna's resolution, and we also need to  look at a strategy and insist that this administration come to Congress  if, in fact, they intend to use force anywhere in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Tlaib for her leadership and for  this Special Order.
