 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  service and sacrifice of Petty Officer Logan Palmer from Decatur,  Illinois.   Logan knew early on that he wanted to serve his country. He was an  Eagle Scout and an active member of Life Foursquare Church.   After he graduated from Sangamon Valley High School and Richland  Community College, he enlisted in the Navy as an interior  communications electrician. In the Navy, Logan earned the National  Defense Service Medal.   Although I never had the honor of meeting Petty Officer Logan Palmer,  his family remembers him as a committed sailor, a loving son, and a  brother.   Petty Officer Logan Palmer died serving and protecting our country,  and for that, we remain eternally grateful.   This accident is a grave reminder of the risks our servicemembers and  their families take on each day. I continue to pray for Logan's  parents, Theresa and Sid, his brothers Austin and Kaleb, his sister  Mattie, and all those who knew and loved Logan.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer this amendment which would prevent  the Grain Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration from using  any funds to revoke service agreements--also known as exceptions--in  place before April 14, 2017.   At its core, this amendment, supported by my colleague, Congresswoman  Cheri Bustos, is about reinforcing congressional intent, preventing  further mismanagement, promoting good customer service--corrections we  must make due to a bureaucratic failure at GIPSA.   Mr. Chairman, in the U.S., grain handlers are assigned a USDA- approved inspection agency based upon the grain handlers' geographic  location. To utilize official inspection services, grain handlers must  go through their assigned official inspection agency unless they apply  for and receive an exception from GIPSA. Only with an exception may  grain handlers receive services from an alternate inspection agency  outside of their assigned territory.   During the drafting of the 2015 Agriculture Reauthorizations Act, one  of my priorities was to provide for more opportunities for these  exceptions to be considered and granted. That legislation passed this  Chamber by a voice vote and included a provision which created a new  process by which grain handlers could petition GIPSA for an exception.   When it was signed into law, I felt the provision accomplished my  goal to provide grain handlers with greater opportunities to utilize  exceptions.   In July of 2016, GIPSA reaffirmed my initial pleasure with the  provision when it released its final rule governing the new exception  process stating: ``GIPSA currently has 95 agreements for agencies to  operate outside of their assigned territories and GIPSA will continue  to honor those agreements.''   So imagine my surprise and disappointment when, in April of this  year, GIPSA contradicted itself and released a directive opening a back  door for official grain inspection agencies to revoke those 95 service  agreements.   As a result of this directive, an official inspection agency can now  unilaterally request that GIPSA or the USDA revoke a service agreement  with neither the grain handler nor the alternate inspection agency  having a say in the process.   This runs contrary to the original intent of the legislation, which  was to provide grain handlers with greater opportunities to utilize  exceptions, not less.   By supporting my amendment today, we can temporarily halt this  misinterpretation. As it stands, GIPSA's interpretation of the law has  caused many grain handlers to lose their service agreements--even  though these grain handlers have operated under these exceptions for  years.   This includes my constituent Scott Docherty of Topflight Grain  Cooperative in Monticello, Illinois. Scott has been using the same  grain inspection service for more than 20 years when GIPSA sent him a  notice giving him less than 30 days to prepare for a change in service.   The issue at stake is a prime example of bureaucratic failure. In our  current inspection process, the grain handlers are the customers, yet  they are not given a say under the new directive, not granted enough  time to plan for the disruption, and they are the last to find out  about this drastic change in service.   They deserve better, Mr. Chairman. By supporting this amendment, we  can reclaim congressional intent, prevent GIPSA from revoking the  remaining service agreements in place before April 14 of this year, an  outcome Congress never intended.   GIPSA's interpretation of the law may be wrong, but I do want to  thank the USDA for working with me to ensure my amendment is not  misinterpreted and accomplishes what I have sought to do. And that is,  to prevent GIPSA from revoking the remaining service agreements. I look  forward to working with them on finding a more permanent solution in  future legislation.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank  Chairman Aderholt for his support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
