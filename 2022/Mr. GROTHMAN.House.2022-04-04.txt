 Madam Speaker, I hereby remove my name as cosponsor of  H.R. 3807.    Madam Speaker, America has to realize we are on the  precipice of making one of the most significant precedential  determinations in recent memory, and that is the removal of Title 42  affecting American immigration law.   Already we are allowing--depending on the month--between 80,000 and  100,000 people to cross our border who are not appropriately vetted.   However, due to a title put in effect by President Trump, we are  keeping another perhaps 400,000 people a month--we are told 18,000 a  day--south of the border out of concern that they will bring the virus  in this country.   If this title is removed, we will go--according to current  estimates--to 18,000 people a day: a half a million people a month  coming in this country. That is an intolerable amount. They are people  we cannot support. They are people who have not been appropriately  vetted. And, obviously, there will be a massive increase in illegal  drugs crossing our southern border.   I beg the American public to wake up and do what you can to make it  clear  [[Page H4148]]  to everybody in this body that we do not need a massive increase over  the already intolerable 80,000 to 90,000 people who are coming here  every month unvetted.                            ____________________
