 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote is called.    And for the information of the Senators, I will speak  for about 7 minutes.    Madam President, I would like to start by taking a  moment to address the awful violence we saw in Georgia yesterday.   Everyone, especially elected officials, needs to not just speak out  but to act against this deadly display of hate.   To the victims and their families and to the Asian-American and  Pacific-Islander community in Washington State and nationwide, my heart  is with you not just today but going forward. I will continue sending a  strong message that hate against you must stop, and I will keep working  to ensure your safety in light of the terrible surge in hate crimes we  have seen in our State and across the country.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
