 Mr. President, for Washington Democrats, 2021 will  have one major theme: ramming through inflationary spending on a  partisan basis that hurts American families and actually helps China.  That is how this all-Democratic Government began the year, jamming  through a wasteful excuse for a stimulus bill that drove up prices and  made supply chain problems even worse. Not a single Republican  supported it, and Democrats now want to end the year with another  massive spree that would make it even worse.   The whole country understands that Democrats own this mess. They have  seized one-party control of the economy. So you better believe that  they will have one-party accountability for the resulting nightmare.   The President and his allies are badly upside down in overall  approval ratings, upside down on the generic ballot, upside down on the  economy. And the more the men and women of this country learn about the  reckless taxing-and-spending spree that Democrats are planning next,  the less they want it or anything close to it.   Democrats have wanted to transform the country alone. They want to  print and borrow trillion after trillion on their own. They want to  create even more inflation on their own. So, as the Republicans have  made clear for months, they will have to own a debt ceiling increase as  well. This week, the House and Senate have reached a bipartisan  agreement to make that happen. As the Democratic leader said yesterday,  the Democrats are ``willing to carry the burden.'' And so they will.    We have reached an agreement on a one-time, one-shot statutory  process that will enable Democrats to raise the debt limit at a fixed  dollar amount, which they will specify. Much like the vote on an arms  sales resolution that occurred yesterday and the Congressional Review  Act vote that will occur today, this will be a standard expedited  process, at a simple majority threshold, established by law. Democrats  will get one shot at this. They won't be able to add any other  amendments. And every single Senate Democrat will have to put their  name to the gigantic dollar amount of debt they are prepared to pile on  the American people.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on another matter, for the past 2  years, as the country has battled COVID-19, I have been a strong and  consistent advocate of following the science and taking precautions.  That has included strong support for the safe and effective vaccines  that have helped millions of Americans substantially lower their risk  of death or serious illness. I took advantage of these modern medical  miracles as soon as I could. I have received a booster. I have  encouraged Kentuckians and all Americans to take full advantage as  well. I have recorded public service announcements.   I am a survivor of childhood polio. I have watched vaccines  obliterate polio in our entire country in my lifetime. Trust me, there  is no bigger proponent of vaccination than I am. But here is the thing:  The United States of America is a free country. The Federal Government,  elites in Washington, cannot micromanage citizens' personal choices  without a legitimate basis in law and the Constitution. And that goes  double for Presidents going far beyond the bounds of their office and  their authority.   President Biden's absurd private-sector vaccine mandate is blatant  overreach. It is illegal. The administration has already lost in  Federal court and had it blocked.   Washington Democrats have lashed themselves to a mast that is very  simple: Unvaccinated people should be fired. That is what they want.  They don't trust individuals, families, doctors, employers, and  customers to sort things out for themselves. They want every worker at  a medium-sized business and up to either get the shot or get fired by  President Biden. And buried in the illegal mandate is a call to explore  whether it should expand to all businesses.   This is not how things work in our country, period. Workers are not  happy. Medium-sized businesses are not happy, especially not in the  middle of this worker shortage. And, frankly, nobody who understands  our system of government is happy.   I have heard from so many Kentuckians who are affected by the  administration's suite of several unwise vaccine mandates. Here is one  quote:         My wife . . . was notified that if she doesn't get fully       vaccinated by January 4 then she would be terminated and lose       her job without severance or unemployment. . . . She has been       [there] for 17 years and has nothing but exemplary reviews.    Here is another:         I will lose my job at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.       I very much enjoyed my work there and had every intention of       retiring from the plant. However, due to Joe Biden's forced       vaccine mandate, I will be terminated. . . . Please let a man       who wants to work, go to work.    Here is another:         My firm [of] 103 employees will [either] lose about 25 to       the mandate, or lay off 4 to get to 99. Which one should we       do?    Remember, personally, I would encourage each of these Kentuckians to  get the vaccine, but for the purposes of this conversation, that really  isn't the point. You better believe I am going to stand up and fight  for their freedom.   I want to thank the junior Senator from Indiana for spearheading this  resolution to overturn the Biden administration's illegal mandate. I am  a proud cosponsor. I will proudly vote for it and urge every Senator to  do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, the national  murder rate just recorded its biggest jump in more than a century. In  some cities, homicides have set alltime records. From Albuquerque to  Milwaukee, Memphis to Des Moines, city officials reported more murders  last year than in any prior year. In my hometown of Louisville,  homicides this year have now broken last year's alltime record.  [[Page S9004]]    All last year, liberal politicians and activists made absurd and  false claims about law enforcement. Here are some of them: ``We need to  completely dismantle'' local police. Here is another one: ``Policing in  our country is inherently and intentionally racist.''   A leftwing messaging campaign has spent a year and a half trying to  chill law enforcement and policing. A network of liberal district  attorneys around the country is matching their rhetoric with incredibly  soft-on-crime practices behind the scenes, and the predictable result  of all this has been a collapse--a collapse--in public safety.   For example, last month a man killed six people and injured dozens  more at a Christmas market in Wisconsin--listen to this--just weeks  after he was released on bail for another set of violent charges. This  criminal had already been arrested and locked up in neighboring  Milwaukee County, but he was let out by a liberal DA who remarked  several years ago:         Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into       treatment program, who's going to go out and kill somebody?       You bet. Guaranteed. It's guaranteed to happen. It does not       invalidate the overall approach.    Stunning. There are now a whole bunch of grieving families in this  Wisconsin city who have strong feelings about that ``approach.''   Here is a headline from New York City just this week:         Man busted for assault set free, allegedly beats two random       [New York City] women--then cut loose again.    Smash-and-grabs, flash mob thefts, and carjackings are increasingly  facts of life in multiple major cities, but against this backdrop,  Democrats just want to keep getting weaker on crime and softer on  public safety.   We expect a vote today on the nomination of Rachael Rollins to be  U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. Ms. Rollins has spent years in her  current job as a DA pushing the idea that the State should wipe entire  categories of crimes off the list of things worth prosecuting. She  would rather her office not go after trespassers, shoplifters, or even  those found possessing drugs with intent to distribute. This soft-on- crime advocacy should have earned the nominee a pink slip. Instead,  President Biden is giving her a promotion.   I would urge all Senators to vote no. Law-abiding Americans don't  want prosecutors who refuse to prosecute. They don't want city jails  equipped with revolving doors. And they need leaders who will defend  the rule of law.
