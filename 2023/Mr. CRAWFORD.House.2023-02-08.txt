 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank my friend and colleague from Kentucky for his leadership on this  bill.   I just want to remind everyone here today that the year is 2023, it  is not 2020, and yet, many of our COVID policies are still based on  numbers from almost 3 years ago.   This vaccine requirement for international travelers is a prime  example. Countries all around the world realize this and are rolling  back their own border restrictions.   I also point out that this vaccine requirement is not part of the  emergency declarations that are scheduled to end in May.   This means that vaccine requirements could still stay in effect for  an indefinite period of time. Come May, it is possible we won't even  have a public health emergency at all.   We won't have a national emergency, but our friends and family from,  say, for example, Canada would still have to show proof of vaccination  when flying in to visit their relatives.   We don't even require our own citizens to be vaccinated or show a  negative test, so why would we do that and create a different standard  for folks that are visiting?   This only causes confusion for Americans who are told one minute they  are safe and don't have to fear COVID-19, and yet, we continue these  pandemic requirements.   I am here today to tell the American people that despite the mixed  messages emanating from the White House, I believe we are safe, and in  the words of President Biden, the pandemic is, in fact, over.   I am proud to cosponsor this commonsense bill, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 185.
