 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legacy of  Harold ``Hal'' Snopek of Binghamton, New York. Mr. Hal Snopek was the  beloved Chenango town supervisor and, sadly, passed away last month.  Hal graduated from Chenango Forks High School, where he was a multiyear  letterman, setting several school records, one which still stands  today. He was inducted into the New York State Public High School Hall  of Fame Athletic Association in 1991.   Hal was also a devoted car salesman at JW Greene for over 25 years.  He was appointed to the Chenango town board in 2004, and served as the  town's current supervisor.   Hal was deeply devoted to his family, leaving behind his loving wife  and high school sweetheart, Donna, his daughters, Tami and Tina, four  grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.   Along with being a dedicated public servant, Hal was a loving  husband, dad, grandfather, and ``Pop Pop.'' He was a parishioner at the  former St. Christopher's Church, where he and Donna were married 57  years ago, and he was currently active at Most Holy Rosary.   In his later years, Hal enjoyed driving all over town with his wife,  Donna, in his 1932 Chevy. He was known as a Mr. Fix-It and loved to  work on cars.   Hal was also known for his warm heart and great sense of humor.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Hal's contributions to the  town of Chenango over the past two decades. Our deepest condolences to  Hal's family on the loss of an honored and beloved member of our  community.                            ____________________
