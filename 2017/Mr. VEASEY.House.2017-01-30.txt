 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, this was a sad week for our country. We saw  anger, despair, and chaos at American airports when people from all  different types of backgrounds from the Middle East were banned from  coming into the United States. We had individuals who were green card  holders who were denied entry into the United States. We had  individuals who were interpreters for our United States military, who  kept them safe in the Middle East, who were denied the right to come  into the country. It was a sad day in our country's history.   This past weekend, I took my son to an exhibit at one of the  synagogues in Fort Worth, Texas, where I live. It was an exhibit on  Jews in baseball. There was a picture of Hank Greenberg and Joe  DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio, an American lexicon, is about as American as  you get; but, in looking at the exhibit and at the caption that was  next to it, it read, while Joe DiMaggio was fighting for our country in  World War II, the United States Government listed his parents as  ``enemy aliens.'' In revisiting that sort of sad chapter in our  history, when individuals were treated that way in our country, I think  it is very sad, Mr. Speaker.   We have a lot of Members who would like to express their discontent  at what happened. I yield to our chair, Mr. Cedric Richmond, from the  State of Louisiana, to come and address us because what we have to talk  about tonight is very serious.    I thank the chairman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I did not mention that we are also talking about voting  rights, which is very important on the eve of the President making the  selection for the next Supreme Court Justice of the United States.   I know, with Representative Plaskett's representing the Virgin  Islands and understanding the importance of voting rights, that that is  very significant. I yield to the gentlewoman and thank her for being a  voice in terms of refugees, immigration rights, and on the very  important issue of voting rights.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the Garden  State of New Jersey, Mrs. Bonnie Watson Coleman, who will speak to this  House on the issues that the Congressional Black Caucus is taking up  this evening.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   In his first full week as President, Donald Trump continued to make a  mockery of the ideas upon which our Nation was founded. In addition,  his de facto Muslim ban is contrary to the national security interests  of the United States. His actions are not only discriminatory and  bigoted, but also reckless, dangerous, and counterproductive to any  authentic effort to defeat terrorism.   As a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, I am concerned  this will only serve to stoke anti-American sentiment across the globe,  including our international partners committed to eradicating global  terror threats.   My colleagues have outlined the ways in which men and women they  represent have been impacted at this present moment, and highlight the  uncertainty that those constituents feel about the future. But we  cannot forget those who have come to this country in pursuit of the  future that the American Dream has promised.   Close to 17,000 students from the seven affected countries attend  U.S. colleges and universities. The 12th District of New Jersey  represents these  [[Page H725]]  men and women, both young and old, at a multitude of 2-year, 4-year,  and technical institutions.   The President of Princeton University--one of the most revered  institutions in the world, housed in the heart of my district--released  a statement concerned that the success of Princeton and many other  institutions of higher education across this Nation depend on America's  ability to attract and engage with talented people from around the  world.   Rutgers University, the flagship public university in my State, has  students, researchers, and professors from all seven countries on  Trump's barred entry list who are currently traveling outside of this  country. The impact on university personnel was felt most immediately  after the executive order went into effect.   Two Iranian nationals who are associate professors at the University  of Massachusetts at Dartmouth were detained Saturday upon arrival at  Boston Logan International Airport. Today I talked with university  officials in my district who have faculty members that need to return  home in order to renew visas, but are afraid to leave. At another  college, one-fourth of their applicants come from the countries that  are impacted by this ban.   A constituent in East Brunswick, who is a non-Syrian political  refugee, sits in limbo as only one of her four minor children passed  through our already thorough and extensive processing and was approved  for a visa. USCIS put a hold on the process of the remaining three due  to lack of communication and direction and understanding from this  travel ban.   By feeding off of fear, hatred, and bigotry, this administration's  incendiary Muslim ban has created confusion, disruption, and chaos that  is rippling around the world.   As our Federal agencies and international partners seek to understand  and combat this meritless policy, I call on the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee, on which I sit, to hold an immediate  hearing with leadership at the Department of Homeland Security to  review concerning reports about the crafting and execution of this  President's order.   I also requested that the House Homeland Security Committee, which I  also serve on, to move up its February 7 hearing on this issue so that  we may urgently address the national security implications of this  administration's actions.   In short, Mr. Speaker, this is the United States of America. We  respect diversity because this is a nation founded and made great  because of immigrants. We are not going to stand by and allow President  Trump, with his un-American ideals, to push forward on American  policies. Understand that we will resist at every turn.    I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for her comments.   Now I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from the State of  Illinois (Ms. Kelly). I thank Ms. Kelly for all of her work on so many  issues that are important. I know that voting rights is particularly  important to her with her representing the Chicago suburbs and the city  of Chicago itself.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois.   I am now going to call someone who also has a really good  understanding of civil rights, voting rights in the State of Virginia,  but then also the plight of immigrants and has a deep level of empathy  because the other part of his State is very much a diverse State with  people made up from various parts of the world.   I yield to the gentleman representing the Fourth Congressional  District of Virginia, Representative Donald McEachin.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank the gentleman as well as the gentlewoman for leading tonight's  conversation about so many issues that are important to the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, the President's baseless executive order on immigration  has hurt this country. It has hurt this country to the extent that it  has made us less safe, and it has hurt this country to the extent that  it goes against our values as a nation. Our Constitution says that we  will not favor any religion over another, yet the President has  instituted a religious test for entry in this country just 1 week after  his inauguration.   Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty. This rule has inconvenienced travel  back to America over the weekend for any number of permanent residents  and those of all backgrounds who serve our country. I know this because  it has actually impacted citizens of the Fourth Congressional District.                                time  1945    Mr. Speaker, I have a constituent who has been a permanent resident  for 20 years. He had visited his family in Cairo and was on his way  back to Virginia when he was turned around. He was actually sent to  Qatar, Mr. Speaker, where he has no connections, where he has no  business. He was just sent there because he was denied entry back home.   Mr. Speaker, my congressional staff worked around the clock, along  with his employer, to get him back home and, thanks be to God, he is,  indeed, home. But, Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable, and it cannot go  on.   I can't help but think of Leviticus chapter 19, verse 34, where we  are reminded, Mr. Speaker, to treat the foreigner in our midst as if he  was one of our own.   Mr. Speaker, the President's order does not do this. It is an offense  to all Americans. It is an offense to the Judeo-Christian ethic. Mr.  Speaker, it cannot be allowed to stand, and I will work every day,  along with my colleagues in the CBC and other like-minded individuals  in this Congress, to reverse this order.    I thank the gentleman for sharing that story about his  constituent. Again, it is such a terrible and shameful time for our  country, for the world to have seen that.  [[Page H726]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Columbus, Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty).    I thank the gentleman for sharing that story about his  constituent. Again, it is such a terrible and shameful time for our  country, for the world to have seen that.  [[Page H726]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Columbus, Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty).    I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio, a State that knows a  lot about voter suppression, also a very international State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass)  representing Los Angeles, one of our most international cities in the  world that I am sure was impacted very greatly by what happened at  airports this weekend.    I thank Representative Bass for her commentary  representing the very international city of Los Angeles, again, a city  with many immigrants, with many people who have contributed to the  greatness and vibrancy of that city that we know as Los Angeles. I just  really do appreciate all of her input on that.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to call up to come and speak Mr. Dwight  Evans. Mr. Evans, hailing from Pennsylvania's Second Congressional  District, a State that also is very international, I am sure that your  State was heavily impacted by the travel ban that was implemented by  the Trump administration, and I believe the world needs to hear your  remarks tonight, so thank you for being here tonight to speak.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. And just like  the city of Philadelphia, just like the city of Los Angeles, when we  heard from Congresswoman Bass earlier, oftentimes the State of Texas is  portrayed through popular culture as not being a very international  place, but we are a very international place.   Everyone has heard of the stories how every State Legislative  Session, which one has just begun a couple of weeks ago, how Black and  Hispanic voters, in particular, in the State of Texas, are targeted so  our voting participation numbers will decrease.   Well, someone who has been in that fight to help protect Black and  Latino voters in the State of Texas to expand voting rights in the  State of Texas; and not just that, again, in pop culture, our State has  oftentimes been portrayed as one way, but a lot of people forget that  the city of Houston is the fourth largest city in the country and one  of the most international cities in the entire world, one of the  largest ballots in the entire country, printed in--I forgot exactly how  many languages. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee can tell you that  later.   So not only are voting rights being impacted in her district, but  also I am sure that she felt the plight of many of the people who she  represents who were stuck at airports, including the Houston  International Airport, by the Muslim ban that was implemented by the  Trump administration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Veasey) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett)  for their continuing leadership on a very important and needed response  to the actions of many, in particular, this new administration.   My time is short, so I want to thank Mr. Veasey for his leadership on  the challenge to the voter ID law and, as well, his continuing  leadership on the empowerment of voters, as well to Ms. Plaskett for  ensuring and fighting for the right to vote for the Virgin Islands.                                time  2000    I stand with both of them. But I come today to plead and also to  enunciate what crisis we find ourselves in. The White House is in  crisis. When the White House is in crisis, that means America is in  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, it is not a frivolous statement that I make; it is a  truthful statement because less than 72 hours ago, without the counsel  of many experts, Members of Congress who are on the jurisdictional  committees, without the notice and input of the Secretary of Homeland  Security, an executive order was produced by one young staffer in the  White House and another individual who has pushed an agenda of  exclusiveness. That is not the way to run this country.   So this executive order came out, and what we find is that 67,000  refugees are stranded around the world who actually had documents, who  were vetted, and, as some stories have told us, waited 10 and 12 to 13  years to be able to get in line and to be vetted to come to the United  States of America. The tragedy is that some of them were, in fact, our  friends from Iraq who have stood by our military personnel who had, in  fact, provided them the interpretation that they needed to save their  lives. In one story we heard tonight on the steps of the United States  Supreme Court was a woman who finally got here with her two children.  Her husband was murdered, and her father was tortured.   So, to Mr. Trump, today I think it is important as we have joined in  to repeal and to rescind this unconstitutional order, it is clear that  you need to read the writing on the wall. The Deputy Attorney General,  duly appointed and confirmed, of the U.S. Department of Justice, the  remaining individual who has power in that office, has made a very  conscious decision that they cannot defend this order because it is  unconstitutional. This is not a person who takes her task lightly. This  is not someone who is not an officer who has not taken an oath of  office. This is akin to what happened in the Nixon administration. They  were willing to lose their position to stand for the Constitution.   So the Congressional Black Caucus is on the floor today with our  chairman, Mr. Richmond, to be able to inform America that this is  patently unconstitutional. It does not provide for due process. It did  not provide for equal protection of the law. As well, it is a blatant  attack on freedom of religion.   For those of you who need a better explanation, let me tell you what  a ban on Muslims is. A ban on Muslims is one country, two countries,  seven countries, and the idea of who cannot come in are Muslims--that  is a ban on Muslims. It is not a ban on Christians. It is not a ban on  any other faith. It is a ban on Muslims, and the White House needs to  understand what an interpretation of that means.   Further, let me say, as I come to a close, please do not try to cover  yourself with the announcement that was made by President Obama. As a  member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am well aware of that  announcement that he had regarding a number of countries. It was not a  ban. It was to take note that those countries were in conflict and that  individuals who were coming from those countries specifically needed to  have a higher level of scrutiny. It was not a ban. It is well  documented that the tragedies that we have had from Boston to Orlando  to San Bernardino were not individuals who came through as refugees or  came from those particular countries.   What are we doing here? We are blatantly violating the Constitution.  When the President of the United States violates the Constitution, this  body has to stand up and respond. So I would ask this body to direct  the President to rescind. In the alternative, I would ask that the  legislation that is being introduced call upon the President to repeal  this.   In all fairness, I would appreciate if the President took it up on  his own to suspend this order that is impacting so many who are being  left along the highway of despair, people who are able to--if you will,  people and individuals who are able to seek refuge here are now being  left.   I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus--the conscience of the  Congress--stands now, tonight, to seek to ban the Muslim ban, to seek  to stop the suppression of voting, and to also say to the nominee for  the Attorney General: Are you prepared to represent all of us and to be  able to support the institution, or reinstitution, of section 5 of the  Voting Rights Act?    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson  Lee for clearing up a lot of the misconceptions that are being  purposely spread out there that this was something that was used by the  Obama administration. It absolutely was not. It is being purposely  spread on social media, and people are lying about the past and what  happened. It is completely different, and I want to thank her for  clearing that up.  [[Page H728]]    I now yield to the gentleman from Newark, New Jersey (Mr. Payne), who  is the gentleman representing the eastern coast of New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New  Jersey.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who  represents a critical State, a State that some people think actually  went a certain direction in the Presidential race because of voter  suppression tactics. She represents the city of Milwaukee.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from the  State of Wisconsin.   Now I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), who is my  friend and colleague from another international part of the country,  the Oakland Bay Area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rutherford). Members are reminded to  refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, within just days of  assuming office, President Donald Trump has made a number of alarmingly  fictitious claims about anything from the alleged failures of the  Affordable Care Act to the skyrocketing murder rate throughout the  United States. President Trump has even felt it was necessary to  misrepresent the number of attendees at his inauguration. However,  among his most egregious ``alternative facts'' that he has presented to  the American people is the idea that there is widespread voter fraud  across the country, which is undermining the electoral process in the  United States. This is unequivocally false.   In fact, numerous reports, court findings, and official government  investigations over, the years have pointed to the fact that voter  fraud is, in reality, extremely rare. In 2016, the United States Court  of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which ultimately found the Texas  photo ID law to be racially discriminatory, noted in its findings that  there were only two convictions for in-person voter impersonation fraud  out of 20 million votes cast in Texas within the last decade. In a  separate case ruled in 2014, a special investigations unit for the  State of Texas was found to only have identified a single conviction  and one guilty plea of in-person voter impersonation in any election in  the State of Texas between 2002 and 2014. Nationally, countless  Studies--including one conducted by the nonpartisan Government  Accountability Office--have failed to identify any evidence of  widespread voter fraud. The story is the same in states all across the  country.   Yet, somehow President Trump and Republicans in Congress have arrived  at a separate conclusion and are using this false notion to promote  regressive voter laws that seek to suppress minority voting rights all  across the country. These laws are an example of your classic  ``solution in search of a problem,'' albeit with a more sinister  objective to suppress liberal leaning voters and deny select groups of  voters their fundamental right to vote.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I have worked tirelessly throughout  our careers to ensure that every American has equal access to the polls  regardless of race, income, location, or background. We will not stop  at making sure that every American preserves their right to vote, even  in the face of a Republican-controlled Congress and Administration. The  right to vote is a fundamental pillar of our democracy, and it is  counter to our principles that our nation had defended for centuries to  now try and erode that right for millions of Americans. I, and  countless other Americans, unequivocally reject these efforts and will  forever stand united against them.                            ____________________
