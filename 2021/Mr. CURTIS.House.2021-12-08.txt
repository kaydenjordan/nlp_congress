 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share my support for expanding  access for individuals to investigative drugs because I am concerned  that we are not moving swiftly enough in order to prevent diagnosis,  mitigate, treat, or cure ALS.   This is very personal to me, it is very personal to the committee. It  hits extremely close to home for so many of us who have lost friends,  and have seen good friends and neighbors struggle with their families  with this difficult disease.    I had the opportunity to speak about this earlier today in the Energy  and Commerce Committee hearing on biomedical innovation. We are not  moving fast enough and we have more work to do.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud this Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies  for ALS Act for working to create and further develop public-private  partnerships and to prevent policies from being enacted that impede  private sector investments and advancements.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
