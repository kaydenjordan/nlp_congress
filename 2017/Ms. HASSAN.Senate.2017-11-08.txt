 Mr. President, it is with great sadness today  that I recognize the life and passing of Gary Wayne Smiledge, 72, of  Gonic, NH.   Mr. Smiledge served bravely in the U.S. Army during the Korean war.  As a member of the 2nd Infantry Division, stationed at Camp Casey south  of the DMZ, Mr. Smiledge protected orphanages after serving on the  frontlines.   When Mr. Smiledge returned to New Hampshire, his service to his  fellow veterans continued. In addition to being a member of the  American Legion Post No. 7 of Rochester, he was also heavily involved  with the New Hampshire Amputee Group, where he worked with other  veterans who lost limbs during the course of their service.   Mr. Smiledge was a beloved member of his community, and he will be  missed dearly. I join all Granite Staters in expressing our profound  gratitude to veterans like Gary who have fought for the cause of  freedom, putting their country and devotion to duty first.                            ____________________
