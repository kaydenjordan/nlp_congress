 Madam President, throughout their history, the children of  Israel have known persecution and sorrow. They have lived in exile and  enslavement. They have faced bigotry and violence. Entire nations and  civilizations have sought to extinguish them and vanished, but the  Jewish people remain, and, against all odds, millions of their  descendants gathered together in the Holy Land and founded a nation.   Today, Israel is a vibrant democracy in the Middle East and a strong  ally of the United States of America. Many people of faith would say  the existence and perseverance of the State of Israel is itself  evidence of divine providence.   Yet, even today--even today--Israel faces existential threats. On  October 7, Hamas terrorists carried out the worst attack on the Jewish  people since the Holocaust: the slaughter of 1,400 people; the  decapitation of babies; the execution of grandmothers; and the taking  of nearly 200 hostages, including children, women, seniors, and  American citizens. Thirty Americans were among the murdered--30  Americans. Many of our fellow citizens have friends and family in  Israel.   Regardless of our faith, we are all, I know, heartbroken for the loss  and sickened--sickened--by the cruelty. And, on behalf of the Hoosiers  I represent, I want to express my deepest condolences to the people of  Israel as they mourn and pray and bury the dead.   As it has since its founding, against alliances of far larger nations  and armies, this country, which is four times smaller than Indiana,  will defend itself, and America will be here for Israel and support its  right to confront this violence, this barbarism. We will do this  because our values are the same: dedication to liberty and order, to  tolerance, and to human dignity.   Make no mistake, the days ahead will be difficult. As Members of this  body know too well, Israel is still under threat, and the risk of  additional fronts opening up is real.   Over the past several days, I have been heartened by the strong  bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate for the people of Israel. During  this time of peril, this body cannot succumb to isolationism. We cannot  abandon Israel any more than we can abandon our friends in Ukraine or  Taiwan. On urgent matters of national security, we are stronger when we  stand together, and in the difficult days ahead, we will work to  support the people of Israel. I know we will continue that spirit.   Relatedly, I call on the Biden administration to consult and closely  work with this Congress to quickly fulfill--  [[Page S5070]]  quickly fulfill--any urgent Israeli requests for assistance and do all  we can to fully support Israel.   Now, colleagues, the Constitution of the United States lays out our  responsibilities. Congress--Congress--has an important constitutional  role in determining how the United States will respond to any  additional acts of aggression.   As we support and stand with our allies, we also must be crystal  clear about what has happened. The attacks on the people of Israel  orchestrated by Hamas were barbaric, depraved--they were evil. Long  supported by the Iranian regime, Hamas's stated mission is to destroy  the Jewish people.   That is right--at the core of Hamas burns an age-old sickness: anti- Semitism. It was the twisted inspiration for their massacre. This  broken thinking, this horrific ideology liberates not a single life;  instead, tragically, it will cost only more, including those of  innocent Palestinian civilians.   For the past 15 years, many peacekeeping Palestinians in Gaza have  had their lives upended and exploited by the Hamas terrorist group. We  acknowledge their suffering. We hope for change.   Those in our media, on our college campuses, or even those serving in  government who ascribe the actions of Hamas to anything else other than  hatred; those who are so quick to decry injustices elsewhere but place  murder and rape in some sort of perspective; those who provide context  for savagery; those who sigh that both sides are equally guilty--to all  of you, I say you are providing cover for monsters.   The world view of Hamas must be added to the rollcall of evil  ideologies that failed to destroy the Jewish people. And that is why we  must stand with Israel. That is why. But that alone is not enough. You  see, the murder of thousands of Jews brought reminders of the Holocaust  and echoes of Russian pogroms and so many centuries of trials and  tragedies. So we must also stand vigilant against and always oppose  anti-Semitism wherever it appears, whatever movement it is attached to,  whatever banner it marches underneath.   In these difficult days, we echo the old prayer sung across  synagogues to the Jewish people:         May God have mercy on them and remove them from distress to       relief, from darkness to light, from subjugation to       redemption, now, speedily, and soon.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
