 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark the sad  occasion of the passing of Rosemary Lawley of Williamsville, New York.   Entering into her eternal rest a few short months ago, Mrs. Lawley  was the matriarch of the Lawley family of Buffalo and western New York  and was loved by all those who came into her life. She was a champion  for those who had none.   Born Rosemary O'Connor in south Buffalo, she was a graduate of Mount  Mercy Academy and nursing school at D'Youville College. Rosemary met  the love of her life, Bill, and together, they raised six children who  each continue in the footsteps of their parents, giving back generously  to the western New York community.   Rosemary Lawley was one of a kind--a graceful and thoughtful woman  whose commitment to faith, family, and community set examples for so  many to follow, and, most particularly, her grandchildren and her  great-grandchildren.   While her loss leaves an irreplaceable void at the top of the Lawley  family, her legacy shines on through her family and through her many  charitable works for which she is best known. I am honored to remember  her on this beautiful day on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives in this good and generous Nation and the Capitol of the  United States of America.                            ____________________
