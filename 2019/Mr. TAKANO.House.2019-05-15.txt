 Madam Speaker, ``We the People'' is a bold opening  statement enshrined in our Constitution. Yet, the truth is that in most  parts of our country, LGBTQ Americans are not included in ``We the  People.''   Students in Arizona should go to school free from fear and bullying.  Workers in Texas should not be afraid of being fired because of who  they are. Renters in Mississippi should not be evicted because of who  they love.   No person, no matter where they live in America, should face  discrimination. Equality should not depend on the ZIP Code where you  live. It is time to make equality for LGBTQ people the law of the land  and to ensure that we, too, are part of ``We the People.''   I urge my colleagues to be on the right side of history and to vote  ``yes'' on the Equality Act.                            ____________________
