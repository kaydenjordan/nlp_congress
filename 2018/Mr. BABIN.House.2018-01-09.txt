 Madam Speaker, some folks in Washington are upset because  we just passed the largest tax cut in American history. They think this  money is Washington's money and that politicians and bureaucrats should  decide how to spend it.   I could not disagree more. You and I know that this money belongs to  the American people, came right out of their wallets.   Under our new law, we put hardworking families first by helping them  cope with the cost of raising children by doubling the child tax  credit. We also help small businesses by cutting their taxes so that  they can compete with foreign companies and create jobs right here in  America.   Well, for those folks who don't think they need an extra $1,500 or  so, or who think politicians and bureaucrats can spend their money  better, I have a solution: go ahead and drop your new refund check in  the mail. Send it to the IRS. They will be glad to take your money.                            ____________________
