 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the  bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, a bipartisan agreement that  Representatives Garamendi and Johnson have reached. I thank my  colleagues for working with me and Congressman DeFazio on this  legislation.   As chair of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime  Transportation, I have held hearings on the ongoing supply chain  disruptions and met with countless stakeholders and constituents who  are feeling the impacts of the disruptions, including those who  suffered wrongdoing by ocean carriers. This legislation is a big step  toward addressing this.   The increase in funding for the Federal Maritime Commission, FMC, in  this 2-year authorization is indicative of this body's strong support  for finding an effective solution to the pandemic supply chain crisis.                                time  1115    Now is the time to ensure that the Commission has the ability to  enforce fairness in ocean carrier practices.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the bill contains a number of  provisions aimed at addressing wrongfully issued detention and  demurrage fees and complements President Biden's actions to address  this issue. The bill also includes several reporting requirements on  issues of maritime cargo flow at U.S. ports and anticompetitive  business practices.   By addressing these challenges, Congress seeks to counter trade  imbalances with foreign exporting countries, making reciprocal trade  one of the FMC's missions.   I am proud of the committee's work on this important legislation, and  I look forward to ensuring that this legislation, H.R. 4996, is signed  into law.
