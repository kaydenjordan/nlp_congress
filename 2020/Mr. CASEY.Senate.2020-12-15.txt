 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in  morning business.    Madam President, I rise today to unfortunately look back  with sadness on the deadly toll of COVID-19 this year. I will focus my  remarks on my home State of Pennsylvania, but of course the stories  that I will relate about individuals we lost--of course many of them  could be told in so many other States.   As of today, the middle of today, there have been some 301,264 deaths  in the United States due to COVID-19, including 12,890--12,890--deaths  in Pennsylvania. While I wish I could recognize and honor the memories  of each of those individuals, that recognition, of course, would take  longer than I have time set aside on the floor to speak, so instead I  will share the stories of just 5 Pennsylvanians who have lost their  lives to this terrible disease--5 stories, 5 families, from one corner  of our State to the other, east to west, throughout our 67 counties.
