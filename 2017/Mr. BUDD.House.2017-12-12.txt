 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the gentlewoman from New  York's legislation, H.R. 3971, and I thank her for her leadership on  this very important issue.   As many of my friends here today know, Dodd-Frank and the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau have made life very difficult for many.  Luckily, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act will, once  again, solve a problem that they created, this time regarding escrow  and mortgage servicing requirements.   The CFPB rule regarding these accounts has done nothing more than  accelerate industry consolidation in this space, particularly causing  harm to rural consumers, leaving them with even less financing options.   This bill reverses that problem, though, and will help bring local  banks and financial institutions back into the picture. This bill  simply lets them reenter the mortgage market and directs the CFPB to  exempt them from the escrow account requirement of Dodd-Frank.   Now, though this is a bipartisan bill, some of my friends on the  other side of the aisle may claim that this bill removes consumer  safeguards, but I would argue that this CFPB rule that they support  creates an unnecessary burden on local banks and credit unions, which,  in the end, hurts local communities and people that they claim to  protect with this very rule.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad this bill remains largely bipartisan and, as I  said, returns power back to the community financial institutions and  ensures that consumers have credit through various credit choices.   I want to thank Representative Tenney for her steadfast leadership on  this issue, and I urge adoption of her legislation.
