 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 972 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 972         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       2471) to measure the progress of post-disaster recovery and       efforts to address corruption, governance, rule of law, and       media freedoms in Haiti, with the Senate amendment thereto,       and to consider in the House, without intervention of any       point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on Appropriations or her designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-35. The Senate       amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion. The       question of adoption of the motion shall be divided for a       separate vote on all of the matter proposed to be inserted by       the amendment of the House other than divisions B, C, F, X,       and Z, and titles 2 and 3 of division N. The two portions of       the divided question shall be considered in the order       specified by the Chair. If either portion of the divided       question fails of adoption, then the House shall be       considered to have made no disposition of the Senate       amendment.        Sec. 2.  The chair of the Committee on Appropriations and       the chair of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence       may insert in the Congressional Record not later than March       11, 2022, such material as they may deem explanatory of the       Senate amendment and the motion specified in the first       section of this resolution.        Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 75) making further continuing appropriations for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 4.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6968) to       prohibit the importation of energy products of the Russian       Federation, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways       and Means or their respective designees; and (2) one motion       to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), who  is my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, let me wish a good morning to my good  friend, Mr. Cole. It feels like just a couple of hours ago I was saying  good morning. Let me say to the gentleman that he looks marvelous for  getting no sleep, and it is great to be with my friend.   Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 972, providing for consideration of the Senate Amendment to  H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. It provides for a  motion to concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 2471 with a House  amendment and 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.  It divides the question on adoption of the motion into two votes in the  order specified by the chair, and provides that if any portion of the  divided question fails, then the House shall be considered to have made  no disposition of the Senate amendment.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 75, the  Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2022, under a closed rule.  It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations  and provides for one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 6968, the  Suspending Energy Imports From Russia Act, under a closed rule. It  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means and  provides one motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, the bills contained in the rule are about investing in  our communities and families here at home and living up to our values  abroad.   Throughout last summer, House Democrats were hard at work passing  appropriations bills funding nearly all of the Federal Government to  build on the momentum of our economic recovery. This full-year omnibus  is the product of extensive bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. Both  sides have come together to produce an agreement to fund the government  that I think has resulted in a very, very good bill.   That means this agreement does not include everything I wanted, and I  know it doesn't include everything my Republican friends wanted. But I  think, at the end of the day, it is a good package that is going to  benefit the American people.   I especially want to recognize Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member  Granger and thank them for forging a bipartisan path forward. I also  want to take this opportunity to thank the incredible staff of the  Appropriations Committee as well as the incredible staff of the Rules  Committee--Democrats and Republicans--who have worked tirelessly to  bring this legislation to the floor today. I think most of my  colleagues here do not appreciate how hard the staff works, and I think  the American people ought to be proud of those who serve up here in  both parties for their public service.   The work of Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger could not  have come at a more critical time. We are at a moment in history that  demands a strong and confident America,  [[Page H1382]]  and the certainty provided by this omnibus will allow us to tackle some  of our country's biggest challenges by helping to support good-paying  American jobs; by building ladders of opportunity for hardworking  families; by confronting the existential threat of climate change; and  by investing in lifesaving research into maternal health, mental  health, and opioid abuse.   I am proud that we negotiated a government funding package that  centers on the needs of middle-class and working families, not the rich  and not on powerful special interests.   I am particularly proud that one of the provisions included in this  package--funding for a White House Conference on Food, Nutrition,  Hunger, and Health--is something that we have worked together on in a  bipartisan way at the Rules Committee and with Democrats and  Republicans in the Senate.   We live in the United States of America, the richest country in the  history of this planet, yet as we gather here today, close to 40  million of our fellow citizens don't know where their next meal is  going to come from. There is not a single congressional district in  America that is hunger-free. We ought to be ashamed of that.   Hunger is a political condition. We can solve this problem, but we  need to have the political will. This conference, I hope, will provide  that political will.   I will remind my colleagues the last time we had a conference on this  subject was 54 years ago, so I am looking forward to working with the  White House and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to forge a  path forward to end hunger in America once and for all.   Madam Speaker, this rule also provides for consideration of a short- term continuing resolution that keeps the government funded at current  levels through March 15 to give the United States Senate adequate time  to pass this full-year omnibus agreement and get it to President  Biden's desk so that he can sign it.   And in the wake of the unprovoked and horrific invasion of Ukraine at  the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin, this Congress is taking  urgent bipartisan action to protect global peace and security and hold  Putin's corrupt regime accountable.   Yesterday, I co-chaired a meeting of the Tom Lantos Human Rights  Commission. We had a detailed discussion about what was happening in  Ukraine and the fact that what is happening has risen to the level of  war crimes, and there needs to be accountability.    We have all seen the awful pictures and the awful videos, Madam  Speaker, families gunned down, apartment buildings bombed, and the  indiscriminate use of force, yet still the people of Ukraine are  courageously standing up for freedom. Congress, the Biden  administration, and the people of the United States must stand with  them, and that is exactly what this measure does.   By encouraging World Trade Organization members to suspend  concessions to Russia; taking steps to review Russia's international  trade status; and, very importantly, by reauthorizing a strengthened  Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act so that the United  States can impose further sanctions on human rights abusers in Russia  and around the globe, America is standing up to bullies like Putin who  think they can invade their way into an empire and blackmail the world  with their oil.   I want to commend President Biden for taking action to stop the  import of Russian energy products into the United States, action which  our legislation supports.   I should also say, Madam Speaker, that I had kind of hoped that this  could have come up under suspension because I like to think there is no  dissent on what we are doing in this legislation. I am concerned that  some of my friends on the other side objected to the strengthening of  human rights provisions in the Magnitsky Act.   Ironically, the language that we are using is language very similar  to the executive order put forward by President Trump. I don't agree  with him on a lot of things--almost nothing--but I think he was right  signing an executive order to actually strengthen the human rights  criteria for the Magnitsky legislation. We ought to hold human rights  abusers--those guilty of corruption--accountable. And for anybody-- anybody--to want to weaken the standard and to want to let some people  off the hook, I think, is unconscionable. So I hope there is a strong  bipartisan vote on this.   Finally, I want to highlight that our bipartisan omnibus agreement  includes $13.6 billion in emergency military, humanitarian, and  economic support for Ukraine. This week, the United Nations has warned  that this is the ``fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World  War II.'' I am proud that we are taking the moral obligation of  humanitarian assistance seriously.   Together, these measures, in addition to the strong leadership shown  by President Biden working quickly and in close consultation with our  allies and partners, have placed enormous pressure on President Putin  and his corrupt oligarchs to end this war. I hope that he does that  immediately.   The final thing that I am going to say is to echo what I began with.  This bill is not perfect through the eyes of anybody, whether you are a  liberal Democrat like me or whether you are a conservative Republican,  and this rule allows people to express their support and their lack of  support for different parts of this bill very clearly.   Some think that the defense section is too high. I personally do. But  we have an opportunity to be able to vote yes or no on that.   Some think that the investments in domestic spending are too high. I  think they are not high enough, but whatever. People have an  opportunity to be able to vote yes or no on that.   So, I hope that we can get support for the rule. I hope that we can  get this legislation passed today, sent over to the Senate, and help  the American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say that I have enormous respect for the gentleman from  Oklahoma. There is this old adage that says you don't have to agree on  everything to agree on something. Much of what he cited is something  that I think we can all agree on: investments in medical research,  support for the NIH, investments in trying to find ways to manage and  cure cancer. All of those things are incredibly important, and I think  they bring us together.    Some of the things he said I disagree with. I believe it is a mistake  to deny women their legal reproductive rights, and I think the defense  budget is way too big. Spending more on something doesn't necessarily  get you a better result. We need to spend more efficiently and more  effectively. We have a military budget that is so bloated, that is so  excessive, so filled with cost overruns, that even Dr. Strangelove  would be impressed. We need to do better.   Having said that, I am aware that we have to be able to deal on  legislation within the reality that we live in. We have a 50/50 Senate;  we have a majority here in the House, not as big as I would like.  Hopefully, that changes in November. But the bottom line is, we have to  work with what we have. I think that is what has occurred here.   We continue to hear this claim that President Biden's climate  policies are somehow to blame for the latest spike in gas prices. I  think we need to just set the record straight here. Domestic energy  production is up, it is rising, and it is approaching records. There  are over 9,000 approved drilling permits the oil industry is not using.  The truth is that changes in domestic energy policy often take years to  impact global energy markets.   Instead, what is happening here is oil companies are using Putin's  war as an excuse to jack up prices at the pump even more. They argue  for looser regulations, cheaper drilling, and more pollution.   This is Putin's price hike. Quite frankly, at this time of global  crisis, I  [[Page H1384]]  would like to appeal to the patriotism of Big Oil in this country to  not make record profits their priority, to actually put the American  people's interest and, in fact, the global interest first. Let's not  fool ourselves that greed isn't at play here.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a March 4 opinion article  written by the House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul  Grijalva, entitled ``Oil and gas lobbyists are using Ukraine to push  for a drilling free-for-all in the U.S.''                     [From the Guardian, Mar. 4, 2022]    Oil and Gas Lobbyists Are Using Ukraine To Push for a Drilling Free-                            for-All in the US                            (By Raul M Grijalva)         Last week, we all watched in horror as Vladimir Putin       launched a deadly, catastrophic attack on Ukraine, violating       international treaties across the board. Most of us swiftly       condemned his actions and pledged support for the Ukrainian       people whose country, homes and lives are under attack.        But the fossil-fuel industry had a different take. They saw       an opportunity--and a shameless one at that--to turn violence       and bloodshed into an oil and gas propaganda-generating       scheme. Within hours, industry-led talking points were oozing       into press releases, social media and opinion pieces, telling       us the key to ending this crisis is to immediately hand US       public lands and waters over to fossil-fuel companies and       quickly loosen the regulatory strings.        Our top priority must be ending Putin's hostilities, but as       chair of the US House committee on natural resources, I feel       duty-bound to set the record straight. We can't let the       fossil-fuel industry scare us into a domestic drilling free-      for-all that is neither economically warranted nor       environmentally sound.        Despite industry's claims to the contrary, President Biden       has not hobbled US oil and gas development. In fact, much to       my deep disappointment and protest, this administration       actually approved more US drilling permits per month in 2021       than President Trump did during each of the first three years       of his presidency. Before the pandemic, oil and gas       production from public lands and waters reached an all-time       high, and the current administration has done little to       change that trajectory over the last 13 months.        Fossil-fuel companies and their backers in Congress also       profess that more drilling on public lands and waters would       lower gas prices for Americans. But if that's true, why       hasn't record oil extraction from both federal and non-      federal lands over the last decade done anything to       consistently lower, or at least stabilize, prices at the       pump?        The fact is that crude oil is a volatile global commodity.       Worldwide supply, demand, and unpredictable events--like       wars--influence the price of gas, not the current       administration's decision to approve a few new leases or       permits.        Even if we take industry's claims at face value, nothing is       keeping fossil-fuel companies from more drilling on public       lands right now. The oil industry already controls at least       26m acres of public land and is sitting on more than 9,000       approved drilling permits they're not using.        They have a similarly gratuitous surplus offshore, where       nearly 75% of their active federal oil and gas leases,       covering over 8m acres, have yet to produce a single drop.       Any new leases issued today wouldn't produce anything of       value for years, or even decades in some cases.        If industry did start to ramp up production from federal       leases, the overall increase to the total US supply would       likely be marginal. In 2020, public lands and waters only       accounted for 22% and 11% of oil and gas production,       respectively. The vast majority of oil and gas resources are       beneath state and private lands--not public lands or federal       waters.        With the facts laid bare, we see the fossil-fuel industry's       crocodile tears for what they are--the same old demands for       cheaper leases and looser regulations they've been peddling       for decades. These pleas have nothing to do with countering       Putin's invasion or stabilizing gas prices, and everything to       do with making oil and gas development as easy and profitable       as possible.        The US is the world's top oil and gas producer. Doubling       down on fossil fuels is a false solution that only       perpetuates the problems that got us here in the first place.        And quite frankly, we can't afford to maintain the status       quo. In its newest report the Intergovernmental Panel on       Climate Change (IPCC) issued its most dire warning yet on the       rapidly accelerating climate crisis. If we fail to enact       major mitigation efforts, like curbing fossil-fuel       development, both quickly and substantially, we will ``miss a       brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a       livable and sustainable future for all''.        Fortunately, there is a path forward that simultaneously       cuts the lifeline to fossil-fuel despots like Putin,       stabilizes energy prices here at home, and creates a safer,       more sustainable planet. We must wean ourselves off our oil       and gas dependence and make transformational investments in       cleaner renewable energy technologies, like those in the       Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Build Back Better Act and       the Competes Act, and we must do it now.        The fossil-fuel industry has had hold of the microphone for       far too long. It's time we let the facts speak for       themselves.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to correct the record on one thing. The gentleman said he  didn't get a copy of the text of what we are considering here today. It  was put into his Dropbox, and he could have downloaded it. It was  emailed to his staff. It was posted online. Yeah, we didn't print off a  3,000-page bill because I believe in saving trees. But it was  available, and I just want to point that out for the record. I will  also just say--and again with great respect for my two colleagues on  the Rules Committee--I don't share their enthusiasm about big oil  companies. I just don't. They are making all-time-high record profits  while Americans are paying more at the gas pump.   I will remind my friends that when Donald Trump was President, we had  unemployment at about 14.9 percent, which was terrible. It is now down  to 3.8 percent, which is driving up demand. Nobody is questioning the  fact that there is a supply-and-demand problem here. But we also ought  to understand that part of these price hikes, in addition to the Putin  price hike, is the oil company price hike, and as we try to figure out  how to alleviate the burden on the American people, which we are trying  to do, we also have to figure out how we do it in a way where any  savings or any tax incentives that we might provide are actually passed  on to the consumer because the oil industry in this country, the big  oil companies, have a history of price gouging, and the fact that they  are doing it now I think is unconscionable.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Give me a break. I hope my friends know better, and I hope they know  what drives the price of oil. They talk as if there is just one little  switch you can turn on. I hear them talking, just bring the Keystone  pipeline back online. By the way, it was never built, and it was years  away from bringing any oil to the United States--foreign oil, by the  way; Canada is another country. Even if it were built, we are told it  may lower prices by maybe one cent a gallon and lock us into the same  dependence on fossil fuels that got us into this mess to begin with.   We have been arguing for years with my friends to make the transition  away from fossil fuels to greener, cleaner energy so every time there  is a world crisis we are not having this discussion, but instead they  continue to be in the pockets of the oil companies. Follow the money.  Follow the money. Look where the oil companies are putting their money.   By the way, when they say we should do more drilling, the oil  companies now have been provided 9,000 new drilling permits on public  lands. Much to my disappointment, the Biden administration is actually  outpacing even the Trump administration in approving new drilling  permits on public lands and water. So give me a break.   Here is the reality, and let me spell it out for my friends; and I  think they know better, but again it is politics as usual: Oil is a  global commodity. Prices rise when supply chains are disrupted or  demand is interrupted, like we saw during COVID. Prices rise when oil- producing countries launch destabilizing invasions; and, yes, when oil  companies think they can use either of these as an excuse to jack up  the prices, they do.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a March 4 article from  Newsweek entitled, ``'Little Evidence' Keystone Pipeline Would Level  Prices Despite GOP Claims.''                       [From Newsweek, Mar. 4, 2022]    `Little Evidence' Keystone Pipeline Would Level Prices Despite GOP                                   Claims                           (By Alexandra Hutzler)         Republicans are hitting President Joe Biden over his       decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline as gas prices       rise across the country in the wake of Russia's invasion of       Ukraine.        Former Vice President Mike Pence said last week ``gas       prices have risen across the country because of this       Administration's war on energy--shutting down the Keystone       Pipeline, shutting down oil and gas leases in this country--      while they were incomprehensibly green-lighting the Nord       Stream 2 deal for the Russians.''        Senator Tim Scott told Fox News on Wednesday canceling the       pipeline was ``catastrophic'' and that ``the prices we're       seeing today are reflective of his decisions a year ago, not       reflective of the conflict that started days ago.''        But James Glynn, a senior research scholar at Columbia       University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said the       Keystone pipeline--even if operational--likely wouldn't have       had an impact on the global energy markets.        ``There is little evidence to back up the argument that       Keystone XL would have averted some of this price spike,''       Glynn told Newsweek. ``The Keystone pipeline capacity is less       than one-tenth of Russian oil exports.''        ``Even if Keystone XL was filled with fully additional       Canadian export capacity, which would have been an unlikely       scenario, it would not balance the global oil markets where       the price of oil is set through a global arbitrage of the       last marginal available barrel,'' Glynn continued.        The current national average for a gallon of gasoline is       $3.837, according to the American Automobile Association       (AAA). That's an increase of over 20 cents from the national       average reported the week before.        The White House has also emphasized that the Keystone       Pipeline was never running, and was less than 10 percent       completed when the project was shut down, amid criticism from       the Republican Party.        ``The Keystone Pipeline has never been operational,'' press       secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday ``It would       take years to have any impact. I know a number of members of       Congress have suggested that, but that is a proposed solution       that has no relationship or would have no impact on what the       problem is we, here, all agree is an issue.''        The pipeline project would have expanded an existing       conduit for transporting tar-sands oil from Canada through       the U.S. to the Gulf Coast. After years of legal challenges       and environmental activism to shut the project down, the       company behind it officially halted construction in June 2021       after Biden revoked a key permit.        ``The Keystone pipeline is not a viable solution because       you can't build a pipeline in an hour, right?'' David Sacco,       a practitioner in residence in the finance program at the       University of New Haven, told Newsweek. ``The company that       was building it shut it down a year ago. So that's not       viable. But I think the argument that our energy policies       have been a pretty significant contribution to this [crisis]       are certainly valid from an economic standpoint.''        Sacco said there's an argument to be made that the U.S. and       other nations purchasing oil from Russia has ``allowed their       economy to strengthen, has allowed Putin to basically fund       his military and expansion policies.''        In addition to rising prices, Republicans have hit the       Biden administration for energy policies they say make the       U.S. more dependent on foreign oil.  [[Page H1387]]         ``Biden has given up the best defense we had against       Putin's evil vision for the world--energy independence,''       Senator Marsha Blackburn said in a statement this week. ``We       need to make America energy independent again. It's time to       divest from Russian energy and stop funding Putin's war, and       reauthorize the Keystone Pipeline.''        One energy proposal that has received bipartisan support on       Capitol Hill is to ban Russian oil imports. House Speaker       Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she was ``all for'' the proposal.        While Biden has said ``nothing is off the table,'' the       administration has so far resisted slapping Moscow's energy       sector with sanctions because it could further drive up       prices at the gas pumps.        Sacco said he believed gas prices could go up to $5 per       gallon as the Russia-Ukraine crisis unfolds.        Biden has said it's a priority for his team to ease the       financial burden on Americans as prices rise. The       administration just announced it is coordinating with other       nations to release 60 million barrels of oil in global       reserves, half of which would come from the U.S. Strategic       Petroleum Reserve.        ``The American people understand that defending democracy       and liberty is never without cost,'' Biden said last month       while speaking on the Russia-Ukraine crisis.     Madam Speaker, I also urge all my colleagues to do a  little research and look at the profits of Big Oil in this country.  Look at what they are making. While Americans are paying more at the  pump, their executives are making more and more and more. You can  defend Big Oil if you want. And I get it, maybe there is some benefit  politically to doing that. Again, follow the money. But I have to tell  you, I think people are sick of this. We have seen this movie before.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).                                time  1000     Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We are all trying to figure out a way to alleviate the burden of  energy costs on consumers. I mean, it is brutal for a lot of families  in this country.   Listening to some of the speeches here, I kind of feel like we should  have an amendment that would require Members of Congress to take a  basic course in economics to understand how supply and demand works.   Again, the oil companies have 9,000 leases that they are not  utilizing as we speak.   I include in the Record an article titled ``Exclusive: Oil companies'  profits soared to $174 billion this year as U.S. gas prices rose.''                     [From the Guardian, Dec. 6, 2021]  Exclusive: Oil Companies' Profits Soared to $174bn This Year as US Gas                                Prices Rose                             (By Oliver Milman)         The largest oil and gas companies made a combined $174bn in       profits in the first nine months of the year as gasoline       prices climbed in the US, according to a new report.        The bumper profit totals, provided exclusively to the       Guardian, show that in the third quarter of 2021 alone, 24       top oil and gas companies made more than $74bn in net income.       From January to September, the net income of the group, which       includes Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP, was $174bn.        Exxon alone posted a net income of $6.75bn in the third       quarter, its highest profit since 2017, and has seen its       revenue jump by 60% on the same period last year. The company       credited the rising cost of oil for bolstering these profits,       as did BP, which made $3.3bn in third-quarter profit.       ``Rising commodity prices certainly helped,'' Bernard Looney,       chief executive of BP, told investors at the latest earnings       report.        Gasoline prices have hit a seven-year high in the US due to       the rising cost of oil, with Americans now paying about $3.40       for a gallon of fuel compared with around $2.10 a year ago.        The Biden administration has warned the price hikes are       hurting low-income people, even as it attempts to implement a       climate agenda that would see America move away from fossil       fuels, and has released 50m barrels of oil from the national       strategic reserve to help dampen costs.        But oil and gas companies have shown little willingness so       far to ramp up production to help reduce costs and the new       report, by the government watchdog group Accountable.US,       accuses them of ``taking advantage of bloated prices,       fleecing American families along the way'' amid ongoing       fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.        ``Americans looking for someone to blame for the pain they       experience at the pump need look no further than the wealthy       oil and gas company executives who choose to line their own       pockets rather than lower gas prices with the billions of       dollars in profit big oil rakes in month after month,'' said       Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US.        The analysis of major oil companies' financials shows that       11 of the group gave payouts to shareholders worth more than       $36.5bn collectively this year, while a dozen bought back       $8bn-worth of stock. This apparent focus, rather than on       further drilling, has caused some frustration within the       federal government, with Jennifer Granholm, the US energy       secretary, stating that ``the oil and gas companies are not       flipping the switch as quickly as the demand requires.''        A glut of new oil drilling has made the US awash with oil       in recent years, turning the country into a top-level       exporter as well as domestic supplier, but this has kept       prices low to the displeasure of investors.        ``A lot of this has been driven by investor sentiment,''       said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC       Capital Markets, of the current reluctance to expand       production. ``They don't want them to spoil the party.''        The situation has left the White House in an awkward       position with its commitments to rapidly reduce planet-      heating emissions, with environmentalists furious at       administration attempts to expand drilling and fossil fuel       companies also unhappy over some of its earlier climate-      related moves, such as shutting down the controversial       Keystone XL pipeline.        The oil and gas industry has fought Joe Biden's attempts to       pause new drilling permits on federal land, despite its       unwillingness to expand operations in order to reap the       returns of costlier oil and the fact the industry currently       sits on 14m acres of already leased land that isn't being       used, an area about double the size of Massachusetts.        ``It's not the government that is banning them from       drilling more,'' Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond       James, told CNN. ``It's pressure from their shareholders.''        Aside from its role in the current high gasoline prices,       the oil and gas industry is a leading driver of the climate       crisis, the reality of which it sought to conceal from the       public for decades. and is a key instigator of the air       pollution that kills nearly 9 million a year, a death toll       three times that of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.        The American Petroleum Institute, a leading industry lobby       group, pointed to a blog that blamed the Biden administration       for policies that ``significantly weaken the incentives to       invest in America's energy future'' but did not answer       questions on production rates of oil companies.     Madam Speaker, I love the fact that we can't even get  anybody to express the slightest bit of outrage over the fact that oil  companies are gouging us, making record profits, while Americans are  paying more at the gas pump.   I mean, I get it. They are very supportive of some on the other side,  but, I mean, give me a break. I think the American people understand  this.   We need to figure out a way to lower gas prices to alleviate the  burden on working families here. But to get up and defend oil companies  and oil company executives and put forward bills and ideas that are oil  companies' wish lists when they have 9,000 leases right now that they  are not utilizing--and why? Because they are making record profits.   I would also say to my colleagues that the underlying bill that we  are dealing with here today contains a lot of good stuff. The gentleman  from Oklahoma alluded to it in his opening remarks about the incredible  investments in medical research.   I was at the White House, as was the gentleman from Oklahoma, when  President Biden announced the relaunch of his Cancer Moonshot program.  I mean, the issue when it comes to curing cancer is not whether we can.  The issue is when we will do it. That depends on investments. That  depends on supporting innovation and medical research. This bill does  that. That is a good thing. It should bring us all together.   As we have talked about, we are going to deal with a bill to help  Ukraine, especially with humanitarian assistance, given the refugee  crisis. We are going to strengthen the Global Magnitsky law so that we  have stronger human rights language, which some of my friends on the  other side of the aisle, unfortunately, have opposed.   I am reading in The New York Times today an article, ``Republicans,  Once Harsh Ukraine Critics, Pivot to Strong Support.'' I am glad about  that. I am hoping that the people who called Ukraine the most corrupt  country in the world under the previous administration will now at  least vote to support that country as they are under attack by Vladimir  Putin.   Anyway, there is some really good stuff in this bill, and I am  looking forward to getting to the debate on this.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman asked a question: Are we  going to pick America or our adversaries? Interesting question. My  friends on the other side have spent all of their time criticizing  President Biden and very little mention of Putin. I think that says it  all.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the Members that things  are going exactly according to plan. Everything is beautiful in its own  way.   In a few moments, I will withdraw this rule. It has been a long day,  but we have some important work to do in front of us. I am excited  about what we are about to do with the omnibus and the aid to Ukraine.  We will finish it today. I feel pretty good.   We will reconvene the Rules Committee to report a new rule on the  items before us. I expect the new rule to be on the floor pretty  quickly. I hope we get bipartisan support for all these important  measures. I don't have anything else to say.   Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the rule.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 973 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 973         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       2471) to measure the progress of post-disaster recovery and       efforts to address corruption, governance, rule of law, and       media freedoms in Haiti, with the Senate amendment thereto,       and to consider in the House, without intervention of any       point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on Appropriations or her designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-35 modified by the       amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. The Senate amendment and the       motion shall be considered as read.

The two portions of the divided question       shall be considered in the order specified by the Chair.

All points of order against consideration of the       joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the  [[Page H1391]]       joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 4.

All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways       and Means or their respective designees; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 5.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 7007) making       emergency supplemental appropriations for coronavirus       response and relief for the fiscal year ending September 30,       2022, and for other purposes.

Sec. 6.  House Resolution 972 is laid on the table.                                time  1800     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), who is my good friend, pending which I yield myself such  time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all  time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 973, providing for consideration of the Senate  amendment to H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Appropriations Act. It  provides for a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 2471  with a House amendment and self-executes a manager's amendment. It  divides the question on adoption of the motion into two votes in the  order specified by the chair, and provides that if any portion of the  divided question fails, then the House shall be considered to have made  no disposition on the Senate amendment.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 75, the  Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, under a closed rule, and  provides one motion to recommit.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 6968, the Suspending  Energy Imports from Russia Act, under a closed rule. It provides 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means and provides one  motion to recommit.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7007, the COVID  Supplemental Appropriations Act, under a closed rule, and provides one  motion to recommit.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations for H.R. 2471, H.J. Res. 75, and H.R. 7007.   Finally, the rule tables House Resolution 972.   Madam Speaker, at this point, I am a big believer that less is more.  I have spoken about the important aspects of what we are doing here  today earlier, so I will not repeat it.   Madam Speaker, I urge everybody to support the rule and support the  underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I don't have any other requests for  time.   Does the gentleman have any additional requests for time?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We talked about this earlier. I don't want to belabor the point, but  I just want to make sure my colleagues understand there are 9,000 wells  that are currently unused. Oil companies are experiencing record  profits, $174 billion in profits, while they gouge American consumers.   As for the Keystone pipeline, when people say to just turn on the  switch, there is no switch to turn on. It was never completed. By the  way, even if it was completed, estimates are that maybe it would save  you a penny on a gallon of gas.   Maybe the time has come for us to have a serious conversation about  energy independence that involves an acknowledgment that we need to  wean ourselves off of fossil fuels. We need to actually care about the  environment and dealing with climate change. And we need to tell the  oil companies, especially during this crisis, to work with us to help  the American people get through this difficult time--in fact, help the  world get through this difficult time. But there is no excuse for price  gouging.   Madam Speaker, I have no other requests for speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me again thank my friend from Oklahoma for his comments and for  him being so accommodating during this day that began really early this  morning.   Let me also thank the staff of the Rules Committee, Democrats and  Republicans, who work incredibly hard. I think this entire Congress and  the American people owe them a debt of gratitude.   I also want to thank Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger  and the staff, both Democratic and Republican, of the Appropriations  Committee for all of the incredible work that they have done.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous  question. The gentleman is right that American consumers need relief  right now, and we ought to be having a discussion on how to help  alleviate the burden of high energy costs right now.   The problem with what my Republican friends are proposing is it  purports to provide relief 20 years or 30 years down the road. We need  to find mechanisms right now to help lower costs to consumers, and we  have to find a way to do it so that whatever we do  [[Page H1393]]  gets passed on to the consumers and not just absorbed by the oil  companies, as we have seen in the past.   We also need to get serious about renewable energy and about dealing  with the climate crisis. I mean, we should have done it a long time  ago. We would probably be having a very different conversation right  now.   So as we deal with Putin's price hike, let's understand that, you  know, there is an immediate issue that what they are proposing doesn't  even begin to address and there is the long-term issue. I would rather  have a long-term solution that is not so reliant on fossil fuels.   What we have in this omnibus bill will help this country, will help  everybody, will help every State, will make a real difference in  people's lives. It will help our kids in school. It will help the  parents of those kids get good jobs. It helps provide additional  resources to medical research to try to find cures to life-threatening  diseases like cancer. There are so many good things in here.   There are obviously things that we all don't agree on or see eye to  eye on. The gentleman mentioned the changes that he liked. No surprise  that I don't like all of those changes that he liked. He doesn't like  some of the things that I like. But that is the way this works,  especially when we have to negotiate four corners, which means  Democrats and Republicans have to work things out and you have a Senate  that--well, I don't want to go there. Anyway, the bottom line is, we  ought to get this done.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' on the rule and a ``yes'' on the  previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 973         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security,       encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum       products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6858.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
