 Madam President, today I wish to recognize and  honor the extraordinary service and sacrifice of Jeffrey Holt, a  firefighter from Brownsburg who served in the Lawrence Fire Department.  Selflessness, caring for others, and service to his community were  defining traits of Jeff's life.   On the morning of April 30, 2018, Jeff was participating in an annual  physical assessment training when he collapsed and suffered an apparent  heart attack. He passed away at Indiana Heart Hospital. Jeff's death  left his fellow firefighters without one of their leaders, and he will  be sorely missed by his fellow firefighters and loved ones.   Jeff was a graduate of Indiana's Benton Central High School. After  finishing high school, he worked at the Otterbein Fire Department in  Otterbein, IN, as a firefighter and then as an EMT and subsequently  joined the Purdue Fire Department in 1985. In 1994, Jeff began training  to be a paramedic and, while training, met his future wife, Lindi. In  1996, he began his service in the Lawrence Fire Department as a  firefighter and paramedic. Over the course of his career with the  Lawrence Fire Department, Jeff served as an engineer, lieutenant,  division chief of training, and deputy chief of operations.   Outside of work, Jeff pursued his passion for music and was the lead  singer in several bands. He shared this love of music and rescuing  special needs animals with Lindi, his wife of nearly 20 years.   He is survived and deeply missed by his wife, Dr. Lindi Holt,  stepdaughters Jennifer and Rachael Kempfer, parents Dr. Donald and  Marilyn Holt, brothers Dr. Steve Holt and Bill Holt, sister Kathy  Stichnoth, as well as nieces, nephews, and a great-nephew.   Jeff represented the best of Hoosier values. He put his life on the  line day-in, day-out, serving his community and working to keep his  fellow citizens safe. Those who knew Jeff described him as well-liked  and respected, compassionate, dedicated, and loyal. Jeff set a strong  example for others, and let us remember and emulate the example this  selfless man set for us and honor his commitment to serving his  community.   On behalf of Hoosiers, we mourn with Jeff's family, the men and women  he served with, and the Lawrence community. His legacy will live on and  his memory will not be soon forgotten.                            ____________________
