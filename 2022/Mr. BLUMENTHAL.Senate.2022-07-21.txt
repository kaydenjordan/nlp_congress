 Mr. President, I am honored to appear with a group of  my colleagues on behalf of the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act.   We are here to talk about this essential measure in the post-Roe  world. That is a phrase I never thought I would ever utter anywhere,  not to mention on the floor of the U.S. Senate. But we are living in  the post-Roe world where reproductive rights are under assault as never  before and critical reproductive healthcare services are more necessary  and also are more at risk than ever before. That is why a consistent,  strong source of funding for title X Family Planning Programs are  absolutely critical and urgent. That is the purpose of the Expanding  Access to Family Planning Act.   What it means for the State of Connecticut is, in the past, $2.5  million in title X funding, allowing patients, mostly women--45,000 of  them--critical access to comprehensive family planning and preventive  healthcare services. What we are talking about here is not only family  planning but also testing and treatment for sexually transmitted  diseases, lifesaving cancer screening, and other essential health  services. And they are all now at risk.   What they need is the strong and consistent source of funding that  this measure would provide, doubling--literally, almost doubling the  number of dollars but also guaranteeing over a 10-year period that  clinics will receive this funding.   In the State of Connecticut, most of this funding in the past has  gone to Planned Parenthood of Southern New England. The Cornell Scott- Hill Health Center has received some. They have done absolutely  extraordinary work in delivering health services, particularly to women  who are uninsured, women who are of lower incomes, and women who are  younger--under 30. And that is the primary patient pool that needs  these services.   Let me be very blunt. If my Republican colleagues truly care about  supporting families, they can show it by supporting this measure and  funding title X. In the past, since its inception 50 years ago, it has  been bipartisan because people agree that families ought to be a  priority, that decisions about when and whether to have children are  the most important that we make, that caring for families and  particularly prenatal care, screening for sexually transmitted  diseases, cancer screening--these health services are vital to all of  us, whether we are the patient or not, and that they stay funded in the  long run. Preventive healthcare is pound-wise, and it will save money.   We know that the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs strips women of a  vitally important freedom and puts it in the hands of government  bureaucrats: the decision about when and whether to have children. The  least we can do now is to fund the reproductive healthcare services  that will save lives and save futures.   Dobbs has put women at risk. It has put reproductive healthcare in  grave jeopardy. This measure is necessary to mitigate the effects of  Dobbs--more necessary now than ever before. We will never stop fighting  for a woman's right to choose when and whether to have children. We  will never stop fighting to protect a woman's right to access  healthcare that is vital to her own and her children's health.   In the face of mounting attacks on women's health, now is the time to  strengthen title X, and that is why we need this legislation. Passing  the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act will strengthen our entire  healthcare system.   It is simply critical for this $500 million--providing birth control,  cancer screening, other kinds of testing and treatment--to be passed.  And if my Republican colleagues are serious about supporting families,  they ought to be eager to join us. And I am proud to be supporting this  measure, and I am eager to see it signed into law.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on July 11, 2022, I was absent for  rollcall vote No. 243, Executive Calendar No. 599, the motion to invoke  cloture on the nomination of Ashish S.
