 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, first, this morning I would like to  join Kentuckians in McCreary County in breathing a sigh of relief.  Deputy Sheriff Dustin Watkins was responding to a routine call on  Tuesday evening when he was shot and needed to be airlifted to a  hospital. Fortunately, we heard yesterday afternoon that Deputy Watkins  is in stable condition. I understand that last night he was able to sit  up for the first time--all good news.   With Sheriff Randy Waters, I wish to extend sincere thanks to the  doctors, nurses, and hospital staff who are caring for this brave  Kentuckian and will support his recovery. My best wishes go out to  Deputy Watkins, his family, and his colleagues. We thank them for their  service to our Commonwealth as we are reminded once again of the  sacrifices they make every day to keep us safe.                            ____________________     Madam President, this week the Senate has attended to  one of this body's unique responsibilities relating to foreign  affairs--the ratification of treaties. We have ratified bilateral tax  agreements with four trading partners: Spain, Switzerland, Japan, and  Luxembourg. Measures like these bring clarity, certainty, and fairness  to international commerce. They ensure U.S. citizens and businesses  have a level playing field without duplicative tax burdens, and they  make the United States a more inviting destination for foreign  investment.   These newly ratified treaties will provide immediate and much needed  relief to employers in every corner of our country. They will reinforce  support for hundreds of thousands of jobs including many in my home  State of Kentucky. This is a significant bipartisan accomplishment.   Now, standing in stark contrast to the Senate's productive,  bipartisan week is what the Democratic House of Representatives has  chosen to prioritize. We have seen plenty of partisan theatrics and  high drama for the television cameras. We have seen the  [[Page S4924]]  majority spend plenty of time attacking the President and members of  the administration, but virtually nothing in the way of bipartisan  legislation to actually make progress for the American people.   The problem seems to be that so many Democrats have moved so far to  the extreme left that they literally could not pass commonsense  legislation even if they wanted to.   A case in point is the chronic difficulties and consternation that we  have seen over in the House when it comes to the seemingly  straightforward task of condemning anti-Semitism and efforts to  delegitimize the Jewish State of Israel.   Back in March, remember, House Democrats had their hands full dealing  with one of their freshman members who had trotted out age-old anti- Semitic tropes--dual loyalties, support for Israel being driven by  money, the kind of language you would think the House could have  condemned pretty easily.   But instead, after days of internal Democratic strife, all the House  leadership could drum up was a watered-down resolution that sort of-- sort of--gestured vaguely at the problem. All the while, Senate-passed  legislation that would actually do something about anti-Semitism has  been languishing over in the House without a vote.   For more than 5 months and counting, the House has refused to act on  S. 1, the foreign policy legislation that we here in the Senate passed  back in February. This bipartisan bill included a provision to take on  the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, an economic form of  anti-Semitism that targets Israel.   Here in the Senate, taking action against BDS was a bipartisan goal.  I am a passionate opponent of the BDS movement. I know my friend the  Democratic leader opposes BDS as well, and S. 1 earned 77 votes here in  the Senate back then.   But apparently it is a bridge too far for this Democratic House. Even  a milder resolution simply condemning BDS--not doing anything about it,  but condemning it--has become a lightning rod for the far left this  very week.   Reports indicate that ``senior progressive Democrats are urging House  leaders'' to walk away from the resolution condemning BDS--a  resolution, not the thing that we passed, which is much stronger. So  the House will not take action against it, and now it seems they can't  even merely condemn it. They can't even condemn it. In fact, the far  left wants to defend BDS. Let me say that again. The far left in the  House wants to defend BDS.   I guess this is where we are. Elected members of the Democratic Party  are openly urging their leadership not to make them vote on condemning  anti-Semitism. Let me say that again. Elected members of the Democratic  Party are openly urging their leadership not to make them vote on  condemning anti-Semitism--a watered-down version of what we sent them  back in February--because, for some reason, it is just too tough a  vote. What a sad and bizarre situation we find in the House.   I urge the Speaker of the House to do the right thing. Don't let  these far-left voices run the show. At long last, bring S. 1 up for a  vote--the comprehensive legislation that sailed through the Senate with  77 votes. Bring it up for a vote, Madam Speaker. Let them vote. I bet  we would see a pretty good outcome and show anti-Semitism the door.                            ____________________     Madam President, earlier this week, I spoke about the  economic pain that many Americans felt under the last administration's  leftwing policies and all the Trump administration and Republicans in  Congress have done to turn the page.   Today we see the lowest unemployment in nearly 50 years, way more job  openings than job seekers, and an all-American recovery that isn't  limited to just a select few places and industries.   My home State of Kentucky has hit and sustained our lowest  unemployment rate ever recorded--ever recorded. Two thirds of Americans  now say they feel optimistic about where their finances will be a year  from now.   But we know the effects of bad policy are hard to erase. So my  colleagues and I are continuing to fight for the places that are still  struggling to pick up the pieces.   Unfortunately, my home State of Kentucky offers a particular case  study, because nothing shows the difference between the last  administration and this one more clearly than in the case of affordable  energy and the coal industry.   For more than a century, coal has been a reliable and low-cost energy  source that has helped fuel America. Coalfields in both Eastern and  Western Kentucky have provided good jobs and served as critical drivers  of our economy.   Back in 2009, the industry directly employed more than 23,000  Kentuckians. It provided more than 90 percent of our electricity. It  brought billions of dollars in revenue into our State. So we were  especially vulnerable when a Democratic administration came to  Washington that didn't even try to hide its hostility toward Kentucky  coal.   Speaking in San Francisco, then-Senator Obama pledged to bankrupt any  new coal-fired plants and declared that under his plan ``electricity  rates would necessarily skyrocket.'' His Democratic leader of the  Senate said, ``Coal makes us sick.''   So clearly, the elite disdain for fossil fuel in places like New York  City, Chicago, and San Francisco was going to become the law of the  land. Sure enough, the Obama administration declared a War on Coal. It  hurt Kentucky badly. Plants closed. More than 10,000 miners were let  go--10,000 unemployed miners. And then these mass layoffs strained  local social services. Entire communities went into a tailspin.  Unsurprisingly, many of these places experiencing economic distress  subsequently became ground zero in the opioid and substance abuse  crisis as well.   I, and Republicans generally, did all we could to fight. But when we  passed bills repealing the worst regulations, President Obama vetoed  them. When I urged his EPA Administrator to hear from Kentucky  families, she turned me down.   The policies had been dreamt up in places like New York City and San  Francisco for places like New York City and San Francisco. Places like  Kentucky? We were just the collateral damage. So it is no surprise that  all kinds of Americans elected President Trump and Republican  majorities in 2016. And we hit the ground running.   One of the first bills we sent the President was a bill I introduced  to repeal the stream buffer rule, a burdensome part of a series of  regulations designed to make coal prohibitively expensive to mine or to  use. We halted some of the worst regulations, like the waters of the  United States, eliminated the so-called Clean Power Plan, and replaced  them with policies to support American energy dominance.   For former miners and for the industry, the damage can't be unwound  overnight. This very month, we have seen two more major coal producers  in Kentucky move toward bankruptcy. Clearly, even now, all is not well.  That is why my colleagues and I are focused on lending a helping hand.  When healthcare benefits for thousands of retired coal miners and their  families were at risk, I led the effort to secure a permanent extension  and protect coal communities in States like Kentucky.   Congressman Hal Rogers and I established the Abandoned Mine Land  Reclamation Economic Development Pilot Program, which aims to revive  old mine sites into economic drivers again. That program includes  everything from helping dislocated miners develop the skills they need  to transition to a new career, to delivering resources to strengthen  our water infrastructure, to improving the infrastructure and tourist  attractions to draw new visitors and money into Appalachia.   With each program and many others, we are working to revitalize  communities and repair the damage. But many of our Democratic  colleagues are itching to take us right back to the bad old days. The  most prominent voices in the Democratic Party are openly calling to  restart a Big Government assault on fossil fuels and on so many  Americans' livelihoods.   We all remember several months ago when many Democrats embraced an  unabashedly socialist proposal called  [[Page S4925]]  the Green New Deal that would have made the Obama-era War on Coal look  like child's play. Among all of its other craziness, it sought to end  all production of American oil, coal, and natural gas within a decade.  How ridiculous. How absurd.   We had a vote on it in the Senate, and lest we think this was just  some extreme view that only the fringe subscribes to, only 4 of 47  Democrats could bring themselves to oppose the Green New Deal in the  Senate--only 4 of 47 Democrats could bring themselves to oppose the  Green New Deal in the Senate. There were 43 of 47 Democrats who  couldn't vote against this thing. Fortunately, Republicans voted it  down.   But last week, not to be deterred, a number of Democrats rolled out  yet another far-left environmentalist manifesto. This new resolution  calls for--here we go again--a managed phaseout of the use of oil, gas,  and coal to keep fossil fuels in the ground--a managed phaseout of the  use of oil, gas, and coal to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Of  course, this means a whole lot more intrusive Big Government.   The bill calls for a ``massive-scale federal mobilization of  resources''--a ``massive-scale federal mobilization of resources.''  Just imagine what that would entail. And get this: The new manifesto  dictates that our Nation model ourselves after Europe, Canada, and  liberal enclaves like New York and Los Angeles. You just can't make  this stuff up.   The contrast is clear. Republicans are working overtime to rebuild  the conditions for middle-class prosperity, and we are working overtime  to help those who were hit hard in the Obama years. But Democrats are  working to resurrect the same bad ideas that caused much of that damage  and implement them yet again, this time on steroids. The good news is,  as long as this Republican Senate has anything to say about it, none of  these radical job-killing manifestos have a chance of becoming law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to move to proceed to nominations reported out of the Armed  Services Committee today.
