 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Canal Conveyance Capacity Restoration Act,'' which I introduced  today. Representatives Jim Costa (D-CA) has introduced companion  legislation in the House.   The bill has two major provisions, benefiting both drought resilience  and the environment:   First, it would authorize more than $653 million to restore the  capacity of three canals of national importance. Restoring these canals  would improve California's drought resilience and help the nation's  leading agricultural economy comply with limits on groundwater pumping  under the state's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.   Second, the bill authorizes an additional $180 million to restore  salmon runs on the San Joaquin River. The funding is for fish passage  structures, levees and other improvements that will allow the  threatened Central Valley Spring-run Chinook salmon to swim freely  upstream from the ocean to the Friant Dam.   The bill authorizes a \1/3\ Federal cost-share for restoring the  capacity of the Friant-Kern Canal, the Delta-Mendota Canal, and the  California Aqueduct.   Coordinated legislation in the State legislature introduced by State  Senator Melissa Hurtado would authorize a \1/3\ state cost-share for  restoring the canals' capacity. Under the coordinated Federal and State  legislation, the locals would also be responsible for a \1/3\ cost- share for the canal restoration projects.   This legislation would help California water users and California's  nation-leading agricultural industry comply with a recent State  requirement to end the overpumping of groundwater. The stakes are huge:  bringing groundwater into balance will reduce the water supply of the  San Joaquin Valley by about 2 million acre-feet per year.   Unless local water agencies and the State and Federal governments  take action, a recent U.C. Berkeley study has projected severe impacts  from these water supply losses:   798,000 acres of land would have to be retired from agricultural  production, nearly \1/6\ of the working farmland in an area that  produces half the fruit and vegetables grown in the nation; and   $5.9 billion would be lost in annual farm income in a region that is  almost entirely reliant on agriculture and has been called ``the  Appalachia of the West'' due to its severe economic disadvantage.   One of the most cost-effective and efficient ways to restore  groundwater balance is to convey floodwaters to farmlands where they  can recharge the aquifer. California has the most variable  precipitation of any State. When we get massive storms from atmospheric  rivers, there is plenty of runoff to recharge aquifers--but only if we  can effectively convey the floodwaters throughout the San Joaquin  Valley to recharge areas.   Here is where the challenge arises. For a variety of reasons, the  ground beneath the major canals has dropped by as much as 10 to 20  feet, which has caused canals designed to convey floodwaters to buckle  and drop in many places. Other parts of the canals have not subsided,  so the amount of water that the canal conveys must be reduced so that  the canals don't overrun.    As a result, these essential canals for conveying floodwaters have  lost as much as 60% of their conveyance capacity. The bill I am  introducing today would provide Federal assistance to help fix these  Federal canals.   Specifically, the bill would authorize $653.4 million in a Federal  funding-cost share for three major projects to repair Federal canals  damaged by subsidence to achieve their lost capacity:   $180 million for the Friant-Kern Canal, which would move an  additional 100,000 acre-feet per year on average;   $183.9 million for the Delta Mendota Canal, which would move an  additional 62,000 acre-feet per year on average; and   $289.5 million for California Aqueduct repairs, which would move an  additional 205,000 acre-feet per year on average. While parts of the  California Aqueduct are state-owned, the majority of the repairs are on  its federally-owned portion.   If the Federal government covers a portion of the cost of restoring  these three essential Federal canals for conveying floodwaters, it will  give local farmers a fighting chance to bring their groundwater basins  into balance without being forced to retire massive amounts of land.   Critically, the ability to deliver floodwaters through restored  Federal canals will allow the water districts to invest in their own  turnouts, pumps, detention basins and other groundwater recharge  projects. The South Valley Water Association, which covers just a small  part of the Valley, provided my office with a list of 36 such projects  for its area alone.   The Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) has determined that  groundwater recharge projects are the best option to help the San  Joaquin Valley comply with the new state groundwater pumping law. PPIC  projects that the Valley can make up 300,000 to 500,000 acre feet of  its groundwater deficit through recharge projects.   A study commissioned by the coalition group called the ``Water  Blueprint for the San Joaquin Valley'' estimates that required  reductions in groundwater could cause a loss of up to 42,000 farm and  agricultural jobs in the San Joaquin Valley. Another 40,000 jobs or  more could be lost statewide each year due to reductions in Valley  agricultural production, putting the total at approximately 85,000 jobs  statewide. Most of these impacts will fall disproportionately on  economically disadvantaged communities. These impacts will be  significant unless we address them through collaborative planning,  policies, infrastructure, recharge and necessary financial support.   Let me now turn to the three critical canals that the bill would  authorize assistance to restore. The Friant-Kern Canal is a key feature  of the Friant Division of the Federal Central Valley Project on the  Eastside of the San Joaquin Valley. For nearly 70 years, the Friant  Division successfully kept groundwater tables stable on the  [[Page S1988]]  Eastside. This provided a sustainable source of water for farms and for  thousands of Californians and more than 50 small, rural, or  disadvantaged communities who rely entirely on groundwater for their  household water supplies.   But unsustainable groundwater pumping in the Valley has reduced the  Friant-Kern Canal's ability to deliver water to all who need it. Land  elevation subsidence caused by over-pumping means that not all of the  supplies stored at Friant Dam can be conveyed through the canal. In  some areas, the canal can carry only 40 percent of what it's designed  to deliver.    In 2017, a very wet year in which we should have been banking as much  flood water as possible, the Friant-Kern Canal couldn't deliver an  additional 300,000 acre-feet of water that it would have been able to  convey had its capacity not been limited by subsidence. This  significant amount of water would have been destined for groundwater  recharge efforts in the south San Joaquin Valley, where the impacts of  reduced water deliveries, water quality issues and groundwater  regulation are expected to be most severe.   The California Aqueduct serves more than 27 million people in  Southern California and the Silicon Valley and more than 750,000 acres  of the Nation's most productive farmland. But despite its name, much of  the California Aqueduct is owned by the Federal government and serves  portions of Silicon Valley, small towns and communities in the northern  San Joaquin Valley, and farms from Firebaugh to Kettleman City. The  aqueduct represents a successful 70-year partnership between the  Federal Government and the State of California.   In recent years, particularly recent drought years, the California  Aqueduct has subsided. It has lost as much as 20% of its capacity to  move water to California's families, farms and businesses. California  is leading efforts to repair the aqueduct and is working to provide its  share of funding, but the Federal government will also need to pay its  fair share. The bill I am introducing today would authorize $289.5  million toward restoring the California Aqueduct.   The Delta-Mendota Canal stretches southward 117 miles from the C.W.  Bill Jones Pumping Plant along the western edge of the San Joaquin  Valley, parallel to the California Aqueduct. The Delta-Mendota Canal  has lost 15% of its conveyance capacity due to subsidence. The bill I  am introducing today would authorize $183.9 million toward restoring  its full ability to convey floodwaters to farms needing to recharge  their groundwater, and to wildlife refuges of critical importance for  migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway.   This bill responds to a potential crisis that very possibly could  cause the forced retirement of nearly 1/6 of the working farmland in an  area that produces half of America's fruits and vegetables.   These are Federal canals, and the federal government must help give  these farmers and communities reliant on the agricultural economy a  fighting chance to keep their lands in production.   In addition, this legislation helps to restore an historic salmon run  on California's second-longest river, the San Joaquin.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Duckworth, Mr.          Leahy, and Mr. Brown):   S. 1185.
