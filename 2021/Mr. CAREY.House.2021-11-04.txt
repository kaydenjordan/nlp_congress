 Madam Speaker, first, I am humbled to stand here today to  serve in the people's House as a product of the small town of Sabina,  Ohio.   I thank my family: my wonderful wife, Meghan, who is home with our  young son Conrad while we are preparing to welcome a new son into the  world in just a couple of weeks; also, my incredible son Prescott; my  brother Chad; and my loving mother, Debra, who are all here today in  the gallery.   To the people of Ohio's 15th District, from our smallest towns to our  State capital in Columbus, I am truly honored that you have entrusted  me with this solemn duty. Whether you work on a farm, own a small  business, or are a large employer, I promise to fight for our district  and to represent you all with dignity and respect.   The problems facing our Nation today are great and consequential.  Working families need this body to deliver solutions. Today, I am ready  to work for the people of my district and for this great Nation.                            ____________________
