 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Richard and Joni Maples,  two Beardon High School graduates--my mama had them in math class--who  have received this year's Helen Ross McNabb Spirit Award. This award  recognizes folks who have done great work to support the McNabb Center  and the east Tennessee community.   Richard and Joni were both raised by parents who taught them the  values of faith, family, and hard work. They keep these values close to  their hearts, and they make a constant effort to serve folks around  them whenever they can.   This includes supporting the McNabb Center, which is a nonprofit that  provides mental health services to east Tennesseans who need it.  Richard has continuously served the McNabb Center in various board  positions and campaigns since 2012 and stayed involved in a bunch of  other east Tennessee organizations that serve our community.   Of course, this was all done with the unwavering help and support of  his wonderful wife Joni. They are about to celebrate their 50th  anniversary. I can't imagine any woman who could tolerate Richard for  50 years, but she has managed to do that.   They have raised two wonderful children, Matthew and Andrea, and now  they have four wonderful grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, we thank Richard and Joni so much for serving our  community with selfless dedication. I am proud to congratulate them on  receiving the Spirit Award this year. They certainly deserve it. It is  good to see a couple of West Knoxvillians who have done well.                            ____________________
