 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am  so glad that we are gathered here today to honor our colleague.   It is an honor to represent Georgia's Sixth District here in  Congress, and it is truly an honor to hold the seat that Senator  Isakson once held.   Senator Isakson has spent decades in service to the State of Georgia  and to our great Nation. His legacy has left an unforgettable mark on  Georgia and the United States Senate.   He is known in our community for being a friendly neighbor and for  being a truly good man, and I am honored to call him my friend. We  share a passion, a passion to make Georgia the best place to live and  to start a family. We share a dedication to making America a more  perfect union.   I know that I have not been in the Georgia delegation very long, but  I thank the gentleman for putting people over party and for his  commitment to the best policy, which is not always easy politics.   We live in an age where loyalty to partisanship has too often come at  the expense of the American people, and we live in an age where  ``compromise'' has become a dirty word. We live in an age where the  American people have become disillusioned with the American Government.   Senator Isakson has defied that age. Senator Isakson has always been  open to that tough conversation, and he has always been open to finding  commonsense solutions to forge uncommon ground.   That is why I am so proud to follow in his footsteps as the  Representative from Georgia's Sixth Congressional District. It is why I  work so hard to make sure that we are passing bipartisan bills, bills  that will help protect the communities that we truly love.   Madam Speaker, I thank Senator Isakson. I thank him so much for his  service to the people of Georgia and his service to the freedom of our  country.   Godspeed to my friend. God bless.
