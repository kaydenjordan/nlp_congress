 Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I oppose this broad reactionary and irresponsible  amendment because it would harm U.S. interests and undermine scientific  progress for the American people and the world.   There is no question that the PRC poses real challenges to the United  States and that it is engaged in technological and economic competition  with us. We know that the PRC is engaged in harmful research to boost  its military, that it engages in technology and IP theft. These are  challenges worth tackling, and the Biden administration and Congress  have taken steps to protect ourselves against these activities in  effective and responsible ways.   This amendment, however, goes entirely too far. When a careful and  scalpel-like approach is needed to ensure we are not contributing to  China's military or providing China with advanced and sensitive  technology and know-how, this amendment uses a guillotine to cut off  support for any form of research collaboration between the United  States and China.   As drafted, this amendment would prevent any U.S. funding of,  contracting with, or partnership with any individual or entity  connected to the PRC government. Let's be clear about what that would  mean. This would prohibit collaboration with all the major public  universities in China, endangering academic collaboration and research  partnerships between U.S. and Chinese institutions.   We should be worried about AI and supercomputing. This amendment  would cut off collaboration on completely harmless and often very  beneficial social science research on things such as poverty reduction  and economic development.   This amendment would make it harder for American academics and  researchers to partner with the Chinese people, many of them who may  not have any love for the CCP and would benefit from talking directly  to and working with an American and learning about the freedoms and  values that Americans enjoy.   More critically, this amendment would cut off collaboration on  medical research that could literally save lives of Americans and  people around the world. Let me give you one example. Right now doctors  and researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New  York are collaborating with the Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group to  conduct shared clinical trials in hospitals in the United States and  China to develop modern cancer drugs. We need to make sure this  research collaboration happens in a safe and secure way, but why would  we prohibit it? Why would we not want to work together to find a cure  for cancer?   Ultimately, we cannot and must not follow the Chinese Communist  Party's example and close ourselves off to the world and the Chinese  people. That is what they do. That is not what America does.   Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith).    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from San Diego, California (Ms. Jacobs).    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As we consider this amendment today, Ukrainians are suffering greatly  as Russia's brutal war against their sovereignty continues unabated.  Seventy-eight percent of Ukrainians have had either a family member or  a friend die because of Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Cities  have been decimated, families have been broken, and lives have been  lost.   But the Zelenskyy government stands, the fight for democracy is  alive, and Ukrainian willpower is and has been unflappable, and Putin's  so-called ``special military operation'' has become one of the biggest  strategic catastrophes in Russian history as we stand today. Russian  generals are disappearing, and the Wagner group was marching on Moscow,  not Kyiv, just a few weeks ago.   The United States' security assistance has been absolutely essential  for the Ukrainian Army's heroic stand against the invaders of their  homeland. We cannot and must not pull back now. The cost of this war on  the Ukrainian people has been immense, but their bravery has been even  more monumental.   I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I am confident that  it  [[Page H3512]]  will, in fact, be opposed in a strong bipartisan vote.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I request an Advil, and I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chair, do I have any more time remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is consistent with certain members of  the Republican Party's continued opposition to aiding Ukraine.   Our security assistance to Ukraine over the past year plus has been  crucial to Ukrainian efforts to counter Russia's illegal, immoral, and  reprehensible invasion of another sovereign nation.   If Vladimir Putin and our foreign adversaries can invade other  countries without any response from the United States or our allies  around the globe, then every country in the world becomes less safe.   The United States is not fighting a war in Ukraine. We are giving  Ukrainians the weapons they need to fight the war for themselves and  defend their country from totalitarian invaders.   We must support our friends who are standing on the front lines of  the fight for freedom in this world. I oppose this amendment  forcefully, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. Smith).    Madam Chair, in Ukraine, since day one of this  war, attacks have been aimed at civilian structures, hospitals, energy  infrastructure, and urban centers. In the battlefield, Russia has  brutally murdered prisoners of war as their Wagnerites occupied  Ukraine's towns and territory.   Allied military sources say that Russia has landmined Ukrainian  territory at an unprecedented rate, making it one of the largest  minefields in the world. These minefields in war zones and in  agricultural areas will likely cause civilian death and require  billions of dollars to safely remove in the coming years. The World  Bank estimated the cost to be at $37.6 billion.   Ukraine is paying for their freedom with their lives as we speak, but  the mental, emotional, familial, and social scars will be there for  generations to come. Ukrainian citizens are living through a nightmare  because of their push toward democracy during the Revolution of Dignity  in 2014.   This amendment prohibits a feasibility study on centers for treatment  of traumatic brain injuries to improve the lives of individuals  affected by traumatic brain injury experienced in Ukraine as a result  of Russian aggression and to improve the lives of the family members of  such an individual.   Honestly, we should be funding centers across the world because that  is a better expression of democracy than what is often exhibited.   This amendment is callous, and America and our partners' support of  Ukraine's fight for freedom is better than that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. I could  support it but for the limitation clause, which is meant to cut support  for Ukraine. Like all of these amendments, this is meant to undermine  our support for Ukraine. I simply oppose it and urge all of my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, sometimes the devil is in the reading.  The amendment sounds good, but at the end of the day, it cuts support.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).  [[Page H3517]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, which would eliminate the important extension of lend-lease  authority for Ukraine included in the underlying bill.   As Ukraine continues its counteroffensive against Russia's brutal,  unprovoked war of aggression, we must continue doing everything we can  with our allies and partners in support; not just for the future of  Ukraine and its people, but for democracies and free people across the  world opposing brutal autocrats like Putin.   The lend-lease authority this bill extends is one of the many tools  the administration has at its disposal to support Ukraine in its  courageous efforts with critical weapons and defense capabilities.   This authority is one which has bipartisan support, not just in  committee by virtue of the extension being included in the bill, but by  way of bicameral, bipartisan passage in strong support roughly 10  months ago. It was a Republican bill led by Senator John Cornyn, S.  3522, which provided for lend-lease authority for Ukraine that passed  by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, 417-10 in favor, including nearly  200 Republicans.   I call on Members to recognize the importance of ensuring Ukraine has  the tools and capabilities it needs to defend itself, defeat Russia,  and preserve its independence and sovereignty.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. This ties the  administration's hands in how it can best support the people of  Afghanistan living under Taliban rule. It prohibits the use of any  funds authorized via this bill to be used, even tangentially, to aid in  our support of the millions of Afghan women and girls suffering under  Taliban rule or to those Afghans living in poverty and in need of  humanitarian relief.   The administration already jumps through many hoops to ensure that  aid is not moving through Taliban hands. This amendment also removes  the President's ability to issue waivers or licenses to allow for  humanitarian need. This amendment counters our own interests to prevent  humanitarian crises, to assist with detained Americans, and to continue  our ongoing work to relocate all those Afghan allies who worked  alongside the United States over the course of our 20-year war in  Afghanistan.   The amendment strives to be tough on the Taliban without any regard  for the Afghan people, which will just embolden the Taliban and create  further discord and distrust between the United States and Afghanistan.   The amendment is a red herring. The bogeyman word in this amendment  is the Taliban. What this amendment does is ties the hands of the  administration by requiring sanction mitigation to go through Congress.  That is the job for the administration. With the dysfunction of this  Congress, you should not even ask us to put toilet paper in the  bathroom. This amendment would make that humanitarian aid illegal and  people would die.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the text is not in the Constitution; it  is in the bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Smith).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chair, the last election proved that the  majority of the people did trust the President. They voted for him.   I just restate that we don't send money to the Taliban. We send money  to USAID and charitable organizations. They use the money to help the  people directly.   This amendment would make that work, that very important critical,  diplomatic, strategic work illegal, and then people would die. They  would die with that red blood.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2110     Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I want to say how important it is to  read bills and to read amendments. Once again, this amendment removes  the President's ability to issue waivers or licenses to allow for  humanitarian need.   This amendment counters our own interests to prevent humanitarian  crises, to assist with detained Americans, and to continue our ongoing  work to relocate all of those Afghan allies who worked alongside the  United States over the course of our 20-year war in Afghanistan. Mr.  Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
