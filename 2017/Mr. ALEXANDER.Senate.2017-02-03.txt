 Madam President, with this vote, the Senate will move  early next week to confirm the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the U.S.  Education Secretary. In my judgment, she will be an excellent and  important Education Secretary for this country.   The No. 1 job of the U.S. Education Secretary is to help create an  environment in which our 100,000 public schools succeed, because that  is where 9 out of 10 of our children go.   When I was Education Secretary for President George H.W. Bush in the  early 1990s, I had the privilege of working with a man named David  Kerns, who had been the chief executive officer of the Xerox  Corporation. He came in as the Deputy Education Secretary at a time  when he was not only one of the country's leading businessmen, but he  was also the leading businessman who tried to help change public  education. David Kern's belief was that it was very difficult to help  children by changing public education if you try to do it from within.  As all of us do, he respected the teachers, the parents, and the  students who work within the public education system, but over the last  30 years, as this country has worked to try to improve our public  schools, much of that energy has come from outside the public school  establishment. Among those were the Governors of the country.   In the mid-1980s, all of the Governors met together--in 1985 and  1986--on one subject for a whole year. The purpose was, how can we help  improve our public schools? I was chairman of the National Governors  Association that year, Bill Clinton was the vice chairman, and we did  that in a bipartisan way. We did that from outside the schools. Since  that time, many Governors and many business leaders have worked hard in  support of our public schools, trying to help them have even better  opportunities for our children. Among those has been Betsy DeVos. The  Governors I spoke of are Governors who are familiar names in this  country. I think of Gov. Jeb Bush, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, Gov.  Mitt Romney, and the work they did in their respective States to make  their public schools better and to create other opportunities for  children. All of the three Governors I mentioned--Bush, Romney, and  Engler--support Betsy DeVos.   As chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, there are 22  Governors who have written letters to me supporting Betsy DeVos. They  see her as someone from outside the system of public education who, as  they worked for 30 years, can help change and improve it.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record following my remarks the names of the 22 Governors who support  her. They come from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois,  Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri,  North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma,  Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.   The Governors of all those States support Betsy DeVos. Four of the  last Education Secretaries support Betsy DeVos. Bill Bennett, Rod  Paige, Margaret Spellings, and I support her. Joe Lieberman, who served  in this body and worked on the DC voucher program for many years,  endorsed her. She has strong support from the Governors who for 30  years have been working hard to successfully improve our public  schools.   Some have said: Well, she has spent her time working on giving  children choices of schools other than public schools.   She has done that, and it has always puzzled me as to why anybody  would criticize that. The idea that a low-income child should have the  same opportunity or more of the same opportunities as a wealthy family  has would seem to me to be a very all-American idea. Not only does it  seem to be, it is an idea that underlies the most successful piece of  social policy our country has ever enacted, arguably--the GI  [[Page S665]]  bill for veterans in 1944. Think about that. The veterans came home  from World War II. We gave them a scholarship. It followed them to the  college of their choice. Ms. DeVos has argued for the same thing for  children. Why is an idea that has helped to create the greatest  generation and the greatest colleges of the world so dangerous for  schools?   I would argue that she has been among the forefront of the leaders-- like the Governors--for the most successful reform of the last 30 years  to change and improve public education, and that would be the public  charter schools. Those began with 12 schools in Minnesota created by  the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in the early 1900s. Since then,  charter schools have been supported by every President--President  Obama, President Clinton, Presidents Bush. President Obama's most  recent Education Secretary was a founder of charter schools. Four  times, this Congress, by big bipartisan majorities, has supported  charter schools. The last six U.S. Education Secretaries have supported  charter schools. Charter schools have grown from 12 Democratic-Farmer- Labor schools to 6,800 today, and 2.7 million children attend them.  Teachers have more freedom and parents have more choices. They are  public schools, and Betsy DeVos was in the forefront of helping to  create that opportunity for public education.   Finally, she believes what 85 of us voted for in the law that  President Obama called a ``Christmas miracle'' in December of 2015, and  that is to reverse the trend from a national school board and restore  control of our children and our schools to those closest to the  children. There will be no mandates for common core, no mandates for  teacher evaluation, no mandates for vouchers, and no mandates for  anything else from a U.S. Department of Education headed by Betsy  DeVos. We will be swapping a national school board for what she  believes in, which is a local school board, which is what 85 of us  voted for.   I am pleased to support her.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record following my remarks an article published by Max Eden on January  29, 2017, which shows Detroit charter schools--by three major studies-- are better and children perform better than the traditional schools of  Detroit.   I look forward to casting my vote for Betsy DeVos for U.S. Education  Secretary early next week.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      Highlights Among DeVos supporters         22 State Governors, including:        Gov.

It's no       surprise that the education establishment was perturbed by       the selection of a school choice advocate, and opposition       from interest groups is to be expected.        But in an era when the president of the United States has       declared a ``running war'' on the media, accusing reporters       of distorting facts to attack him, the work of one education       journalist unfortunately lends some credence to that       argument.        Some critical coverage has been responsible and fair, but       DeVos was sadly not ``spinning'' when she told the Senate       that there's been a lot of ``false news'' about her record.       The New York Times has been most conspicuous in this regard.       The editorial angle of its national education correspondent       Kate Zernike was clear from her first piece on the nominee,       ``Betsy DeVos, Trump's Education Pick, Has Steered Money From       Public Schools.''        Liberal bias at the Times is less than a non-story; if       anything, I'd argue a partisan press is healthy in a       pluralistic democracy. But when America's ``paper of record''       makes verifiably false claims, they must be checked and       corrected. Here are two significant ones.        In a front-page June article titled ``A Sea of Charter       Schools in Detroit Leaves Students Adrift,'' the Times       education correspondent asserts that ``half the charters       perform only as well, or worse than, Detroit's traditional       public schools.''        That claim was echoed by a Times editorial and would be       big, if true. DeVos was nominated based on her school choice       advocacy. If that work helped foster charter schools that are       worse than the worst-in-the-nation Detroit Public Schools,       that would be profoundly troubling. But if Detroit's charters       are better (even if not as much better as we'd desire), then       it's a different story entirely.        Fortunately, they are better.        There are three key studies that compare Detroit's charter       and district schools: one from Stanford University, one from       the center-right Mackinac Center and one from Excellent       Schools Detroit (ESD), a local education nonprofit. As Jason       Bedrick, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for       Educational Freedom, and I demonstrated in Education Next,       all three show that charters significantly outperform       district schools. Perplexed at how the Times reached the       opposite conclusion, I reached out to Zernike.        Some critics assumed that Zernike was twisting data from       the Stanford study, the presumptive source of district-to-      charter comparisons. But Zernike informed me that she chose       to use the ESD study after contacting the Stanford study's       author and determining that the data was too outdated for her       purposes.        I asked why she chose the ESD data over the Mackinac       Center's. Mackinac grades schools using a complex regression       taking into account students' socioeconomic background. ESD       grades on a combination of raw test scores, test-score growth       and a school climate survey, but it doesn't consider       socioeconomic status.        She explained that Mackinac is ``a partisan group that is       pro-school choice and anti-DPS. ESD, despite how GLEP [the       DeVos-backed Great Lakes Education Project] will characterize       it, supported charters and traditional public schools, and       the measures seemed broader.''        When I told her that sounded more like political than       methodological reasoning, she countered, ``It's not politics,       it's methodology. I think graduation rate was the only thing       Mackinac used to compare,'' and added that she thinks the ESD       data ``do break down for demographics.'' Wrong and wrong.        Now, it's possible that she didn't simply default to the       politically congenial option without further scrutiny.       Perhaps she just failed to properly recall the details       several months later. Whatever the case, the ESD data also       show charters outperforming district schools.        So, how did the Times national education correspondent       reach the opposite conclusion?        Now, bear with me, here because it's complicated and it       makes no sense.        First she separated out K-8 district schools and high       schools, calculating their respective average scores,       weighted by student enrollment. She included high-performing       selective-admissions district schools and excluded low-      performing Detroit public schools that have been taken over       by the state. (Neither decision is justifiable in a       traditional-to-charter comparison.)        Then she saw that for both K-8 district schools and high       schools, the (inflated) weighted average score was higher       than the median charter school score, and concluded that       ``half the charters perform only as well, or worse than,       Detroit's traditional public schools.''        On the high school side, the unweighted average score of       .33 is significantly lower than the weighted average of .41.       It's worth noting that the .41 is above the charter median       score and the .33 is below it. So going by the weighted       average was the only way to arrive at that result for high       schools.        On the K-8 side, the weighted and unweighted averages are       essentially equal. That average is indeed slightly higher       than the median charter score, but it's much higher than the       district's median score. So on K-8 schools, by her same       faulty logic, it would also be accurate to say that ``two       thirds of the public schools perform only as well, or worse       than, Detroit's traditional public schools.''        If that sounds silly, it's because comparing an average to       a median is statistical nonsense. The ``apples to oranges''       metaphor is apt but insufficient here. Essentially, Zernike       took a basket of apples, pulled out the rotten ones, kept the       genetically modified ones, made statistically weighted       applesauce, and plopped that applesauce in the middle of a       row of organic oranges. Then she drew a false conclusion       that's become central to the case against Betsy DeVos's       nomination for secretary of education.        Personally, I doubt the mathematical mistakes were       conscious or intentional. But what really matters is that the       ESD, Mackinac and Stanford studies all show Detroit charters       significantly outperforming traditional public schools.  [[Page S666]]         The second claim also involves the Times's editorial       against DeVos, in this case lamenting that she funded charter       advocacy efforts, ``winning legislative changes that have       ``reduced oversight and accountability.'' The editorial       linked to a December article by Zernike covering a       legislative debate on Detroit charter regulation wherein       ``Ms. DeVos pushed back on any regulation as too much       regulation.''        Whatever the rhetorical merit of that editorial claim, it       is flat false. In a Detroit News op-ed, to which the article       later links, DeVos called for two additional regulations: A-F       school accountability grades and default closure for failing       schools, both charter and district. She certainly pushed back       on some regulations as too much. But the bill that passed       included the additional accountability regulations for which       she advocated. In fact, the final legislation boosted       Michigan's accountability score on the National Alliance of       Charter School Authorizers index.        Given the fact that the main subject of her article was a       net increase in charter accountability, Zernike admits on       Twitter that she's ``not sure what the ed board meant by       that,'' but notes that ``MI legislation in 2011 (not June       bill) did weaken oversight.'' Zernike's December article       refers to the 2011 legislation in one passing sentence. Her       June article noted that ``the law repealed a longstanding       requirement that the State Department of Education issue       yearly reports monitoring charter school performance.'' While       true, that provision didn't merit mention among the 12 key       changes in the official legislative summary (five of which       increased charter regulation).        It's possible that the Times's editorial was referring to       that repealed reporting requirement from 2011 when it claimed       that DeVos backed ``legislative changes that have reduced       oversight and accountability.'' But that seems unlikely,       given that the editorial linked to Zernike's December article       on the 2016 legislative debate and that piece doesn't even       mention the 2011 provision. It seems more likely that the       editors honestly confused an increase in accountability that       was smaller than some stakeholders wanted with an actual,       absolute reduction. And given the reporting they relied on,       it would be hard to blame them.        Education blogger Alexander Russo has skillfully outlined       the ``problematic media coverage'' of Betsy DeVos, in which       journalists have latched onto hyper-simplified story lines       while ignoring complexities and eschewing nuanced criticism.        Whatever your take on DeVos or the media, everyone loses       when the line between fact and falsehood is blurred beyond       distinction. At a time when the president's advisers proudly       tout ``alternative facts,'' critical, fact-based reporting is       more necessary than ever, especially from outlets with the       weight and influence of The New York Times. Their readers,       and America's schoolchildren, deserve better. Correcting the       record would be a good start.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
