 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  this rule and for the underlying legislation, a bipartisan measure that  will make all of our communities safer and will save lives.   I would like to thank Chairman McGovern for his fair consideration of  H.R. 8 and the proposed amendments that came before the Rules  Committee.   This is an important time in our Nation's history. Over 80 percent of  Americans have come together to support universal background checks.  This is a new day, and this is the time to act now.   Since the tragedy in Newtown about 6\1/2\ years ago, this House has  held 54 moments of silence, but we have not held one moment of action.   With Speaker Pelosi's leadership, we now have a chance to vote for  two--two--bipartisan bills which will help save lives.   As a gun owner and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I was  proud to introduce H.R. 8 with my bipartisan colleagues. I look forward  to its consideration tomorrow, and I urge my colleagues to support this  rule today and the bill tomorrow.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act.   This public lands package represents a real investment in our natural  heritage.   By protecting over 1.3 million acres as wilderness, and making  significant expansions of some of our most sacred national parks, this  legislation will ensure that our public lands are pristine and  accessible for our children and grandchildren.   As a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman, I am especially proud that this  package includes legislation from my ACCESS ACT that is crucial to  sportsmen and sportswomen across the country.   This includes my legislation to permanently reauthorize the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, our nation's most successful conservation  program in all 50 states, for over 50 years.   And, S. 47 includes my language to encourage innovative ways for  citizens to work alongside natural resource agencies to conserve  wildlife and its habitat.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who worked to  negotiate this important public lands package and I urge my colleagues  to vote yes on S. 47.
