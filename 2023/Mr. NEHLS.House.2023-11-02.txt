 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment prohibits the National Park  Service from placing any limitation on the number of air tours at our  Nation's parks. There are over 45,000 commercial scenic air tours over  our national parks every year. These air tour operators provide that  breathtaking experience for visitors that should remain, if not even  increase.   I have been following this issue for quite some time now, and I don't  think people really fully understand what is going on here. Two decades  ago, Congress passed the National Park Air Tourism Act which required  the National Park Service and the Federal Aviation Administration to  work together to develop air tourism management plans for any park that  had 50 or more annual air tours over its landscape.                                time  1330    After 20 years of bickering and bureaucratic incompetence,  jurisdictional fights between Federal agencies, and the actions of what  we would see in a kindergarten, neither the National Park Service nor  the FAA had completed their congressional mandate.   An effort was spearheaded by radical environmentalists whose sole  goal is to end air tours because they think noise ruins the experience  of visitors and the animals who live there.   As a result of these efforts, in 2019, a court ordered that any park  hosting 50 or more sightseeing air tours a year develop a management  plan by August 2022. Twenty-four parks are named in the resulting court  order, and some of these parks developed plans that will drastically  reduce the number of air tours or outright ban them.   This is completely nuts. Did they depose an elk or a moose or a trout  and find that these air tours offend them? Give me a break.   These air tours are not reserved for the millionaire and billionaire  class, as some of my colleagues like to pretend. They are utilized by  families, the disabled, the elderly, and middle-class Americans.   I will also point out that the level of noise from our air tours is  decreasing every year with technological advances and investments from  our air tour operators, not to mention many of the flights fly at an  altitude that people on the ground wouldn't even notice.   If there are any Democratic staffers or Members listening to this  right now, I would like them to answer this question. We hear a lot of  talk about fairness, equity, and civil rights, but if we reduce or  phase out air tours, then what is your plan for the disabled or the  elderly? How are they supposed to traverse these landscapes? Where is  the fairness there?   Air tour operators offer a crucial alternative for individuals who  cannot easily walk the often treacherous terrain of our national parks.  I understand some of these more radical environmentalists believe these  flights disrupt the natural landscape and experience because of noise,  but what about the families that have children who are disabled or  those who want grandma and grandpa to participate in that family  vacation? Who is advocating for them? Where is the sympathy for them?  And who the hell are we to deny them that experience?   Let's do the right thing and save our air tours and ensure access for  our elderly and the disabled by supporting my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar).    Mr. Chair, I couldn't agree more with my colleague from  Arizona.   The only ones against this, it appears, are the environmentalists  because I haven't talked to a moose or an elk or a trout that has found  these tours offensive.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would simply prohibit funds to  be used for the shooting of cattle in the Gila National Forest or any  other national forest.   Folks, let me tell you why this issue is so important.   I am offering this amendment to ensure that the voices of the  concerned residents of New Mexico and cattle grazers across the country  are heard. The Forest Service has been using your hard-earned taxpayer  dollars to issue and execute aerial kill orders for feral cattle in the  Gila National Forest due to environmental concerns.   The Forest Service defines feral cattle as cattle without brands, ear  tags, or other signs of ownership. However, it is oftentimes difficult  to tell the difference between a feral cow and a non-feral cow. My  staff and I tried it. We couldn't tell the difference.   Even if the cows are feral, under New Mexico State law, feral cows  are the property of the New Mexico Livestock Board, which opposed the  actions taken by the Forest Service to shoot these cattle in the first  place.   Cattle grazers are rightfully concerned that their own branded cattle  could have ventured into the area in question due to fences being  burned down by wildfires or damaged from an unusually strong monsoon  season.   The area in question in the Gila National Forest comprises over  500,000 acres, and only 19 of the estimated 50 to 250 feral cattle were  killed.   After the aerial shooting of cattle takes place with high-powered  rifles, the Forest Service leaves the cattle carcasses to decompose  without removal. They don't care.   The Forest Service is clearly appeasing radical environmentalists and  is not taking in the concerns of local landowners and cattle grazers.  Even New Mexico Governor Grisham, the very liberal Governor, said that  the Federal Government needed to do a better job of listening to  residents about this issue.   To my colleagues in Congress: Whether it is local landowners, cattle  grazers, the New Mexico Livestock Board, the New Mexico Farm Bureau, or  Grant County cattle growers, they have all voiced their support for my  amendment.   To my colleagues on the left: Even prominent animal rights  organizations, such as Animal Wellness Action, the Animal Wellness  Foundation, and the Center for Humane Economy have all come out in  support of my amendment.   With that, I believe I should be able to sit down.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I don't believe I have to say anymore.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of my amendment  before us today, which would prohibit funds for the EPA's Clean School  Bus Program.   Let's get right to it, folks. Every Member of Congress and their  staff searching for a pay-for, here it is. Cite this worthless program.   There is no need for the American taxpayer to continue to foot the  bill for activities like this. This program provides $5 billion, with a  b, over 5 years to replace existing schoolbuses with zero-emission and  low-emission models.   While everybody knows that schools are failing our students, the  Biden administration would rather facilitate the transition of  schoolbus fleets to zero-emission, low-emission, and electric bus  alternatives when we have perfectly capable buses now that work every  day.   A majority of eighth graders in our Nation are at basic and below  proficiency levels when it comes to math and reading, yet we are  focused on electrifying our bus fleets. Help me make that make sense.  [[Page H5336]]    With limited government funds and a national debt out of control, pet  projects for this radical environmental ideology are not functional and  has no place in a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.   Furthermore, EPA's top watchdog also said that he is not confident in  the way the Agency has been handing out billions of dollars under this  new program. He said: ``We have seen this before: the equation of an  unprepared agency dispensing an unprecedented amount of money times a  large number of struggling recipients equals a high risk of fraud,  waste and abuse.''   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to prohibit funds for  EPA's so-called Clean School Bus Program and to prioritize the most  immediate needs of the American people.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, buses are a mode of transportation to get our  prized possessions to the school.   Now, my colleague mentioned about the kids talking with the bus  driver saying, How far can the bus get? They are trying to do some  math. I would probably figure the kid probably doesn't even know the  math, because our schools are failing, so the point is it is  prioritizing the need.   We have to help educate our kids. The school system is failing. They  are failing in States across our country, mostly in these very, very  large cities run by liberals, mayors and city councils, so let's get  our priorities straight and let's help the kids and not worry about the  mode of transportation we have to get them there.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
