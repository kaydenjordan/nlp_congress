 Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon       with a request to confirm a highly qualified nominee. Dr. Brent Neiman       is nominated to serve as the sixth Assistant Secretary of the Treasury       for International Finance and Development.            [[Page S9730]]              Finance Committee members voted in November of last year--let me       repeat: November of 2021, more than 13 months ago, over a year--to       approve Dr. Neiman's nomination on a strong bipartisan basis. This is       not a controversial nominee. His nomination has waited long enough. And       there are a lot of challenges waiting for him at the Treasury       Department. For example, China's lockdowns are creating a ripple effect       throughout international supply chains. It is one of the major causes       of the inflation that has been clobbering family budgets in Oregon and       across the country the last few years.        Dr. Neiman will also have a role to play in dealing with the fallout       of Russia's brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine. He will directly       address the economic impact of sanctions and the price cap on Russian       oil. He will be involved in maintaining maximum pressure to hold Putin       accountable for the horrors of the unprovoked, unjustified war that       Vladimir Putin started.              Dr. Neiman will also work on the critically important issue of       currency manipulation by foreign governments. This is a subject that       the Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, has taken very seriously.       Most importantly, the Treasury Department urgently needs an expert at       the helm to address these issues and solve complicated policy questions       that have everything to do with the global economy.        Dr. Neiman is the right man for the job. His qualifications are       undeniable. Following an education in economics and mathematics, he       served on the staff of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and       the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He brings very valuable private       sector experience. Let me underline that to our colleagues, real       private sector experience.        At the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, his decades       of research have contributed to his expertise on international       macroeconomics, finance, and trade.        He is an excellent choice for a very challenging job that handles a       lot of difficult issues. I strongly support his nomination for this       especially important, urgently needed post at the Treasury Department.       He has support from both sides of the Senate Finance Committee. His       nomination has waited long enough.        For that reason, I ask unanimous consent that as in executive       session, the Senate consider the following nomination: Calendar No.       545, Brent Neiman to be a Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury; that       the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;       that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid       upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the       Senate's action.         Mr. President, I think this is very unfortunate. We very       much need to have this post filled, and we are going to stay at it       until Dr. Neiman, a very distinguished individual whose talents are       immense and fit for the job, is approved.                                      ____________________                Madam President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent       that the Committee on Environment and Public Works be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1154, and the Senate proceed to its       immediate consideration.         I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a       third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made       and laid upon the table.         Madam President, I would like to make a few points about       provisions in the omnibus that are based on the Unclaimed Savings Bond       Act. I want to explain why there are changes from the original       legislation to the version we are voting on today. The Treasury       Department has indicated that they will not always be able to match the       serial numbers of the bonds with the names and addresses that Congress       is requiring them to provide under this act.        States and other supporters recognize that there may be       administrative and fraud prevention problems with releasing serial       numbers for unclaimed bonds into the public sphere when there are no       other identifying markers on the bonds. That is the only reason that       the language concerning the transmission of serial numbers for bonds to       the states has changed from ``shall'' to ``may''. The intention is to       give the Treasury Department the flexibility they need to prevent       fraud, but I fully expect that the Treasury will endeavor to provide       the serial numbers to the States, especially when they are associated       with names and/or addresses. I believe, for example, that digital       copies of the bonds, where they exist should be shared with the States.        Also, as it relates to this set of provisions, I want to clarify the       term-of-art of ``paper bond'' in the description of ``applicable       savings bonds.'' Paper bonds in this context are not the physical       bonds, but rather bonds that were originally issued in that form. The       purpose of the Unclaimed Savings Bond Act, incorporated in this bill,       is to give the States the ability to find the owners and heirs of these       unclaimed savings bonds, and I intend for the Treasury to write their       regulations in a manner that respects the States and only limits the       transmission of data when there is a tangible risk for fraud or theft       or the like.                                      ____________________
