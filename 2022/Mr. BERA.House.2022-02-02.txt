 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a looming crisis  that we see in Eastern Europe.   Last week, as a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I had  a chance to accompany some of my colleagues on a bipartisan delegation  to both Brussels and Ukraine.   What I saw when we were in Ukraine, as we met with their senior  leaders and President Zelensky, was a country that has resolve. They  reminded us that they have been at war with Russia for the last 8 years  since Russia invaded Crimea and occupied the Donbas territories. So,  this is a country that has been fighting Russia. They are prepared to  defend themselves.   When I went out on the streets with my colleagues and talked to  ordinary Ukrainian citizens, there is a resolve. They have no intention  of living under Soviet rule. They have tasted freedom.   It is important for us as the United States of America to stand with  this young democracy. We are the oldest democracy in the world. When I  have been asked by the media why the United States should be concerned  about what is happening in Eastern Europe, it is because we value the  freedoms that we enjoy; we value the liberty; and we value the ability  of individual citizens to choose their own path forward. That is what  this is about.   When we went to Brussels, we had a chance to meet with our NATO  allies, with other members of the European Union. Think about what we  accomplished working with those countries in the 75-plus years post- World War II. We created peace on the European Continent after two  world wars. We created thriving democracies. We created prosperity.  That is what is at risk.   Think about what Mr. Putin wants to do. He wants to reestablish the  Soviet Union. He is an autocrat. That is what is at risk in the 21st  century.   It is not a given that democracy will win the 21st century. We have  to fight for democracy. We have to fight for those liberties. We have  to fight for those individuals to choose their path forward.   That is why this is important. That is why it is important for us to  stand with the people of Ukraine. That is why it is important for us,  along with our European allies and our NATO allies, to stand together  and speak with one voice and tell Mr. Putin we are not going back to  the Soviet era; we are going forward to a peaceful, prosperous 21st  century for all people.                            ____________________
