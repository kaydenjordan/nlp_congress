 Madam President, last Friday, our country lost a  trailblazer for equality, a moral giant, and a lover of justice--the  great Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, affectionately known as RBG. While  physically small, she had a towering impact on American jurisprudence.  While the volume of her voice was not high, her words carried farther  and had a greater impact than the louder voices that were often around  her.   She famously observed that many of the laws on the books that  pretended to put women on a pedestal actually put them in cages, and  then she proceeded to bring cases to strike down those discriminatory  walls. She transformed America's legal landscape, especially in the  area of gender equality, and that was before she was even appointed and  confirmed to the Supreme Court.   On the Supreme Court, with intelligence and persuasion, she was often  able to bring others to her point of view, and when she couldn't, she  could write a stinging dissent, which she viewed as a conversation with  the future. She had optimism in our Nation's pursuit of justice--that  her dissents would be vindicated in time, and I dare say that they  already have in so many cases, including her dissent in the voting  rights case with the reprehensible 2013 decision where, on a 5-to-4  vote, the Supreme Court took a bite out of the Voting Rights Act. She  predicted that as soon as that happened, many of the States that had  been subject to the preclearance provisions would begin to put up  barriers to voting, and that is exactly what happened.   Speaking of the future, her deathbed wish communicated to her  granddaughter--her most fervent wish--was that she not be replaced  until a new President is installed, whoever that President may be.   She died last Friday on Rosh Hashanah. It was a moment when the  country needed to come together to celebrate her life and honor her  legacy, and that is what so many people did around the country. We saw  an outpouring of support from coast to coast, north to south, east to  west. We saw large crowds gathering at the Supreme Court. But here in  the U.S. Senate, the majority leader didn't have the decency to even  provide a respectful pause, a respectful timeout to honor that legacy.  Just over 1 hour after her death was announced, he put out a statement  announcing his power play--a statement saying that President Trump's  nominee, whoever it may be to replace her, would get a vote. The  majority leader rushed to do that despite taking the opposite position  in March of 2016 when Justice Scalia passed away and President Obama  nominated Merrick Garland.   The majority leader rushed to commit to that vote on President  Trump's nominee even though, in the middle of this COVID-19 pandemic,  we have not even had a chance to vote here in the Senate on the Heroes  Act, which passed the House of Representatives over 4 months ago,  providing emergency comprehensive relief to families and workers and  small and medium-sized businesses that are hurting from this pandemic.  We haven't had a vote on that in 4 months. Yet, within 1 hour of  Justice Ginsburg's death, the Republican leader announced: ``We will  have a vote'' on President Trump's Supreme Court nominee.   Our country just reached the grim total of 200,000 Americans dead  from COVID-19. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than in any other  country on the planet, and a big share of those dead are the direct  result of President Trump's calculated indifference--what he describes  as ``downplaying'' the threat. Well, downplaying a known threat led to  inaction, and inaction led to thousands more Americans dying than would  have been the case. That inaction has led to far more economic pain and  fallout from COVID-19 than had to be the case.    We wouldn't have all of these schools closed right now if the  President had taken more rapid action and if we had comprehensive  universal and rapid testing. But here we are because Trump wanted to  ``downplay'' the threat.   The President has opposed the Heroes Act, which passed the House of  Representatives, and there is still no vote here in the Senate on that  important legislation to help a country in need--so no vote on that.  But, my goodness, they just couldn't wait to announce, within 1 hour of  the Justice's passing away, that this Senate would vote on Trump's  Supreme Court nomination.   That is despite what Majority Leader McConnell said in 2016. When  Justice Scalia passed away and President Obama nominated Merrick  Garland to fill the seat, you heard Senator McConnell and many  Republicans say: Can't do it. We are in the middle of an election year.   In fact, the majority leader went so far as to instruct his  Republican Members not even to meet with Merrick Garland. They didn't  even have a hearing for Merrick Garland. The majority leader and so  many Republican Senators said: Oh, we can't do that because primary  voting has begun in this 2016 Presidential election year. Primary  voting has begun. It is underway. It is important to let the American  people weigh in on the Presidential election and then allow whoever  wins that Presidential election to make their nomination to the Supreme  Court.   That is what we heard from Senator McConnell and so many of our  Republican Senate colleagues back in 2016--that democracy required that  the people's will be heard in the Presidential election year.   Well, it turns out that all of that was just a pure political ploy;  that we are going to see one set of rules for Democratic Presidents  like Barack Obama and another set of rules from the Republican majority  for Republican Presidents like Donald Trump. The dishonesty and rank  hypocrisy is obscene, and the American people, regardless of party, see  it for what it is.   But as bad as the hypocrisy and the dishonesty is, this is about even  more than that. In fact, it is about much more than that. It is about  the future direction of our country and the direction of justice in our  Nation. It is about whether we have a Supreme  [[Page S5745]]  Court that truly stands for equal justice under law, as Justice  Ginsburg did. It is about whether we will protect women's rights, as  Justice Ginsburg did throughout her career before and after being on  the Supreme Court.   We know where President Trump stands on that. We know he was asked  during his Presidential campaign on national television about a woman's  right to reproductive freedom. He said that women who would choose to  have an abortion should be punished--should be punished. And he has  said that he will appoint a Justice who will make sure that is what  happens. That is what he said.   We are going to see a Justice who wants to strike down workers'  rights and protections, and we are going to see a Justice who wants to  destroy the Affordable Care Act.   The Affordable Care Act provides important protections to the  American people during ordinary times. It is especially important now,  as we face this COVID-19 pandemic. We know it has been the goal of  President Trump and Republicans for years to destroy and overturn the  Affordable Care Act. After all, I think many of us remember being right  here on the Senate floor in the summer of 2017. The Speaker of the  House, Paul Ryan, and a majority of Republicans in the House at that  time had passed a law to overturn the Affordable Care Act. President  Trump was itching to sign it. But here in the Senate, we defeated that  effort by one vote--one vote in the U.S. Senate.   Why did that happen at the time? A lot of people thought it was a  forgone conclusion that this Republican majority Senate would vote to  strike down the Affordable Care Act. It is because the American people  rose up and said: Hell no. People with diabetes, cancer, heart disease,  and other preexisting health conditions, and so many other Americans  said: Do you know what? This isn't a partisan issue. It is not a  partisan issue if I have cancer or diabetes or asthma or other  preexisting conditions. Don't take it away.   Guess what. COVID-19 is not a partisan disease either. It will strike  people, of course, regardless of political party.   So the American people got to the phones, got to social media,  occupied people's offices, and they said: Hell no. And by one vote, we  protected the Affordable Care Act here in the U.S. Senate   That should have been the end of the story, but it wasn't because  what Republicans could not do through the democratic process here in  the U.S. Senate, they decided to take to the courts. President Trump  and his Attorney General Barr are in court right now, trying to do  there what they could not succeed in doing here in the U.S. Senate-- trying to destroy and overturn the Affordable Care Act.   Guess when the Supreme Court hearing on that Affordable Care Act case  is scheduled to take place: November 10--November 10, 1 week--1 week-- after the November 3 election.   So we see the power play here: Jam through a Supreme Court nominee.  Put them on the Court in time for that hearing so they can hear the  case and be part of overturning it.   Make no mistake, President Trump has pledged to appoint a Supreme  Court Justice who will knock down the Affordable Care Act. We don't  know who it is going to be, but we know it is going to be somebody who  the President believes will strike down the Affordable Care Act.   How do we know that? Here is what Candidate Trump said: ``If I win  the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike  Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.'' That is Candidate Trump  in June of 2015.   Here is what Candidate Trump said on another occasion:         I'm disappointed in [Justice] Roberts because he gave us       ObamaCare. He had two chances to end ObamaCare. He could have       ended it by every single measure and he didn't do it, so [it       is] disappointing.    He says this on numerous occasions--numerous occasions.   He also tweeted out that in 2012, he supported--this is 2012 when  now-Senator Romney was running for President. Donald Trump tweeted out  then: I am 100 percent supporting Mitt Romney's position that we need a  Justice on the Court to strike down ObamaCare.   So nobody should be playing any games. The President has told us he  is going to nominate somebody to strike down the Affordable Care Act.  That hearing is scheduled 1 week after the November 3 election.   All of those issues are at stake right now. It appears that we have  enough Republican Senators who have said that we will proceed to  consider the nomination. They have abandoned the position that Mitch  McConnell, the Republican leader, and so many Senators took in 2016  with Barack Obama--President Obama--when they refused to provide a  hearing. So we are going to proceed. But let's remember the President  has pledged that he will nominate somebody who will get rid of the  Affordable Care Act and who will strike down a woman's right to choose.  That is what the President has said.   Just as the American people began to get to the phones and on social  media and to contact their Senators in the summer of 2017 when  healthcare was at risk, when the Affordable Care Act was at risk, we  need to make sure that the word gets out again. Back in 2017, we  stopped that from happening by one vote in the U.S. Senate because the  American people understood what was at stake.   Here we are now, in a global pandemic. Instead of focusing on the  pain the American people are feeling at the moment, instead of allowing  us to vote on the Heroes Act, we have this Republican majority trying  to power through a Supreme Court nominee to strike down the Affordable  Care Act, to do through the courts what they were unsuccessful doing  here on the Senate floor in the summer of 2017.   Let's recognize the consequences of this abuse of power and the  impact and harm it will do to the American people. Let's take the  advice and dying wish of Justice Ginsburg: Allow the American people to  speak on November 3 and then allow whoever is sworn in on inauguration  day in January to put forward a nominee to be considered by the U.S.  Senate.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an  extraordinary constituent, Dr. Rolf H. Eppinger, who passed away on  August 14, 2020. Dr. Eppinger's outstanding work has saved the lives of  many Americans and will save many more in the years to come.   Dr. Eppinger had a distinguished 34-year career with the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA. There, he performed and  led fundamental biomechanics research that resulted in the development  of crash test dummies, the interpretation of their measurements, the  advancement of the prevention of crash injuries, and the reduction of  the severity of crash injuries.   His work has helped save hundreds of thousands of lives and many more  injuries worldwide. NHTSA has estimated that in the United States, as  of 2017, more than 50,000 lives have been saved by airbags, 374,000 by  safety belts, and 11,000 by child restraints. Many times more serious  injuries were prevented or ameliorated.   The work of Dr. Eppinger and his team formed the basis for the New  Car Assessment Programs now in use worldwide.   Over the course of his career, Dr. Eppinger published more than 120  technical papers dealing with automotive safety and was the holder of  two U.S. patents. In addition, he enjoyed sailboat racing and was an  accomplished watercolorist, pen and ink artist, woodworker, boat  builder, and general handyman.   Dr. Eppinger is remembered for his rigorous scientific medical and  engineering research, integrity, decency, and humility.   I ask my colleagues to join me in sending our gratitude for Dr.  Eppinger's outstanding contributions and our deepest condolences to his  wife Karen, his children Justin and Dwight, his daughter-in-law Kelly,  and his grandchildren Alice and Hugo.                            ____________________
