 Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Chairman Scott  for yielding and for his tireless, incredible, and brilliant  leadership.   I include in the Record a letter from The Leadership Conference on  Civil and Human Rights expressing their strong support for H.R. 582.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.        Vote Recommendation: Support the Raise the Wage Act of 2019         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse       membership of more than 200 national organizations to promote       and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the       United States, we write to express our strong support for the       Raise the Wage Act of 2019 (H.R. 582). This important       legislation would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to       $15 an hour by 2025, index it to median federal wages, and       ensure that all tipped workers, working people with       disabilities, and young people get paid at least the full       minimum wage. Passage of the Raise the Wage Act is a top       legislative priority of our coalition. We urge you to vote       YES on final passage of a clean bill and NO on any Motion to       Recommit (MTR) in connection with this legislation. The       Leadership Conference will score both of these votes in our       voting record for the 116th Congress.        At the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, one       of the founders of The Leadership Conference, Black labor       leader A. Philip Randolph, noted, ``Nor is the goal of our       civil rights revolution merely the passage of civil rights       legislation. Yes, we want all public accommodations open to       all citizens, but those accommodations will mean little to       those who cannot afford to use them.''        This week, the House of Representatives has the opportunity       to champion working people by passing the Raise the Wage Act       of 2019. In February 2019, I testified at a hearing held by       the U.S. House Committee on Education & Labor entitled       ``Gradually Raising the Minimum Wage to $15: Good for       Workers, Good for Businesses, and Good for the Economy.''       What I said then remains true today: low-wage working people       are overdue for a raise. For decades, wages for most people       in America have stagnated while productivity has increased.       This has been particularly true for low-wage earners.       Congress has not raised the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an       hour since 2007. And the tipped minimum wage has been stuck       at $2.13 an hour since 1991.        Raising the federal minimum wage is a racial and gender       justice issue. The National Women's Law Center has noted that       women make up nearly two-thirds of those earning the federal       minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Women of color are more likely       than any other group to be paid the lowest wages.        Paying tipped workers the full minimum wage would rectify       longstanding injustices and ensure that no one works for       pennies in America. The subminimum wage that tipped workers       receive is rooted in the history of slavery. The practice of       tipping proliferated in the United States after the Civil War       when the restaurant and hospitality industry, exemplified by       the Pullman Company, ``hired'' newly freed slaves without       paying them base wages. The effect was to create a permanent       servant class, for whom the responsibility of paying a wage       was shifted from employers to customers. Today, poverty rates       for people who work for tips are more than twice as high as       rates for working people overall--with female tipped workers,       especially women of color, at a particular disadvantage.       According to the 2012-2015 ACS data on gender and race for       tipped occupations, of the almost 6 million tipped working       people in our country, 66 percent are women. And women of       color are disproportionately represented in the tipped       workforce.        As with the tipped minimum wage, the subminimum wage under       Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act that allows       people with disabilities working in segregated settings to be       paid less than the minimum wage leaves this community       vulnerable to poverty and exploitation. The National       Disability Rights Network believes that ``sheltered workshops       have replaced institutions in many states as the new       warehousing system and are the new favored locations where       people with disabilities are sent to occupy their days.''       Enacted in 1938, Section 14(c) reflects what should be a       bygone era of how we as a nation treat people with       disabilities. The time has come for federal action to support       and fully integrate people with disabilities into the       workplace.        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released a       report looking at the potential effects of increasing the       federal minimum wage to $15 an hour incrementally through       2025 and found that the benefits strongly outweigh its costs.       The CBO report predicted that this gradual increase would       decrease the number of individuals living in poverty by 1.3       million people and disproportionately increase the incomes of       families that are low-income.        The civil rights community has long supported a universal       floor for wages that would provide a base line for all people       in our country. Indeed, one of the core demands of the 1963       March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was for ``[a]       national minimum wage that will give all Americans a decent       standard of living.'' Cost of living data show that in all 50       states today a single working person without children       currently needs or will soon need a wage of at least $15 per       hour to cover basic living costs. Working people with       children and those in high-cost states will need even more.        Fair wages are essential for working people to cover basic       expenses like housing, food, transportation, childcare,       health care, and other necessities. We urge you to vote for       clean passage of the Raise the Wage Act of 2019--and against       any MTR that is offered--to address the economic security       concerns of working families. Thank you for your       consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Vanita Gupta,                                                 President and CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  bill, the Raise the Wage Act. This critical bill would increase the  minimum wage to $15 an hour and give 33 million workers a raise,  including 16 million people of color who are disproportionately paid  poverty wages.   Once more, it would lift 1.3 million Americans out of poverty.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue. The current minimum wage of  $7.25 is a poverty wage, plain and simple.   I, too, am a former business owner with hundreds of employees who saw  firsthand how productivity was achieved and increased by paying good  wages.   These poverty wages must end for everyone. Homelessness is rising.  People can't afford to pay their rent. They are living on the edge.   No one in the richest nation on Earth should be struggling like this,  working two and three jobs just to survive.   Mr. Speaker, I have been proud to have joined my union brothers and  sisters, along with the attorney general of Minnesota, former co-chair  of the Progressive Caucus, Keith Ellison, and my union brothers and  sisters on picket lines, in rallies, and marches in the fight for $15.  I want to thank them for their bold and committed leadership.   When we fight, we win.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on raising the wage to $15 an hour.   I thank Chairman Scott, again, for his leadership.
