 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would direct the Army Corps to  expedite and complete dredging in Plymouth Harbor in time for the 400th  anniversary celebration of the Mayflower landing in Plymouth and  Provincetown, Massachusetts.   This is a huge international event that will attract people from all  over the world, particularly from Britain--including Plymouth,  England--and it is going to be a significant revenue producer for our  Commonwealth but also for our country.   The 2020 anniversary is a proud milestone for our country as we  commemorate the 400th anniversary of the successful settlement of  Plymouth by the Pilgrims; the essential contributions of the Aquinnah  and Mashpee Wampanoag tribes; and the number of key events that  followed, including the signing of the Mayflower Compact, the 50-year  Plymouth Pilgrim-Wampanoag peace treaty, and of course, the first  Thanksgiving.   For my entire time in Congress, I have worked closely with my  constituents to prepare for this Plymouth 400 event.   The Plymouth Harbor dredging project has always been a cornerstone to  these preparations. A centerpiece of the anniversary will be the return  of the fully restored Mayflower Two, a full-scale replica of the  original ship that brought the Pilgrims to Cape Cod in 1620. However,  the Mayflower Two cannot return to her home in Plymouth Harbor unless  much-needed dredging is completed by that time.   Further, we anticipate a maritime salute to mark the return of the  Mayflower Two as part of the commemoration. We also expect significant  uptick in corresponding maritime traffic.   The amendment is part of a final piece to ensure that 2020 will be a  memorable year for our community and our country, and I look forward to  the completion of this project and all the good that will follow.   This is something that is critical not only in terms of the event but  making sure there is safe navigation, which we will have to be able to,  in some way, counter the influx of marine traffic as well.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just want to thank the chairman for his  help working with this, and I want to say, you are welcome. In 2020,  come be part of the celebration. It is so integral to our country, and  it is something that will, I think, be a great revenue producer as  well.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would grant the Army Corps  of Engineers the authority to repair or replace any Army Corps bridge  that is necessary for evacuation during extreme weather or natural  disaster in New England.   In my district, Mr. Chairman, the Bourne and Sagamore bridges  represent the only roads for crossing the Cape Cod Canal by car. These  bridges, owned by the Army Corps, have long reached the end of their  working lives. In fact, the Army Corps is already spending a  significant amount of funds just to keep the traffic on the bridges  moving. Anyone who has gone there in the summer and experienced that  can well attest to that.   We cannot risk the safety of those vital roadways at any time, let  alone at a time of an emergency. As the Corps already knows, it is  important that we recognize that the canal bridges and other critical  evacuation infrastructure across the Nation play a fundamental role in  providing for the public safety of countless Americans. Much of this  State and local work required to ensure the long-term safety of the  canal bridges is already under way.   I have also been working closely with the Army Corps leadership in  New England and in Washington to ensure that the funding necessary for  the safest, most resilient evacuation routes remains a priority.   This amendment would authorize the Army Corps to continue down the  path towards long-term safety for the people in my region, the people  in New England, and, importantly, the over half a million people that  the population swells to just in that small area over the summer  months. For that reason, I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4834]]         Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman again for his  cooperation. This is a vital matter of public safety going forward, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
