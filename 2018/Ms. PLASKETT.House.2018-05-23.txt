 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the recent  graduates of the University of the Virgin Islands. Unfortunately, I  could not attend the graduations last week due to the bad weather up  here and the debate on the farm bill.   Despite two hurricanes, no power, damaged classrooms, personal  tragedies galore, revised class schedules, et cetera, UVI graduates  lived up to their names. On St. Thomas, they were known as the  Ambitious, Resilient and Hardworking Class of 2018; and on St. Croix,  they were known as the Enriched, Elite and Educated Class of 2018.   During the ceremony, honorary degrees were also awarded to former  local elected officials and radio personalities, Holland Redfield II  and Addie Ottley.   The class of 2018 is made up of a diverse group of students. Whatever  their individual plans, as a class, these UVI graduates have proven  that they can take on anything life and nature have to offer. I commend  the 2018 UVI graduates for their hard work.   Additionally, I would like to commend Briana Winslow and Jermaine  Ferguson, who are shadowing me today as young adults in the national  foster youth care program. Their lives, their stories are an  inspiration to us all, and I commend them for what they are going to be  doing in the future.                            ____________________
