 Mr. Speaker, today the court has affirmed the value  of the First Amendment and provided the credentials back to CNN  reporter Jim Acosta.   It is unfortunate that since taking office, the President has treated  members of the press differently than did his predecessors. The  President constantly disparages the fourth estate as fake news, derides  the press as the enemy of the people, and routinely singles out  individual members of the press.   It is fortunate that no injury has yet come, because last month the  Trump zealot in Florida, inspired by his devotion to the President,  took it upon himself to mail pipe bombs to perceived enemies of the  President, including two former Presidents, the news desk of the Cable  News Network, Secretaries of State, Attorneys General, and  Congresspeople.   The President seems to reserve his most special and pointed derision  for African-American women members of the media. In particular, April  Ryan of the American Urban Radio Networks and CNN; Abby Phillip of The  Washington Post; and Yamiche Alcindor of the Public Broadcasting  System. Instead, the President derided April Ryan as a loser; called  Abby Phillip stupid; and accused Yamiche Alcindor of racism when she  asked him about his claim to be a nationalist.   Let us be very clear. The questions asked of the President were  pointed, timely, and relevant. They were not dumb, racist, or stupid.   They were protected by the First Amendment, and I ask the President  to stand for the First Amendment and stand against racism.   Since taking office, the President has treated members of the press  differently than did his predecessors.   The President constantly disparages the Fourth Estate as ``fake  news,'' derides the press as the `enemy of the people,' and routinely  singles out for verbal abuse individual members of the press.   Although this conduct by the President is rude, childish, and  unbecoming of the leader of a great nation, we are fortunate that it  has not yet resulted in physical injury or harm to any member of the  press.   I say fortunate because last month, a Trump zealot in Florida,  inspired by his devotion to the President, took it upon himself to mail  pipes bombs to perceived enemies of the President, including two former  Presidents and the news desk of the Cable News Network (CNN).   Mr. Speaker, the current President of the United States has disgraced  his office on numerous occasions, most recently this past weekend when  he refused to visit a cemetery in France where Americans gave their  lives to defend freedom in World War I because he did not want to get  wet in the rain.   But it is beneath the dignity of his office for the President to  deride the free and independent press, which the Framers knew was  indispensable for a functioning democracy and enshrined its protection  in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a protection that  every President takes and oath to preserve, protect, and defend.   The President reserves his most special and pointed derision for  African American women members of the media who do their jobs and have  the temerity to ask him questions regarding his actions or the policies  of his administration.   So it came as no surprise that in the aftermath of the 2018 midterm  elections, in which his party was routed and lost control of the House  of Representatives, the President refused to answer questions put to  him by three great and highly respected African American woman  reporters: April Ryan of the Urban American Urban Radio Networks and  CNN; Abby Phillip of the Washington Post; and Yamiche Alcindor of the  Public Broadcasting System (PBS).   Instead, the President derided April Ryan as a ``loser,'' called Abby  Phillip ``stupid,'' and accused Yamiche Alcindor of racism when she  asked him about his claim to be a ``nationalist.''   Let us be very clear: the questions asked of the President were  pointed, timely, and relevant; they were not dumb, racist or stupid.   They may have made the President uncomfortable but it is not the role  of the media to make public officials feel comfortable, especially one  who lashes out because he clearly feels the legal, ethical and  political walls closing in on him.   The President's misconduct conduct is consistent with his pattern and  practice of routinely disparaging African American criticism-- especially from females.   The American people see the President's unmistakable pattern of  disrespectful and abusive treatment of African American women members  of the White House Press Corps; they do not like it, they see through  it, and they know that these flailing attacks say more about this  President than it does about the three very able, highly respected, and  fearless African American women journalists.   I call upon the President to cease and desist his disrespectful  treatment of all journalists in general, and of African American women  journalists in particular.                            ____________________
