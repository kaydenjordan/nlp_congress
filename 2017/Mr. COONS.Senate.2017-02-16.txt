 Mr. President, I want to initially begin by thanking my  colleague from Oklahoma for graciously allowing me to proceed first  ahead of him. He is, as ever, a terrific colleague. I would like to  associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Minnesota. I,  too, led a bipartisan delegation--two Republican House Members and two  Senate Democrats--to Eastern European in August and observed many of  the same issues and concerns that she just raised and have joined her,  along with 10 Republican Senators and 8 other Democratic Senators, in  the legislation she mentioned. I think this is an important issue on  which all of us should focus.   Mr. President, let me turn to the matter at hand, the nomination of  Scott Pruitt to serve as the director of the EPA. I thank my  colleagues, many of whom have come to the floor to speak about the  nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, and most essentially, my  senior Senator and friend from my home State of Delaware, Tom Carper,  ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who has  ably led this fight.   I am glad to be able to join my colleagues to make clear why, in my  view, someone who does not believe in a core Federal role in protecting  the environment is not the right person to lead the Federal Agency  charged with just that mission. It is possible that we in this Chamber  have now forgotten why the Environmental Protection Agency was created  in the first place. The idea of Federal protection of our environment  really started to take hold when the Cuyahoga River caught fire, again,  in June of 1969. The public outrage that rightfully followed this near- spontaneous combustion of a river helped lead to the EPA's creation in  1970 and the passage of the Clean Air Act the same year and the Clean  Water Act in 1972.   Now, nearly a half century later, it is precisely because these laws  and others like them have been successful in making us healthier and  safer that it is easy to forget why we need them.   Institutions like the EPA don't run themselves. The environment does  not protect itself, and big oil and gas and coal companies certainly  don't police themselves. That is why the EPA exists. You would  certainly hope that at the very least the Administrator of that Agency  would support that core mission. Yet this evening we are considering  the nomination of someone whose main experience with environmental  protection at the Federal level is filing lawsuits against the Federal  Environmental Protection Agency.   In fact, he has filed 14 of those lawsuits in just 6 years as  attorney general of the State of Oklahoma. That is not all he has done.  Scott Pruitt, in his confirmation hearing, refused to recuse himself  from consideration of future cases which he brought against the EPA if  confirmed.   Mr. Pruitt has also suggested that Senators who want more information  about the details of his record should file FOIA requests rather than  providing that information voluntarily. He has described himself as ``a  leading advocate against the Federal EPA's activist agenda.'' Scott  Pruitt has not been able to name in confirmation hearings one single  environmental protection statute he supports. In my view, that is  unacceptable for a State attorney general let alone someone nominated  to be our Nation's highest ranking environmental protection official.   Mr. Pruitt's disdain for the core mission of the EPA leaves me  without a doubt that he is unfit to take on this important role, but  that is not all. Scott Pruitt either ignores or is ignorant of the core  and important science of climate change, mercury, lead exposure, ocean  acidification, to name just a few of many topics uncovered in his  confirmation hearing.   Mr. Pruitt acknowledges the climate is changing but says the role,  the influence of human activity is ``subject to debate.'' I am here to  say this evening, that is simply not true. Only in an alternative  universe, based on alternative facts, is the human impact on climate  change still subject to debate. That is like saying that Scott Pruitt  is fit to lead the EPA is subject to debate. I think after an  exhaustive confirmation hearing and a review on the floor of the facts,  it is not. It is simply not true.   Scott Pruitt also led a lawsuit against EPA rules that would reduce  mercury emissions from coal-fired powerplants. He argued it was too  expensive, too burdensome, but he also questioned whether mercury  itself was  [[Page S1267]]  harmful to health. On that issue, the science is clear. Mercury has  devastating effects on the development of the human nervous system.   Does Mr. Pruitt not get that or does he not care? Those are pressing  questions for me. During his confirmation process, Mr. Pruitt was  confused about ocean acidification, a process explained by very basic  science. A question I was left with was whether Mr. Pruitt just did not  get it or just did not care.   In that same hearing, he made statements that indicated he was  unfamiliar with the Federal standards regarding lead in drinking water.  I had to ask myself whether he simply has not heard of Flint, MI, or  was not concerned.   My office alone has received nearly 1,000 calls and emails from  Delawareans expressing concern about Scott Pruitt and the future of the  EPA under his potential leadership, expressing concern and opposition.  Delawareans have reached out to me saying they are worried about their  kids with asthma; they are worried about clean drinking water for their  families; they are worried about protecting our rivers, our wetlands,  and other outdoor spaces in Delaware and around the country.   With Scott Pruitt potentially at the helm of the EPA, they are right  to be worried. Let me end by sharing a brief excerpt of a letter from  one of my constituents who lives in my hometown of Wilmington, DE. She  wrote:         Please vote against Scott Pruitt as leader of the EPA. Our       children's future, their health and well-being, and their       right to inherit a world we have not irreversibly destroyed       may depend on it.    She is absolutely right. Our kids do deserve a better environmental  future. To her and all the Delawareans who have contacted me and my  friend and colleague from my home State, I hear you. I intend to vote  against Scott Pruitt. If my colleagues in the Senate really want to  stop pollution, we can start by keeping Scott Pruitt from going to lead  the EPA.   Our environment should not be for sale, should not be neglected, and  should not be turned aside from being the core mission of the  Environmental Protection Agency. I think we all should stand firm  against the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead that important Agency.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the exemplary  service of the Smyrna Delaware School District Superintendent, Deborah  Wicks, and recognize her upcoming retirement. For nearly half a  century, she has been an exceptional teacher and leader, serving in  many positions throughout Delaware's fastest growing school district.  Her hard work, perseverance, and dedication will truly be missed by  students, parents, and Delawareans up and down our State.   Since 1967, Debbie has played an active and integral role within the  Smyrna Delaware School District, serving as a special education teacher  for 16 years and an associate principal for 4 years, before serving as  the district's superintendent for 19 years. Throughout her time in the  district, Debbie has been a key leader, instrumental in the successful  completion of many projects like the John Bassett Moore Intermediate  School and the School Special Services Building. As she steps down from  her position as superintendent in June, I join the many Delawareans she  has worked with in thanking Deborah for her diligent efforts to improve  the education system for Delaware's children through hard work and  diligence.   A native of Smyrna, DE, and educated in the same school system that  she serves so faithfully, Debbie has always been a champion for  students, teachers, and the local community. Being a champion to Debbie  means helping to instill values of integrity, compassion, perseverance,  respect, and responsibility--values visible in the hallways and  classrooms of the schools in Smyrna and in the hearts of its graduates.   Debbie's success can be attributed not only to a commitment to  instill essential values in district students, but also to a genuine  passion for the betterment of her community. Her ability to develop and  foster community relationships essential to the district's long-term  educational success can be seen in numerous completed projects and  building upgrades, as well as the annual ``I Love Smyrna School  District Day,'' which has drawn close to 7,000 attendees in recent  years.   Debbie's work has been nothing short of inspirational, and we are  sincerely grateful for all that she has done on behalf of the students  and families of Smyrna. Her model leadership and dedication has touched  so many lives in Smyrna and beyond. It is my privilege to offer my  sincerest congratulations on a job well done and wish her many happy,  healthy, and successful years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Leah Rubin  Shen of my staff be granted floor privileges for the remainder of this  Congress.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
