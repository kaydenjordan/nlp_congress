 Mr. President, it is no secret that the Senate doesn't do  much around here, except for confirming judges. But looking at the  records of the folks we are confirming to the Federal bench, it is  clear we have forgotten even how to do that.   The Founding Fathers were incredibly visionary. When they set up the  Federal judiciary, they hoped to insulate it from political influence.  How? By giving them lifetime appointments, with the advice and consent  of the Senate. In doing so, they gave the Senators the most solemn of  responsibilities we have in this body: evaluating  [[Page S6915]]  judicial nominees on their independence, their fairness, their  temperament, and their judgment.   Unfortunately, these days, the Republican majority seems to have  thrown qualifications out the window. Instead, they give out lifetime  appointments to the court like candy. This doesn't prevent partisanship  from influencing our judicial system; it ensures partisanship. The  latest example is Lawrence VanDyke's nomination to the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Montana.   Mr. VanDyke is a familiar face to Montanans because he grew up and  attended school in the great State of Montana. He also served as  Montana's solicitor general before resigning to run an unsuccessful  race for the State supreme court.   Montanans can separate the wheat from the chaff pretty well, and  after examining his record and judgment, they found Mr. VanDyke  unqualified to serve on the State's highest court. Montanans rejected  him overwhelmingly at the ballot box, but now the majority leader wants  to give him a lifetime seat on the bench.   Once you start to dig into Mr. VanDyke's extreme record, it is not  hard to see why folks in my State were concerned about his ability to  be fair and independent. This is a man who believes a government should  insert itself between a woman and her doctor when she is trying to make  private healthcare decisions. This is a man who, as Montana's solicitor  general, worked to oppose same-sex marriage and questioned the ability  of same-sex partners to properly raise children. This is a man who  supports opening our public lands to mining and drilling.   By the way, our public lands contribute more than $7 billion to our  economy. Nonetheless, open it up, drill it, and mine it. And this is a  man who ridiculed Montana's deep belief that corporations are not  people. He argued in favor of unchecked money flowing into our  elections. He believed that corporations were people and, in fact, his  race for supreme court in Montana received over $600,000 in outside  spending--$170,000 from the Koch brothers alone.   My guess is that some of my friends on the other side of the aisle  view Mr. VanDyke's extreme positions as an asset, not an issue. They  may point to the fact that he claimed he would be objective during his  confirmation hearing.   The fact is, we cannot trust Mr. VanDyke to put aside his past  positions and give everyone who comes before his court a fair shake, to  be fair and impartial.   Mr. VanDyke has never been a judge, and he was rated as ``not  qualified'' by the nonpartisan, nonpolitical American Bar Association.   By the way, this isn't the first nominee who has come up who has been  rated as ``not qualified.'' I asked a lawyer friend of mine what that  means, and he said, basically, if you can't achieve a ``qualified''  rating by the American Bar Association, you are a train wreck. That is  what Mr. VanDyke is.   His nomination is opposed by over 200 conservation, education, civil  rights, and other organizations. He is also opposed by six former  Montana Supreme Court justices, folks that Montanans did elect to sit  on the highest court in our State. They wrote of Mr. VanDyke:         It is doubtful that he understands that judicial decisions       must be based solely on the facts of the case and on the law.       . . . We strongly believe that Mr. VanDyke has demonstrated       that he has neither the qualifications nor the temperament to       serve as a federal court of appeals judge.    His coworkers from his time as Montana's solicitor general seem to  agree. A former assistant attorney general who worked with VanDyke  wrote privately to his colleagues:         Ever since he has arrived, Mr. VanDyke has been arrogant       and disrespectful to others, both in and outside of this       office. He avoids work. He does not have the skills to       perform, nor desire to learn how to perform, the work of a       lawyer. Now that he has resigned--    That was when he resigned to run for the supreme court--         and refuses to work on cases assigned to him, while       remaining on the payroll for the next several months.    In fact, even Mr. VanDyke doesn't consider himself qualified to  perform the basic duties of a lawyer. He once explained in an email  that he has no experience in discovery, experts, stipulations, or in  meeting and conferring with opposing counsel.   I am no lawyer, but those sound like the tasks that someone up for a  lifetime judicial appointment should know how to do.   Let me put it this way. If I were looking for a contractor to do work  on my farm and the contractor had these kinds of qualifications, I  would not hire him for 1 minute, much less give him a job for a  lifetime.   I spend more time in Washington, DC, than I would like, which is how  I know there is no shortage of lawyers around here and around the  country. There is absolutely no reason that we can't find someone  better suited to this position than Lawrence VanDyke.   I know it is too much to hope that the Senate will act with as much  common sense as the folks in Montana do, but I do expect us to have the  decency to respect the will of Montana voters and reject Mr. VanDyke  for a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.   I urge my colleagues to take a look at the record, to take a look at  what he has done, to know it will not be a fair and impartial court if  he is put on it, and I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
