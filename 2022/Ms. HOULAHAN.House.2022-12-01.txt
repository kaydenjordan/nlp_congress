 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Senior Master  Sergeant Paige Flaherty, who for the past year has joined my office as  a  [[Page H8676]]  member of the Air Force's legislative fellowship program. Paige  embodies some of the best qualities of our forces, and indeed, of our  Nation.   Her tireless work with my team these past 11 months has revealed not  only the immense depth of her commitment to public service, but also  her intelligence, her kindness, and her grit. I am grateful for her  leadership and insight, which I have relied upon time and time again as  we have worked together to advocate for military families and those who  serve in uniform.   Although I am extremely sad to see her leave my staff and resume her  work in the Air Force, I appreciate all she has done as part of my  team.   Thank you, Paige.                            ____________________
