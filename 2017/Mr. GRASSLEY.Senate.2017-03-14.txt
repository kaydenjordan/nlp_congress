 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a  colloquy with the junior Senator from Utah and the junior Senator from  Nebraska.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor several times  over the past 8 years to discuss the constitutional principle of  separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and the  judicial branches. President Obama promised that he would act  independently of Congress where he had to; his quote: ``Where they  won't act, I will.'' I have come to the floor to discuss the many  examples of Executive overreach that we have witnessed, from unilateral  pursuit of climate change regulations to unconstitutional recess  appointments.   As I have said before, the structure of our Constitution is a  critical safeguard of our liberty. As Justice Scalia famously said:         Every banana republic in the world has a bill of rights.       Every President for life has a bill of rights. The real key       to the distinctiveness of America is the structure of our       government.    Now, I have served in the Senate for 36 years, so I have a deep  appreciation of the different roles of the coordinate branches and for  the fact that the people govern themselves through their  [[Page S1787]]  elected representatives, and my accountability to them is the defining  characteristic of my role as one of their representatives in the U.S.  Senate.   That is not true of judges in our Federal system who are not elected,  and it is certainly not true of the executive agencies that administer  the laws we write here in the Congress.   Judge Gorsuch is the President's nominee to serve as the next Justice  of the Supreme Court. It seems to me that he really understands the  important differences in these roles. Reflecting on the legacy of  Justice Scalia, he remarked that ``the great project of Justice  Scalia's career was to remind us of the differences between judges and  legislators.''   So I am now going to turn to Senator Lee. I would like to have him  discuss a question I put before him: How do you understand Judge  Gorsuch to view differences between judges, legislators, and the  executive under our Constitution?    Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his very  thoughtful explanation. I know both as a Senator and as a lawyer, he  takes the study of constitutional law very seriously. His point of view  ought to be seen as an authority on the separation of powers,  particularly. I think the way Senator Lee sees Judge Gorsuch is similar  to how I do, but he knows the law a lot better than I.   It is clear that the questions about separation of power can arise in  very complex and legally technical cases in the courts. But I think the  principle is also a fundamental one. Judge Gorsuch has made this point  himself, and I would like to quote a little of what he has said.   Recent Supreme Court cases ``permit executive bureaucracies to  swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and  concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little  difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design.''   To quote again, on the role of the prosecutor and the role of  Congress, he said: ``If the separation of powers means anything, it  must mean that the prosecutor isn't allowed to define the crimes that  he gets to enforce.''  [[Page S1788]]    So I want to ask my other colleague here for this colloquy, the  Senator from Nebraska, a question that I am sure he can answer and has  thought about a lot. These are not just legal technicalities that we  are talking about, but the very fabric of our Constitution. I hope the  Senator would agree.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his very  thoughtful explanation. Senator Sasse and Senator Lee have laid out  very clearly the Constitution's separation of powers, the proper role  for judges, the proper role for Members of Congress, and when one can't  interfere with the other. I think the Senator has laid out very  clearly, and I agree, that Judge Gorsuch fits in very well with what  judges are supposed to do, what the Supreme Court is supposed to do-- obviously not legislate. Members of the judiciary have a lifetime  appointment. They can't be voted out of office. That is why, when  people don't like what the Congress does, every 2 or 6 years as far as  the House and the Senate are concerned, they get a chance to express  that opposition and send somebody else to do the job, and they can't do  that with whoever is on the Supreme Court.   I thank my colleagues for participating with me in this conversation  we have had about the separation of powers and about their thoughts on  Judge Gorsuch on the issue of judges judging and not legislating. His  record demonstrates a firm grasp on the separation of powers that  animates our Constitution. He is an independent judge who properly  understands the judicial role. At a time when we hear renewed calls for  an independent judiciary, I don't think we could have a better nominee  to fit the bill.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
