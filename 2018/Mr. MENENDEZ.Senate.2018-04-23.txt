 Mr. President, today I wish to address Cuba's  undemocratic leadership transition and its implications for the Cuban  people and U.S. foreign policy.   Today, in a highly scripted process, Cuba's National Assembly  replaced Raul Castro, the country's gerontocratic dictator, with heir  apparent Miguel Diaz Canel. While this marks the first time in nearly  60 years that a Castro does not occupy the Cuban Presidency, this  transition by no means portends the desperately needed political and  economic change that Cubans desire, nor does it mean that the Castro  regime is no longer in charge.   This week's transition, characterized as a coronation and an attempt  to institutionalize the Castro regime, is a ruse. This spectacle does  not remotely come close to meeting internationally recognized standards  for a democratic election. Cuba remains a single party, authoritarian  state that denies its citizens their most fundamental freedoms.   Some contend that Mr. Diaz Canel could be a ``Cuban Mikhail  Gorbachev,'' and in seeking to reform the Castros' broken model, he  will stumble into the collapse of Cuba's communist system. Such  thinking fails to account for the fact that Mr. Diaz Canel's political  ascent was forged under the same Communist Party that has perpetuated  the Castros' decades-long stranglehold on Cuba.   More importantly, Raul Castro will maintain his position as the First  Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party. As article 5 of Cuba's  authoritarian constitution states, ``The Communist Party of Cuba [. .  .] is the superior ruling force of society and the State . . .'' Under  such a structure, does anyone honestly think that Raul Castro won't  continue calling the shots while his handpicked dauphin occupies the  role of President?   As this political farce unfolds, I want to make brief observations  about three aspects of Raul Castro's legacy, the state of human rights  in the country, the state of the Cuban economy, and the crisis in  Venezuela, which Miguel Diaz Canel now owns.   Raul Castro will certainly leave an enduring human rights legacy. In  the last 3 years, the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National  Reconciliation, Cuba's leading independent human rights organization,  documented more than 20,000 arbitrary detentions of activists.  Moreover, the State Department's 2016 Human Rights Report on Cuba  stated that the Cuban Government routinely denies its citizens fair  trials, monitors and censors private communications, suppresses  freedoms of speech, assembly and press, and employs threats, physical  assault and intimidation tactics against its own people.   Raul Castro's economic legacy will be the maintenance of the dual  currency system that distorts the national economy and subjugates Cuban  citizens to second-class status in their own country. Foreign companies  seeking opportunities in Cuba are still forced to conduct business with  the military and its vast network of shell companies. ``Independent  entrepreneurs'' are a complete misnomer, as individuals continue to  operate in a byzantine system that prevents them from owning their own  companies and subjects them to licensing and tax requirements designed  to stifle entrepreneurial activity.   Additionally, as well-connected members of the Cuban Communist  [[Page S2339]]  Party and the military use their positions for self-enrichment, average  Cubans face a status quo of limited economic opportunities. As the gap  between the ``haves'' and the ``have nots'' grows in Cuba, it appears  that the Castros' Orwellian dystopia is a system in which all Cubans  are equal, but some Cubans are more equal than others.   Finally, looking outward, at the Summit of the Americas last week,  where leaders of the Western Hemisphere grappled with an unprecedented  migration and humanitarian crisis, Raul Castro may have been absent,  but the legacy of ruin in Venezuela was front and center. In a July  2017 Senate hearing, Organization of American States Secretary General  Luis Almagro described Cuba's presence in Venezuela as an ``occupation  army.'' While Nicolas Maduro clings to his failed ideological,  military, and economic alliance with the Castro regime, Venezuelans are  suffering from food shortages, a collapsed healthcare system, and  rampant crime.   This brutal reality is the Castros' legacy for the Cuban people and  the hemisphere. In his role as First Vice President since 2013, Mr.  Diaz Canel has been Raul Castro's first accomplice. So while Cubans  will never stop dreaming for a future in which they are guaranteed  human rights and are truly free to pursue economic prosperity, they  know that Mr. Diaz Canel represents little more than a continuation of  the Castro regime.   Turning to U.S. foreign policy, to those who would argue Cuba is  ready to be a member of the community of nations, let me point to the  attacks against American diplomats in Havana. U.S. personnel have faced  an unprecedented ordeal. More than 50 unexplained attacks have affected  more than two dozen American citizens, with some cases involving  lasting, physical brain damage. Let anyone who harbors doubts about  these incidents refer to the Trudeau government's announcement this  week regarding incidents affecting Canadian officials and changes to  Canada's diplomatic presence in Cuba. These attacks are real. People  are suffering.   Cuban officials attempting to dismiss these egregious attacks is yet  another sign of the disingenuous nature of the dictatorship. Whether  the attacks were perpetrated by Cuban intelligence services or involve  the participation of another country's intelligence services, it is  unfathomable that a government that prides itself on running a police  state would even try to feign ignorance about these incidents. I refuse  to accept the premise that members of the Castro regime are not in some  way complicit or have no information about who is responsible. The  State Department must continue its investigation of these attacks.   The Trump administration must also move beyond Presidential promises  towards a substantive strategy that pressures the regime to undertake  serious reforms to advance democratic values and human rights and end  its support of failed leadership in Venezuela.   First, the United States must remain steadfast in supporting  democratic activists in Cuba. While President Trump claims to support  those fearlessly advocating for their rights, his budget proposals tell  a different story. Alarmingly, his fiscal year 2018 request to Congress  proposed zero dollars for democracy programs in Cuba, while his fiscal  year 2019 budget only requested $10 million. In contrast to his  statements, this amounts to rejecting support for the Cuban people and  our interests.   Additionally, as the U.S. Government hones new tools to advance  accountability for human rights violations, we should utilize targeted  global Magnitsky sanctions to put a spotlight on the Cuban officials  responsible for these abuses.   Second, although senior administration officials have been critical  of business deals with the Cuban military that enrich the Castro regime  in the process, the regulations the administration introduced in  November 2017 fail to address key elements of commerce that benefit  Cuba's dictatorship. In the coming weeks, I will launch a congressional  review of Treasury and Commerce regulations in order to end unnecessary  loopholes that benefit the regime.   Finally, as leaders from the Americas and Europe come together to  address the multifaceted crisis in Venezuela, they must seriously  confront Cuba's role in Venezuela's collapse. To date, efforts to  coordinate increased international pressure on the Venezuelan  Government have given the Castro regime a free pass. There was  widespread support in the hemisphere for Peru's decision to not invite  Nicolas Maduro to the Summit of the Americas due to the authoritarian  nature of his government; yet no one, including the Trump  administration, held Cuba's dictatorship to the same standard. It is  time for the administration to reverse this trend and call for a  coordinated diplomatic response to Cuba's longstanding role in  Venezuela's emergence as a failed state.   In closing, I urge my colleagues join me in speaking out against the  undemocratic political spectacle in Cuba this week. We must join  together to pursue a comprehensive policy towards Cuba that pressures  regime officials to loosen their stranglehold on Cuba's economy and  political system and that advances the true democratic and justice  reforms the Cuban people so desperately desire.                            ____________________
