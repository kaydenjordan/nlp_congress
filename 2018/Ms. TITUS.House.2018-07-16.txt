 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I join the chairman in supporting H.R. 5772, which  designates the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in  Amarillo, Texas, as the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou  Robinson United States Courthouse.   The new designation is a well-deserved honor for Judge Mary Lou  Robinson. You have heard some description of her outstanding career.  Let me add a few more points.   She has served as a judge in Amarillo, Texas, for more than 63 years,  with 35 years on the Federal judiciary. When she took senior status as  a Federal judge in 2016, she became the longest serving Federal judge  in both the Northern District of Texas and the entire Fifth Circuit.   Judge Robinson received numerous awards throughout her career for  both her legal and her public service to the community. She was named  one of the 100 Legal Legends by Texas Lawyer, the 2016 Jurist of the  Year by the Texas Chapters of American Board of Trial Advocates, and  the 1973 Texas Woman of the Year by the Texas Federation of Business  and Professional Women, among other awards.   Her colleagues reported that she had a reputation for running an  orderly and efficient courtroom, and she treated celebrity trials the  same way she treated mundane 2-day civil cases.   Judge Robinson certainly served with distinction during her time on  the Federal bench. She was deeply respected by the Amarillo legal  community, and I am pleased to support this legislation which aptly  names the facility in her honor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I say again that we are most impressed by the  two people whose names are on this Federal building, and I urge my  colleagues to support the designation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 3460. This is the bill,  as you heard, that would name the United States Federal courthouse  located in downtown Durham, North Carolina, as the John Hervey Wheeler  United States Courthouse.   Mr. Wheeler was a prominent community leader. He was a bank president  and he was a civil rights lawyer who helped transform the city of  Durham over his long and impressive career. Clearly, it is appropriate  to name this courthouse after him.   I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) who brought us this legislation and can  speak more personally about the qualities of Mr. Wheeler.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Butterfield, for  sharing with us that amazing life story.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support passage of this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of S. 2734 which designates the  Federal building and United States courthouse located in Laredo, Texas,  as the George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse.   I would like to commend Congressman Cuellar, our colleague from  Texas, who introduced the House companion to this bill, H.R. 5280, that  also has bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), to share with us the impressive story of  Judge Kazen's legal and public career.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleague Mr. Cuellar for helping  explain why it is even more important for us to name this building for  Judge Kazen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5846, the Promoting Flood Risk  Mitigation Act, as amended.   This bill was brought to us by my colleague from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).   The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a  study of the efficacy of buyouts of flood-prone property acquired by  the Federal Emergency Management Agency and examine ways to streamline  funding to provide more timely assistance to a larger number of State  and local governments.   One only needs to look at last year's hurricane season to see the  devastating impacts of these intense storms that were caused by climate  change and what they did to our communities. Unfortunately for many  residents, the damage and destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria were not occurring for the first time but for a second  or third time. These homes have been flooded and then had to be  repaired with Federal assistance.   In order to stop this endless repairing and rebuilding of homes in  floodplain areas, we must find ways to encourage more homeowners to  agree to having their homes bought out, as well as ways to encourage  State and local governments to purchase more of these properties.   The bill before you requires the GAO to assess the feasibility of a  pilot program that, in exchange for a credit on their flood insurance  premiums, property owners would be able to agree, before a flood  occurs, to have their residence bought out if their residence is later  substantially damaged by flood. The study would also examine the role  that nonprofit organizations could play in making buyouts more readily  available and more efficient.   We must stop the cycle of destroy, rebuild, destroy, rebuild. This  study is a good first step to assess the benefits of buyouts and the  feasibility of potential solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), who is the ranking member of the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure, to further discuss this.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge passage of this  legislation and all the bills that we have brought before you today  from this subcommittee.   I want to thank our chairman, Mr. Barletta, for working with us  across the aisle on these bipartisan bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1800
