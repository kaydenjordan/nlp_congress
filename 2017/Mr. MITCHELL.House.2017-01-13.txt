 Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the resolution to give  relief to the millions of Americans who are struggling to access health  care due to the destructive impact of the Affordable Care Act.  Americans were promised that, with the passage of the Affordable Care  Act, costs for health insurance would decrease and patients could keep  their plans and their doctors if they liked them. Americans have now  seen the truth: massive increases in premiums, constantly rising  deductibles and copays, and fewer plans with fewer providers.   Just because an individual or a family has insurance does not mean  they can access and afford health care. Health insurance means little  if they cannot find a participating doctor or afford the deductible. In  Michigan, premiums have risen over 17 percent this year, and  deductibles are up an average of $492.   There is a plan. I will hand carry it over for you to read it. I  suggest we not instill fear but, rather, we move forward with a better  way to provide health insurance. Broken promises have led us to a  broken healthcare system. We promise to fix it and, beginning today, we  are going to do just that.
