 Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Judiciary Committee  began to hear witnesses on the nomination of Bill Barr to be the next  Attorney General of the United States. We heard first, of course, from  Mr. Barr himself all day yesterday and today from additional witnesses.   By any standard, Mr. Barr is an exceptionally qualified individual,  in part because 27 years ago, he was Attorney General, nominated and  confirmed unanimously--nominated by President George Herbert Walker  Bush. Under his leadership at the time, the Department of Justice  focused on some of the most important law enforcement challenges facing  our country at that time. They worked to fight violent crime and combat  the drug epidemic, both of which continue to do great harm to  communities across the country still today.   As significant as the work done under his leadership was, I was more  impressed with the fact that after 27 years, he was willing to take on  the task of becoming Attorney General once again. He said he was sort  of semiretired. He and his wife were looking forward to spending more  time with their children and grandchildren. But he answered the call to  public service, and I am grateful that he did. He knows that our Nation  needs a strong law-and-order Attorney General at the Department of  Justice.   When he spoke at his confirmation hearing more than 2\1/2\ decades  ago, he said:         The Attorney General must ensure that the administration of       justice--the enforcement of the law--is above and away from       politics. Nothing could be more destructive of our system of       government, the rule of law, or the Department of Justice as       an institution, than any toleration of political interference       with the enforcement of the law.    He repeated that commitment yesterday, and I think the need for that  sort of strong statement is more important today than ever.   I believe Attorney General Barr will be a good Attorney General,  assuming what is one of the most challenging positions in the Cabinet  because you are a political appointee but you are also the chief law  enforcement officer in the country. That sometimes can be difficult to  navigate.   As the nominee noted, doing the job and doing it well sometimes  requires being prepared to burn your political capital in order to  preserve the rule of law. I believe this is the most fundamental  quality of a good Attorney General, and having a leader at the helm of  the Department of Justice with the right temperament and a fundamental  understanding of this responsibility is critical now and forever. In  recent years, we witnessed some Attorneys General carrying out actions  that repeatedly toed that political line, sometimes crossed it.   Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice began to  veer increasingly away from the impartial administration of law and  toward politics. That shift undoubtedly occurred at the hands of  President Obama's Attorneys General who were in the driver's seat  during his administration, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.   Both Holder's and Lynch's conduct has come under a great deal of  scrutiny--even now, after they have left--and for good reason.   For example, under then-Attorney General Holder, there was something  called Operation Fast and Furious in which the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, and Firearms and the Department of Justice purposefully  allowed the illegal sale of firearms in Mexico in the hopes of being  able to track them. Unfortunately, there were a number of casualties,  including Border Patrolman Brian Terry, who was killed with one of  those firearms in 2010. Attorney General Holder never accepted  responsibility  [[Page S257]]  for Brian Terry's death or ever admitted that allowing these guns to  walk into Mexico, into the hands of some criminal organizations, was a  terrible mistake.   Under his watch, the IRS targeting controversy occurred in which  politically aligned groups applying for tax-exempt status faced  official oppression based upon their political affiliation.   Then, of course, more recently, let's not forget then-Attorney  General Lynch's handling of the Clinton email scandal--something even  James Comey, the FBI Director, objected to--along with her famous so- called tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton when his wife  was under an active FBI investigation. The conduct of both Holder and  Lynch undermined the public's confidence in the impartial  administration of justice and law at the Justice Department.    Under the leadership of my friend and our former colleague, Jeff  Sessions, the Department of Justice has begun to right the ship and  again separate politics from the impartial administration of the law,  and I am confident that Mr. Barr will continue to do the same.   During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Barr reaffirmed that politicians  should not interfere with criminal investigations, and he likewise  committed not to interfere with the special counsel's investigation. He  assured us that his allegiance will be to the rule of law, to the  Constitution, and to the American people, and that, above all else, he  will work to protect the professionalism and integrity of the  Department of Justice and the thousands of dedicated public servants  who work there.   Not only is Mr. Barr exceptionally qualified for the job, he is  prepared on day one to step in and lead with distinction.   The Senate unanimously confirmed his nomination to three different  positions at the Department of Justice, and I hope we can work  expeditiously to get this fine man to the Department of Justice once  again.   I thank Mr. Barr and his entire family for agreeing to bring his  talents and his temperament to the Department of Justice at a time when  those qualities are so desperately needed, and I look forward to voting  yes on his nomination.                          Remembering Herb Kelleher    Mr. President, on another matter, I want to share a few words about  the passing of one of the airline industry's most unconventional and  most successful executives. That would be Herb Kelleher, who cofounded  Southwest Airlines.   Herb was born in 1931 in New Jersey, and his young life and early  career kept him on the east coast. He graduated from Wesleyan  University and New York University School of Law and served as a law  clerk for 2 years at the New Jersey Supreme Court and then joined a law  firm in Newark. But as fate intervened in this promising young lawyer's  career, he met his wife Joan, a native Texan, and they decided to move  to the Lone Star State, something he later referred to as the greatest  business decision he ever made.   Building America's largest domestic airline carrier was never on  Herb's to-do list. In the late 1960s, he was an attorney in San  Antonio, when one day his client approached him with an idea about a  low-fare airline serving three Texas cities. Tired of spending so much  time in the car traveling between San Antonio and Houston and Dallas,  he believed they could make point-to-point intrastate travel faster and  much cheaper by flying, and also cheaper than other airlines.   Getting their innovative idea off the ground wasn't easy. These men  who founded Southwest Airlines slogged through years of legal battles  before the airline operated its first flight. Their vision not only led  to the creation of a budget airline but also drove down the cost of  their competitors, as competition will do.   To maintain their edge, Southwest tried some interesting ideas along  the way. After another airline ran an ad calling Southwest a cheap  carrier, Herb responded by filming a commercial where he wore a brown  paper bag over his head and promised that the airline would gladly  provide one to any customer too embarrassed to be seen flying on  Southwest Airline.   At one point, to compete with the low fares of other airlines,  Southwest started a program to keep customers, and they said: You can  either pay the lowest fare or pay full fare and get a full premium  bottle of liquor in the process. Well, apparently it worked, and for a  short time, I am told, Southwest was the largest liquor distributor in  the State of Texas.   I think one of the most distinctly Herb Kelleher stories is of a  battle called ``The Malice in Dallas.''   In 1992, Southwest Airlines and another company realized their  slogans--``Plane Smart'' and ``Just Plane Smart''--were similar. Rather  than settling the matter in court, they settled it by holding a public  arm wrestling match.   The 61-year-old, with the cigarette fixed between his teeth, gave his  much younger competitor a run for his money, but he couldn't pull off a  win. At the end of the match, the two men made donations to each  other's chosen charities. They agreed to share the slogan and called it  a day.   Each of these stories has Herb Kelleher written all over it. He was  known for his gregarious personality, his incredible work ethic, and  his penchant for the nontraditional, not to mention his affinity for  Wild Turkey.   I first met Herb when I represented him in a lawsuit early in my  legal career in San Antonio. He had a larger-than-life personality, and  it was a pleasure to know him.   We can all learn a lesson from Herb about the importance of working  hard, treating people with respect, and not being afraid to have a  little bit of fun along the way. His entrepreneurial spirit was  credited with democratizing the skies by disrupting the airline  industry, and I believe he was one of the most consequential leaders in  American aviation, and we have all benefited from that.   So I join Herb's wife Joan, his children, his grandchildren, his many  friends, and, of course, his beloved Southwest Airlines family in  mourning the loss of this larger-than-life figure.   I yield the floor.
