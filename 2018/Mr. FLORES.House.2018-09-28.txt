 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Murray Watson, Jr., of  Mart, Texas, who passed away on July 24, 2018.   Murray was born in 1932 in Mart, Texas, to Murray Watson, Sr., and  Ethel Bryson Watson. He graduated from Mart High School in 1949, from  Baylor University with a bachelor's degree in 1952, and a juris  doctorate from Baylor in 1954. In 1957, he was elected to the Texas  House of Representatives. In 1963, he was elected to the Texas Senate,  where he served for 10 years.   During his lifetime in elected office, Murray was involved in  crafting and passing many pieces of influential legislation, including  the establishment of what is now known as Texas State Technical  College, a vocational school based in Waco, with campuses all across  our State. Murray served as the school's general counsel, and the  Watson family's contributions to the school are significant. Both  Murray and his wife have buildings named in their honor on the TSTC  campus in Waco.    His passion for education extended long after his retirement from  politics. He took a leading role in founding the Brazos Higher  Education Authority and Brazos Higher Education Service Corporation,  Inc., to help students fund their education. He also served as a  trustee of the McLennan Community College Foundation. In 2017, he was  named Baylor Lawyer of the Year for his commitment to education and his  philanthropic spirit.   Murray was a member of the Rotary Club of Waco, the Austin Avenue  Methodist Church, the Baylor Masonic Lodge, the Waco Scottish Rite  Consistory, the Order of the Eastern Star, the Baylor Law Alumni  Association, the Baylor Bear Foundation, and the Baylor Founders Club.   While Murray was committed to serving others, his role as a family  man was the pride of his life. He allowed nothing to come between him  and his family, including Greta, his wife of nearly 59 years, two  children, a daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. Murray also owned  and operated the family's ranch and historic feed store in Mart, Texas.   Mr. Speaker, Murray's life was defined by his service to those all  around him. He worked tirelessly to better our community and families  all across America. He will be forever remembered as a selfless  servant, a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a friend to hundreds.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Watson family. We also lift up the family and friends of Murray  Watson, Jr., in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of Murray Watson, Jr.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women, and for our first responders.                        Honoring Sheriff David Greene     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Milam County Sheriff  David Greene of Cameron, Texas, who passed away on July 20, 2018.   Sheriff Greene was born in 1952 in Sherman, Texas, to Oscar and  Marguerite Greene. In 1996, he married Janell Rene Morin. He had three  sons and was blessed with three grandsons.   Sheriff Greene dedicated his life to public service in Texas. He  served as a game warden for the Texas Park and Wildlife Service for  almost 30 years before becoming a Milam County constable. In 2008,  David was elected Milam County sheriff and was reelected for two  additional 4-year terms.   Sheriff Greene went well beyond the call of duty in 2010 by  establishing the Milam County Sheriff's Office Brown Santa program to  raise money to buy Christmas gifts for underprivileged children in  Milam County. This year's fundraiser was held just 8 days after Sheriff  Greene's passing and was the largest in the event's history, a  testament to Sheriff Greene's character and his impact on Milam County.   Mr. Speaker, Sheriff Greene's life was defined by his service to  those around him. He worked tirelessly to better our community. He will  be forever remembered as a selfless public servant, a husband, a  father, a grandfather, and a friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Greene family. We also lift up the family and friends of Sheriff  David Greene in our prayers.   I requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to  honor the life and legacy of Sheriff David Greene.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us from external  threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at home.                            Honoring Olive DeLucia     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Olive DeLucia of  Bryan, Texas, who passed away on August 12, 2018.   Olive was born on June 16, 1924, in Audubon, New Jersey. As a young  woman during World War II, she served in the United States Naval  Reserve in the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, more  commonly known as the WAVES program.   In 1958, she moved with her husband and two sons to Bryan-College  Station, Texas. Once in Texas, Olive made a career working for Texas  A&M University for 30 years. While working for The Association of  Former Students, our alumni association, she served as the director of  class programs and later oversaw the Traveling Aggies program, which  gave her the ability to visit all seven continents. She was thanked for  her service to the university with the President's Distinguished  Service Award and was named as a Fish Camp namesake.   Even though she was only about 5 feet tall, she had immense wisdom. I  remember the days that she would give me that look and tell me what I  had done wrong or how to do things better, and I always paid attention  to what Olive DeLucia told me to do.    Mr. Speaker, Olive's life was defined by her service to those around  her. Her life enriched the lives of many. She will be forever  remembered as a selfless servant, an Aggie, a mother, a grandmother,  and a dear friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the entire DeLucia family. We also lift up the family and friends of  Olive DeLucia in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of Olive DeLucia.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us overseas, and  for our first responders who keep us safe at home.                            Honoring George Boyett     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor George Boyett of  College Station, Texas, who passed away on September 7, 2018.   George was born in 1935 and was a native of the Brazos Valley. He  graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School in 1953 and attended Texas  A&M University. At Texas A&M, he was a member of the Corps of Cadets,  the Ross Volunteers, and the swim team.   In 1957, he married his wife, Gaytha, at the Texas A&M All Faiths  Chapel.   Upon graduation in 1958, he served our country in the United States  Army for 6 years before returning to College Station while continuing  to serve in the Army Reserve.   George was a successful businessman, forming local firms and  companies before he was elected as a Brazos County justice of the peace  in 1988. His precincts were redistricted and renumbered many times  throughout his tenure, but he most recently served as the justice of  the peace in precinct 3, which included much of the Texas A&M campus,  before retiring in 2015.                                time  1315    During his career as a judge, George taught at the National Judicial  College and the Texas Department of Public Safety. He also served as a  reserve sheriff's deputy for the Burleson County Sheriff's Office and  as an associate judge for the city of College Station.   His dedication to public service went far beyond law enforcement and  the judiciary system. George was a dedicated volunteer within the  Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints and the Boy Scouts of  America.   After becoming an Eagle Scout as a young man, George continued his  involvement in the Boy Scouts, serving at the troop, district, and  council levels. He was awarded the Silver Buffalo by the Sam Houston  Area Council and the National Outstanding Eagle Scout Award for his  work in Boy Scouts.   Mr. Speaker, George's life was defined by his selfless service to  those  [[Page H9398]]  around him. He worked tirelessly to better our community through his  capacity as a judge and his involvement with the Boy Scouts. He will be  forever remembered as a selfless servant, a mentor, a husband, a  father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather, and a friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Boyett family. We also lift up the family and friends of George  Boyett in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of George Boyett.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who serve us, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.                        Honoring Mary Fay Lucas Arnold     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mary Fay Lucas Arnold  of Bryan, Texas, who passed away on November 29, 2017.   Mary was born in east Texas on November 17, 1920, to William and Cora  Terrell. In 1943, in the midst of World War II, Mary decided to serve  her Nation by joining the Women's Army Corps. A few months later, she  met William Everett ``Bill'' Lucas, and they married in January of  1944.   After the war, Bill's work took him, Mary, and their family to live  in Haiti, Venezuela, and College Station, Texas. Upon retirement, Bill  and Mary moved to Bryan, Texas.   Bill passed away in 1972, and Mary later married T.H. ``John''  Arnold.   Mary was active in serving the Bryan-College Station community. She  was the assistant credit manager at Sears in Bryan and was one of the  two oldest living members of the First Baptist Church in College  Station. She was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star and belonged  to the American Legion and the VFW Auxiliary.   Mr. Speaker, Mary's life was defined by her selfless service to those  around her. She was loved by her community and, certainly, left an  enduring legacy. She will be forever remembered as a veteran, community  leader, wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great-great- grandmother, and a dear friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Lucas and Arnold families. We also lift up the family and friends  of Mary Fay Lucas Arnold in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of Mary Arnold.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who serve us, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.                     Honoring Bob Beamon's 100th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James Robert Beamon of  Edge, Texas, who turned 100 years old on September 15, 2018.   Mr. Beamon, who is known as Bob to his friends, was born in Eufala,  Alabama. His family moved to Goliad, Texas, when he was 2 years old. In  true Texas style, he would ride his horse to school with his younger  brother.   As a young man in the 1930s, he attended a house dance, where he met  Annie Juanita Clifton. Annie and Bob were married on December 13, 1937,  and were married for 74 years.   At the outbreak of World War II, Bob was drafted into military  service. Although he could have opted to defer, Bob went on to serve in  the United States Navy as a gunner for the PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol  plane in the 106th Squadron, the Fighting Wolverines. Bob flew 17  missions for the Navy in the war's Pacific theater before returning to  the United States.   After his service, he came home and raised five children with Annie,  four sons and one daughter. He worked for more than 60 years in the  painting business and eventually owned his own company.   Now retired, Bob enjoys making Wahoo game boards for his family,  visiting military museums, and, until recently, enjoyed hunting and  fishing.   Recently, Bob celebrated his 100th birthday with dozens of friends  and several generations of his family. He recounted many stories from  his military service days and played with his great-grandson, Rage, who  turned 1 year old also on September 15.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Bob on this joyous occasion, and  I know that his family and friends love him and are proud of him. I  wish him many more years of health and happiness.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the United  States Capitol to honor Bob Beamon's 100th birthday.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who serve us, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.                             Honoring Air Med 12     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize CHI St. Joseph's  Hospital Air Med 12 team for their outstanding achievements in  providing lifesaving services for residents of the Brazos Valley.   In May of 2005, PHI Air Medical formed Air Med 12, the first air  medical program to serve the Brazos Valley. Prior to this time, the  only air medical support was available from Houston, with response  times of more than an hour.   For patients in the Brazos Valley, such wait times made air medical  support an unrealistic solution to their health emergencies. PHI  partnered with St. Joseph's Hospital, which was looking to expand  services within their trauma center.   Just a few months later, in August 2005, Air Med 12 would lead a  group of four helicopters into New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.  These would be the first civilian medical helicopters in the city after  the storm passed. Subsequent hurricane response teams have used Air Med  12's leadership and example to improve medical care for storm  survivors.   Disaster response is not the only way Air Med 12 has revolutionized  air medical support. In 2008, three members of the Air Med 12 team were  tragically lost in an accident outside of Huntsville. Since that loss,  the Air Med 12 team has become involved in improving safety standards  for all air medical support that include increased weather minimums,  the use of night vision goggles on every flight, and national  collaboration amongst air medical providers.   Air Med 12 has shaped more than just air medical support in the  Brazos Valley. Their group values development of clinical education and  collaboration with the Texas A&M College of Medicine's School of Rural  Public Health and College of Nursing have brought a high standard of  healthcare across central Texas and the Brazos Valley.   The impact of Air Med 12 cannot be understated. In 2018 alone, they  have transported 23 critical pediatric patients to specialty hospitals,  administered 27 units of blood to patients either directly at the scene  or at rural hospitals, and, in August, completed a record number of 48  flights in one month.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor Air Med 12 and CHI St. Joseph's  Hospital for the work they have done to provide the Brazos Valley with  improved emergency medical care.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the United  States Capitol to honor Air Med 12.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and woman who serve us, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
