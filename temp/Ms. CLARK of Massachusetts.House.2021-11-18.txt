 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for  his incredible work in putting together this bill and all his  leadership and friendship. And today, we have the build back better  agenda before us that was built on conversations that President Biden  had with the American people so we can meet this time of historic  challenge for them with historic progress.   The Build Back Better Act lowers costs and taxes for working  families, creates jobs, and puts us on a path towards sustainability.  We will provide 26 million children with access to affordable, quality  childcare and universal pre-K. This will let families, and especially  women in this country, get back to work and give all of our kids a  great start.   We will build one million units of affordable housing, cut  prescription drug costs and cap insulin costs, expand healthcare  coverage, extend the historic child tax cut, and invest directly in  climate resiliency and clean energy.   We declare with this bill that care is economic infrastructure and  send a message to families and providers both that help is on the way.  And all of this is done with a through line of equity. This is what is  possible when we put families front and center here in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, so today, we build back better.
