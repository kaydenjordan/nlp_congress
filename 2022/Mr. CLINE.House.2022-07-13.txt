 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the Big Brothers Big  Sisters of Harrisonburg-Rockingham County  [[Page H5981]]  for winning the 2022 Quality Award at their national conference.   Big Brothers Big Sisters aims to connect mentors, or ``bigs,'' with  local youth, known as ``littles.''   This prestigious Quality Award is granted to only a third of chapters  in the country. To achieve it, the chapter must succeed in having 73  percent of mentors meet with a youth member for a whole year.  Additionally, 54 percent of participants must meet with their  ``littles'' at school for that year.   The Harrisburg-Rockingham chapter knocked that standard out of the  park, reporting a 70 to 80 percent meeting success rate.   According to Lindsay Douglas, the executive director of the  Harrisonburg-Rockingham chapter, the reason for the chapter's superb  performance is strong communication between the mentors, children, and  their parents.   It is community organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters that  foster an environment where our youth can thrive.   Congratulations, again, to the Harrisburg-Rockingham chapter.                            ____________________
