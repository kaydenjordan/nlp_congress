 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment prohibits funding for  the promotion, implementation, or enforcement of the CDC's  recommendation to add the COVID vaccine to the child and adolescent  immunization schedule.   In the fall of 2022, the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices  voted to recommend that the CDC add the COVID vaccine to the child and  adolescent immunization schedule, despite having zero scientific  evidence for such recommendation.   This decision recommended that children as young as 6 months get the  COVID vaccine and accompanying boosters. In direct contradiction to the  science, the CDC officially implemented the recommendation earlier this  year. All studies show that young children were far less likely to be  infected or hospitalized by COVID.   Between August 1, 2020, and August 21 of 2021, the CDC reported that  less than 1 percent of kids' hospitalizations for COVID resulted in  death, less than 1 percent. Children comprised less than 0.01 percent  of COVID hospitalizations and 0.0005 percent of deaths according to the  CDC study.   Why would the CDC implement such a recommendation to knowingly inject  an experimental shot, especially one that is not even fully FDA  approved into kids who have an almost zero percent chance of dying from  COVID?   Now, we see that the side effects of the unapproved experimental  vaccine are proving to be detrimental to children and are causing  irreversible injuries.   Nine days after receiving the vaccine, a 6-foot-9 healthy 17-year- old, Everest Romney, was admitted to the ICU with blood clots in his  brain. Anyone who talked about the incident on social media was  censored.   Nine months later, he was admitted for a second time. Doctors found  another blood clot. A deep vein in his right leg and potentially  permanent heart inflammation. Now he can no longer play basketball, and  he has to take blood thinners. Thank God he is still alive.   Stephanie De Garay's now 15-year-old daughter was in the Pfizer COVID  vaccine trial and is now in a wheelchair with vision problems and a  feeding tube. Several groups on Facebook were even taken down after she  tried telling her story.   Dr. Cody Meissner, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the  Tufts Children's Hospital in Boston said, ``It is hard to deny that  there's some event that seems to be occurring in terms of  myocarditis.''   Although, the CDC does not have the authority to officially mandate  the vaccines for kids, the CDC's recommendation to add the vaccine to  the child and adolescent immunization schedule is the foundation for  all the vaccine mandates for kids in schools, daycares, sports leagues,  and extracurriculars.   My amendment would protect children from the experimental shot by  blocking the implementation of the baseless CDC recommendation.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment prohibits funding for  the enforcement of any COVID vaccine mandate. This includes every  agency under the Department of Health and Human Services, the  Department of Labor, and the Department of Education.   During COVID, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  implemented unconstitutional, tyrannical vaccine mandates for  businesses with more than 100 employees. This mandate applied to 84  million workers.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented the same  tyrannical mandates for healthcare workers. Thousands of healthcare  workers were unjustly fired for refusing the experimental vaccine, many  of whom were from my district in northwest Georgia.   The Department of Education also put out recommendations and guidance  for schools to require students to get vaccinated. Furthermore, the  Federal Government has spent more than $30 billion on the COVID  vaccines, including incentivizing their development, guaranteeing a  market, and ensuring that these unsafe vaccines would be free to the  public, but they weren't. The American taxpayers were forced to pay for  them.   Big Pharma was the only industry that benefited from these mandates.  From 2020 to 2021, Pfizer saw a 95 percent increase in earnings while  businesses all over America were shut down and crushed. In 2020,  Pfizer's revenues were $41.6 billion. In 2021, Pfizer's revenues were  $81.3 billion, doubling the year before. In 2022, Pfizer's revenues hit  a record of $100 billion. That is outrageous. Americans suffered,  people lost their jobs, and businesses were forced to close.   As we know now, the experimental vaccines have been detrimental to  Americans and have caused irreversible injuries, and in some cases  death. In just 15 months after the vaccine rollout, approximately 1,400  peer-reviewed articles documented severe adverse events after the  COVID-19 vaccinations, a concerning safety signal not even rivaled by  combining all other vaccines in the worldwide medical literature over  the last century.   There have been approximately 1 million adverse events resulting from  the COVID vaccine reported in the VAERS system, which includes  everything from myocarditis, blood clots, permanent disability,  miscarriages, stillbirths, and menstrual abnormalities.   The following shows significant increases in various diseases and  medical conditions among servicemembers who were forced to take the  vaccine: hypertension, 2,181 percent increase; disease of the nervous  system, 1,048 percent increase; malignant neoplasms of the esophagus,  894 percent increase; breast cancer, 487 percent increase; female  infertility, 472 percent increase. These are just to name a few.   Historically, a vaccine is subjected to an average of 10 to 12 years  in clinical trials before it is authorized to be administered to the  general population. Under an emergency use authorization, these  vaccines were available to the public as early as 10 months after  development. Mandating such a vaccine is a complete abuse of power, and  no American should be forced by the Federal Government to have any  experimental shot injected into their body.   Our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, said it  is absolutely the government's business to know whether and which  Americans have not been vaccinated. He also previously said:  Absolutely, the message is clear. You are vaccinated, guess what? You  get to return to a more normal lifestyle. If you are not vaccinated,  you are still a danger, and you are still in danger as well, so get  vaccinated.   These vaccines are not as safe and effective as the American people  were told. COVID is over. Not only has Congress passed it, the  President himself signed it. No one should be forced to take a vaccine.   My amendment prohibits the enforcement of any COVID vaccine mandate,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment uses the Holman Rule  to reduce--no, castrate--the salary of Assistant Secretary for Health  Richard Levine to $1, the same way he supports castrating children who  suffer from gender dysphoria.   Richard Levine was a diversity hire by the Biden administration to  push the demonic gender-affirming care agenda, and he is unfit to serve  as the HHS Assistant Secretary for Health. He should never have been  hired after he, serving as Pennsylvania's Health Secretary, directed  nursing homes and care facilities to take in COVID patients while  simultaneously pulling his mother out of her own care facility.   Dr. Levine has spent his career focusing on treating--let's say  grooming--children, adolescents, and young adults. He now serves as a  top adviser for our Nation's health policy while masquerading as a  woman. A mentally  [[Page H5824]]  ill man who thinks he is a woman should never be responsible for  overseeing anything in the Department of Health and Human Services, let  alone the Office on Women's Health.   This same man who is empowering kids to mutilate and castrate  themselves under the guise of so-called gender-affirming care said that  he was happy to have waited to transition genders so that he could have  kids. What a complete hypocrisy.   He has promised that mutilating and castrating kids will soon be  normalized and that it has the highest support of the Biden  administration. He has stated that ``sex reassignment surgery and  puberty blockers for kids is lifesaving, medically necessary, age- appropriate, and a critical tool.'' He also said there shouldn't be  ``State laws and actions that dictate principles of transgender medical  care by us, pediatric experts,'' illustrating why we need Federal  protections like my bill, the Protect Children's Innocence Act, for our  most vulnerable and innocent children.   It is our job to protect our children from sexual groomers like  Levine and reducing his salary to $1 is a strong first step. He has  infiltrated our Department of Health and Human Services with guidance  and curricula that further his perverted agenda. The Office of  Population Affairs, which is directly overseen by Levine, put out  guidelines encouraging our youth to seek gender-affirming care. These  guidelines discuss how and why our youth should seek puberty blockers,  as well as top and bottom reassignment surgeries. Let's be real. That  is cutting off their body parts before they are adults.   Other initiatives and guidance he has issued include a cultural  competency curricula. This cultural competency curricula is for  behavioral health and primary care practitioners to ``assess, treat,  and refer LGBTQ clients in a culturally appropriate manner.'' Part of  this curricula is for nurses to focus on teaching cultural competency  in the care of LGBTQ older adults. Another part of this curricula  includes utilizing the National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center for  its educational programs on how to best meet the learning styles,  needs, and time constraints of LGBTQ people.   A last additional part of this cultural competency curricula includes  a training specifically designed to help both administrators and  clinicians address the various aspects of providing effective substance  abuse treatment to LGBTQ people. Obviously, they shouldn't be cutting  off their body parts as children. The training covers such topics as  legal issues, the coming out process as it relates to behavioral  health, how to make a provider organization more LGBT-welcoming, and  more.   Another agenda Levine has been pushing for is the vaccination of  children. Just recently he was calling on parents to speak up and  defend vaccine requirements at schools, saying they need to be part of  back-to-school checklists of an emergency use vaccine that children do  not even need.                                time  2015    Our mentally ill Assistant Secretary for Health is more concerned  with woke gender and vaccine agendas than serving the everyday health  and needs of the American people.   He deserves to be fired immediately. This man is a danger to all  children and should not be serving in our government.   Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to my  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment uses the Holman rule  to reduce the salary of Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona to $1.   Miguel Cardona is unfit to serve the American people as Secretary of  Education. He is complicit in allowing biological men to compete  against women, labeling parents as domestic terrorists, and  implementing critical race ideology in schools.   His Department of Education issued a proposed rule on Title IX to set  out a standard for how schools must adopt sex-related criteria that  would limit or deny a student's eligibility to participate on a male or  female athletic team consistent with their gender identity.   Under this proposed rule, schools would be prohibited from adopting a  policy that directly bans all transgender from participating on  athletic teams that correspond to the gender they identify as. If  schools were to implement such a ban, they would be subjected to  intense litigation.   This Department's proposed rule not only makes a mockery of women's  sports. It also perpetuates the radical agenda that biological  differences should not be weighed against the emotions of confused men.  This proposed rule will destroy women's sports.  [[Page H5825]]    He has stated that sports do ``more than just put ribbons on the  first-, second-, and third-place winner,'' fully acknowledging that  biological men will dominate women's sports when they are put on the  same playing field as women.   Miguel Cardona is also complicit in Merrick Garland's memo directing  the FBI and DOJ to target parents who were considered domestic  terrorists for speaking out at school board meetings.   Internal emails between the National School Boards Association's  secretary-treasurer and a member of a school board in a Washington  school district revealed that Secretary Cardona requested the NSBA to  write a letter to the White House to provide supporting information for  why parents are domestic terrorists.   This letter, sent on September 29, 2021, from the NSBA to the White  House, said that disruptions by parents at school board meetings posed  a threat of domestic terrorism. Don't forget, these people are paid by  the parents, who are the taxpayers. The letter suggested that parents  who object to mask mandates and critical race theory are engaging in a  form of domestic terrorism.   A week later, Garland issued a memo directing the FBI and DOJ to  target parents, citing the contents of this letter as a reason for  such.   Miguel Cardona was one who requested that the National School Boards  Association write this letter to the White House.   Prior to serving as the Secretary of the Department of Education,  Miguel Cardona implemented the Nation's first mandated statewide CRT  curriculum in Connecticut. Critical race theory is a destructive,  racist ideology that promotes Black supremacy and teaches that America  is fundamentally racist. It is not.   He is now pushing the same CRT agenda across the Nation's school  system by attempting to implement CRT curriculum in schools and into  the grant-making process. After enough pushback, he said that the  Department will not dictate or recommend the curriculum to be taught in  classrooms. However, the Department is still encouraging projects that  incorporate racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically  diverse perspectives in classroom instruction.   While the Department claims it no longer requires grant recipients to  incorporate CRT into its curriculum, they are still explicitly pushing  for it in the grant application process.   Secretary Miguel Cardona's actions are destroying our Nation's school  systems. He should be fired immediately, and I urge all of my  colleagues to vote for this amendment. Protect our kids. This must be  done.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, my Democratic colleague across  the aisle, who is 80 years old and has been here over 30 years, just  said we are on the verge of a shutdown. She probably just forgot that a  few hours ago she voted for the continuing resolution that will extend  the budget, and we are not on the verge of a shutdown. So I just wanted  to note that for the Record.   I also urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment. We should pass  this Holman rule. We need to protect our kids. No males belong in  women's sports in schools, and parents are not terrorists and never  should be referred to that way.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
