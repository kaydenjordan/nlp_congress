 Madam Speaker, in March of this year, The Washington Post  published an article titled: ``GOP lawmakers push historic wave of  bills targeting rights of LGBTQ teens, children, and their families.''   In April, The Washington Post published another article titled:  ``Some Republicans fear party overreach on LGBT measures.''   I just thought I would now recite for you what Jesus Christ said  about homosexuality: ``. . . . ''                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, when I served in the U.S. military, I was  trained on firearms.   Let me tell you what a bullet from an AR-15 does to you. The bullet  leaves the muzzle of the AR-15 at a speed three times higher than that  of a handgun. The energy is so strong that the bullet will disintegrate  3 inches of your bone.   A person shot with an AR-15 looks like a grenade exploded in their  body. The bullet also causes your human flesh to ripple violently, so  that even if the bullet misses your artery, the human flesh, the  ripples can burst arteries anyway.   In Uvalde, Texas, little kids were decapitated and had their faces  blown off.   A person under 21 cannot buy a Budweiser. We should not let a person  under 21 buy an AR-15 weapon of war.
