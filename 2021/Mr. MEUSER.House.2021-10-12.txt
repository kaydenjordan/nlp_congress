 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for  exposing that facts are very stubborn things.   Mr. Speaker, what am I missing here? The Democrat leadership just  lectured us on how critical it is for all of us to vote for their huge  debt ceiling increase as an obligation, as our duty.   Yet Democrat leadership, we are showing, has voted against debt  ceilings many times. I have quotes here from their commentary. It would  create uncertainty in the overall economy, leading to job-destroying  credit downgrades, et cetera, et cetera.   Mr. Speaker, this is hypocrisy, and my constituents and the American  people are very tired of it.   As well, to say that this debt ceiling is for past bills is false.  Let's then set the debt ceiling at a responsible level, not at the  level which just happens to accommodate the $5 trillion-plus planned  reconciliation tax-and-spend bill they are working on.   Asking us to raise a credit card limit trillions and have no say at  all in how it is spent, Mr. Speaker, that is irresponsible, and I won't  be part of it.
