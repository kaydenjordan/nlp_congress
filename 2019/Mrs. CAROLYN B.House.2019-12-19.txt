 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend  for yielding and for his great leadership.   Madam Speaker, there was a lot wrong with the 2017 Republican tax  law. This week, we can fix part of it by repealing the cap on the State  and local tax deduction, or SALT.   The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to deduct from their Federal  taxes the State and local income property taxes they pay. Republicans  capped the SALT deductions at $10,000, far, far less than many New  Yorkers pay. It has caused a great deal of pain for many New Yorker  families.   There is also a marriage penalty in the law. So if two people who  each have $10,000 in SALT get married, their combined deduction goes  from $20,000 to $10,000 when they tie the knot. That doesn't make  sense.   The bill before us, H.R. 5377, introduced by my colleague,  Tom  Suozzi, addresses both of these issues. It lifts the cap for married  couples to $20,000 in 2019. It eliminates the cap entirely for the  following 2 years and pays for it by restoring the previous top  marginal tax rate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5377.    MALONEY of New York changed her vote from ``yea'' to  ``nay.''   So the bill was passed.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
