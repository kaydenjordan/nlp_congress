 Madam Speaker, there are more troops right now in  Washington, D.C., than in Afghanistan. They are here to defend us  against the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, and  his mob.   I would ask my colleagues to look at the faces of those young  Americans defending democracy, defending us, and find an ounce of their  courage to do the right thing, as several Republicans have, and take a  tough vote for the future of democracy, for the future of our country.
