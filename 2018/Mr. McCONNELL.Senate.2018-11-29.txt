 Madam President, this week, the Senate has taken  important steps to fulfill our advise-and-consent responsibility on the  President's nominees. We have ended unnecessary delays that kept well- qualified individuals from filling important posts at the Departments  of Agriculture and Commerce and confirmed both of them.                            ____________________     Now, on an entirely different matter, I am sorry to  say it is time to begin offering thanks and farewells to Members whose  Senate service will conclude at the end of the 115th Congress.   Today, I would like to begin with our friend, the senior Senator from  Nevada. It doesn't feel like much of an exaggeration to say that Dean  Heller may have been destined for public service. I don't just mean his  eagerness to serve or his outgoing personality. There were other signs.  For example, one of the stops on his childhood paper route in Carson  City was the Governor's mansion itself. Talk about early civic  involvement.   At every step of the way, from successful businessman to his local  and statewide races, all the way here to the Capitol, Dean earned the  respect of his neighbors and constituents by following the hard-working  example set by his parents. His mother worked as a cook in a school  cafeteria. His father was an auto mechanic who raced stock cars on the  side. Their son grew up to be the only sitting Senator I would trust to  replace my transmission.   When most politicians use phrases like ``rolling up their sleeves''  and ``getting their hands dirty,'' they are usually referring to things  like late-night negotiating or taking tough votes--in other words, more  talking. Not Dean Heller, he means it literally. As Dean likes to say,  here in Washington, during the week, he works for the people of Nevada,  but at home, on the weekends, there he works for his wife Lynne on the  ranch they keep up together.   But let it not be said that even in the midst of hard labor, Dean  isn't capable of multitasking. After all, sometimes official duties  just can't wait. I have it on good authority that on one occasion Dean  had to field a surprise phone call from President Obama on his cell  while standing right in the middle of a ditch. Another time, he took a  call from President Trump and talked business right there in the aisle  of a home improvement store. Something about this image seems just  right--not talking, not posturing, doing. That is Dean Heller; isn't  it?    He didn't come to Washington to court praise for lofty rhetoric or to  become a TV star. He came here to do. In just 7 years, Dean has  authored or helped to introduce 100 pieces of legislation that are now  law.   Perhaps first and foremost, he has built a reputation as one of the  Senate's chief advocates for our veterans. Dean shares his home State  with more than 200,000 men and women who have served our Nation,  including one he calls ``Dad.''   Keeping the promise of top-notch VA services across Nevada's  widespread rural communities is no small task. The facilities in Reno,  in particular, weren't always up to the job, but day in and day out,  Dean has made it his mission to right the ship. As a member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, he has fought to expand access to care,  contributing key provisions to the VA MISSION Act and spearheading the  21st Century Veterans Benefits Delivery Act. It is a legacy that is  already making a difference for our veterans.   But these are hardly the only victories Dean won for Nevada and for  our Nation. He came to the Senate in 2011, representing a State that  had been hit hard by the great recession and was trying hard to regain  its footing. Nevada communities faced ballooning foreclosure rates and  persistent unemployment. Fortunately, their new Senator was intent on  hooking up the economic jumper cables and getting things humming once  more.   Dean has seized opportunities to champion an economic agenda that  puts workers and job creators back in the driver's seat. He was a  driving force behind the once-in-a-generation tax reform passed last  December to put more  [[Page S7198]]  money in the pockets of working families. It is pouring a new 21st  century foundation for American businesses to compete, win, and create  more jobs right here at home.   Today, Nevada is doing better, our Nation is flourishing, and Dean  Heller was there every step of the way. He was especially instrumental  in making sure that tax reform increased the child tax credit. Dean  knew that working parents need that money more than the IRS does.   Nevada veterans, Nevada workers, Nevada families--Dean never lost  sight of the reason he came here to Washington. He has been a happy  warrior here in the trenches, with a ready grin and an iron  determination to do right by his friends and his neighbors.   I also have it on good authority that seeing Dean in action back home  in his natural habitat is truly a sight to behold. His joy at every  conversation and every handshake around Carson City are palpable.  Nevadans are Dean's people. They always have been, and he has always  been theirs too.   According to some of the staff who travel around the State with him,  it is practically impossible to make any brief stops anywhere. At a  fast-food restaurant, or a sporting goods store, or even a gas station,  Dean would inevitably run into friends and set about swapping stories  or Carson City inside jokes. On the rare occasions when Dean didn't  know the proprietor or fellow customers--no trouble, no trouble--he  would have a room full of new friends in about 3 minutes flat.   I am told it never got old for the people around Dean to witness the  energy he drew from his friends, neighbors, and constituents. He was  delighted to be one of them and honored to be their employee--``a man  of the people''--not a cliche, in this case, a reality.   You don't need to take my word for it. I hear there is objective  evidence out there, photographs from the Nevada Day Parade in Carson  City. Suffice it to say it takes a certain kind of person to steal the  show, riding horseback, dressed head to toe in full western regalia,  something like John Wayne. It is no wonder his grandkids--Brielle,  Zachary, and Ava--know him as ``Duke.''   Now, his boss, Lynne, might very well have put him up to it. I hear  she rides right there alongside him. But Dean is no newcomer to the  parade. In fact, it is the very same parade he marched in as a Scout  years ago.   If you read that story in a book, you would think it was almost too  earnest and too all-American to be true, but that is Dean Heller. He is  the paper boy who started out delivering the headlines and wound up  making the headlines, the Senator who still saddles up for the same  parade from his childhood memories, one of Nevada's favorite sons and a  dedicated servant of the entire Silver State.   Dean's colleagues are really sorry to see him go. For a leader with  this much heart and this much talent, any departure would feel  premature. This one certainly does, but I doubt Dean will have trouble  finding good uses for a little more spare time. I know he and Lynne  must be looking forward to saddling up their horses and setting out for  the Sierras a little more often than they have been able to lately, and  I hear he could use a little bit of rehearsal time before he leads the  Heller family band through its repertoire of Christmas carols this  year--lead trombone. Lead trombone is no laughing matter. Maybe he will  even find time to get back in the driver's seat for a race or two.   So whatever it is that Dean does next--whatever it is--he should take  with him great pride in all he has accomplished here in a policy legacy  that will continue lifting up our Nation's veterans, workers, and  middle-class families literally for years and years to come, and the  sincere best wishes of the friends he has made here in this Chamber for  health, happiness, and every future success for himself, for Lynne, and  for their entire lovely family.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I move to  proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 1153.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
