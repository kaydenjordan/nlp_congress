 Madam Speaker, I agree with my friend from Colorado that we  should condemn all violence. We should condemn violence to unborn  children, also, but that doesn't seem to be something that is shared on  the other side of aisle.   One of the pregnancy centers that was targeted last year was Life  Choices Pregnancy Medical Center located in my home State and at the  time in my district in Colorado. On June 25 at 3:17 a.m., first  responders responded to a fire at the pregnancy center. The fire was  the result of angry protestors acting out after the Supreme Court's  Dobbs decision. Not much was salvageable from the fire, but what  remained were hateful and extreme messages graffitied on the exterior  of the building.   Kathy Roberts, the executive director of Life Choices, is here today  to commemorate passage of this resolution. I am honored to have Kathy  here and to introduce this brave and dedicated woman.   I thank Kathy for being here.   Sadly, our Nation has become all too familiar with the violent  attacks on pro-life centers. In 2022, over 100 pro-life centers were  violently attacked, and there has been minimal accountability. Instead  of Democrats accepting the Supreme Court Dobbs decision and condemning  this violence, they have egged it on, including some who told pro- abortion protestors to rise up and commended their violence by stating  it was a way for individuals to channel their righteous anger into  meaningful action.   Our Nation is a Nation of law and order, and violence is never the  path we should pursue to create effective change.
