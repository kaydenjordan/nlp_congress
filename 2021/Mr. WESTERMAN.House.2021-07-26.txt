 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this year, as the gentlewoman pointed out, marks the  20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11. While almost  two decades have passed since that tragic day, we will never forget the  thousands of innocent people who lost their lives and the brave first  responders who put their lives on the line in our country's time of  need.   Memorials have been established nationwide to honor the victims and  first responders who were killed in the attacks, including the National  9/11 Pentagon Memorial in Virginia, the Flight 93 National Memorial in  Pennsylvania, and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New  York.   H.R. 2278, offered by Congressman Connolly, authorizes the Secretary  of the Interior to designate a memorial trail, approximately 1,300  miles in length, to link the three existing September 11 memorials in  Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania. The tour route will intersect  Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and  Washington, D.C., and will be administered by the National Park  Service.   This bill will help preserve the memory of the 2,977 innocent people  who lost their lives on 9/11 and ensure that we never forget the  horrors of that fateful day. I hope it also serves as some solace to  the families of the victims, who can use this trail to remember and  honor their lost loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1029, offered by Congressman Steube of Florida,  would waive the application fee associated with special use permits for  any veterans' demonstrations or special events at war memorials located  on Federal land.   Each year, hundreds of veterans' groups and Gold Star families visit  our national war memorials in Washington, D.C. This is done through  arranged visits sponsored by veterans' organizations. To obtain a  permit for any special events they hold, these veterans' groups may be  required to pay administrative fees and other processing costs to the  National Park Service. The Free Veterans from Fees Act waives these  special use permit fees for veterans' groups so that they may hold  their demonstrations and special events at war memorials administered  by the National Park Service in the District of Columbia free of  charge.   The last thing veterans and their families should worry about is  paying administrative fees when visiting memorials and monuments built  in their honor. These brave men and women fought to defend our Nation,  and we should honor their sacrifices by making it as simple as possible  for them to visit these sites.   I commend Congressman Steube for his work on this bill, I urge  adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a great bill to honor our heroes  and to say thank you in another way. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 1154, offered by Congressman McEachin, requires the Secretary of  the Interior to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating a  national heritage area comprised of cities and counties in Virginia and  counties in North Carolina to be known as the Great Dismal Swamp  National Heritage Area.   While many think of Washington, D.C. as a great dismal swamp, it is  actually a marshy region on the coastal plain of southeastern Virginia  and northeastern North Carolina that stretches roughly 37 miles north  to south and covers an area approximately 750 square miles. The Great  Dismal Swamp has a long history of Native American inhabitants and was  a known route and destination for freedom seekers.   This measure already passed the House as an amendment to H.R. 803,  the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act earlier this  Congress. I did not support the measure then because it had not gone  through regular order and was being added to a package that created 1.5  million acres of new wilderness. You could say this measure was bogged  down here in the swamp.   While this is not how the process should work, I am happy that this  bill has now gone through regular order, and I would, therefore, urge  adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 1664, offered by Congressman Veasey, would authorize the  National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to establish a commemorative  work on Federal land in the D.C. area to recognize Medal of Honor  recipients.   The Medal of Honor is our Nation's highest medal for valor in combat  awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The medal was first  authorized in 1861 for U.S. Navy sailors and marines, and the following  year for Army soldiers. Since then more than 3,500 Medals of Honor have  been awarded to members of all Department of Defense services and the  Coast Guard. Medals of Honor are awarded sparingly and only bestowed on  the bravest of the brave whose courage and valor in combat is well  documented.   According to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, at least 10  Arkansans have been awarded the Medal of Honor since its inception.  This includes John Henry Pruitt, an Arkansan who is one of only 19  soldiers to ever be awarded the Medal of Honor twice. Our State Capitol  in Little Rock also boasts its own Medal of Honor Memorial, which  depicts a bronze eagle surrounded by plaques honoring each individual  Medal of Honor recipient from Arkansas.   I would like to thank Congressman Veasey and Congressman Blake Moore  of Utah, a freshman on our committee, for their leadership on this  important bipartisan bill. I urge adoption of the measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill and strongly  [[Page H3862]]  support creating this memorial, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2365, offered by Congressman Kim, would extend the  authorization of the Gold Stars Mothers National Monument Foundation to  construct the Gold Star National Mothers Monument. Legislation signed  into law during the 112th Congress authorized the Gold Star Mothers  National Monument Foundation to erect a monument on Federal lands in  Washington, D.C., that would honor mothers whose children gave the last  full measure of devotion defending the United States as members of the  Armed Forces.   This bill would allow more time for the Foundation to ensure the  monument's construction and completion by extending the authorization  until January 2, 2027.   We can never fully understand the lifelong grief that these Gold Star  Mothers must face, and I hope that this new memorial serves as a  collective place for them to heal and remember their brave children who  valiantly fought to defend our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2497, offered by my friend, Representative Neguse  from Colorado, would establish the Amache National Historic Site in  Colorado as a unit of the National Park System.   In 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an executive  order, later enforced by law, to forcibly remove tens of thousands of  Japanese Americans, including nearly 70,000 American citizens, from the  West Coast to internment centers further inland during World War II.  The smallest internment camp was located a mile from Granada, Colorado,  and was officially known as Amache. Over 7,000 residents of Japanese  ancestry, most of them American citizens, were imprisoned at Amache  from 1942 to 1945. The Amache site was added to the National Register  of Historic Places in 1994 and designated a National Historic Landmark  in 2005.   Amache is currently owned by the town of Granada, Colorado, and  maintained by a group of student volunteers who, led by their high  school social studies teacher, are known as the Amache Preservation  Society.   During a hearing on the bill in the Natural Resources Committee  earlier this year, we heard testimony from an Amache survivor, Mr. Bob  Fuchigami. Mr. Fuchigami was just 11 when his family was forcibly  relocated to Amache and during his powerful testimony, he said the  following about the bill: ``Designating Amache a national park site  would shine a light on our forgotten history and help tell a more  complete story of America. Amache is our collective story. It is an  American story.''   Adding the Amache site to the National Park System will help educate  Americans about this dark chapter in  [[Page H3864]]  our Nation's history and help us not to repeat the mistakes of our  past. Sites like Amache help to remind us of the challenges our Nation  has faced and the mistakes we have made as we have endeavored to form a  more perfect Union.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that in Mr.  Fuchigami's own words we can ``help shine a light on this forgotten  history.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak today in support of H.R. 4300, the  Alexander Lofgren Veterans in Parks Act, also known as the VIP Act,  which is sponsored by Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks from Iowa.   This bipartisan bill, which currently has 150 cosponsors, would  provide free annual passes to our national parks and public lands for  current military servicemembers and free lifetime passes for veterans  and members of Gold Star families.   We can never fully repay the debt owed to our military  servicemembers, veterans, and Gold Star families. However, as a small  acknowledgment of their sacrifice, this bill will ensure that they can  always access over 2,000 Federal recreation areas across the country  that they fought so hard to defend free of charge.                                time  1530    By codifying these passes under the Federal Lands Recreation  Enhancement Act, it guarantees this benefit can never be taken away  from these brave men and women.   This bill is important not only because it honors the sacrifice of  the men and women of our military and Gold Star families but because  our public lands hold a special value for veterans, particularly those  wounded in combat.   Captain John Paluska, a constituent of Representative Miller-Meeks  and a Purple Heart recipient, summed up the purpose and meaning of this  bill perfectly when he testified before our committee earlier this  month: ``I mentioned the word `freedom' earlier. Is it a concept? Is it  a place? Is it the result of an action? What does it mean for  [[Page H3865]]  each of you on this committee? For me, it is all of those, and I find  this each and every time I am so very fortunate to visit the outdoors  and our national parks.''   This bill would not only allow our veterans and Gold Star family  members to always enjoy the freedom of our national parks, but it will  remove any financial barriers they may face to accessing places they  use to heal the emotional and physical burdens they carry with them.   In addition to the 150 bipartisan cosponsors of this bill, there are  also 60 organizations currently endorsing the measure. These  organizations represent a diverse variety of interests, from the  outdoor recreation industry to veterans groups, and include The  American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of  America, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, REI, Vista Outdoor, Audubon  Society, and The Nature Conservancy.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record five letters in support of the  bill from the Outdoor Industry Association, Sierra Club, Backcountry  Hunters and Anglers, American Cultural Resources Association, and  Evangelical Environmental Network.                                   Outdoor Industry Association,                                                       July 9, 2021.      Hon. Joe Neguse,      Chairman, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public           Lands, Washington, DC.      Hon. Russ Fulcher,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and           Public Lands, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neguse and Ranking Member Fulcher, On behalf       of our 1,200 manufacturer, supplier, sales representative and       retailer members, Outdoor Industry Association (OIA) is proud       to support the ``Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act'' to give       veterans and members of the Armed Forces free access to       national parks and public lands.        Spending time in nature can provide countless mental and       physical health benefits for everyone, including our nation's       servicemembers. Through studies and anecdotes, we know       outdoor activities are linked to improved mental health and       long-term psychological well-being. Additionally, increasing       access and opportunity to outdoor spaces is an important way       to honor those who have risked their lives to protect us and       this country.        The outdoors can be a restorative force for all, helping       individuals and communities thrive. We are pleased to see the       commitment to ensuring those who served our country have the       resources they need to participate in outdoor activities and       experience everything our beautiful national parks and public       lands have to offer. OIA is committed to honoring and       respecting servicemembers through access to the outdoors and       outdoor recreation, and we look forward to seeing this bill       become law.            Sincerely,                                                  Lise Aangeenbrug,                                        Executive Director, Outdoor      Industry Association.                                   ____                                                      July 13, 2021.      Hon. Joe Neguse,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee           on Federal Lands, Washington, DC.      Hon. Russ Fulcher,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee           on Federal Lands, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neguse, Ranking Member Fulcher, and Members       of the House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on       National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands: On behalf of 3.8       million members and supporters, the Sierra Club urges you to       support the Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act, H.R. 4300. This       bipartisan legislation would help military service members,       veterans, and Gold Star Families explore, enjoy, and heal on       America's public lands and waters by removing a financial       barrier to access over 2,000 federal recreation areas.        America's public lands and waters provide unique       opportunities for healing and respite for veterans upon       returning home from service. Unfortunately, these       opportunities are not equally available to all. No one,       especially veterans, active duty service members, and Gold       Star Families, should be denied access to the benefits of       nature because of a lack of funds. The Veterans in Parks Act       will ensure that those who have served and sacrificed for our       nation can enjoy a direct connection to the land they defend.        Many veterans face considerable challenges upon returning       home. Repeat exposure to trauma and long deployments away       from family and friends has resulted in a generation of       veterans that have difficulty reintegrating into civilian       life. In addition, some of the effects of war, such as       traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress, leave no       visible scars and can be equally or more disabling than an       apparent physical injury, making it even harder to adjust to       life at home. As a result, the demand for mental health       services for veterans continues to grow. According to the       U.S. Government Accountability Office, the number of veterans       receiving mental health care from the Department of Veterans       Affairs increased 90% from FY 2006-2019--more than three       times the rate of increase for all VA health care services.       During this time, VA's mental health budget increased from       $2.4 to $8.9 billion.        Time spent outdoors is proven to promote mental and       physical health and well-being. For veterans, these benefits       can be exceptionally profound; research into the efficacy of       outdoor recreation as therapy shows significant improvements       in mental and physical well-being, social function, and       outlook on life with even moderate exposure to nature.       Research also indicates that these programs may be especially       beneficial to veterans most in need of help, supplemented by       fewer stigmas being associated with outdoor recreation       compared to clinical treatments. Expanding access to these       benefits is a common-sense, cost-effective way to ease       veterans' transition into civilian life and improve the       health and wellbeing of service members and Gold Star       Families.        Veterans are already relying on the healing power of the       outdoors. Structured programs utilizing outdoor recreation on       federal lands have become increasingly common within various       Veterans Service Organizations.        Last year, Congress passed the Accelerating Veterans       Recovery Outdoors Act, which will create an interagency task       force to identify veterans' barriers to access and recommend       how the Department of Veterans Affairs can utilize public       lands as an adjunct therapy for veterans. This victory was a       critical step to ensure veterans have ample opportunities to       enjoy outdoor recreation on the land they served to protect.       Similarly, the Veterans in Parks Act will be an important       part of fulfilling that mission and improving the lives of       veterans, service members, and Gold Star Families.        Thank you for your support for our nation's service       members, veterans, and Gold Star Families.            Sincerely,                                                    Rob Vessels,                                          Military Outdoors Campaign      Manager, Sierra Club.                                   ____                                    Backcountry Hunters & Anglers,                                                       July 8, 2021.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chair, House Natural Resources Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Grijalva and Ranking Member Westerman: On behalf       of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers (BHA), the voice for our       wild public lands, waters and wildlife, we write in support       of the bipartisan Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act (H.R. 4300) led       by Representatives Miller-Meeks (R-IA) and Gallego (D-AZ).       This important legislation will provide free annual America       the Beautiful Passes to current military service members and       free lifetime America the Beautiful Passes to veterans and       members of Gold Star Families.        We recognize that members of the armed forces are a       critical constituency when it comes to the defense of our       wild public lands. BHA's Armed Forces Initiative focuses on       connecting veterans to our public lands through lowering the       barrier of entry of hunting and fishing for military members,       engaging veterans through skill camps and leading restoration       projects, and elevating the voices of veterans from town       halls to the discussion of legislation at the congressional       level. The benefits provided by the VIP Act would fit well       within this mission.        The VIP Act is supported by hunters and anglers who want to       recognize the sacrifice made by service members, veterans and       Gold Star Families. The debt to these individuals can never       be repaid, but the VIP Act would give them access, at no       cost, to over 2,000 federal recreation areas including       national parks, national forests and national wildlife       refuges. This will eliminate barriers and increase access to       hunt, fish and recreate on our nation's treasured public       lands, an honor they deserve.        Since 2020, the annual America the Beautiful Pass has been       free for veterans and Gold Star Families, however the VIP Act       would change these to lifetime passes and codify this program       to ensure it continues in the years to come. Passing this       legislation would not only ensure this program continues for       veterans and Gold Star Families, but it would also provide       the much-needed inclusion for current service members.        We urge the Natural Resources Committee to pass the VIP Act       and honor the service of our nation's active-duty military,       veterans and Gold Star Families by increasing their access to       our public lands and waters. As the bill continues through       the legislative process, we look forward to working with you       and your colleagues to see it across the finish line.            Sincerely,                                                   Morgan Mason,                                             Armed Forces Initiative                        Coordinator, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.  [[Page H3866]]                                          ____                                                  American Cultural                                           Resources Association,                                                      July 12, 2021.      Hon. Mariannette Miller-Meeks,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ruben Gallego,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Miller-Meeks and Gallego: The American       Cultural Resources Association (ACRA) strongly supports H.R.       4300, the Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act, and commends you for       introducing this worthy legislation.        ACRA is the national trade association supporting the       common interests of cultural resource management (CRM) firms       of all sizes, types, and specialties. ACRA member firms       undertake much of the legally mandated cultural resource       studies and investigations in the United States. They employ       thousands of professionals, including archaeologists,       architectural historians, historians, ethnographers, and an       increasingly diverse group of other specialists who work with       communities in every state to help protect and record our       nation's historic and cultural heritage.        Our nation's public lands, monuments and parks help tell       the story of America, from the battlefields of Yorktown to       the Pacific coast and everything in between. These public       lands educate, entertain and inspire millions of Americans       and visitors from around the world. They are integral to       understanding America's history and culture, while providing       enormous ecological benefits to our nation's ecosystem.        As veterans, you both understand first-hand the enormous       sacrifices that servicemembers and their families have made       to protect our nation. Their contributions to our nation's       story are incalculable; they certainly should not have to pay       to access to our most treasured and beautiful public lands.        By giving active-duty servicemembers free annual passes,       and veterans and Gold Star Families free lifetime passes, to       our national parks and lands, the VIP Act honors both our       nation's historic and scenic heritage and the people who have       sacrificed so much to protect it.        We commend you for your leadership in introducing this       bipartisan bill, and we urge Congress to pass it as soon as       possible.            Sincerely,                                                 Nathan Boyless,                                                          President,      American Cultural Resources Association.                                   ____                                           Evangelical Environmental                                                         Network,                                                      July 12, 2021.      Ref: H.R. 4300--117th Congress (2021-2022)       Hon. Joe Neguse, Chair,      Hon. Russ Fulcher, Ranking Member,      Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands,           Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Neguse and Ranking Member Fulcher, Our National       Parks and other public lands are essential to our quality of       life. They make God's creation available to everyone. They       reflect our ideals as a nation: that everyone is welcome       because all individuals are created equal and endowed with       the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of       happiness. To step into a National Park and enjoy the beauty       of God's creation is to experience freedom and the richness       of life as persons made in the image of God. That's why over       400,000 pro-life Christians have joined with us to defend and       protect these God-given National Treasurers.        Most Christians have experienced God in our natural parks       and public lands, but we also have the responsibility to care       for them. We are commanded to tend the earth and steward all       aspects of this wonderful creation given to us to sustain       abundant physical life, enjoy, and even play in. Creation       doesn't belong to any one person or group to exploit,       plunder, or be used selfishly. It's a trust, given by God,       for the benefit of humanity and the glory of God.        That is why The Evangelical Environmental Network supports       the efforts of Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-      IA), Representative Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), and the over 140       other cosponsors for introducing the Veterans in Park (VIP)       Act! The VIP Act offers a small thank you to our military       service members, veterans, and Gold Star Families for their       patriotism and service to our nation, but it goes beyond       saying thanks, it offers an opportunity for healing. Medical       research clearly proves the ability to find healing in our       greatest outdoor treasurers, America's National Parks. God's       marvelous creation provides perhaps the greatest healing       place for many of our heroes and their families who suffer       deep internal wounds. The VIP Act offers our heroes hope for       healing, wholeness, restoration, and simply great fun!        Our prayer is that the Subcommittee on National Parks,       Forests, and Public Lands will quickly move this to the full       committee and then onward to the House floor in quick order.        Thank you for your service to our nation and know you are       in our prayers.            Sincerely,                                       The Rev. Mitchell C. Hescox,                                                   President/C.E.O.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record several news  articles that speak to the importance of this bill that have appeared  in papers all across the country.                        Honoring America's Real VIPs    (By Reps. Bruce Westerman (R-ARK.) and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-                       IOWA), Opinion Contributors)                       [From The Hill, July 4, 2021]         This year, we celebrate the 245th birthday of the United       States. Independence Day is a great day to picnic with       friends, spend time outside, and enjoy a fireworks show, but       it is also much more than that. It is our duty to honor the       men and women who, for the past two and a half centuries,       have kept our county free.        We owe a debt of gratitude to American military members and       their families and we want to repay them in a very small way       by giving them lifetime access to our national parks.        There are few things that instill American pride quite like       watching the sun set over the Grand Canyon, seeing bison roam       through Yellowstone, or hiking through the forest in Acadia.       From sea to shining sea, we are a nation of incredible beauty       and biodiversity. Congress recognizes the mental and physical       health benefits of outdoor recreation for current       servicemembers and veterans. Last December Congress passed       and President Trump signed legislation establishing an       interagency task force to identify barriers and make       recommendations to increase the use of public lands and other       outdoor spaces for veteran medical treatment.        Removing barriers and increasing access to our public lands       is exactly why we have introduced the bipartisan Veterans in       Parks (VIP) Act: to give servicemembers, veterans, and Gold       Star families free passes to all national parks and federal       recreational lands for life. It is the least we can do for       those who gave so much for our country. Currently, active       duty servicemembers and veterans are able to receive a one-      year free access pass to all parks with entrance fees. With       more than 135 co-sponsors, the VIP Act would codify the       active duty and veterans passes, as well as make the pass for       veterans a lifetime pass. It would also amend the previously       codified Gold Star families annual pass and make it a       lifetime pass.        As a veteran of the U.S. Army who served for 24 years,       Congresswoman Miller-Meeks is no stranger to the myriad       hardships that come from being a member of the military. We       both are also privileged to represent a host of       servicemembers in Congress and want to make it even easier       for them to enjoy time with family and friends in America's       most beautiful landscapes.        Our national parks are for all of us. No one is more worthy       of experiencing open access to these incredible places than       the men and women who fought to keep us free and the families       who made the ultimate sacrifice.        Unfortunately, it is often all too easy to pay lip service       to the military's sacrifice but then not follow through with       action to recognize their service. We aim to change that, one       legislative recognition at a time.        If you or a member of your family has been a member of the       U.S. Armed Forces, we are grateful for your service, today       and every day. We hope to see you in a national park soon.                                   ____                              [From Samoa News]             (Source: Congresswoman Uifa`atali Amata's Office)         Washington, DC.--Congresswoman Uifa'atali Amata voted       Wednesday for the Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act, H.R. 4300,       which was passed by the full Committee on Natural Resources       with bipartisan support. Amata cosponsored the legislation to       honor Veterans with free lifetime access to all U.S. National       Parks, and other National Forests and public lands.        The Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act specifically honors the       nation's servicemembers, veterans, and Gold Star families as       VIPs in over 2,000 federally protected places. Amata       supported the bill from the start as an original cosponsor       upon introduction by Representatives Mariannette Miller-Meeks       (R-IA) and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ).        Currently, the public can purchase annual ``America the       Beautiful'' passes that allow entry to all parks for one       year. The VIP Act works by providing these annual America the       Beautiful Passes for free to current military service       members, and free lifetime America the Beautiful Passes to       veterans and members of Gold Star Families.        ``This bill is a special statement of support for our       Veterans and military families, and another way to say thank       you,'' said Congresswoman Amata. ``The VIP Act honors those       serving, those who served, and Gold Star families who lost a       loved one in service to the United States, by ensuring you       are a VIP in the nation's federally protected historic and       beautiful places.''        The America the Beautiful pass is an access ticket to over       2,000 places spanning National Parks, National Forests and       Wildlife Refuges, which fall under different federal agencies       and departments. The National Parks system has 423 sites       including 63 Parks, along with trails, historical sites,       monuments and memorials. These sites are preserved for       national value based on scenery, special geographic features,       history, or plant and wildlife conservation. Some Parks, such       as the National Park of American Samoa, are generally free to       access, but many locations have fees, or passes applied per       car or for parking. The America the Beautiful pass covers       those entry expenses.        In 2020, the administration made America the Beautiful       yearly access free for Veterans  [[Page H3867]]       and Gold Star families, but the VIP Act takes it a step       further in three ways by extending it to lifetime passes,       making the change permanent, and codifying it in law.                                   ____                                [July 1, 2021]   Boone and Crockett Joins Over 100 Others Endorsing Veterans in Parks                                    Act         The Boone and Crockett Club endorsed H.R. 4300, the       Veterans In Parks Act, which was introduced earlier today       (https://republicans-naturalresources.house.gov/newsroom/ documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409869) by Reps. Miller-Meeks       and Gallego with an additional 133 bipartisan original       cosponsorsr.                                  Background         The America the Beautiful Pass provides access to more than       2,000 federal recreation areas, including our national parks,       national forests, and wildlife refuges. This includes some of       the country's most iconic treasures, ranging from the       majestic Grand Canyon National Park to the aweinspiring       Redwood National Forest. Although we can never fully repay       the debt we owe to our servicemembers and veterans, the VIP       Act would allow them, along with Gold Star Family members, to       visit our national parks and public lands free of charge. In       2020, the America the Beautiful annual pass became free for       veterans and Gold Star Families. However, this change for       veterans has never been codified and could be undone in       future years. The VIP Act protects these passes by codifying       them and making them lifetime passes instead of annual       passes. The VIP Act also creates annual passes for current       service members, which can be converted into lifetime passes       once they leave the military.

[July 8, 2021]  House Introduces Bill To Give Military Families Free Lifetime Access to                               National Parks                              (By Zach Hester)         (WHNT).--A new bill introduced in the U.S. House of       Representatives could allow veterans and Gold Star families       free lifetime access to national parks and public lands--and       free annual passes to active-duty members of the military.        The bipartisan bill, brought to the floor by Reps.       Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa) and Ruben Gallego (D-      Ariz.), creates the ``America the Beautiful Pass'' providing       these services members and their families free access to more       than 2,000 federal recreation areas, ranging from Acadia       National Park to Redwood National Forest.        ``As a 24-year Army veteran, I understand the sacrifices       made by our military and their loved ones,'' said Miller-      Meeks. ``We owe so much to our amazing servicemembers,       veterans, and their families; my Veterans in Parks Act is the       least we can do.''        In addition to creating the passes for services members and       their families, it also codifies them and makes them last a       lifetime. Last year, a similar measure was passed, but never       put into law.        ``As a veteran, I know firsthand the importance of national       parks as a place of connection and healing when dealing with       the visible and invisible wounds of war,'' Gallego said. ``I       am proud to co-lead this bill and I will continue to fight       for veteran accessibility and support on our nation's public       lands.''        The bill lists over 100 co-sponsors, including Alabama       Reps. Mo Brooks, Barry Moore, and Jerry Carl.                                   ____                               [July 14, 2021]    Proposal made to expand veterans' free access to all national parks                            (By Ariana Figueroa)         Washington.--U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa       testified Tuesday before the House Natural Resources       Committee hearing in support of bipartisan legislation that       would give veterans and Gold Star families free lifetime       access to national parks and public federal lands.        ``No one is more worthy of experiencing open access to the       incredible places that these men and women have fought to       keep us free and their families who have also made the       ultimate sacrifice along with them,'' the Iowa Republican       said.        Miller-Meeks is a veteran and worked on the bill, the       ``Veterans in Parks Act,'' with Rep. Ruben Gallego, an       Arizona Democrat who is also a veteran.        ``As a veteran, I know firsthand the importance of national       parks as a place of connection and healing when dealing with       the visible and invisible wounds of war,'' Gallego said in a       statement.        ``The VIP Act is an important step in ensuring that       veterans, service members, and Gold Star families have access       to the public lands they and their loved ones fought to       protect.''        Last year, the U.S. National Park Service made annual       visits to national parks free for veterans and active duty       service members, but the bill, H.R. 4300, would codify that       annual pass into law, to be used throughout their lives.        ``We can never fully repay our veterans for their service       and sacrifice, but we want to show our gratitude by giving       them lifetime access to America's beautiful landscapes,''       Miller-Meeks said.        The bill would also give active-duty military free annual       passes to national parks and public federal lands. Once those       members retire, their passes could be converted to lifetime       passes. A Gold Star family is an immediate family member of a       service member who died in the line of duty.        Capt. John Paluska, from Ottumwa, Iowa, testified before       the panel in support of the bill.        He said that in between his deployments, he would often       visit Yellowstone National Park ``and find my freedom all       throughout the park.''        ``There's something about connecting to nature at these       parks that helps with the healing,'' he said. ``I will always       carry the wounds of war with me wherever I go, but when I go       to these beautiful places, I am able to connect with one of       the reasons I decided to serve-this incredible, beautiful,       country.''                                   ____     Mr. Speaker, I would note that at our committee markup  earlier this month, as the gentlewoman has stated, we added a  bipartisan amendment to name this bill after a wounded veteran who,  sadly, passed away earlier this year.   Alexander Lofgren was a military and veterans' liaison for Chair  Grijalva through the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program and a lover of  the outdoors. I was happy to cosponsor Chair Grijalva's amendment to  name the bill after him and hope that this fitting tribute helps carry  on Alex's legacy and provides some level of comfort to his family and  friends.   Before I close, I thank Representative Miller-Meeks for her  leadership on this effort. A veteran herself who served 24 years in the  Army as a private, nurse, and doctor, Congresswoman Miller-Meeks is the  perfect champion of this legislation. I commend her for her commitment  to bipartisanship and for her work on behalf of our Nation's veterans  and her constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I again urge adoption of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 325, which would amend the Alyce  Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children Act, to  extend the deadline of the Commission's report from 3 years to 5 years  after the Commission is fully appointed and fully funded.   In 2016, the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on  Native Children Act was signed into law.   The purpose of the legislation was to establish, within the U.S.  Department of Justice's Office of Tribal Justice, a commission on  Native children and to conduct a comprehensive study regarding the  Federal and local programs, grants, and support available for Native  communities and Native children.   The legislation stipulated that 3 years after the date on which the  Commission is fully appointed and funded, the Commission shall issue a  report to Congress with its recommendations on how to achieve better  use of existing resources, increased coordination, measurable outcomes,  stronger data, enhanced private sector partnerships, and implementation  of best practices.   Funding for the Commission was not authorized in the enacted version.  However, the fiscal year 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided  $400,000 to the Commission.   With delays in securing funding and the full appointment of  Commission members, the Commission was not able to hold its first  meeting until December 2019. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed  much of the Commission's work.   In response to these challenges faced by the Commission, my good  friend, Mr. Young, introduced the House companion bill to S. 325, to  ensure that the Commission has adequate time to produce a complete and  comprehensive report.   I would like to commend Mr. Young for his continued tireless work on  behalf of American Indian and Alaska Natives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 18, the  No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  Act of 2021.   Earlier this month, President Biden released his budget, which does  not include the Hyde amendment, an amendment that prohibits Federal  taxpayer dollars from funding abortions through Medicaid. Hyde has been  included in every appropriations package since 1976 and is a  longstanding, bipartisan common ground bill between Republicans and  Democrats to protect the conscience of taxpayers.   President Biden has consistently expressed support for the Hyde  amendment throughout his career, and I am disappointed that his recent  shift signals to the American people that he will cave to the political  pressures of his left wing and force our tax dollars to pay for the  eugenics of our Nation's poorest individuals who are on Medicaid. We  cannot stand for this and must codify Hyde's restrictions on taxpayer- funded abortions.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
