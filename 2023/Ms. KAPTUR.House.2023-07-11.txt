 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the patriotic life  of Matt Hanenkrath, a pillar of Defiance County, Ohio.   Matt served as chief of the South Richland Volunteer Fire Department,  assistant chief of the Highland Township Volunteer Fire Department, and  director of the Defiance County 911 Communications Center.   Matt passed suddenly in the line of duty responding to a fire call.   Chief Hanenkrath was a true public servant. He embodied the very  essence of bravery, selflessness, and unwavering commitment to  community and country. He ran toward danger and faced flames with an  unyielding determination to safeguard his community.   His dedication to public service didn't stop there. Matt was also the  president of the Ayersville Board of Education and coached softball and  football. He exemplified the spirit of putting others before self and  tirelessly working to better his community.   He is survived by his wife, Ashley, and three children, Haleigh,  Brynn, and Bentley.   Mr. Speaker, in his memory, let us recommit ourselves to supporting  our firefighters. Let us value their heroic efforts.   Chief Hanenkrath's sacrifice will never be forgotten. His legacy as a  community leader will live on through the countless lives he impacted.  Chief Hanenkrath is an American hero.                            ____________________
