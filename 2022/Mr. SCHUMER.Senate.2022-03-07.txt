 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, well, let me start off with some great  news. When we vote later today, all of us will be able to say these  four wonderful words: Senator Lujan, welcome back.   He is not on the floor right now, but, Ben Ray, it was great to see  you back here in this Capitol last week. It was great to see you today.  We have missed you. We are thrilled to have you back on the job. We  admire your strength and your courage and your fortitude--your quiet  strength.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, now, over the weekend, Members from both the House and  Senate met virtually with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and  we reemphasized Congress's strong and unwavering commitment to  providing robust and ample assistance to his country in this time of  war.   I told the Ukrainian President he was an inspiration to Americans,  and I assured him that his pleas for help will not go unanswered.   In particular, President Zelenskyy made a desperate plea for getting  Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine. I  strongly support the President's request, and yesterday I called on the  administration to explore all feasible options to getting these fighter  aircraft to Ukraine. These planes are very much needed, Ukrainian  forces are familiar with them, and they will very much help in  countering the Russians, especially as Putin massacres--massacres-- civilians in Ukraine.   Democrats and Republicans broadly agree that this is a necessary step  against Russia's illegal invasion, and today I reiterate my call for  the administration to explore how to ensure the Ukrainians have the  capabilities they need.   I also spoke with the administration yesterday and was told they are  looking closely at imposing a ban on Russian oil.   Meanwhile, there are other steps Congress can take in the coming days  to support the Ukrainian people. Above all, we must finalize a more  than $12 billion emergency aid package to be included in the upcoming  omnibus spending bill. This emergency aid will provide both  humanitarian and military assistance for Ukraine--funding for refugees,  medical supplies, emergency food supplies, as well as funding to  support weapon transfers into Ukraine and help our eastern flank NATO  allies.   The clearest signal Congress can send to Vladimir Putin this week is  passing a bipartisan aid package, leaving no doubt that the democratic  nations of the world stand with Ukraine and against Putin's deeply  immoral and bloody war.   And again--let me say it again. The quickest--the quickest--way to  secure an emergency aid package for Ukraine is through the omnibus, and  I believe both sides are close--very close--to arriving at an  agreement.                                 Coronavirus    Now, on COVID aid, at the same time, there is another important  matter that Congress must address in the spending bill: additional  COVID relief aid, which the administration has wisely urged Congress to  approve.   The Federal Government has completely exhausted all the public health  funding approved last year as part of the American Rescue Plan. That  means that to prepare for future variants, more Federal funding is  needed now.   Across the country, thank God, we have seen signs that the United  States is turning the corner on COVID. Schools are open. Mask  guidelines are being reversed. Vaccinations have surpassed 216 million  Americans. And last Friday, we learned that more than 7 million jobs  have now been created since President Biden took office. This is all  great news. Cases are falling, unemployment is falling, and the country  is on the right track. But experience has taught us that new variants  can come back with a vengeance if--if--we aren't ready.   The administration has been clear: If we want schools to stay open,  if we want to preserve as much of normal life as possible when another  variant arises--and the odds are quite high that one will--Congress  must pass additional COVID funding now, not later. We have to have it  ready. We have to have the therapeutics ready. We have to have the  testing ready. We have to have the vaccines ready. We can't wait 2, 3  months after the variant hits to debate this issue and then allocate  the money and then production starts. That would be terrible for the  country. It will be too little too late. It is far better to prepare  now than play catch-up later. We should have learned our lesson a long  time ago, but now we are, hopefully.   I have been strongly urging my colleagues to get a deal done on  COVID. Failure to act is not an acceptable outcome.                                  H.R. 3076    Mr. President, another issue this week is postal reform. This week,  the Senate is going to put the finishing touches on a bipartisan  accomplishment weeks, months, and, in fact, years in the making:  comprehensive postal reform legislation.   Six days a week, the U.S. Postal Service processes an average of 167  million pieces of first-class mail. It employs nearly half a million  people. It has been a fixture of our country since the very beginning,  since Benjamin Franklin. But over the last decade, the post office has  been in serious need of reform. Everyone knows the frustration of  waiting weeks for a package to come in the mail. So this week, the  Senate is finally passing legislation that will deliver for the post  office the long-overdue reforms it has been waiting for.   The fact that this bill has extraordinary bipartisan support is  indicative of its importance, and I am glad that both sides have  negotiated in good faith thus far. I want to particularly thank  Chairman Peters and Ranking Member Portman for making sure this  legislation has kept moving over the past few weeks.   For generations, the post office has delivered for America, and now  Congress is delivering for the post office. By passing postal reform  legislation, we can ensure that Americans will continue to benefit from  a speedy, dependable, and well-run post office, just as we have for our  entire history.                                    Costs    Mr. President, now on costs, a few weeks ago, a Member of the  Republican leadership released a platform that proposed raising taxes  on tens of millions of Americans, focused on fanning the flames of  division, and zeroed in on proposals that failed to address the biggest  problems of our time.   Today, a new analysis found that a plan like that from the junior  Senator of Florida could raise taxes on many American families by more  than $1,000 in 2022 alone. Democrats don't think that we should be  raising taxes on working Americans as we recover from COVID. In fact,  we are working to make sure Americans have more money, not less, in  their pockets.   So, today, I sent my colleagues a letter outlining how Democrats will  keep a laser focus over the next few months on cutting costs, building  upon historic job growth, and finding bipartisan ways to help everyday  Americans make ends meet. Democrats are the party offering ideas for  how to combat inflation that is being felt around the world because of  COVID. Democrats are taking aim at capping insulin prices to $35  [[Page S1007]]  a month, while making prescription drugs much, much cheaper.   Democrats are working to repair supply chain bottlenecks that are  hurting businesses, including in our seaports. And Democrats are  zeroing in on policies to combat price hikes at the grocery store,  including meat prices, which the President noted last week.   This week, our caucus will hold our annual DPCC retreat, where we  will go over our proposals in greater detail. I want to compliment  Senator Stabenow for putting this retreat together, and I encourage all  of my colleagues to review my letter so we can all continue our work of  lowering costs for the American people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 55, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I just want to go over what just  happened.   After more than 200 failed attempts to outlaw lynching, Congress is  finally succeeding in taking the long-overdue action by passing the  Emmett Till Antilynching Act. Hallelujah. It is long overdue.   The first anti-lynching legislation was introduced a century ago, and  after so long, the Senate has now finally addressed one of the most  shameful elements of this Nation's past by making lynching a Federal  crime. That it took so long is a stain--a bitter stain--on America.   While this will not erase the horrific injustices to which tens of  thousands of African Americans have been subjected over the  generations--nor fully heal the terror inflicted on countless others-- it is an important step forward as we continue the work of confronting  our Nation's past in pursuit of a brighter and more just future.   I want to applaud the work of the legislation's sponsors. Senator  Booker has been relentless to get this done and deserves tremendous  credit, as does his colleague on the Republican side of the aisle,  Senator Scott, and, of course,  [[Page S1013]]  Representative   Bobby Rush, who worked so hard to pass this bill as  well.   We look forward now to President Biden quickly signing this long- delayed bill into law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 288, S. 2089.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged and the Senate now proceed  to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2545.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 537, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar, under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have one request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, March 7, 2022, at 6:15 p.m., to hold a  classified briefing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10:30 a.m.,  Tuesday, March 8, and that following the prayer and pledge, the time  for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day;  further, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to  allow for the weekly caucus meetings; finally, that all time during the  adjournment, recess, morning business, and leader remarks be counted  postcloture on H.R. 3076.    For the information of Senators, we will continue to  process the Postal Service Reform bill and hope to complete its action  during Tuesday's session.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:03 p.m., recessed until  Tuesday, March 8, 2022, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
