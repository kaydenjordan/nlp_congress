 Madam Speaker, I rise to say my final goodbye  to Alcee Hastings, the dean of Florida's congressional delegation, who  recently passed away.   Someone will be elected to fill his seat, but Alcee is irreplaceable.  His life was full, complex, and extraordinary.   Born in 1936, Alcee spent his formative years in my district. He  lived in Altamonte Springs and attended the all-Black Crooms Academy in  Sanford.   This was the segregated South where the opportunities available to  African Americans were few and the obstacles to success were many. But  Alcee was a force of nature. He rose to become an attorney, then a  State judge, and then a Federal judge.   Judge Hastings suffered a setback, but he rose again becoming a  Member of Congress admired by his colleagues and beloved by his  constituents.   As Congressman Hakeem Jeffries put it, he loved the people he served,  and he always fought for the least, the lost, and the left behind.   The book of Alcee's life contained challenging chapters, but  ultimately it is a story of redemption and achievement in the face of  adversity, written by a warrior for justice and equality who left the  world far better than he found it.   Rest in peace, Congressman. You have earned it.                            ____________________
