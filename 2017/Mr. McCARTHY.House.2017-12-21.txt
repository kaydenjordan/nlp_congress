 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me and for his work.   Mr. Speaker, it is only 4 days until Christmas. I look forward to  going home and being with my family. I know every single Member in this  body looks forward to that, too. I count my blessings that my family is  safe and that I have a community and home to head back to.   There are people in this country who don't have that. Their homes  were destroyed by wind, flood, and fires. Their communities were torn  apart by hurricanes and flames.   Mr. Speaker, I had the somber privilege of traveling to these places.  I went to Texas and spent time with Members from both sides of the  aisle, seeing the flooded homes and streets filled with water. We  visited NRG Stadium to meet the people forced to evacuate their homes.   I stood with Representatives like Sheila Jackson Lee, Al Green, Randy  Weber, and Brian Babin. These folks don't often agree on much in  politics. But you know what we did that day? We all promised to help  the people of Texas.   I flew to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with Minority Whip Steny  Hoyer, and I would like to thank Delegate Stacey Plaskett and Resident  Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon for welcoming us and opening the  eyes of the Nation to what was happening.   In the Virgin Islands, we visited a hospital. The storm left half of  it unusable. No dialysis machines. They had to come to the mainland.  Nurses and doctors were working, doing the best they could to help  people in the most difficult of circumstances.   In Puerto Rico, we were the first congressional delegation to visit  the interior after the storm. We were with Members like Jeff Denham,  Anthony Brown, and Norma Torres. We met people without power for weeks,  low on food, low on medicine. We saw schools and homes destroyed and  completely washed away.   We then went to Florida to see the other towns hit by Hurricane Irma,  places that face storms year after year.   I returned to my home State of California with Congressmen Mike  Thompson and Jared Huffman during the worst wildfire season our State  has ever seen. We saw the fires rage up north, where it destroyed  entire communities. Forty-six people have lost their lives in the fires  in California this year.   You could see the devastation, block after block. Ash heaps of homes  and trees, standing like barren pillars.   I met with firefighters down south, still battling what may become  the largest wildfire in California's history. As it looks right now,  they will still be standing on the front lines of those fires come  Christmas day.   Every single place I went, Democrats and Republicans stood together.  We saw the devastation together. We spoke to the suffering that the  people were having together, and together we made a promise that we  would return here to Washington and work hand-in-hand to help them as  soon as possible.   That is why you heard Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, on September 26, say  that he would ``work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  ensure Congress provides all funding necessary to ensure that all  Americans affected by these storms can recover and rebuild.''   That is why he said on November 2 that he believes ``we can work  together in a bipartisan way to ensure that the affected areas receive  the resources they need from Congress.''  [[Page H10392]]    That is why I appreciated joining him in an op-ed piece that was in  The Washington Post on November 8, where we wrote: ``We are determined  to ensure that there is strong bipartisan support for the next  supplemental emergency funding package so that affected areas, such as  those we visited, have the resources they need.''   Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke similarly. She signed a letter  with Members across California saying to President Trump that: We look  forward to working with you to ensure that all Americans who have been  severely impacted by recent natural disasters across the United States  receive the Federal support they need and deserve.   She told the Appropriations Committee that: Congress has an urgent  responsibility to the California families, whose lives have been  upended by disastrous wildfires.   I couldn't agree more with these statements. In the past few weeks  and months, we did--we worked together. We analyzed the damage. We  studied the requests from Governors and legislators. We even made  significant reforms to respond to disaster in the most effective and  responsible way possible.   The legislation today is the result. It provides funding for every  single State and territory affected by natural disasters.   I remind all my friends from California that this legislation  accommodates exactly what our entire delegation requested.   In all this work, we did it together in a bipartisan way; the way the  American people expect this body to work.   Now, I know it is the habit of this town to play politics. Mr.  Speaker, I do want to tell my friends on the other side: If they feel  like they have to, play politics on tax cuts. Call it whatever you want  to call it. Play politics on all the other legislation that comes to  this floor.   But if I can request one thing: Please don't do it here. Don't play  politics on a vote to give aid to the people of Texas; to the people of  Puerto Rico; to the people of the Virgin Islands; to the people of  Florida, and to the people of California, who are still fighting the  fires.   Don't play politics on a bill that you are going to hope to maybe  stop another. That would be the worst of any politics I have seen  played here.   Mr. Speaker, I beg my friends on the other side: Please don't do what  they did 2 weeks ago when they whipped against the funding bill to shut  the government down. If they don't like tax cuts, I understand;  vot against them. If they don't want to vote for the funding of the  government and they want to shut it down, fine, take that vote.    But here and now, right before Christmas, don't vote against aid for  Americans who just lost everything. They don't understand the politics  in it. Don't vote against aid we promised to deliver. Don't vote  against aid we worked so hard together to put on this floor.   Washington, D.C., can be far from our homes. We may all be dreaming  of being home with our kids, eating Christmas dinner, opening presents,  and enjoying time with our family and friends; but what we do here and  now has consequences. What we do here and now will either give tens of  thousands of people something to hope for this Christmas, or take that  hope away.   We can deliver that hope if those who stood with me on the flood  plains of Texas and on the burnt hills of California keep the promise  they made. We can deliver that hope if those who worked with us for so  long continue to work with us today.   People need our help. Vote to give them the help they need, the help  we all promised.    Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of making a  scheduling announcement.   Mr. Speaker, Members are advised that these are the last votes  expected in the House for the day, the week, the month, and the year.   Now, I want to thank all of the Members for their service to our  Nation. I want to wish you and your families a blessed holiday and a  very Merry Christmas, and I look forward to working with all of you in  2018.                            ____________________
