 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of The Respect  for Marriage Act because everyone should be able to marry who they  love. This important law will protect same-sex and interracial  marriages.   When I was serving in the Oregon State Legislature in 2007, I helped  pass the Oregon Family Fairness Act to give same-sex couples many of  the rights afforded to married couples. In 2014, a federal district  court judge found that Oregon's ban on same-sex marriages violated the  Oregon Constitution, and in 2015 the United States Supreme Court held  in Obergefell that all people have the right to marry who they love.   It is imperative that we pass the Respect for Marriage Act because  Justice Thomas cast doubt on rights grounded in privacy, including  same-sex and interracial marriages, in his concurring opinion in Dobbs  v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The Respect for Marriage Act  will enshrine this fundamental right into law and so it continues to be  protected.   Although it is essential that we pass the Respect for Marriage Act,  this legislation is a compromise. The bill as passed includes an overly  expansive exemption for faith-based nonprofit organizations. This  exemption is disappointing because it will allow legalized  discrimination and undermine the fundamental principles of fairness  this legislation is intended to uphold.   As Vice Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, I am proud  to continue standing with members of the LGBTQI+ community and their  allies as we pass the Respect for Marriage Act. I remain committed to  continue fighting against discrimination, including by enacting the  overdue Equality Act to close gaps in civil rights protections.   No one should face prejudice and violence because of who they are or  who they love. I urge my colleagues to support the Respect for Marriage  Act and swiftly send this bill to President Biden's desk.
