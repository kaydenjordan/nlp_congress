 Mr. President, first, this afternoon I would like to  recognize the career and public service of retired VADM Joseph Maguire,  whose  [[Page S1096]]  tenure as Acting Director of National Intelligence and Director of  National Counterterrorism Center concluded last week.   Joe Maguire spent 36 years serving our Nation as a U.S. Navy special  operator. His leadership record included SEAL Team 2 and the U.S. Navy  Special Warfare Command, where he guided some of our Nation's most  sensitive military operations.   Admiral Maguire retired from the Navy in 2010, but it was not long  before public service came calling again. In 2018, the President asked  him to direct the NCTC. The Senate confirmed him on a voice vote.   He took on an even more challenging assignment last summer when he  agreed to follow our former colleague Senator Dan Coats and act in the  role of the DNI.   Our Nation asks our intelligence community to fulfill an enormous  array of sensitive missions. These men and women work day and night to  protect the homeland from terrorists. They fight nuclear proliferation.  They keep watch on dangerous adversaries, like Russia and China. They  guard against what hostile intelligence services are doing in our  Nation, and they work to protect American elections from foreign  interference that seeks to sow division and chaos and reduce public  confidence in our democracy.   Recent reports suggest that adversaries, including Russia, are likely  continuing efforts aimed at dividing Americans, sowing chaos in our  politics, and undermining confidence in our elections. Fortunately, in  stark contrast to the failures of the Obama administration in 2016, the  Trump administration, once again, appears to be doing the right thing-- in this case, by promptly providing a specific counterintelligence  briefing to a Democratic Presidential candidate in question. This is  just the latest example of the vigilance and the action we have seen  from this administration on this crucial issue.   In parallel with hundreds of millions that Congress has appropriated  in new election security assistance for State and local authorities,  the administration has taken major proactive steps. The Treasury  Department has sanctioned numerous Russian entities involved in the  2016 interference. The Department of Homeland Security has worked  closely with States, local jurisdictions, and the private sector to  bolster our cyber security defenses.   The Obama administration's naive and belated efforts failed to deter  or to defend against Russian interference in 2016 and failed to provide  substantive counterintelligence briefings to the Trump and Clinton  campaigns. By contrast, the Trump administration has been vigilant and  appears to be providing timely warnings to candidates affected by  foreign intelligence activities. This is critically important work, and  it wouldn't be possible without the hard work of our intelligence  community to identify the hostile activities.   This is just one of many critical tasks the intelligence community  performs for our country. Our country is safer and stronger when they  have the tools and the resources they need and leadership that  understands that political bias must have no quarter in intelligence  work and that all Americans' rights need protecting.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, this week the  Senate will continue to fulfill both of our constitutional charges: We  will vote on important legislation, and we will provide advice and  consent on a number of Presidential nominations. We will begin with two  nominations to the Federal bench in U.S. territories.   Judge Robert Molloy, who currently sits on the U.S. Virgin Islands  Superior Court, is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for  the Virgin Islands for a term of 10 years. Judge Silvia Carreno-Coll  currently serves as a U.S. magistrate judge for the District of Puerto  Rico and has been nominated to be a U.S. district judge. Both  nominations were reported out of committee on a voice vote.   This week we will also consider Katharine MacGregor, the President's  nominee to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior, and Travis Greaves, a  nominee to serve as judge on the U.S. Tax Court for a term of 15 years.   But first, following the first two nominations, the Senate will turn  to important legislation put forward by Senators Graham and Sasse to  expand protections for innocent lives. Senator Graham's Pain-Capable  Unborn Child Protection Act would finally remove the United States from  a list of only seven nations, including China and North Korea, that  permit elective abortion after 20 weeks. It would bring our Nation's  regard for the unborn off this sad and radical fringe and bring us more  in line with the global mainstream.   I do not believe this legislation should be controversial, but even  less controversial should be Senator Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act. It would simply ensure that infants who  survive abortion attempts receive the same level of professional care  as any other children.   My colleagues and I will have more to say on this subject in the days  ahead, but I will urge all Senators to join me in supporting these  nominees and these pieces of legislation when we vote on them this  week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
