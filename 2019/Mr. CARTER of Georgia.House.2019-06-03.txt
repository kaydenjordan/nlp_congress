 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Jenkins High School robotics team for all of their accomplishments  during the 2019 season.   The Jenkins High School team, also called Team WIRE, built from  scratch a robot that can pick up a large bouncy ball, carry it across a  room, and place it in a specific location.   This year's theme was space, and the team had to design a robot that  could bring fuel to a spacecraft. In this case, the fuel was the large  bouncy ball.   Ranking 20th in the State of Georgia, Team WIRE won the judge's award  at a competition in Gainesville and advanced to a number of prestigious  tournaments. I am proud that we have this level of talent in the First  Congressional District of Georgia and thankful that we have Jenkins  High School, which is doing so much to give their students a STEM  education and teaching their students the value of teamwork.   I would like to congratulate Team WIRE on its accomplishments this  year and wish good luck to Team WIRE in the future.                            ____________________
