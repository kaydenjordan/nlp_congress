 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of the underlying legislation, H.R. 998, the  SCRUB Act, and urge adoption of my amendment.   The Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission created in the SCRUB  Act is an important tool to help Congress reclaim its constitutional  role of serving as a check to the executive branch and will help bring  back jobs and opportunity to hardworking Americans.   In 2016 alone, the Obama administration added 97,110 pages to the  Federal Register. That is over 75 times more than the Bible, without  any of the good news. These rules and regulations accumulate with no  relief and touch every aspect of life all the way down to recordkeeping  for contact lenses, vending machine food labeling, and walk-in freezer  testing.   Of the over 3,500 final regulations issued in 2016, 34 will cost over  $100 million, and 105 are deemed to have significant impacts on small  business. We  [[Page H1379]]  need to reduce this regulatory burden on American households and small  businesses, which costs the economy over $2 trillion per year.   The Congressional Review Act gives Congress 60 legislative days to  introduce and pass into law a disapproval resolution overturning a rule  or a regulation. Once agency actions are overturned using this process,  agencies are unable to reissue, substantially in the same form, a  regulation or guidance in the future.   A little known provision in the Congressional Review Act requires  Federal agencies to submit to Congress and the Government  Accountability Office a report on the rule or regulation. The 60-day  clock for congressional action begins either when the rule is published  or when Congress receives this report, whichever comes later.   Independent studies have shown many rules since 1996 have been  implemented without this report, often due to Federal agencies' push to  hastily implement new rules. This means that there are still many rules  and regulations that may still be eligible for Congress to overturn  using the Congressional Review Act disapproval resolutions process.   My amendment to the SCRUB Act requires the Retrospective Regulatory  Review Commission to consider for removal rules and regulations for  which Congress did not receive the report as required by the  Congressional Review Act. According to GAO, approximately 29 percent of  final rules failed to submit required reports in 2013. This prudent  step will help give Congress the opportunity to, where appropriate,  make use of the Congressional Review Act disapproval process to  expedite the rollback of flawed rules and regulations that are choking  our economy.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Madam Chair, again, my amendment is simple under the  SCRUB Act. Right now, these agencies are not complying with the law.  They have not submitted necessary reports to Congress and the GAO. So  this amendment is simply asking, among other things that are being  reviewed in this act, that we take a look at which reports have not  been submitted, therefore, which are not in compliance with the  Congressional Review Act so that we can decide whether any of those  would be appropriate for disapproval resolutions or, quite frankly,  whether the rule is even one that should be enforced because it hasn't  complied with the law.    This is a good amendment. I appreciate our colleagues supporting it.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.                                time  1515     Madam Chair, I want to thank Mr. Arrington for his  support. I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Mr. Smith for their hard  work on this important legislation. I want to urge the passage of my  amendment and encourage my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.
