 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, extending the Federal Aviation Administration's  authority is traditionally something that gets bipartisan support. That  hasn't been the case this time, as we saw on Monday when a prior  version of this bill failed on suspension. It contained several  extraneous provisions, but it didn't include some of the most important  priorities that we face.   September 30 is nearly upon us. That is the deadline to reauthorize  programs that the American people depend on. That includes things like  the Perkins student loan program, which helps low-income students to  finance their education.   There are 500,000 students across the country, including nearly  50,000 from New York, relying on it right now, but the Perkins Loan  Program isn't anywhere in this bill.   The bill also does nothing to extend the Children's Health Insurance  Program created in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. More than 9  million children get their health insurance through this program.  Without continued Federal funding, States are going to begin running  out of money to take care of some of the most vulnerable kids, and they  can't wait until the end of the year for us to act.   Community health centers have also been left out of the bill, and  they have told us that they will have problems from day one. If we  don't extend their funding, an estimated 9 million people would lose  access to healthcare.   These are essential bipartisan programs, Mr. Speaker, and what does  it say about the majority's leadership if they are not extended by the  deadline? It does not bode well for our ability to fund the government  later this year, to raise the debt ceiling, extend the Flood Insurance  Program, or reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   This bill is an incredibly important one. No one in this Chamber or  anywhere that I know of in the world wants the FAA program stopped and  their employees furloughed or airport projects brought to a halt. We  should work together and get it right.   This package, however, has not been negotiated on a bipartisan basis.  It didn't go through regular order. Committees have been shut out of  the process, and Democrats, who represent half the population in the  United States, didn't get a say.   We are all glad to see provisions included here to provide some tax  relief for victims of the recent hurricanes. With regular order and a  more open process, this could be a more comprehensive package of  extenders that provide more tax relief for victims to recover and to  rebuild. After all, the Democrats did suggest 21 bipartisan tax  provisions which were included in previous relief legislation after  previous disasters.                                time  1545    But none of those, except five, I think, are included in this bill.  That is a shame.   We have said it before. This is, I think, the 44th closed rule this  session, and that is just about all the bills we have done. This bill  could either have been bipartisan extending the FAA authorization, or a  comprehensive package of extenders that provided the tax relief  necessary for hurricane victims to recover and rebuild. The bill before  us is neither. I doubt many of us have had time to review the changes  that were made last night.   I have often said that a bad process leads to a bad product, and, Mr.  Speaker, I am afraid that is what we see with this bill. Another  opportunity for bipartisanship has been turned into another political  fight.   I, regretfully, reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream  Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of  young people who are Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez).    Mr. Speaker, I think the previous speaker made a very  important statement, that we should treat all Americans alike.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Roybal-Allard).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to  my friend.   I appreciate the information that the gentleman just gave us. We have  been told the community health service will be in trouble from day one.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the gentleman whether he has the same kind  of information about them?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate that  because millions of people use the community health services, and the  children, we cannot let them go unattended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Judy Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say to the  previous speaker that my understanding is the fallback provision on  flood insurance came to the Federal Government because the private  insurers didn't want to do it.   If we can get them to take it over, I think everybody would be  relieved.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    I thank the chairman for giving me that answer, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is our 44th closed rule for this session of  Congress which prevents Members from offering amendments to the floor.  This has put this Congress well on its way to becoming the most closed  Congress in modern history. Democrats have been routinely unable to do  the job we were elected to do and amend bills to represent the concerns  of the people of the United States which we are both privileged and  obligated to serve.   Despite his promises, Speaker Ryan has shown a complete disregard for  regular order since assuming the gavel. Bills routinely come before the  Rules Committee that haven't even been considered by the relevant  committees. The majority even moved a healthcare repeal bill through  this Chamber earlier this year without a score from the nonpartisan  experts at the Congressional Budget Office.   This measure would impact one-sixth of our Nation's economy and tens  of millions of people if it became law.   This is no way to run the people's House. The public expects more,  and it is high time that we heed those calls.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule,  and the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
