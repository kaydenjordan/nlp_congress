 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, and I thank my  colleagues for their kind remarks about our friend and my predecessor,  former Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey.   Lynn was a one-of-a-kind, barrier-breaking trailblazer and a lifelong  advocate for women and working families. In her 20 years of service in  this body, she was a passionate voice for progressive values,  unflinching in her convictions and ahead of her time in so many ways.  Speaker Pelosi often called Lynn the conscience of the Congress.   People who speak truth to power are often met with opposition and  misunderstanding. Clearly, there are some Members of this body who  don't share Lynn Woolsey's progressive values, and they tried to block  efforts to recognize her work a few weeks ago. Today, we have a chance  to right that wrong.   When this bill was first on the floor, my colleagues and I thoroughly  covered Congresswoman Woolsey's extensive public service career and her  many personal obstacles that she overcame to get to Congress where she  became one of the leading progressive voices in either Chamber. She was  co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was chair of the  Workforce Protections Subcommittee, wrote historic legislation to  expand paid family leave, and fought tirelessly to end the wars in Iraq  and Afghanistan.   Lynn's work in Congress was all about fighting for children and  families, and nothing made her prouder than her own children and  family. Anyone who knows Lynn knows that she considers them her  greatest achievement of all: her son Joe Critchett and his wife Kim;  her son Ed, his wife Lisa and their children Teddy and Julia; her  daughter Amy Critchett, Amy's husband Mark Pauline and their son Jake  Eddie; and her son Michael Woolsey, his wife Sarah Grossi and their  children Carlo and Luka.   My bill had widespread bipartisan support, including every Republican  [[Page H5091]]  Member from California. Let's move past partisan pettiness tonight. I  would ask my colleagues to please join me in honoring Congresswoman  Lynn Woolsey's unique and exemplary career in public service by voting  ``yes'' on this bill.                                time  2120
