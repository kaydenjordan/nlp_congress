 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  ``Urban Indian Health Providers Facilities Improvement Act.''   This legislation honors our Federal trust responsibility by providing  parity to Urban Indian Organizations that provide culturally competent  health care to Native Americans living in urban areas.   This legislation would remove the unjust and arbitrary restriction  that prevents Urban Indian Organizations from using appropriated funds  for construction and facilities upgrades.   This restriction is particularly untenable in the midst of the COVID- 19 pandemic.   Current law only permits the Indian Health Service to make  construction or facilities funds available to Urban Indian  Organizations to assist them in meeting or maintaining a now-obsolete  accreditation standard.   This limitation prevents Urban Indian Organizations from using  appropriated funding for facilities, maintenance and improvement,  sanitation, equipment, and other necessary construction upgrades, which  limits their ability to provide the quality health care that Native  Americans deserve.   Urban Indian Organizations are the only tribal health organization  burdened by this restriction. This legislation would provide parity to  Urban Indian Organizations and improve the safety and quality of care  for urban Indians.   California is home to one of the largest populations of Native  Americans, and Los Angeles and San Francisco have two of the largest  urban Native American populations in the country. Almost 90% of Native  Americans in California live in urban areas and therefore don't access  health care through their tribe.   Further, there are no Indian Health Service hospitals in California,  so the California Urban Indian Organizations are a lifeline to Native  Americans in my state. Removing this unjust burden on Urban Indian  Organizations would allow them to improve the quality of the culturally  competent care that they provide.   I thank Senator Lankford for co-leading this bill with me, and  Congressmen Gallego and Bacon for introducing this legislation in the  House of Representatives.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the bipartisan  ``Urban Indian Health Providers Facilities Improvement Act'' as quickly  as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):   S. 1804. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve  maternal health and promote safe motherhood; to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
