 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise as chairman of the Ways and Means  Subcommittee on Social Security in support of the Strengthening  Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018.   My good friend from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) and I introduced this  legislation to make much-needed reforms to the Social Security  representative payee programs. Congress first authorized Social  Security to designate representative payees all the way back in 1939.  The program was last updated in 2004.   For those unfamiliar, the Social Security representative payee  program designates a payee to help manage the benefits of those who  need assistance managing their benefits. We are talking about quite a  few. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that there are about 8  million beneficiaries with payees. In my home State of Texas, we are  talking about more than 625,000 people with payees. To put a face on  this program, we are talking about folks like the aging relative or the  elderly neighbor next door, people you may know but didn't realize had  a representative payee.   With 10,000 Americans retiring every day, this vitally important  program is only going to grow in demand. But here is the problem:  multiple reports have raised serious concerns about how Social Security  administers this program.   In light of these reports, we held two hearings on the representative  payee program last year. The first hearing looked at how Social  Security decides who needs a payee. The second hearing looked at how  Social Security selects and oversees payees.   During the hearing, Social Security told us the greatest challenge  that they face is monitoring representative payee behavior. We also  learned from Social Security's inspector general that Social Security  needs to do a better job of screening payees so that only qualified  people are serving as payees. And we heard from State courts that they  are concerned about the lack of information sharing between Social  Security and States.   We can and must do better for the millions of folks who need some  help managing their Social Security benefits. This is why I have been  working with Ranking Member Larson on the bill and we are voting on it  today.   This bipartisan bill does the following: it strengthens monitoring of  payees; it reduces the burden of unnecessary forms for families; it  increases beneficiary protections; and it improves payee selection and  quality.   This commonsense legislation is supported by over 45 organizations,  including AARP, the National Council of Social Security Management  Associations, the National Disability Rights Network, the National  Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, and many others.   Mr. Speaker, I include the National Council of Social Security  Management Associations and the National Disability Rights Network  letters in the Record.           National Council of Social Security Management             Associations, Inc.,                                   Arlington, VA, December 6, 2017.      Hon. Sam Johnson, Chairman,      Hon. John B. Larson, Ranking Member,      House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Social Security,           Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Larson: On behalf       of the National Council of Social Security Management       Associations (NCSSMA) and our members throughout the nation,       I would like to thank you for your introduction of H.R. 4547,       the Strengthening Protections for Social Security       Beneficiaries Act of 2017. We very much appreciate your       leadership on this important legislation and the hard work       and dedication of the Subcommittee staff in engaging NCSSMA       and other stakeholders to ensure such a commonsense measure       that will not only benefit and protect the American public,       but also ease the administrative burden on the hardworking       employees of the Social Security Administration (SSA).        We firmly believe this legislation will better protect       those individuals who most need  [[Page H748]]       our assistance while relieving the administrative burden both       for families and SSA, ensuring that resources are focused on       programs, policies and workloads that make sense.        We sincerely appreciate the ongoing discussions we have had       with the Subcommittee regarding the Representative Payee       program and are encouraged that H.R. 4547 addresses so many       of the issues and concerns we have raised. We       enthusiastically support this legislation and look forward to       working with you to advance it through the legislative       process.        Thank you for your willingness to work with NCSSMA and the       opportunity for our organization to provide feedback not only       related to the Representative Payee program, but also on so       many other important issues related to SSA and the programs       we administer.        Thank you again for your leadership. Please do not hesitate       to contact me if you have any questions or if we can provide       additional assistance.            Sincerely,                                               Christopher Detzler,      NCSSMA President.                                   ____                               National Disability Rights Network,                                   Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.      Representative Sam Johnson,      Chairman, Social Security Subcommittee, House Ways and Means           Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson: On behalf of the National Disability       Rights Network (NDRN) and the nationwide network of fifty-      seven Protection and Advocacy systems we represent, I write       in strong support of H.R. 4547, the Strengthening Protections       for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2017. Enactment of       this legislation will provide critical protections for Social       Security beneficiaries as well as needed reforms to the       crucial representative payee program.        NDRN is the non-profit membership organization for the       federally mandated Protection and Advocacy (P&A) and Client       Assistance Program (CAP) systems for individuals with       disabilities. The P&A and CAP systems were established by the       United States Congress to protect the rights of people with       disabilities and their families through legal support,       advocacy, referral, and education. P&As and CAPs are in all       50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the       U.S. Territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana       Islands, and the US Virgin Islands), and there is a P&A and       CAP affiliated with the Native American Consortium which       includes the Hopi, Navajo and San Juan Southern Paiute       Nations in the Four Corners region of the Southwest.       Collectively, the P&A and CAP Network is the largest provider       of legally based advocacy services to people with       disabilities in the United States.        News stories, Office of Inspector General and Government       Accountability Office reports, and hearings held by the House       Ways and Means Committee have demonstrated the need for       changes in the representative payee program. Your legislation       proposes many important and needed changes that will       streamline the program as well as take important steps to       increase oversight of the representative payee program by       funding the nationwide network of P&A systems to monitor how       representative payees are administering the Social Security       funds received by beneficiaries.        This legislation recognizes the important oversight work       that the nationwide network of P&A systems performed for the       Social Security Administration (SSA) starting in 2009 after       it was revealed dozens of men with developmental disabilities       were abused and financially exploited at a turkey processing       plant known as Henry's Turkey Service. The company acted as       the workers' representative payee which gave them access to       the men's social security disability benefits. It was found       that in addition to physically and verbally assaulting the       men, Henry's was fraudulently using funds from the men's       social security payments.        To the Social Security Administration's (SSA) credit,       following the discovery of this theft, SSA increased       monitoring beyond reviews that they are statutorily required       to perform and began investigating whether other       organizational representative payees were exploiting the       beneficiaries they were appointed to serve. As part of this       effort, SSA turned to the federally mandated P&A system to       conduct monitoring on representative payees. The       collaboration between SSA and the P&A systems allowed SSA to       meet its goal of ensuring that payees meet the fiduciary       responsibilities they accepted when they applied to act as a       payee. The partnership not only allowed SSA to meet their       responsibilities, but also allowed the P&A systems to address       health and safety issues and other issues important to the       beneficiary but that fall outside of SSA's purview (for more       information and statistics on this program, see this report:       http://www.ndrn.orq/images/Documents/Resources/NDRN Rep Payee       Overview - July 2016.pdf). H.R. 4547 recognizes the benefits       provided by the nationwide network of P&A systems to monitor       representative payees and how they are administering the       social security benefits received by beneficiaries.        Again, we greatly appreciate your work on this important       issue culminating in the introduction of this critical       legislation. We stand ready to work with you to quickly get       this important legislation enacted into law. Should you have       any questions or need more information, please be in touch       with Eric Buehlmann, Deputy Executive Director for Public       Policy.            Sincerely,                                                       Curt Decker,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of the  House to vote ``yes'' on this and pass the Strengthening Protections  for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018 today. As I have said  before, this is too important not to get right.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   You know, without agreement from both sides, you can't get anything  done; and without Mr. Larson, I think we would have been in deep,  serious trouble in Social Security, but he and I think alike. We are  for the people, and everything we do is trying to improve the system  over what it is today, and I thank him for his help.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge all Members of the House to vote ``yes''  and pass the Strengthening Protections for Social Security  Beneficiaries Act today so that the Senate can take action soon and  that the President can sign it into law without delay.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
