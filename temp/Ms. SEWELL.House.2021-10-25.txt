 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the illustrious chairwoman  of the Congressional Black Caucus, Joyce Beatty, for her leadership. I  want to thank Richie Torres for leading us in this Special Order hour.  Nothing could be more profound in this hour than to be talking about  voting rights.   As we speak, our Nation is facing the most concerted effort to  restrict the right to vote in a generation. Just this year, 400 bills  have been introduced in State legislatures across this Nation to  restrict the right to vote. In 19 States, at least 33 of these bills  have become law, including the most egregious of State legislatures,  Georgia, where now it is a crime to give a bottle of water to a voter  as they stand in line.   Even as our democracy comes under attack, we see Republicans standing  firm in their opposition to protecting the right to vote, a bedrock  principle that should never be partisan.   Just last week, we watched as every Senate Republican voted to block  debate on the Freedom to Vote Act, a commonsense bill that would ensure  that every American has access to the ballot box.   What are they afraid of, I ask? What are they afraid of?   Last week's vote made clear that Senate Republicans are unwilling to  even debate voting rights, let alone hold a fair vote. This just  further demonstrates that in order to protect our democracy and the  sacred right to vote; we must reform the filibuster to create a path  forward for must-pass pieces of legislation.   Madam Speaker, almost 3 weeks ago we saw Senator Leahy introduce S.  4, the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in the Senate.  But unless we take action on the filibuster, and take action now, this  critical bill  [[Page H5858]]  will face the same fate as the Freedom to Vote Act.   The way I see it, every Senator is now faced with a choice: it is  voting rights or the filibuster; it is protecting our sacred right to  vote and our democracy or the filibuster; it is advancing the legacy of  John Lewis and the foot soldiers or it is a filibuster.   Now, I know which side I am on. I hope our Senators will choose to do  what is right and do away with an archaic procedural rule that has been  used for decades to block racial justice in this country.   President Biden also understands the urgency of this critical moment.  On Thursday, at his town hall meeting, we heard President Biden express  support for reforming the filibuster to pass must-needed voting rights  legislation. I am glad that President Biden understands the urgency of  this moment and the dire need for Federal oversight.   You know, it was Federal oversight that brought us the Civil Rights  Act of 1965. It was Federal oversight that allowed those marchers to  march across that Edmund Pettus Bridge in my hometown of Selma,  Alabama. You know when State legislatures go amuck, it is Federal  oversight that we need to ensure that every American has access to the  ballot box.   Madam Speaker, it was foot soldiers like our late, great colleague  and my mentor, John Lewis, who shed blood on a bridge in Selma for the  equal right of all Americans to vote. If protecting that sacred right  is not worth overcoming a procedural rule, then what is?   Madam Speaker, it takes only 51 votes to sit a Supreme Court Justice  and for a Supreme Court Justice to have life tenure on the Supreme  Court. 51 votes. Yet, it takes 60 votes to stop debate and to allow a  fair vote in the United States Senate on voting rights. This is  unacceptable. It is un-American. It is unjust.   We, in the Congressional Black Caucus, are saying: This is our  message. This is our fight. Voting rights. We have no other choice, we  must reform the filibuster and we must do so now.   When I think about the shoulders on which we all stand, I am reminded  of being in this House in 2015 during the State of the Union. I had as  my special guest none other than Amelia Boynton Robinson, who at that  time was 103 years old. She was the oldest living foot soldier that  marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis and so many  others.   In 2015, the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march, she  was my special guest. As we waited in a small room off of this Chamber  for Barack Obama, then-President of these United States, to deliver  that State of the Union, everyone wanted to take a picture with Ms.  Amelia Boynton Robinson.   They kneeled by her wheelchair, and said: Ms. Amelia, we stand on  your shoulders. Oh, Ms. Amelia, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for  your sacrifice.   Well, Ms. Amelia was a little tired of people saying that to her over  and over again. And when Eric Holder, the then-Attorney General of the  United States, came and kneeled beside her, and said: Oh, Ms. Amelia, I  stand on your shoulders. She said: Get off my shoulders, all of you, do  your own work--is what she said.   Madam Speaker, I am here to say that we, the members of the  Congressional Black Caucus, are doing our own work. We are standing  firm, we are standing solid, we are standing united in our effort to  bring back the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.    We must do our own work, all of us. It is not enough to say that we  stand on the shoulders of giants. We know these giants, our foremothers  and our forefathers, they were tacticians, they were strategists. They  just didn't happen upon Selma, Alabama. They just didn't happen upon  Birmingham and Memphis and Atlanta. They went looking for good trouble,  and good trouble they got in. We must do the same. We must take a play  from their playbook.   We must stand firm. We must stand united. We must stand undeterred in  our efforts to beat down any barrier that stands in the way of  protecting that sacred right to vote. It was John Lewis who said that  the vote is the most sacred, the most fundamental right, nonviolent  tool in our democracy. That is the vote. The vote is fundamental to  this democracy, and everything else we do--well, everything else we do  will be tainted if every American lacks the right to vote. There is  nothing more sacred, more fundamental to this democracy, than the right  to vote.   How can a procedural rule stand in the way of that right?   Now, I can tell you that my constituents back home don't understand  the filibuster. They don't understand this archaic procedural rule that  is in the Senate. When I tell them that that stands in the way of us  passing the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, they say:  Why? Didn't we go to the polls in record numbers in States all across  this Nation, in southern States like Georgia to deliver the democratic  majority? And they ask of us to protect that democracy now.   John Lewis said that our fight is not a fight for 1 day, it is not a  fight for 1 year, ours is a fight of a lifetime to secure that sacred  right to vote. When I close my eyes, I can hear him. Can't you hear  him? John Lewis said it firmly, he said it often: When you see  something that is not right, that is not fair, that is not just, we  have a moral obligation to stand up and do something about it.   We in the Congressional Black Caucus know that our message, our  fight, our cause, is nothing if not to defend the sacred right to vote.  It is a right that is fundamental to our democracy and that no elected  official should seek to undermine, to restrict any voice in this  democracy.   Our vote is our voice in this representative democracy. When you  squelch the voice of one American who has that sacred right and is  unable to exercise it because the lines are too long, because their  names have been purged from a roll, it is a fundamental threat to all  of us, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.   We know that. We live that. Martin Luther King told us that, but we  live it every day. Nothing is more fundamental to our rights than our  democracy and its foundation, its bedrock, the right to vote.   When Barack Obama came into that small room off of this Chamber,  Amelia Boynton Robinson cradled his face. I think all of us understood  the import of that moment. Here was the first African-American  President of these United States, and here was a woman, at 103 years  old, who made the ultimate sacrifice, bludgeoned on a bridge, shedding  blood on a bridge in my hometown of Selma, Alabama, so that all of us  would have the right to vote and that one day she would see the fruits  of her labor. Oh, what faith our foremothers and our forefathers must  have had. Faith. Faith that their sacrifices were not in vain.   And President Obama said: Oh, Ms. Amelia, to say thank you doesn't  seem adequate. I get to give a speech as the President of these United  States, and it is because of you. Without missing a beat, this woman,  103 years old, frail, said: Oh, make it a good one. That better be a  very good speech.                                time  2000    We should make every day a good one; we who are the inheritors of  this legacy, and we who are the beneficiaries of this movement. Every  day should be a good one. We should not lay our head on a pillow if we  have not advanced the legacy of these foremothers and forefathers.  Every day should be a good one.   So we call on the Senate to do what we know is right, to do what John  calls good trouble. Get into some good trouble. Let's change those  rules. We have it within our power to do so. After all, we control the  Senate, we control the House, and we have the White House--gavels given  to us by ordinary people who believed that we will take that power and  exercise that power on their behalf.   Nothing is more fundamental than the right to vote. So in the name of  John Lewis, in the name of Amelia Boynton, and in the name of all of  those known and unknown foot soldiers who have the audacity to make  this Nation live up to its ideals of freedom, justice, and equality,  are those empty words?   We must breathe life into those constitutional principles, and we can  do so if we have the will to do what we know is right.   A filibuster or voting rights?   Upholding the legacy of our foremothers and forefathers or a  filibuster?  [[Page H5859]]    Making sure that we do all that we can to protect this democracy or a  filibuster?   The choices are easy from where I sit. They are easy from where our  constituents sit.   I ask our Senators to do what they know is right. If ever there is a  reason to reform the filibuster, it is for that constitutionally  protected right to vote. We must do so, and we must do so now and pass  S. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Let us restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Let us pass the Freedom to Vote Act. After all, the first 300 pages  were written by John Lewis. His Voter Empowerment Act is about access  to the ballot box. It is about making sure that the least of these--the  voiceless--have a voice in this democracy. We must restore the vote and  the voices of the excluded.   We can do that. Congress can do that. That was what the Supreme Court  said in the Shelby v. Holder decision: Only Congress can come up with a  modern-day formula to secure the right to vote and to get at the most  egregious State actors. We understand that we are threading a thin  needle, but we have done our job and now the Senate must do its. Let's  get rid of the filibuster. Let's reform the filibuster at the very  least and ensure that every American has a right to vote and to ensure  that their vote is counted.
