 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for yielding.   ``We the people'' is a bold opening statement enshrined in our  Constitution. But for far too long, LGBTQ Americans have not been  included in that statement.   A gay couple can get married in all 50 States. A trans worker has  legal protections from discrimination in the workplace. But despite  this progress, a lesbian mom can be denied housing in most States  because of her sexual orientation. A queer person can be turned away  from serving on a jury.   In 27 States, there are no laws protecting people from discrimination  on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in education,  housing, and public accommodation, and this is wrong. No person, no  matter where they live in America, should face discrimination. Equality  should not depend on the ZIP Code where you live. Now is the time for  ``we the people'' to include LGBTQ Americans.   My Republican colleagues are desperately trying to derail this  legislation by cloaking their bigotry with high-minded arguments about  religious freedom and appealing to people's worst instincts with  transphobic attacks and grossly exaggerated examples. Their main  argument seems to be that America doesn't want a law that will protect  the dignity of trans people who get murdered and beat up for being who  they are.   In reality, trans people are among those in our community who need  this protection the most. Republicans want to vilify people who are the  most severe victims of injustice.   What this law does is simple and just. It guarantees that LGBTQ  people in every State cannot be discriminated against because of their  identity. We have a moral imperative to get the Equality Act signed  into law.
