 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Oh my God, Mr. Speaker. Let's get real here. Nothing about this is  serious, not the process, not the intentions of the resolution's  sponsor, not the impeachment case, not a single damn thing.   Yesterday, Republicans dishonored this House and dishonored  themselves by bringing to the floor a ridiculous censure resolution  against Adam Schiff because Donald Trump told them to.   Today, they are dishonoring this House and dishonoring themselves by  bringing to the floor a ridiculous impeachment referral resolution  against Joe Biden because Donald Trump told them to.   This body has become a place where extreme, outlandish, and nutty  issues get debated passionately and important ones not at all.   In short, Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party is a joke. They talk  about law and order when their frontrunner for President has been  indicted on Federal charges.   They talk about respecting law enforcement. Then, they come in here  and downplay the rioters who came in here on January 6 and beat up cops  with fire extinguishers. I don't even know how they look the Capitol  Police officers in the eye when they walk into this place.   They talk about how important it is that we follow a good process.  Yet, the Rules Committee was called in late last night, literally at a  moment's notice, where they deployed emergency procedures so we could  refer this measure to a committee--what a spectacular emergency, truly  something that needed to be done immediately.   We all know the truth. The real emergency here was that the Georgia  wing and the Colorado wing of the MAGA caucus got into a fight right  over there on the House floor about who gets to impeach the President  first.   The truth is that Speaker McCarthy has lost control of this House,  and it is being run by the MAGA fringe. This is nuts.   Kids get shot in their classrooms. Nothing.   Environmental disasters destroy entire communities. Nothing.   Our air is clogged with smoke because half the Northern Hemisphere is  on fire due to climate change. Nothing.   But when the MAGA wing nuts say to jump, Speaker McCarthy says: How  high?   According to news reports, it sounds like this resolution's sponsor  is dictating to the Speaker which committees bills should be referred  to, when he should put legislation on the floor, and how he should run  this House.   That is who is in charge here, the MAGA extremists.   Frankly, they can try to impeach Joe Biden all they want, but all  they are doing is impeaching themselves and making a mockery of this  place while they are at it.   I get it. They don't like that their cult leader, Donald Trump, will  go down in history as one of the worst Presidents we have ever had.  They don't like that he was impeached twice and had a bipartisan  conviction vote in the Senate. They don't like that Democrats tried to  hold him accountable for trying to extort President Zelenskyy, who is  now trying to defend himself from Putin.                                time  1100    They don't like that Congress tried to hold him accountable again,  this time for trying to overthrow the government on January 6.   They don't like that he had nuclear secrets in his bathroom and in  his desk, and God knows where else, and waved them around like it was  nothing.   You know what? They don't like themselves for having to stand by him  time after time and defend his lies. I know many of my Republican  colleagues say in private what they are not willing to say here in  public, which is that they think this is an embarrassment.   Still, they are here on the floor defending a three-time loser,  sexual abuser, ex-President that has been indicted more times than he  has been elected. It is pathetic.   Instead of dealing with their own issues, Republicans are going after  Joe Biden to try to distract and deflect.   H. Res. 503 claims President Biden is intentionally facilitating a  complete and total invasion of the southern border. This resolution  claims that foreign cartels have complete control of our border.  Seriously? It is insulting to the  [[Page H3079]]  Border Patrol agents that they claim to support, the ones that put  their lives on the line every single day.   By the way, just to talk facts for a second--which I know my  Republican friends hate to do--since the end of title 42 on May 11,  unlawful entries along the southern border have plummeted.   As of June 6, Customs and Border Protection has reported over 70  percent fewer encounters between points of entry or unscheduled  encounters per day.   Fentanyl seizures have increased under the Biden Presidency. To make  that clearer for my friends across the aisle, that means that more  fentanyl is getting picked up at the border before it makes it onto our  streets. They are attacking Joe Biden for stopping more fentanyl. It  makes no sense.   No, they would rather talk about building a stupid wall along our  southern border that they know won't work or about the nonbinding  resolution they put on the floor this week that demonizes migrants but  does nothing to fix our immigration system.   They have a policy disagreement with President Biden and their first  impulse isn't to pass an immigration bill. Their first impulse is to  impeach him. Our Founding Fathers must be rolling over in their graves.   They are doing this all so they can distract from the fact that  Donald Trump stole top-secret information and stored it in his bathroom  and showed highly classified Iran attack plans to people and bragged  about stealing classified government documents on live TV.   Trump is the legitimate national security risk. Don't come to us with  this phony BS about how President Biden is the reason we have a crisis  at our southern border.   Republicans can yell and scream all they want. They can rant and rave  so that they get on FOX News tonight. It doesn't make them right. It is  doing untold damage to this institution. They have no respect for the  traditions of this House. It is grotesque. It is embarrassing. It is  shameful.   We aren't debating matters that help or uplift people, rather we are  debating garbage to make Trump happy. It is cowardly, and it is  sickening.   What we have here is a joke, just like this Republican majority-- which is clearly going to be a temporary majority.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, that was an awful lot. I don't have enough time to  respond to all the inaccuracies that were just stated.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record an  article from Newsweek titled ``Fentanyl Surge  [[Page H3080]]  Started and Peaked Under Trump Despite GOP Blaming Biden.''    Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about this accusation about  open borders. I don't know how many times we need to say it, but the  United States does not have open borders. We didn't have open borders  under Trump, and we don't have open borders under Biden.   Even the conservative CATO Institute knows that. Please stop  incorrectly saying that our country has open borders. We do not.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record an  article published by the CATO Institute titled ``Biden's Border Policy  is Not `Open Borders'.''    Mr. Speaker, let me read an excerpt from the article-- this is from CATO.   ``Practically since his first week in office, President Joe Biden has  faced repeated criticisms from Republicans and some Democrats that his  border policy amounts to `open borders.' This  [[Page H3081]]  criticism is not simply inaccurate: it is unhinged from reality in a  way that distinguishes itself from normal political hyperbole. Indeed,  U.S. immigration policy is effectively closed borders, and Biden's  immigration policies and goals are largely the same as those of  President Donald Trump.   ``President Biden has not suddenly ended America's immigration  prohibition and opened up U.S. borders to almost anyone who wants to  come (as was largely America's immigration policy from 1776 to 1924).  Instead, he has far more vigorously enforced immigration prohibition  than the law requires, narrowing the few exceptions to the universal  ban on legal immigration.''   Mr. Speaker, I point this out because this is crazy what is being  talked about here on the House floor. This is not about a policy  disagreement; if it was, maybe my friends would actually pass a bill  that had an alternative policy.   The bill that they brought up on immigration this week was a bill  that was a nonbinding resolution. It did nothing. It was just their  opinion that expresses the sense of Congress. It was a  ``nothingburger''. If they wanted to, they would legislate in a way  that would change a policy, but that is not what they want to do.   This is about protecting Donald Trump. Donald Trump says to them, you  know: Jump. And they ask: How high? That is what this is about. This is  about covering up for the former President. It is about deflecting from  the former President's criminality, the 37 felony counts that he has  been indicted on, and they don't like it. Unfortunately, that is who he  is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from Politifact titled: ``Are Biden's border policies to blame  for fentanyl deaths? Experts say no.''    Fentanyl deaths in the U.S. were rising before Biden  took office, and, in fact, he is intercepting more fentanyl than the  previous administration did. I think we need the Republicans to get  their facts straight.   The other thing I want to point out to my friends--and maybe they  need to read their history books or read the Constitution--impeachment  is about high crimes and misdemeanors. It is not about policy  disagreements.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that Republicans would rather the American  public pay attention to anything--literally anything--other than the  latest charges that their leader has been slapped with.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from The Washington Post titled: ``Here are the 37 charges  against Trump and what they mean.''    Mr. Speaker, I would love to insert in the Record the  entirety of the charges, but, apparently, I am told it is too long to  be able to be put into the Congressional Record.   Let me say a couple of things. Trump is charged with 31 counts of  violating a part of the Espionage Act that bars willful retention of  national defense information by someone not authorized to have it.   He is basically charged with, among other things, conspiracy to  obstruct justice, tampering with grand jury evidence, concealing  evidence in a Federal investigation, and false statements.   Mr. Speaker, I get it. If I were they, I would want to talk about  anything other than that, but those are the facts. No matter how you  want to distract and deflect, Mr. Speaker, the American people are not  going to ignore what I believe will ultimately prove to be criminality  of the former President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say to the gentleman who just spoke that I know  exactly why he is here. I don't think this is--and the American people  know--this is not a serious effort. I know my friends don't want to  talk about Trump. They want to talk about Biden. So let's talk about  Joe Biden.   I want to make something clear: Not only is any talk of impeaching  President Biden completely absurd--as many House Republicans know--but  President Biden has been a historic success over the first 2\1/2\ years  in office.   He took office in the throes of the pandemic and in the midst of the  chaos caused by his predecessor trying to illegally hold on to power,  but that hasn't stopped Democrats from making huge strides to improve  the lives of every American.    Democrats jumped into action by enacting the American Rescue Plan in  the President's first months in office. That law changed the course of  the pandemic and set the course of our economic recovery to be the envy  of the rest of the world. It lifted more than 5 million children out of  poverty, it safely reopened our schools, and it put money back in the  pockets of middle-class Americans.   Every Republican voted against those things.   President Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure law which makes  historic investments in our roads, our bridges, and our transportation  networks while improving public safety and creating jobs all across the  country.   We passed into law the biggest piece of gun safety legislation in  decades, and we enacted the Inflation Reduction Act less than a year  ago.   President Biden is now busy implementing that law which will cut  prescription drug costs for our senior citizens, lower the cost of  healthcare for millions of Americans, make historic investments in  clean energy, and make American-made solutions to our climate crisis.   It will do all of that while lowering our deficit, unlike so many of  the bills this Republican majority has brought to the floor which would  do the opposite.   This isn't just me saying how great all of this is. During the  Financial Services Committee hearing yesterday, Fed Chairman Jerome  Powell was asked about inflation.   He said: ``Everybody has very high inflation, the E.U., the United  Kingdom, and many countries within Europe.''   He made one more important point: ``Our recovery is by far the  strongest of any country.''   Just look at the results more broadly. More Americans have jobs right  now than at any point in American history. Over the past 2 years, more  small businesses have been created than at any other period on record.  More Americans have health insurance right now than ever before in our  history.                                time  1130    I could go on and on, but let me be clear. No one is saying things  are perfect. There is a lot that we need to do.   We need to do more to keep our children fed. We need to do more to  ensure every child gets the education they deserve. We need to do more  to make sure the richest Americans pay their fair share. We need to do  more to get guns off the streets.   I would love to see this Republican majority do anything at all to  reach those goals or do anything that means anything to anybody.   Instead, we are here today debating this latest attempt by the  Speaker to keep the most radical members of his party behind him. Quite  frankly, it is embarrassing, and it is pathetic.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H3085]]    Mr. Speaker, I will say to the gentleman that we are well aware that  the previous President was impeached twice and justifiably so.   The first impeachment dealt with his effort to try to extort  Zelenskyy into getting dirt on Joe Biden in exchange for assistance so  that they could defend themselves against Putin. I guess no one should  be surprised because the President seems to have this--the former  President seems to have this obsession with Putin.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a 2020  Roll Call article titled: ``Senate report outlines `grave' Russian  threat in 2016 election interference probe.''    Mr. Speaker, despite the former President's repeated  claims that Russian interference in our 2016 election was a Democratic  hoax, a bipartisan Senate investigation and report released in 2020  made clear that there were extensive communications between senior  Trump officials and people with strong ties to the Kremlin.   Senator Marco Rubio--the last time I checked, he was still a  Republican--said: ``We found irrefutable evidence of Russian  meddling.''   The report is damning. The facts are clear. Russia interfered in an  election.   The second impeachment was really in response to what happened here,  and everybody saw what happened here: A violent mob broke into this  Capitol.   Mr. Speaker, 140 Capitol Police officers were injured. The mob  destroyed sacred property in this building. They tried to overturn a  legitimate election. They attempted an insurrection.   I was in the chair, one of the last people off the House floor. I saw  some of my Republican colleagues here, hiding, cowering behind Capitol  Police because they were afraid of what was going on that day.   Now, they come to the floor and say nothing happened, that it was a  perfectly wonderful day, a typical day of tourism at the Capitol. It is  disgusting, the revisionism that we see here.   So you are damn right that he got impeached a second time. He  deserved to be impeached. If that is not an impeachable offense, I  don't know what is.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman said something that I agree with: The  election cannot come soon enough.   I think people are just sick and tired of my Republican friends  defending a three-time loser, sexual abuser, ex-President that has been  indicted more times than he has been elected. It is pathetic.    We should be working on matters that actually help people. That is  why Democrats have been fighting not only for commonsense gun safety  legislation and investments in job creation and environmental  protection, but we have also been insisting that we get a guarantee  from the majority here that they don't go after Social Security and  Medicare.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question, and I will  offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a  resolution assuring our constituents that the people's House will  protect and preserve Social Security and Medicare for our future  generations and reject any cuts to these essential programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with any extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will say to my friends that while you want to distract  and deflect from all of Donald Trump's legal problems, they continue to  mount.   I think there will be probably more charges, I expect, in the coming  weeks and the coming months. While my colleagues do not want to talk  about things like Social Security and Medicare because they are the  party of privatization, the party of trying to undercut Medicare, we  are going to fight them on those things.   We are going to continue to be a voice for the people of this  country, for our senior citizens, for those who believe that Social  Security and Medicare are important. We will not be deflected or  deterred by whatever this circus is that is going on here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that my friends on the other side of the  aisle look small and pathetic and like losers. When they lose this  House, this is going to be a reason why.   Mr. Speaker, my friends keep talking about open borders. That is an  insult to the men and women in our Border Patrol who are risking their  lives to protect our borders. It is just not true.   I entered in the Record an article by the conservative think tank,  the Cato Institute, but facts don't matter. It is what plays on FOX  News and how we can distract and how people can make up things.   I will also say, Mr. Speaker, that try as they might to deflect from  the former President, we can't turn our back on what he has done.   Look, Trump literally can't help himself. He has admitted multiple  times on air, during interviews, and to  [[Page H3087]]  others that he stole and shared top-secret government information. Talk  about a national security threat. The call is coming from inside the  house.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from Rolling Stone titled: ``Trump All But Confesses to  Mishandling Classified Docs on FOX News.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want the record to reflect that the previous President  of the United States supported an insurrection to basically steal the  election.   My friends think it is funny, but I will tell you this: Laugh in the  face of the Capitol Police.   Mr. Speaker, 140 of them were injured. People lost their lives, and  the best you can do is laugh--is laugh--about what happened that day? I  mean, that is disgusting.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are now in week three of an ongoing temper tantrum by  the radical right because they didn't get to cause a catastrophic  default.   First, they ground the House floor to a complete halt, and now they  are jumping over each other to circumvent regular order and diminish  this institution in order to look as extreme as their most fervent  supporters.   What is getting lost in the meantime is any legislation that would  actually help the American people.   We could bring more jobs back to America.   We could expand the middle class and further fight inflation.   We could provide every student with the opportunity to receive a  quality education.   We could ensure every patient has access to affordable and quality  healthcare.   We could make sure every single person has a roof over their head and  food on the table.   We could do more to keep our communities safe.   We could invest in mental health and substance abuse programs.   We could fund projects that will make our air cleaner and our water  purer.   We could pass a bipartisan immigration bill, if it is such a big  issue to my friends on the other side of the aisle.   There is so much we could do if given the chance, but this Republican  majority is clearly far more concerned about scoring political points  than they are about making life better for everyday Americans.   Because the Speaker is not in control of this Chamber anymore, they  are wasting the House's time with a debate on whether to send this  extreme MAGA resolution to an extra committee instead of just voting to  table it.   One final word for my Republican friends, Mr. Speaker: Everything  that  [[Page H3088]]  Donald Trump touches fails. This guy has a reverse Midas touch: Trump  casinos, Trump University, Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump Hotels, and  now the Trump Republican Party.   We can't let him destroy our democracy or this institution. As my  mother says, it is never too late to do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this ridiculous, pathetic rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
