 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection Act removes 830  acres from the wilderness study area in central Oregon. The land is  adjacent to a rural subdivision, and its removal from WSA will arguably  make it easier for the local community and the BLM to plan wildfire  mitigation projects.   While we take issue with the point that the WSA designation limits  mechanical thinning and other necessary forest treatments, the area is  not suitable for wilderness designation, and the release from the WSA  makes sense.   However, we still have concerns with this bill, because it ignores  the collaborative process that was trying to develop a comprehensive  plan for the entire area. That plan would have led to lasting  conservation gains by designating wilderness and would have done even  more to protect the community from wildfire by creating special  management areas adjacent to Crooked River Ranch. Unfortunately, the  collaborative group stalled out after this legislation was introduced.   Only Congress can permanently change the status of a wilderness study  area. Whenever we choose to make a permanent change, we have a  responsibility to consider the whole picture and listen to all  stakeholders.   While it is disappointing that we are unable to fulfill that  commitment with this legislation, we understand the need to prioritize  safety of the Crooked River Ranch residents.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
