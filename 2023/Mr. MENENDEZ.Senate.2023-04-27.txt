 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The       total estimated program cost is $1 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Norway's capability to       perform search and rescue, anti-surface, and anti-submarine       warfare missions along with the ability to perform secondary       missions, including vertical replenishment and communications       relay. Norway will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent       to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.       Norway will have no difficulty absorbing these helicopters       and support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and       Mission Systems, Owego, New York. The purchaser has requested       offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations       between the purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple       trips by U.S. Government representatives and the assignment       of contractor representatives to Norway on an intermittent       basis over the life of the case to support delivery and       integration of items and to provide supply support       management, inventory control, and equipment familiarization.       In addition, there will be up to four (4) contractor       representatives in Norway full-time for the duration of the       case.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-32       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter focuses primarily on       anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface warfare (ASuW)       missions. The MH-60R also performs search and rescue, naval       gunfire support, surveillance, communications relay,       logistics support, personnel transfer, and vertical       replenishment missions. The MH-60R carries several sensors       and data links to enhance its ability to work in a network       centric battle group and as an extension of its home ship or       main operating base. The mission equipment subsystem consists       of the following sensors and subsystems: an acoustics system       capable of, but not configured for, future dipping sonar and       sonobuoy operations, Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) with integral       Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) interrogator, radios with       COMSEC, Electronic Support Measures (ESM), Integrated Self-      Defense (ISD), and Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS). The       aircraft processes sensor data onboard, and transmits data       via Common Data Link (CDL) (also referred to as Hawklink).       The aircraft is night vision compatible. It can carry AGM-      114A/B/K/N Hellfire missiles, as well as MK 46/54 torpedoes       to engage surface and sub-surface targets. The MH-60R Multi-      Mission Helicopter is capable of carrying the Airborne Low       Frequency Sonars (ALFS), GAU-61 Digital Rocket Launchers,       Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System (APKWS), GAU-21 crew-      served guns, and M240 crew-served guns.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Norway can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Norway.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
