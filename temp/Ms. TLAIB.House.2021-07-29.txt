 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Mr.  Thomas Dombroski, who we lovingly call Tom.   Tom was a longtime resident of southwest Detroit, who contributed  actively to several community-based organizations and was especially  known for his service as a board member of the Southwest Detroit  Community Benefits Coalition. He was also a very proud member of the  Teamsters.   Tom was tough, a big-hearted person whose sense of humor and warmth  belied his tenacity in the fight to protect his community, which was  contagious. Tom was a champion of the underdog and advocated for  justice on behalf of those who needed it most.   Before he retired, Tom's work with the Teamsters Union prepared him  for his second act in life as a community advocate for equitable  development of the Gordie Howe International Bridge crossing.   He was outspoken in the fight for clean air and good quality of life  for residents who live in the shadow of the large scale transportation  infrastructure. I have always known Tom to be generous with his time  and energy.   His spirit will be sorely missed by the community he served. Please  join me as we recognize Thomas Dombroski's many contributions to the  families of southwest Detroit and beyond as we give honor to his  memory.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am a proud child of immigrants.  [[Page H4283]]    Both of my parents immigrated from Palestine. My dad's journey  actually was from Palestine as a young boy, and he grew up, his teenage  years, in Nicaragua. From Nicaragua, at 19 years old, he came to the  United States.   My father, with a fourth grade education, couldn't ever experience  human dignity anywhere except until he came here and worked for Ford  Motor Company and became part of the United Auto Workers, the UAW. That  is when he felt, for the first time, human dignity in the workplace.   My father, in the 1970s, used to be in Detroit, on the corners. If  you came up to him before he got to Ford, he would pull up his arm and  say, ``Which watch you want?'' Because he hustled. That is how he  provided for his family.   My mother only went up to eighth grade because she was trying to  provide for her family, which is a farming family in Palestine. When  she came to this country, pregnant with me, never could they have  imagined their daughter ever becoming a United States Congress Member  and coming here with that lived experience and understanding the  importance of bringing truly loving and caring farm immigrant  neighbors.   The human impact on doing nothing in regard to immigration is real. I  grew up in Southwest Detroit--20 different ethnicities. I want you all  to know what that feels like, right?   I mean, this is a majority Black city with a little bit of beautiful  Brown spice here and there. I mean, it was just incredible to grow up  in such a diverse community, where I felt like it made me a better  mother, a better advocate, a better American because, at that moment, I  appreciated things that my immigrant neighbors had seen through their  lens and my Black neighbors through their experience in this country as  they were fighting against racism, and continue to do so, and  discrimination.   It is so incredibly important, as we think about this, not to allow  others to fear our immigrant neighbors, to allow our country and  policies to blame them for everything wrong in our country, when we all  know they helped build it.    I also want to take a moment because I think it is incredibly  important to know that I grew up in a border community. Right there in  Detroit, on the other side, you can see Canada. What does that mean?  Because people focus on the southern border. What that means is Border  Patrol and immigration enforcement is right there in our community.   Why this is important is because I want you all to know, as they are  supposed to be patrolling that border, making sure that illegal drugs  and substances don't come in, that is not what they did. This very,  very broken Customs and Border Patrol system and structure in place is  so racialized that they turned on this beautiful Southwest Detroit  community. They turned on my Latino neighbors. They turned on my Muslim  brothers and sisters, many of them just trying to experience and live  in this border community.   A 9-year-old ACLU investigation of Customs and Border Patrol  operations in Michigan revealed just how incredibly racist the agency  is. The report revealed that, even though CBP's mandated mission is to  police the border, only 1.3 percent of their cases in Michigan involved  attempted entries from Canada that were illegal. Ninety-six percent of  those arrested by CBP in Michigan were recorded by agents of being  nonwhite.   Now, I want to explain this to you all. My block club president, this  beautiful Cuban, Black, mixed person, he is an incredible advocate. He  works in the auto industry. He is out there with this guy from Germany  coming in on a visitor visa. He is in this car, and he is showing them  the border, the riverfront, just the walkway, and just showing: Hey,  that is Canada. This is my community. This is where I live.   He is driving around and, of course, CBP stops him. He goes to the  guy who is here on a visitor visa: Hey, I know you are from Germany.  Don't worry. Just have your immigrant documents ready and everything.   But guess what? They didn't ask the guy from Germany for any of his  documents. They asked the U.S.-born citizen, Brown neighbor of mine for  those immigration documents.   Not only that, one of my neighbors running around in her own local  park, in her own local park, was asked: Where are your papers?                                time  1945    People are now being asked to carry their documents with them, and  this never happened for a very long time, up until about 15 or 20 years  ago. To my good colleague from New Mexico, you should know this. This  is a community that has never seen these kinds of ICE and immigration  operations at schools, which is illegal. It is against our own Federal  policies. They were doing them near churches. I mean, literally, near  churches, against their own Federal policy. So it is really incredibly  important to understand just how broken those systems are.   We can continue to talk about the contributions and the benefits of  immigrants and our immigrant neighbors, but I don't want to make it out  so--of course, it is an economic benefit. Many of my colleagues don't  even realize that most of the food on the table, most the things that  are done, are from immigrant hands touching it, most of it.   You look around. Everybody knows. Everybody knows who is building our  country. Everybody knows that the agricultural community and industry  relies on our immigrant neighbors. Everyone knows that. But they don't  want to do that. They want somebody else to blame. Instead, my  colleagues want to focus on making a pathway to citizenship, one much  more humane. They are focused on blaming them for any economic  downfall.   Guess what? Poverty is increasing, not because of our immigrants, but  because we haven't been able to focus and put people before profits. We  would rather do tax breaks for billionaires instead of actually taking  care of our neighbors. We try to go ahead and blame our Brown and Black  communities for everything going wrong in their own neighborhoods. That  is just not how it works.   I am here because I also wanted to talk about Jakelin, if I may.  Jakelin's story was really eye-opening to me as to what is really going  on at the border. She was a 7-year-old who died shortly after arriving  in the United States in 2018.   Jakelin turned 7 years old on her 2,000-mile journey north through  Mexico. She was given her first new pair of shoes for this journey. Her  and her father went north in search of a better life and to try to make  money to send home to Jakelin's mom and her two siblings. Her family is  from a tiny village in Guatemala, and they lived on approximately $7  per day. She was one of two children to die in CBP custody that month  alone.   I say this because, where is the morality when it comes to these  beautiful children that are coming with their parents? Where is the  morality and understanding that people are coming here for this better  opportunity and we have no pathway? This broken immigration system is  hurting all of us. We need to wake up and understand that.   My beautiful neighbors in southwest Detroit always have my back. They  are the ones when they got up in the morning who knew where my kids  were, what was going on in the community. They were and still are just  an integral part of my neighborhood and my community. When I look  around, all I see is beauty, people that just want to live and thrive  in our country.   I can show all kinds of economic benefit, but it is not enough,  because a lot of people want to blame my immigrant neighbors for  everything wrong. And everything wrong is not because of that; it is  because you keep putting corporations before our people, period. That  is it. You look at the budget, you see how much we are spending on  defense versus how do we address infrastructure issues? How do we  address the broken education and inequity in our education system?   I have a school district right now where the majority of fountains  have garbage bags over them because they have no clean water coming  through in our schools. Our kids don't have clean drinking water in  schools. That is not because of all of these things that they keep  talking about, about broken immigration. No.   If you look at what President Reagan did, President Bush and  President Clinton, if you look at what they did, they created some sort  of pathway. It wasn't perfect. But this constant vilification  [[Page H4284]]  needs to stop. It needs to stop, because that is the lazy approach.  That is the lazy approach of legislating in this country.   Come on. I grew up here. You know what Detroit and this beautiful  Black city taught me? You always have the backs of the people you  represent. You focus on helping them get through everyday issues. You  focus on what is broken inside, not looking far away and saying it is  all their fault. Some of them are not even here, and they are blaming  everybody else. Accept the fact that we haven't had the courage to  stand up and say the economic divide in our country is real, that our  folks are paying the high cost of auto insurance, folks are paying a  high cost in a number of issues regarding their homes, regarding the  education system and so many other systems.   I am passionate about this because not only am I a child of immigrant  parents, but I was my mother's translator until I was 12 years old. I  still remember, Madam Speaker, that I went into Sears and I was  translating for my mother and this cashier just looked at her and looks  at me and looks at her and looks at me--and I am 12 years old--and she  goes: ``She needs to learn English.''   I look and smile. Of course, the southwest Detroit girl came out of  me. My head did bob a little bit, and I said: ``Excuse me, but I am not  translating what you are saying to my mother. I am translating what my  mother wants to say to you. Why? Because even with her heavy accent,  you are dehumanizing her. You are othering her. You are making it like  she is less than, even though she tries.''   As she beautifully speaks the English language, I feel like, my God,  like, if anything, people should appreciate it more.   So I say this because this lived experience of my mother, as a  naturalized American citizen, who is so proud of having human dignity  here, this freedom of raising her daughter who is now a United States  Congresswoman, should be celebrating it and should be honoring it.  Instead, I know what is happening to her in the streets. People are  yelling at her to take off her hijab, vilifying her. That is what we  are doing to our immigrant neighbors, the same ones who pick fruit and  put it on our tables, who open and revive neighborhoods that have never  seen life since they came to our communities.    I am tired of it. I am tired of folks using fear-mongering rhetoric  to create hate towards my immigrant neighbors.   They are here because our country offers something that others don't.  We should understand that. We should create a humane and fair and just  immigration system, not one that hurts them and allows children to die,  that targets women in detention centers, and separates our families. It  is simply wrong.   The most American thing I could do up here is push back and say:  Enough. We are a Nation of immigrants. All of us. I am tired of the  hate and the racism.   I thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus for always speaking that  truth to power.
