 Mr. Speaker, Congressman Garamendi has demonstrated  leadership both here in our Nation's capital and when we worked  together in Sacramento, and I commend his efforts and thank him for  yielding to me.   The government shutdown is simply irresponsible. The American public  understands that a Congress debates a budget, the President submits his  proposal, and we go through our committee hearing process. We make  modifications and changes. You win some and you lose some. But by  October 1, we are supposed to have a budget sent to the President, and  he is supposed to sign it into law.   Now, guess what. A budget is among the most important things we do as  Members of Congress, and it is the Nation's spending priorities. It is  thousands of spending priorities. There are some things we like in the  budget, and there are some things that we would change. But our Nation  has to have a budget, just like every family has a budget, every  business has a budget.   In that family budget or the business budget, there are things you  would rather not pay--a house payment, a car payment--but we have  obligations and commitments to make and have to be responsible.   This government shutdown, this manufactured crisis orchestrated by  the President in which he proudly proclaimed that he would take  ownership of it--they can call it the Trump shutdown, as he said so  boldly in December--is the Trump shutdown. It is simply irresponsible.    I think the American public, for good reason, regardless of their  registration, is frustrated, and I suspect many of them, like myself,  are fed up.   I went through the airport security this morning as I did last week,  as I did the week before, and I thanked those security officers with  TSA for doing their job. They are doing their job. And guess what. They  are doing it without pay. That is disgraceful. It is just not what the  shining democracy of America is about, leader of the free world.   But it doesn't stop there. There are over 53,000 TSA employees around  the country, 54,000 ICE officers, and 42,000 Coast Guard Active-Duty  members who are working without pay.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the President, how would it be if he were to  suggest to his employees at his hotels and at his golf courses--whom he  has to pay every 2 weeks or every month--that he wants them to come to  work but he is not going to pay them?   It is immoral, and it is certainly not the American way. We don't  expect people to come to work and then not pay them.   This manufactured crisis--and believe me, it is a manufactured  crisis--is the real cause for us all to be concerned about national  security. I mean, the challenges we have at the border, these Border  Patrol agents, these Coast Guard Active-Duty members are protecting our  security, and we are saying: Well, but, you know, we don't care if you  have a house payment. We don't care if you have a car payment. We don't  care if you have other commitments and obligations. We expect you to  come to work and to protect our security, and we are not going to do  anything to, in fact, take that into account. In a way, that is clearly  a dereliction of our duties.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to the President that it is a dereliction of  his duty, because he has a responsibility, just as we do, to ensure  that our government is fully functioning. We have passed the  President's bills and sent them to him which would fully fund and  reopen the government.   Last Friday, Congressman Cox and I had an informal workshop at the  Subway sandwich store in the building where my office is, where I work  on behalf of the people of the San Joaquin Valley. In that 10-story  office building are 1,300 IRS employees. That Subway sandwich store has  lost over 50 percent of its business in the last month. The two owners,  the man and the wife, are being impacted.   The store in the lobby, it has lost 70 percent of its business. And  there is another kabob restaurant in which he is helping, sometimes,  the employees who are still hanging around there by giving them  sandwiches, but this is his business.   So it is not just the direct impact of over 800,000 government  employees across this country, people who work for the USDA, the United  States Department of Agriculture, who operate the farm service agencies  throughout our constituencies.   Our farmers, our ranchers, and our dairymen can't go to those Farm  Service Agency offices and apply for loans and other things that are  important with regard to this crazy tariff war that is taking place  because, guess what. Those offices are closed.   But it is also the ripple effect for businesses that have contracts  with the Federal Government, whether it is with the United States  Forest Service or whether it is with other departments and agencies.  They are not getting paid.   But guess what. They have got employees, and they have got a contract  that they signed with the United States Government that says they were  going to get paid every month, and they have commitments to their  employees.   This is the President's shutdown, and 32 days into it, none of us  should be proud of where we are today. Third-world countries are  looking at us and wondering: America doesn't do that.   But we are looking like a third-world country. Countries around the  world just don't shut down their government.   Let me close on this note. This is a phenomena that has happened,  really, in the last 8 years. We had a government shutdown in the mid- 1990s by President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich, and that was not a  good thing.   Normally, as Congressman Garamendi suggested, you have budget  requests. You have debate in committees. You pass segments of the  budget, and it comes together in an orderly process. Ultimately, both  the House and the Senate pass that budget and send it to the President  by October 1.   I think there is another principle here that we need to be very clear  about to the American public. I don't care which party it is. We should  not allow bad behavior to be rewarded in  [[Page H986]]  this sense. If you don't like something in the budget--and there are a  lot of things I don't like in the budget--at the end of the day, you  have got to have a budget.                                time  1945    What is happening here is that this is a manufactured crisis that the  President is using to hold hostage a campaign promise he made 2 years  ago to build this wall.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, wasn't Mexico going to pay for the wall?    Mr. Speaker, I say to Congressman Garamendi, that is what  I heard.    I heard it not once, not twice, but more times than I care  to remember. Clearly, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Garamendi and I know that there is bipartisan  willingness to improve border security. The gentleman and I know,  because we are from California, that the majority of the drug  trafficking and the other crimes that are occurring are through what we  call ports of legal entry. That sounds like a complicated technical  term, but it just means it is an open border crossing between the U.S.  and Mexico, and thousands of people cross every day at many of these  border crossings. That is where the overwhelming majority of the  illegal trafficking is taking place, and along the ocean. And no bill,  no bright and shiny 30-foot wall, will make a difference.   El Chapo, whom we are holding now in prison, built tunnels to get out  of prison. There are tunnels under existing walls that the President  was briefed on when he went down to the border last week.   Mr. Speaker, I don't care how the wall is built, because it is not  going to improve border security.   Mind you, we have more than 500 miles of existing barriers and fences  at the San Ysidro border, and some of the other portions of the U.S.- Mexican border, where it makes sense. Certainly, I am willing to  provide support to improve those existing barriers and to provide the  sort of equipment, drones, and other technical devices that are cutting  edge, that Border Patrol agents and ICE agents say will improve our  border security. That is what we should be doing.   But what we should not be doing is holding America hostage because of  a political campaign promise that was made 2 years ago. That is wrong.  That is simply wrong.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Garamendi is to be commended for taking a  leadership role in this effort. We have to do some things here that  change the debate and how we produce a budget so that we don't allow  groups of either party--our extreme elements--to decide: Well, gee, I  am not going to go through the regular process. I will hold this  Congress and I will hold the American people hostage.   This is impacting our GDP. If the President doesn't believe us, he  should ask his own Council of Economic Advisers, because they came out  with a report last week. It is not affecting only our economy, but it,  therefore, affects the world's economy. That is why we need to reopen  government and have a thoughtful debate on how we can, on a bipartisan  basis, improve our border security.   Of the $1.2 million we allocated in last year's budget for border  security, this administration, I am told, has spent around 10 percent  of that $1.2 billion. Now we were going to give him another $1.6  billion. Then the President--I know we are getting close to the Super  Bowl--to use a football analogy, on December 18, when we thought we had  an agreement, he decided to move the goalposts. I can't say it any  plainer than that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Congressman Garamendi if he can.    Mr. Speaker, I was in Puerto Rico last weekend, and the  recovery funding is a serious matter, as it is in Paradise. It is  simply wrong. It is wrong and immoral for us to do this.    Mr. Speaker, I think until the end of February, which  would  [[Page H987]]  allow us to debate appropriate border security in a committee process  in the House and in the Senate, working together with this  administration and the President. There would be give and take. There  would be compromises. I think we should get back to doing the people's  business in an appropriate fashion, without taking hostages, because it  is simply wrong. We should not let the American public think that we  have lost sight of what the regular order of the United States Congress  is to pass appropriations bills and, ultimately, to pass a budget.   That is where this incredibly egregious activity is taking place in  recent years. I think we know that, at some point, there will be a  series of compromises, and we will reopen government. So why don't we  just do it sooner rather than later and end the pain and anguish of  hundreds of thousands of people who are protecting our security--they  are hardworking men and women of our country--without paychecks?   All the other independent contractors who do business with the  government and who have employees or have small businesses, like that  Subway sandwich shop in Fresno or the market or the kabob restaurant,  let these people do what they do best--work hard and make a living for  themselves and their families, and contribute to our economy--because  what we are doing right now is wrong.    And the ripple effect.    To our national parks.   Mr. Speaker, let me close by underlining one comment that Mr.  Garamendi made earlier. I know, as a member of the Armed Services  Committee, the gentleman is one of our leaders as it relates to our  Nation's security. And I am engaged with a host of other efforts in our  Foreign Affairs Committee and with our European allies. When the  gentleman said that no one could be happier about this series of events  than the President of Russia, President Putin, let me underline that,  because we are doing to ourselves what the Soviet Union and Russia  today have never been able to do to us, which is undermine our  security, undermine NATO's security, and undermine the security of the  free world.   That is how serious this is. This manufactured crisis has now risen  to such a level that we are doing to ourselves what our adversaries  have never been able to do to us through decades of Republican and  Democratic Presidents and Congresses in which, at the water's edge, we  all bind together because it is America's security. I don't know how  they celebrate in Moscow, but right now, they must be very pleased this  evening, with smiles on their faces, as we look at the 32 days of this  government shutdown.
