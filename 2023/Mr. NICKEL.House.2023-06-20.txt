 Mr. Speaker, in such a closely divided Congress, the only  real solutions are bipartisan solutions that can pass the House and get  60 votes in the Senate.   For me, bipartisanship is more than just a buzzword. That is why as a  member of the House Financial Services Committee, I am working on  advancing commonsense, bipartisan legislation. Since January, I am  proud to have advanced three bipartisan bills through committee and one  through the floor of the House.   The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, which I co-led with  Congressman  Mike Flood, recently passed on the House floor with 383  votes and would help cut through government red tape and ensure well- qualified and more diverse individuals are able to invest in our  private markets.   The second bill, Improving Disclosures for Investors Act, which I co- led with Congressman Huizenga, is the next step in the decades-long  process of modernizing the SEC's electronic delivery rules, while  providing strong investor protections.   The China Exchange Rate Transparency Act, which I co-led with  Congressman Meuser, would enable us to learn more about China's  exchange rate policies to level the playing field for American  businesses and promote domestic manufacturing.   As we look ahead, I know that we can reach consensus and find common  ground on the issues facing the American people. One of those areas is  stablecoin legislation. I am proud of the work we have done this  Congress on bipartisan stablecoin legislation.   The most recent draft includes many of my suggestions, like  protecting State regulators in North Carolina, adding consumer  protections, and ensuring banks can safely hold digital assets in their  custody.   I hope that we can continue to come together, put politics aside, and  reach a bipartisan agreement that can pass through committee with  support from Democrats and Republicans. I stand ready to work with  Members on both sides of the aisle to find solutions and get things  done for the people of North Carolina's 13th District.                 Celebrating Distinguished North Carolinians     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and congratulate a  distinguished North Carolinian, Dr. Mandy Cohen, on her recent  appointment as the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, the CDC. This remarkable achievement is a testament to Dr.  Cohen's commitment to public health and her exceptional leadership  skills.   North Carolina has a rich history of contributing remarkable  individuals to our great Nation. Our State has always nurtured talent  and fostered innovation. Dr. Cohen's appointment as the head of the CDC  exemplifies North Carolina's continued influence on the national stage.   Throughout her tenure as the secretary of the North Carolina  Department of Health and Human Services--where I served in the State  senate during her tenure, as well--Dr. Cohen has demonstrated  unparalleled dedication to improving the health and well-being of our  citizens. In the face of the unprecedented challenges posed by the  COVID-19 pandemic, she led North Carolina's robust response efforts  with compassion and expertise.   Today, as we honor Dr. Cohen, we also take pride in recognizing two  other North Carolinians appointed to critical national positions.   Michael Regan, a native of North Carolina's 13th Congressional  District, serves as the administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency, the EPA. Mr. Regan's passion and expertise have propelled us  toward a greener, more sustainable future.   Erik Hooks, the deputy administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, FEMA, also hails from North Carolina. In his role,  Mr. Hooks has played a pivotal role in disaster response and recovery  efforts, ensuring the safety and well-being of communities across our  Nation.   As we celebrate the accomplishments of Dr. Mandy Cohen, Michael  Regan, and Erik Hooks, we also recognize the collective achievements of  North Carolina. I was with our Governor, Roy Cooper, just last week and  he made note of these important contributions from these three North  Carolinians in this administration.   Our State has consistently produced exceptional leaders who have made  significant contributions to our Nation.  [[Page H2972]]    I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Mandy Cohen on her  appointment as the Director of the CDC. I am confident she will bring  the same passion and expertise to this new position that she  demonstrated throughout her career in North Carolina.   To Michael Regan and Erik Hooks, I express my deepest appreciation  for their invaluable contributions to our Nation. North Carolina is  proud to call these exceptional individuals our own, and we look  forward to the positive impact they will play and continue to have on  our country.                            ____________________
