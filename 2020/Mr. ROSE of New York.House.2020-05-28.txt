 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember all those  who we have lost to the coronavirus, and one man in particular who is  close to my heart and the hearts of thousands of people in my district.   Joe Joyce may best be known for his bar in Bay Ridge, J.J. Bubbles,  but the truth is he served our community much more than cold beer. His  generous spirit touched countless lives on both sides of the  Verrazzano.   Joe was an Army veteran who served in Vietnam, and after he returned  home his service continued. He worked as a phys ed teacher for disabled  students on Staten Island, supported the Special Olympics, and would  offer up his bar to host fundraisers for any organization who asked.  That was one thing that never changed over the 42 years Joe was in  business. As soon as you walked into J.J. Bubbles you were family.   Today, we remember and think of Joe's family: his wife, Jane; his  children, Eddie, Kristin, Kevin; and his six grandchildren. Joe's loss  can be felt all throughout my district, but his gift to all of us was  his unique ability to bring people of all stripes together, and that is  a gift we need now more than ever.                            ____________________
