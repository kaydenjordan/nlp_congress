 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, June 20 of  2023, to recognize National Bald Eagle Day.   Each year, this day honors the iconic national symbol of freedom and  American spirit. Chosen by our forefathers to represent the enduring  strength and pride of the American people, the bald eagle is both our  national animal and a symbol of free spirit.   In recognizing the symbolism of the eagle, we must also address the  history of its near extinction and booming recovery.   In the 1970s, America's bald eagles were nearly extinct due to the  destruction of habitats, harmful pesticides, and illegal hunting  practices. After the implementation of congressional action that  protected eagles, the population soared to the numbers that we see  today.   Representing the endurance, adaptability, and tenacity of the  American people, the bald eagle stands for the morals that guide this  great country. If you are lucky enough to see a bald eagle in flight,  think of its history, think of its success, and think of American  pride.                            ____________________
