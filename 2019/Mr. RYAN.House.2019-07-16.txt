 Madam Speaker, ``we the people,'' ``a more perfect Union,''  ``the common defense,'' ``general welfare,'' ``common good,'' ``these  United States''--the words and phrases of our founding documents were  about unity, were about us coming together against the political and  economic concentration of power.   Division is the enemy in the United States today. We are unraveling  before the very eyes of the American people. And I believe that this  President, that the White House does not want to talk about the issues  facing the American people today.   Madam Speaker, 75 percent of the American people are living paycheck  to paycheck; seniors are paying $1,000 a month for prescription drugs;  students are drowning in student loans.                                time  1815
