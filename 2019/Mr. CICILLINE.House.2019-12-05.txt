 Madam Speaker, it has been less than a year since  Democrats took back the majority in the House. In that short time, we  have passed nearly 400 bills to get government working for the people  again, by increasing access to quality, affordable healthcare and  protecting coverage for preexisting conditions; by raising family  wages; by making bold investments in rebuilding our Nation's  infrastructure; and by cleaning up corruption in Washington and getting  the government to work for the people again.   We have sent more than 275 bipartisan bills to the Senate, where  Mitch McConnell is refusing to vote on them. These bills include  legislation to protect and strengthen coverage for preexisting  conditions, to ensure equal pay for equal work, and to fight back  against the debilitating effects of climate change and ban offshore  drilling.   We also voted to give 33 million Americans a long-overdue pay raise  by raising the minimum wage, provide Gold Star families with much- needed tax relief, and secure our Nation's elections.   Yet, Mitch McConnell has described himself as the ``grim reaper'' and  won't take up any of this legislation.   We are busy doing the work of the American people. We have passed  over 375 bipartisan bills that are sitting in the Senate. It is time  for the Senate to take up these bills and address the urgent priorities  of the American people.                            ____________________
