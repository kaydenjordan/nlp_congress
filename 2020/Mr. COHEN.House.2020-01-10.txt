 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Whitehaven High  School math teacher Nathan Kirsch. He won the Milken Educator Award.  This award is given to only 40 early- and mid-career teachers across  the United States, and there was only one in Tennessee who won it.   Mr. Kirsch was surprised with the award at a school assembly  Wednesday morning, where the entire student body applauded him for  being the only teacher in Tennessee to receive the national  distinction, which some have called the Oscar award for teaching. It  could be the Nobel Prize for teaching.   In accepting the award, Mr. Kirsch called it one ``for all of my  students,'' past, current, and future.   The Whitehaven High School community is rightly proud of this  accomplishment, and I am, too.   It is very encouraging that a program known for being an athletic  powerhouse is also recognized for its excellence in academics. The  principal at Whitehaven, Vincent Hunter, posts the names of the  scholars, the ones who have gotten the best scores and the most  scholarship offers, on the wall outside of his office--not athletic  awards, of which there are a plethora, but academic awards.   Mr. Kirsch embodies both traditions that Whitehaven has--as a coach  of teams and a great teacher who has raised their calculus scores.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Kirsch and all the Whitehaven Tigers  on this exceptional achievement.                            ____________________
