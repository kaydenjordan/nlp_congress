 Madam Speaker, former President Ronald Reagan once said:  ``America was founded on the moral proposition that human life--all  human life--is sacred. And this proposition is the bedrock of our  national life, the foundation of our laws. It is the wellspring of our  Constitution.''   If our Nation can unite around any singular issue, it should be that  life is sacred, especially the life of a child.   This week, tens of thousands of Americans will coalesce around that  issue as they visit our Nation's Capital for the purpose of protecting  life.   I join with these peaceful Americans in supporting laws that ensure  every child has the opportunity for the most basic right defined in our  Constitution, the right to life.   As a member of the Pro-Life Caucus and a father of two wonderful  boys, I want to welcome all these great Americans as they visit  Washington, D.C., to help defend the life of the unborn.                            ____________________
