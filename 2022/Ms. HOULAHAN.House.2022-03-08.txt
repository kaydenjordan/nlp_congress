 Mr. Speaker, as the 2022 tax filing season gets  underway, I rise to draw attention to the issues that my constituents  face when trying to navigate the IRS.   James from Nottingham came to my office because his 2020 return was  delayed for almost a year. Lisa from Berwyn called us after she learned  that a clerical error at the IRS had led the Social Security  Administration to claim that she owed them a significant amount of  money. And Tina from Malvern worked with my team to secure a full  refund.   Stories like these are far too common. As recently as the end of last  year, the agency had a backlog of over 8 million new and amended  individual returns.   That is why I was proud to join with over 190 of our House colleagues  in sending a letter to Treasury Secretary Yellen, urging her to provide  taxpayers with relief and flexibility while the IRS addresses its  backlog. These backlogs lead to delays and errors that are devastating  to the families and businesses at the heart of my community and many  others. It is imperative that this relief and flexibility be provided.                            ____________________
