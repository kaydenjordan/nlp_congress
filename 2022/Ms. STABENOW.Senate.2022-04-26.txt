 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a  Michigander who is working every day to build bridges and bring people  together at a very important time for our country and our world.   Farhat Qazi of West Bloomfield is an entrepreneur and a  philanthropist. She is also a woman of deep faith who believes that  religion can be a powerful force for peace and unity in the world.   In pursuit of this noble goal, Qazi created Children of Abraham Day,  which was recognized in Michigan on December 4, 2020. The day is an  opportunity for Jews, Muslims, and Christians to celebrate their shared  origins as descendants of the Prophet Abraham; their reverence for the  city of Jerusalem; and their common beliefs in love, charity, and moral  behavior.   Far too often throughout history, religious differences have led to  strife,  [[Page S2152]]  conflict, and war. By focusing on shared backgrounds and beliefs--and  rededicating ourselves to religious understanding and tolerance--Qazi  believes that people of diverse faiths can build a stronger, more  peaceful, and more prosperous world. I couldn't agree with her more.   ``I believe teaching our children the common origins and shared  heritage of the Abrahamic faiths is key to future global unity, peace,  and harmony,'' said Qazi. ``Children of Abraham Day is about showing  how we can come together, celebrate, and appreciate a common bond.''   Farhat Qazi's belief in the power of Children of Abraham Day--and her  tireless work to bring people of diverse religions together--deserves  to be commended. It is my hope and prayer that this seed of  understanding she has planted will continue to blossom and  grow.                            ____________________
