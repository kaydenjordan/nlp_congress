 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a long-time  Senate staffer who recently retired, Nathan Bergerbest.   Many Members and staff who have worked on judiciary, military and  veterans, homeland security, public safety, foreign relations,  intelligence, or Native American issues and national and international  disasters likely had the opportunity to work with Nathan during the 16  years he served the people of Alaska and the Nation. I am sure that  many can share stories of the help Nathan offered, ideas he pushed to  fruition, and wise counsel he provided. My statement today will offer  just a slice of the many contributions this accomplished man has made  in the lives of so many.   Nathan began his interest in good public policy and politics at a  young age growing up in New York City. I believe he once said that he  got involved in his first political campaign in elementary school  because he was searching for the candidate who could improve his  neighborhood. His quest for what was right, what was fair, and what was  useful public policy has never subsided.   An attorney, Nathan has been a litigator, represented an Alaska  Native regional corporation, and worked at FEMA. He started in my  office in 2003 as legislative assistant and retired as senior counsel  and deputy chief of staff. Throughout his service here in the Senate,  Nathan was the quintessential Senate staffer--working late, knowing his  subject cold, understanding the ways of the Senate and navigating them  brilliantly.   His portfolio was huge, complex, and important. Yet he never shirked  from pitching in where he could be useful. Nathan served not only as a  mentor to young staffers in my office but as the conscience of Federal  agency employees, military personnel, and elected leaders--constantly  challenging us to do better, to be better versions of ourselves.   While a tribute from a former employer is always gratifying, Nathan  made a lasting impression on so many who have worked here in the Senate  over the years. I would like to share some of their stories. Several of  the military fellows who have served in my office and worked closely  with Nathan shared these words:         Nathan was part of the original group that came to be known       as the Fairbanks Tiger Team, leading the red-shirted charge       with the Fairbanks community against the Air Force's proposed       plan to remove the F-16 Aggressor Squadron from Eielson Air       Force Base. He rallied community leaders, helped leverage the       effort on the Defense Appropriations Committee, and       ultimately helped the Alaska delegation save Eielson. Then,       only a year later, he worked to support the Alaska       delegation's strong push to bring the F-35 to Eielson. In       just over a year, the delegation was able to take Eielson       from a near-shuttered installation, to one that will soon       have the most capable fighter aircraft in the world, with       significant infrastructure investment to support it.        The Tiger Team still meets over telephone or in person       every other Friday to discuss housing and other local       community issues related to the military. The team has       evolved over the years with new members joining and old       members retiring or moving to different lines of work. Nathan       will be missed on these calls but his legacy will be forever       forged in the Fairbanks community and the national defense of       our country.    New commanders coming to Washington, DC, for their Hill visits would  often ask my military and veterans affairs liaison in Anchorage for  advice about how to prepare. The advice they received was ``Don't try  to BS Nathan, because he'll be able to sniff it out.'' Several of these  commanders were relieved when the meeting with Nathan was over.   But Nathan would bend over backwards to help the military or a  servicemember. ``A Colonel who served in Alaska attributed Nathan for  saving his career. He didn't give any details. Only that he owed him  everything.'' That is just like Nathan--to do good for an American and  move on to the next task.         Nathan was a true friend to the Alaska National Guard as       well, very close to the Adjutant Generals, and always quick       to help support their needs or tout their accomplishments.        Nathan was extremely proud that Alaska boasts the highest       rate of veterans per capita and worked to ensure strong       representation of the Total Force military and veteran       communities, always working to advance veterans' rights and       benefits. His efforts helped lead to improvements in VA       hospitals in Alaska as well as advances in telemedicine and       other support to veterans in remote Alaskan communities.    Public safety and support for law enforcement were always priorities  for Nathan. He helped to lead collaborative efforts among the Federal  agencies and State and local law enforcement to keep drugs out of  Alaskan communities, and he never missed honoring the fallen at the  National Fallen Officers Memorial ceremonies. He cared deeply for all  those who put themselves in harm's way.   While he was a policy expert in so many areas, Nathan was never one  to ignore a plea for help from an individual Alaskan. There are  countless examples of ``casework'' that he took on in addition to his  legislative duties. From arranging military honors for veterans'  funerals, persuading the Canadian Border Security Agency to reinstate  24-hour border crossings between Hyder, AK, and British Columbia,  ensuring Alaskans' concerns were heard by the Navy prior to Northern  Edge exercises, protecting National Guard members from retaliation  during an investigation of sexual misconduct complaints, improving the  standard of care at VA medical facilities, or any number of efforts,  Nathan started with the question ``What does the individual need?'' and  went about getting it done. In many instances, Nathan would help my  staff in Alaska navigate the bureaucracy to help solve an Alaskan's  problem.   A former attorney for FEMA, Nathan was also the Alaska delegation's  go-to staffer whenever disaster struck. After the November 2018  earthquake struck Anchorage, Mat-Su, and the Kenai Peninsula, Nathan  helped disentangle municipalities, school districts, business owners,  and individuals from the byzantine red tape that often characterizes  FEMA. In call after call, Nathan translated FEMA's language and  policies for Alaskans and worked with FEMA officials to do a better job  assessing and responding to the damage. When FEMA sought to respond to  a flood in Galena but lacked a sense of the challenges of rural Alaska,  Nathan helped prod and guide the agency in improving the response.   Nathan took the same sense of dedication to his work on Indian,  Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian issues. Leading Alaska tribal rights  attorney Lloyd Miller called Nathan ``one of the most knowledgeable and  talented lawyers to ever work on the Hill. He combined an unmatched  mastery of Alaska Native legal history with a deep sensitivity to  Alaska Native issues gained from working inside one of the major Alaska  Native regional corporations. And while his background before coming to  the Hill was predominantly with Alaska Native corporations, he was  equally knowledgeable about the unique challenges confronting Alaska  Native Tribes, and the importance of supporting the critical role that  Alaska Tribes play alongside their corporations. Nathan's remarkable  intellect and sage advice will be deeply missed.''   Over the years, as protestors filled the halls of Capitol Hill and  individual offices, Nathan would stay late to talk with those who  visited my office. He would sit with them for long periods and talk  about how they can best navigate the issues, and how they, as  advocates, could best approach offices for meetings and how they can  present their issues in such a way that they were truly being heard on  both sides of the aisle. On at least one or two occasions, I have seen  him go and literally sit on the floor with protestors outside of my  office for an hour or two--just listening to what they had to say so  that he could ensure I understood the concerns of Americans who are so  passionate about the important issues of the day.   No matter what the time of day or day of the week, Nathan made  himself available to me, to other members of my staff, and to Alaskans.  As my constituent services director in Anchorage put it, ``I remember  one time in particular in 2011 where he and I each took 12-hour shifts  around the clock so we could help Alaskan constituents after the 9.0  magnitude earthquake struck in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast  coast of Japan. A massive tsunami was triggered that flooded Japan's  coastal  [[Page S7203]]  communities and damaged infrastructure. We spent several days in  communication with constituents stranded in Japan that were trying to  navigate the treacherous environment, communicate with the State  Department, and ultimately obtain transportation home. He was also  helpful in working with stranded Alaskan constituents after the 2015  severe earthquake in Nepal. He reached out to the lobbyist for Orbitz,  since many of the foreign air carriers on their website raised prices  drastically when trying to book flights out of Nepal after the  earthquake.''   There are so many stories illustrative of Nathan's positive influence  here in the U.S. Senate and in Alaska.   I thank Nathan Bergerbest for his service to Alaska and the Nation  and wish him well.                            ____________________
