 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  Federal dollars coming to the Houston area to solve the supply chain  issues facing our community and to create more jobs.   Yesterday, the Biden administration announced over $14 billion for  projects that will improve our Nation's ports, waterways, and  railroads. That includes $147 million for a project to expand the  Houston Ship Channel on the way to the Port of Houston.   This project will make it easier for ships to reach the docks and  help more cargo move faster from the container ship to the store shelf.  This will create jobs, jobs, and more jobs. This is huge for Texas,  huge for Houston, and huge for the whole country.   Thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by this  Chamber, we are solving the real problems facing everyday Americans.   I am grateful for the leadership of President Biden and my colleagues  in Congress for getting this done.                            ____________________
