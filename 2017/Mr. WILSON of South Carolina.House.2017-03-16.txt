 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, an editorial last week in  the Post and Courier of Charleston cites ``GOP health bill a start,''  which provided accurate insight into how the American Health Care Act  is the first step in a three-step approach on how to put patients back  in control of health care.   The editorial states: ``Any flaws not withstanding, it's an important  step forward for the GOP to put a fully fleshed-out healthcare bill on  the table. . . . But there is certainly cause for optimism that a  tweaked . . . healthcare bill can at least bandage and begin to cure  some of the festering wounds left by ObamaCare. . . .   ``Republicans have a chance to make things right. They have a chance  to help more Americans afford health care in a sustainable and  responsible way. They have the chance to place more healthcare  decisions in the hands of patients and doctors and fewer in the hands  of government.   ``The bill introduced on Tuesday is a first step in the right  direction. . . .''   I appreciate the positive vision of Speaker Paul Ryan with President  Donald Trump and his team of OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and HHS  Secretary Tom Price.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism to defeat Islamic  extremist terrorists.                            ____________________
