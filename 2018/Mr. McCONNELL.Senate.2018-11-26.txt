 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, with the Thanksgiving holiday behind  us, we are reminded that this year and this Congress will soon come to  a close. The past few years have been a time of historic  accomplishments on behalf of the American people: historic tax and  regulatory reform, landmark legislation to combat the opioid epidemic,  a return to regular order appropriations, much needed reforms and  resources for our men and women who wear the uniform today and for our  veterans. The list goes on and on.   As the 115th Congress comes to a close, my colleagues will have  much--much, indeed--to be proud of. But we aren't finished yet. The  Senate still has a full plate of important business that we must  complete before the end of the year.   At the top of the list are more nominations--well-qualified  individuals that the President has chosen for executive and judicial  service. Since the beginning of this Congress, the majority has taken  the Senate's role in the personnel business very seriously. We have  taken the opportunity to process nominations efficiently and fulfill  our responsibility to advise and consent.   Of course, thanks to a concerted delaying effort from our colleagues  across the aisle, a number of important offices remain unfilled.  Accomplished nominees have waited patiently on the Senate calendar.  Important posts have remained vacant while my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle slow-walk nominations and force a record-breaking  number of cloture votes.   We are 2 years into this administration. The President deserves his  team, and our constituents deserve the government they voted for. So,  as we have this entire Congress, we will continue to make nominations a  top priority for as long as need be.   The nominees we will consider this week are highly regarded and well  equipped for public service. We will begin with Stephen Vaden, who has  been nominated to serve as General Counsel at the Department of  Agriculture. Mr. Vaden is a graduate of Vanderbilt and Yale Law School.  He brings experience from multiple Federal court clerkships and from  years in practice in administrative law and appellate litigation.   This nominee was voted out of the Agriculture Committee with  bipartisan support, including that of the ranking member. So I urge  each of my colleagues to join me in voting to advance Mr. Vaden's  nomination this afternoon and to confirm him this week.   Then we will turn to more nominations for the Department of Commerce,  for the Federal judiciary, and for the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. I look forward to confirming each of them without undue delay.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S7077]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to recognize  one of the greatest voices for Kentucky's agricultural communities, the  Kentucky Farm Bureau, KFB, as it prepares to commemorate its centennial  year. With a mission to identify the challenges facing farmers, to  improve farm income, and to enhance the quality of life for growers,  processors, and all of us who enjoy the fruits of their labors, the KFB  has been a force for good throughout my home State. Since its  establishment almost 100 years ago, the KFB has done all of this and  more. I am so proud to have this opportunity to congratulate the men  and women of the KFB on this impressive milestone.   In 1919, a small group of Kentucky farmers gathered in Louisville to  form an organization to serve as the ``Voice of Kentucky Agriculture.''  Beginning as a member-based and member-driven organization, the KFB has  proudly kept to its founding vision, striving each day to uphold that  same goal.   In the last 100 years, the KFB has grown beyond anything its founders  could have imagined. With nearly 500,000 members, the organization  maintains a presence in all 120 counties in the Commonwealth. The KFB  has developed many service programs to benefit its members and other  parts of the agricultural community. These services include providing  crop insurance products, Young Farmers development, public affairs  representation, and estate planning assistance, just to name a few. As  it celebrates its centennial year, the KFB can also be proud of being  one of the largest State Farm Bureaus throughout the entire Nation.   Since my first day serving in the U.S. Senate, I have had the  opportunity to be Kentucky's champion on the Senate Agriculture  Committee. Every step of the way, the KFB has helped guide my work on  that committee on behalf of my State's farm families. Through several  agricultural bills--and countless fly-ins, the KFB has proved to be a  partner I can rely upon to support Kentucky farmers. We have  accomplished a great deal, and I look forward to many more projects we  can work on together.   One particular event I look forward to each year is the KFB's annual  country ham breakfast during the Kentucky State Fair. I make it a point  to attend every year possible so I can not only have the opportunity to  enjoy the delicious food, but also to spend quality time with the many  friends of Kentucky agriculture I have gotten to know over the years.  The tradition began in 1964 as a way to showcase our agricultural  products during the Kentucky State Fair, and it has grown into one of  the Nation's premier agricultural events. Each year, thousands of  Kentuckians from across the Commonwealth gather to enjoy some of the  best locally sourced food our State's farmers have to offer. The  morning culminates in a charity auction of the blue-ribbon country ham.  This year, the winning bid was a record-breaking $2.8 million to be  donated to Kentucky charities. While the ham breakfast may be among its  best-known public events, it is just one example of the KFB's many  accomplishments.   Throughout 2019, I hear the KFB plans to celebrate its century of  successes on behalf of Kentucky's farmers. I would like to recognize  the contributions of the organization's leadership, in particular Mark  Haney and his executive team. They are wonderful representatives of the  KFB and proud advocates for farmers. With their guidance, the KFB has a  bright future ahead.   I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in the recognition of the KFB,  its members, and all who have benefited from its century of service to  Kentucky. The organization's unmatched dedication to farmers and  commitment to agricultural advancement continues  [[Page S7079]]  to serve the KFB's mission well. I look forward to its continued  successes, and I am grateful for the chance to publicly join the KFB in  celebrating this anniversary and to offer my thanks for everything it  does to support farm families in the Commonwealth.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and  ask for its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, this resolution concerns a State court  civil case alleging price fixing in gasoline markets in northwest  Vermont, in which one of the defendants has issued to an employee in  Senator Sanders' Burlington, Vermont office a deposition subpoena for  testimony and documents arising out of his Senate duties. Senator  Sanders is opposing this subpoena on grounds of sovereign immunity and  the absolute immunity afforded the Senator and his staff under the  Speech or Debate Clause, as well as for imposing an undue burden. This  resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent  Senator Sanders' office and his employee and to move to quash the  subpoena.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Indian  Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration and the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 702.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. Res. 687 and that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 704, S. Res.  705, and S. Res. 706.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Vaden nomination expire at 12:15 p.m. on  Tuesday, November 27, and that if the Vaden nomination is confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  November 27; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Vaden nomination under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:24 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, November 27, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
