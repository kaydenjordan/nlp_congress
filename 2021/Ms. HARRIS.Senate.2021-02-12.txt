 Does one of us have to come out alive?    And there is more.   (Text of video presentations.)         Mr. McDonough. I promise to fight every single day.        One, I'm a fighter and I'm relentless.        But I'm a fighter and I'm relentless.        A fighter and I'm relentless.        I will fight like hell.         To continue fighting, we each have an important       role to play in fighting in this fight like so many before       it. It has been a fight. The American people are going to       have to fight.        And about the importance of fighting. I will always fight.        Fighting.        But we always must fight.        Joe Biden has a deep, deep seeded commitment to fight.        And to fight.        And about the importance of fighting.        We always must fight.        To fight.        To fight.        And to fight.        As our willingness to fight.        Continue the fight.        As Joe Biden says, to fight.        Fighting.        What we are fighting for.        We will tell them about what we did to fight.        About a fight.        Truly I do believe that we're in a fight.        I believe we're in a fight.        I believe we're in a fight.        I believe we're in a fight.        So there's a fight in front of us. A fight for all of these       things. And so we're prepared to fight for that.        We know how to fight.        Our ongoing fight.        A fight.        We know how to fight. We like a good fight. We were born       out of a fight. This is what is our fight right now.         Requiring us to fight and fight we will.        Their fight.        In their fight.        In their fight.        The fight is a fight. And so when we fight the fight that       we are in.        When we are fighting this fight.        We fight this fight.        The strength of who we are is we will fight.        And we will fight.        We will fight the fight.        We are in a fight.        The fight.        Fight.        Fight.        It is a fight.        It is a fight.        And it is a fight born out of patriotism.        This is a fight.        Fighting.        I say fight on.        Fight on.        Fight on.        Fight on.         This is a movement. I'm telling you, they're       not going to stop. And everyone beware because they're not       going to stop. They're not going to stop before election day       in November, and they're not going to stop after.        Mr. Cuomo. Please, show me where it says a protest is       supposed to be polite and peaceful.         They are not going to let up, and they should       not.    Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. You claim that it is wrong to object to the  certification of election results. You, along with your allies in the  media, attempted to cancel and censor Members of this Chamber who  voiced concerns and objected to certification.   Manager Raskin, you had been in Congress only 3 days when you  objected in 2017. It is one of the first things you did when you got  here.   (Text of video presentations of 1-6-2017.)          Does one of us have to come out alive?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Again, I did not show you their robust  speech to excuse or balance out the speech of my client, for I need  not. I showed you the video because in this political forum, all robust  speech should be protected, and it should be protected evenly for all  of us.   As a brief aside, we should all reflect and acknowledge the rhetoric  has gotten to be too much and over the top. It is grating on the  collective well-being of the body public, the citizens. Most would like  it to stop. But the point is, when you see speech such as this, you  have to apply the First Amendment evenly, blindly. She is blind, Lady  Justice.   Question No. 1: Does the First Amendment apply to this Chamber in  these proceedings?   The House managers' position, as stated in their trial brief, is  ``The First Amendment does not apply at all to an impeachment  proceeding.'' That is their position. This is plainly wrong. The text  of the First Amendment expressly restricts Congress from regulating  speech.   It says:         Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of       religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or       abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the       right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition       the Government for a redress of grievances.    To ignore the Constitution would be contrary to the oath of office of  a United States Senator:         I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and       defend the Constitution of the United States against all       enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith       and allegiance to the same--    Well, you all know the rest.   No, the Senate cannot ignore the First Amendment. The Constitution  itself limits the ability of the House to impeach to limited items,  such as ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''   The position advanced by the House managers is essentially an  unlimited impeachment standard without constitutional guardrails,  unmoored to any specific legal test other than the unbridled discretion  of Congress.   This is distinctly not the intent of the Framers. The Framers were  aware of the danger of any impeachment process that would make the  President ``the mere creature of the Legislature,'' a quote directly  from the Framers while debating the impeachment process on the floor of  the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The Framers were fearful that  any impeachment process that gave Congress full discretion on the  standard for impeachment would constitute nothing less than a  violation--``a violation of the fundamental principle of good  Government.'   One Founding Father, James Wilson, wrote extensively on the  impeachment process. Mr. Wilson was a renowned legal scholar at the  time, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania in  Philadelphia. He was a major force in drafting and adopting the  Constitution in 1787. He served as one of the first Supreme--one of the  first six Supreme Court Justices from 1789 to 1798. He was appointed by  President George Washington. In fact, Wilson taught the first course on  the new Constitution to President Washington and his Cabinet--the first  in the Nation's history--in Philadelphia at the University of  Pennsylvania in 1789.   Wilson, in his law lectures, the first of their kind under the  Constitution, plainly states that the Senate may not ignore the  Constitution in impeachment proceedings. He states that lawful and  constitutional conduct may not be used as an impeachable offense. Let  me say that again. He states that lawful and constitutional conduct may  not be used as an impeachable offense.   Read along with me:         The doctrine of impeachments is of high import in the       constitutions of free states. On one hand, the most powerful       magistrates should be amenable to the law: on the other hand,       elevated characters should not be sacrificed merely on       account of their elevation. No one should be secure while he       violates the constitution and the laws: everyone should be       secure while he observes them.    To be clear, James Wilson is saying that the Constitution does indeed  apply when judging whether to convict an official by impeachment. If  the complained-of conduct is constitutional, it cannot be impeachable.  Are we to ignore the words and teachings of James Wilson? The House  managers surely want you to.   The House managers have made several references to this letter signed  by 140 partisan ``law professors'' calling Mr. Trump's First Amendment  defense ``legally frivolous.'' This is really an outrageous attempt to  intimidate Mr. Trump's lawyers.   Whenever a lawyer advances a truly ``frivolous'' argument, they may  violate professional, ethical rules and could be subject to discipline.   This letter is a direct threat to my law license, my career, and my  family's financial well-being. These ``law professors'' should be  ashamed of themselves, and so should the House managers.   How dare you? Do you really hate Donald Trump so much that you are  willing to destroy good, hard-working people's lives, people that are  only  [[Page S676]]  doing their jobs, and, frankly, as counsel for an accused fulfilling a  constitutional role? It is astounding, really. I am a citizen, not a  politician.   I know these First Amendment arguments are not anywhere close to  frivolous. They are completely meritorious.   Interestingly, the law professors' letter was issued on February 5--3  days before we even filed our legal brief in this matter--and they  ignored landmark, bedrock Supreme Court cases directly addressing this  issue.   In our brief, we have a direct quote from James Wilson, the Founding  Father, supporting our position. The direct quote was documented in the  Founding Father's original legal papers on the subject. He was the  primary draftsman of the Constitution who taught the new Constitution  to President Washington. He says so long as acts of elected officials  like Mr. Trump are constitutionally protected, he should not be  impeached.   We have landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions--Wood and Bonds, which  I will explain in detail--supporting our position.   All of this the House managers and the partisan law professors  completely and misleadingly ignore.   Frivolous? Hardly. The letter is a bully tactic, and I think evidence  is the House managers know they have a problem with the First Amendment  defense on the merits, so they are resorting to such tactics.   The House managers' suggestion that the First Amendment does not  apply to this impeachment process is completely untenable.   Ignoring the First Amendment would conflict with the Senators' oath  of office. It would also conflict with well-settled Supreme Court  precedent and ignore the intent of the Framers of the Constitution,  such as James Wilson. Above all else, ignoring the Constitution would  adopt the new Raskin ``commonsense'' doctrine we heard yesterday,  eroding hundreds of years of First Amendment protections.   We are here under the Constitution. It is illogical what the House  managers said. The Constitution does apply to this constitutional  impeachment process. It is double talk. Nonsense. Illogical.   If the House managers had their way, they would ignore all of the  Constitution. Does that include the Sixth Amendment? The right to  counsel? They would have Mr. Trump sitting here without lawyers. And  who would be next? It could be anyone--one of you or one of you.   You must reject this invitation to ignore the First Amendment. It is  anti-American and would set dangerous precedent forever.   The law has developed over the years to clearly establish elected  officials have the right to engage in protected speech. Mr. Trump is  not just a guy on the street or a guy at a bar or a fire chief or a  police officer--there were a few of them in there--all analogies given  by the House managers. These sideways analogies are wrong. Mr. Trump  was an elected official, and there is an entire body of law, Supreme  Court landmark cases, supporting the conclusion that Mr. Trump actually  has enhanced free speech rights because he is an elected official.  These cases are ignored by the House managers and the law professors,  and that, too, is total intellectual dishonesty.   The Supreme Court has long held that the First Amendment's right to  freedom of speech protects elected officials.   Two important, on-point decisions from the Supreme Court--Wood v.  Georgia and Bond v. Floyd--expressly contradict the House managers'  position. The House managers do not even cite those cases in their  brief. They barely acknowledge them in their reply, and they were mum  on them yesterday.   In Wood v. Georgia, the Supreme Court addressed the case involving a  sitting sheriff whose reelection was being investigated by a grand jury  impaneled by a judge based on allegations of irregular ``Negro bloc  voting.'' It was in the sixties.   The sheriff spoke publicly in multiple press releases calling the  grand jury investigations ``racist,'' ``illegitimate,'' and an attempt  to ``intimidate'' voters. He even urged the grand jurors on how to  decide the issues and ``not let its high office be a party to any  political attempt to intimidate'' voters. The sheriff viewed the grand  jury's challenging the legitimacy of his election.   The sheriff even sent a letter to the grand jurors with these  allegations, which is an extraordinary step since laws in most States,  including Georgia, prohibit attempts to influence or intimidate jurors.  The sheriff was charged and convicted of contempt of court and  obstruction of the grand jury. But the Supreme Court, in a decision  written by Justice Brennan, reversed. The Court held that the First  Amendment protected an elected public official's speech because the  voting controversy directly affected the sheriff's political career:         The petitioner was an elected official and had the--    Read with me, please, everybody.         The petitioner was an elected official and had the right to       enter the field of political controversy, particularly where       his political life was at stake. The role that elected       officials play in our society makes it all the more       imperative that they be allowed freely to express themselves       on matters of current public importance.    Wood thus stands for the proposition that a difference of political  opinion, expressed in speech on an issue of voting irregularity, cannot  be punishable where all that was done was to encourage investigation  and peaceful political speech--just like Mr. Trump has done here. The  legal scholars call that directly on point.   A second case, Bond v. Floyd involved a State legislature punishing  an elected official for protected political speech. Bond is  particularly instructive here, too. In Bond, the Supreme Court squarely  addressed a question of an elected official's punishment by a  legislature for statements alleged to have incited public violation of  law--the burning of draft cards. The Court unequivocally rejected the  idea--advanced here by the House managers--that an elected official is  entitled to no protection under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court  held that the Georgia House of Representatives was in fact forbidden by  the First Amendment from punishing Bond, by not seating him, for  advocating against the policy of the United States.   There are three fundamental holdings in Bond.   No. 1:         The manifest function of the First Amendment in a       representative government requires that legislators be given       the widest latitude to express their views on issues of       policy.    No. 2:         Just as erroneous statements must be protected to give       freedom of expression the breathing space it needs to       survive, so statements criticizing public policy and the       implementation of it must be similarly protected.    Third holding:         Legislators have an obligation to take positions on       controversial political questions so that their constituents       can be fully informed by them, and be better able to assess       their qualifications--    Please, read along with me--       their qualifications for office; also so they may be       represented in governmental debates by the person they have       elected to represent them.    Mr. Trump enjoys this same First Amendment protection from Congress.  The First Amendment's protections guarantee free speech addressing the  electoral integrity issues essential to his career that Mr. Trump has  consistently advocated.   The House managers argue that ``the First Amendment''--and I quote-- ``does not shield public officials who occupy sensitive policymaking  positions from adverse actions when their speech undermines important  government[al] interests.'' That is flat wrong. They are in essence  attempting to treat Mr. Trump as their employee.   This is not the law under Wood and Bond. Mr. Trump was elected by the  people. He is an elected official. The Supreme Court says elected  officials must have the right to freely engage in public speech.   Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the House managers'  argument in Wood v. Georgia, holding that the sheriff was ``not a civil  servant,'' but an elected official who had ``core'' First Amendment  rights which could not be restricted. That is Wood v. Georgia, page  395, footnote 21.   The House managers do not mention Wood or Bond in the trial brief or  anywhere else. Why? Why not? Because it does not fit their narrative or  their  [[Page S677]]  story. They want to punish Mr. Trump for engaging in constitutionally  protected free speech and they do not want you to consider the issue.  But you must.   Question 2: Does Mr. Trump's speech deserve protection under the  First Amendment?   There is no doubt Mr. Trump engaged in constitutionally protected  political speech that the House has, improperly, characterized as  ``incitement of insurrection.'' The fatal flaw of the House's arguments  is that it seeks to mete out governmental punishment--impeachment-- based on First Amendment political speech.   Speech for political purposes is th kind of activity to which the  First Amendment offers its strongest protection. These are bedrock  principles recognized by our Supreme Court for decades. The Court has  stated in no uncertain terms the importance of these principles to our  democratic principles:         The general proposition that freedom of expression upon       public questions is secured by the First Amendment has long       been settled by our decisions. The constitutional safeguard,       we have said, ``was fashioned to assure unfettered       interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and       social changes desired by the people.''    New York Times v. Sullivan.         Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough       hierarchy in the constitutional protection of speech. Core       political speech occupies the highest, most protected       position. . . .    Even political speech that may incite unlawful conduct is protected  from the reach of government punishment. The Court has said:         Every idea is an incitement, and if speech may be       suppressed whenever it might inspire someone to act       unlawfully, then there is no limit to the State's censorial       power.    The government may not prohibit speech because it increases the  chances of an unlawful act will be committed ``at some indefinite  time'' in the future. The House managers showed you a series of tweets  going all the way back to 2015 in an effort to prove ``incitement.''  All of that evidence is totally irrelevant under the constitutional  definition of incitement.   Brandenburg v. Ohio is really the landmark case on the issue of  incitement speeches. The applicable case was mentioned yesterday. In  the Brandenburg v. Ohio case, another landmark, the Court held the  government may only--the government may only--suppress speech for  advocating the use of force or a violation of law if ``such advocacy is  directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely  to incite or produce such action.''   The Brandenburg holding has been interpreted as having three basic  prongs to determine if speech meets the definition of ``incitement.''         The Brandenburg test precludes speech from being sanctioned       as incitement to a riot unless--       This is one--         the speech explicitly or implicitly encouraged use of       violence or lawless action,    Two:       the speaker intends that his speech will result in use of       violence or lawless action, and--    Three--       the imminent use of violence or lawless action is the likely       result of the speech.    The House managers cannot get past the first prong of the Brandenburg  test. They have not and cannot prove Mr. Trump explicitly or implicitly  encouraged use of violence or lawless action--period.   Brandenburg requires a close examination of the words themselves. The  words are either important or they are not. The House managers admitted  that the incitement issue is not about the words. Why not? Because on  the face of it, Mr. Trump's words are no different than the figurative  speech used by every one of the Senators assembled here today. If it is  not about the words but about the ``Big Lie'' of a ``stolen election''  then why isn't House Manager Raskin guilty, since he tried to overturn  the 2016 election? The more the House managers speak, the more  hypocrisy gets revealed--hypocrisy.   Even though they say it is not about the words, the law under  Brandenburg requires a close analysis of the words to determine  incitement. So we need to look at those words.   Mr. Trump did the opposite of advocating for lawless action--the  opposite. He expressly advocated for peaceful action at the Save  America rally. He explicitly stated--these are the words:         I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the       Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your       voices heard.    ``To peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard''--that is  how this President has spoken for years when he condemns violence,  lawlessness, and rioters.   The House managers have played manipulated, selectively edited parts  of Mr. Trump's speech. They focus heavily on the word ``fight.'' The  President used the word ``fight'' 20 times in his speech. They picked  only two. Why? Why not the other 18? Because they don't tell the story  in the way they want to tell it.   Here are all of them. Listen to the context.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. And, Rudy, you did a great job. He's got       guts. You know what? He's got guts unlike a lot of people in       the Republican Party. He's got guts. He fights. He fights.       I'll tell you.        Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That       is a tough act to follow, those two.        There's so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones.         Jim Jordan and some of these guys--they're out there       fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it's--it's       incredible.        Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in. I helped       them get elected.        Did you see the other day where Joe Biden said: I want to       get rid of the America First policy? What's that all about?       Get rid of. How do you say I want to get rid of America       First? Even if you're going to do it, don't talk about it,       right? Unbelievable what we have to go through. What we have       to go through.        And you have to get your people to fight. And if they don't       fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't       fight. You primary them. We're going to. We're going to let       you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.        Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his       hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to       be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody,       including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much       harder.        And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and       if he doesn't, that will be a, a sad day for our country,       because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution.        And the accountability says if we see somebody in there       that doesn't treat our vets well or they steal, they rob,       they do things badly, we say: Joe you're fired. Get out of       here.        Before you couldn't do that. You couldn't do that before.        So we've taken care of things. We've done things like       nobody's ever thought possible. And that's part of the reason       that many people don't like us, because we've done too much.       But we've done it quickly.        And we were going to sit home and watch a big victory, and       everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great       and now we're out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was       going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral       victory. 10 o'clock it was over.        The American people do not believe the corrupt, fake news       anymore. They have ruined their reputation. But you know, it       used to be that they'd argue with me. I'd fight. So I'd       fight, they'd fight, I'd fight, they'd fight. Pop pop. You'd       believe me, you'd believe them. Somebody comes out. You know,       they had their point of view; I had my point of view. But       you'd have an argument.        Now what they do is they go silent. It's called       suppression, and that's what happens in a Communist country.       That's what they do. They suppress. You don't fight with them       anymore unless it's a bad story. They have a little bad story       about me. They make it 10 times worse, and it's a major       headline.        But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What happened       to Hunter? Where's Hunter?        With your help over the last four years, we built the       greatest political movement in the history of our country and       nobody even challenges that.        I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the       fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say.        But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech,       and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in       history. There's never been a movement like that.        Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest       achievements, still away.        I think one of our great achievements will be election       security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how       corrupt our elections were.        And again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in       the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they       go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here,       something is really wrong, can have happened.        And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight       like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.        Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet       begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our       children, and for our beloved country.  [[Page S678]]         And I say this despite all that's happened. The best is yet       to come.    ``A boxer fighting with his hand tied behind his back''? ``Members of  Congress fighting''? ``Rudy being Rudy.'' These are the metaphorical,  rhetorical uses of the word ``fight.'' We all know that, right?   Suddenly, the word ``fight'' is off limits. Spare us the hypocrisy  and false indignation. It is a term used over and over and over again  by politicians on both sides of the aisle. And, of course, the Democrat  House Managers know that the word ``fight'' has been used figuratively  in political speech forever. But don't take it from me. It is best to  listen to them.   (Text of video presentations.)          Our mission is to fight.        Our job is to fight        We are in a fight.        We are in a fight.        We are in a fight.         We know how to fight.        We like a good fight.         The American people are going to have to fight.         We always must fight.        Mr. Buttigieg. We're in the fight of our lives.         We cannot ever give up fighting.    Hypocrisy. The reality is, Mr. Trump was not in any way, shape, or  form instructing these people to fight or to use physical violence.  What he was instructing them to do was to challenge their opponents in  primary elections, to push for sweeping election reforms, to hold Big  Tech responsible--all customary and legal ways to petition your  government for redress of grievances, which, of course, is also  protected constitutional speech.   But the House Managers don't want you to focus on those things  because, again, it does not fit their story. In the end, I leave you  with this quote from Benjamin Franklin:         Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free       government; when this support is taken away, the constitution       of a free society is dissolved, and tyranny is erected on its       ruins.    Thank you.                                    Recess
