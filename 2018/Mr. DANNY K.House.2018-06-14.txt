 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pascrell for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two documents. One is an article  from the Chicago Sun Times of today, ``A 4-Block Radius on the West  Side Is at the Heart of Chicago's Opioid Epidemic,'' and ``The Opioid  Crisis in Illinois'' by the Illinois Department of Human Services.                [From the Chicago Sun Times, June 14, 2018]   A 4-Block Radius on the West Side Is at the Heart of Chicago's Opioid                                  Epidemic                      (By Tanveer Ali and Sam Charles)         On July 15, 2016, Darwin Phillips was found dead by his       mother in the basement of the home in West Humboldt Park       where she and Phillips had lived since she bought it in 1979.        He was 50 when he died of an overdose of heroin and two       types of Fentanyl, heroin's synthetic but deadlier cousin, an       autopsy found.        ``A sweet guy'' who worked odd jobs while grappling with       mental illness and addiction and was the father of two,       Phillips had overdosed five times before his fatal OD,       according to his mother Jamie Roberts.        ``It's a disease,'' says Roberts. ``It's sad that people       take advantage of drug addicts. It still bothers me a lot. We       tried to get him help.''        Phillips' death was one of 745 in Cook County in 2016       linked to opioids, according to the Cook County medical       examiner's office. In Chicago, African-American victims like       Phillips accounted for 362 of those deaths--48 percent.        That stands in contrast to what's going on nationally.       Across the United States, white people accounted for about 78       percent of all opioid deaths in 2016, research by the Kaiser       Family Foundation found.        ``The epidemic in Chicago is not the national epidemic,''       says Amanda Brooks, chief population health officer of the       PCC Community Wellness Center, (http://www.pccwellness.org)       which focuses largely on the West Side. ``The Chicago       epidemic is affecting 45- to 65-year-old men on the West       Side.''        In 2014, there were 212 opioid-related deaths in Cook       County, 129 of them in Chicago, according to the medical       examiner's office. By 2017, Cook County had 1,150 opioid       deaths, 764 of those in Chicago.        By comparison, Chicago saw 664 homicides in 2017 (https:// chicago.suntimes.com/news/chicago-murders-homicides-2017- steep-decline/).        What's changed to cause the rise in opioid deaths? The rise       of Fentanyl, experts say.        The powerful painkiller is legally available by       prescription. But it also can easily be manufactured       illegally and typically is mixed by dealers with other       illicit, though less deadly, drugs like heroin--often without       users knowing they're taking Fentanyl.        ``Most of our patients are not intentionally taking       Fentanyl,'' Brooks says.        About 5 percent of the opioid deaths in 2014 were Fentanyl-      related, according to medical examiner data, and 67 percent       were tied to heroin.        By 2017, Fentanyl was a factor in 57 percent of opioid       deaths in Cook County, while heroin played a role in 66       percent. A combination of the two played a role in 37       percent.        While the number of opioid deaths has risen sharply       countywide since 2014, the impact largely has been felt in       areas with a lack of resources.        In 2017, Chicago Fire Department crews were dispatched to       9,158 opioid-related overdoses, records show--up 163 percent       compared to 2014. The hardest-hit parts of the city. West       Side neighborhoods like Garfield Park, West Humboldt Park,       Austin and North Lawndale.        A four-block radius roughly around Ridgeway and Augusta       alone was responsible for 1,257 calls in 2016 and 2017--about       7.2 percent of all opioid-related calls citywide during that       period.        That's the area where Phillips died.        His mother says drug dealers don't set up in the immediate       area around her home, as she and her neighbors have made it       clear that they want to keep their sidewalks crime-free. When       the weather turned warm, Roberts resumed what's become a       summer tradition for her selling snow-cones for 25 cents to       $1 outside her home.        ``This,'' Roberts says, ``is my corner.''                                   ____               [From the Illinois Department of Human Services]        The Opioid Crisis in Illinois: Data and the State's Response                        Statewide Drug overdose Trends         Nature of the Opioid Use Disorder Problem--The opioid       crisis has manifested itself in the form of multiple public       health problems. An analysis of the nature and extent of       these problems provides evidence of the seriousness of the       opioid crisis in Illinois, the widespread prevalence of these       problems across our state, and the existence of populations       and local areas with the most critical gaps in services.        Opioid Overdose Deaths--Perhaps none of these problems has       heightened the awareness of the general public to the same       degree as the recent dramatic increase in opioid overdose       deaths. Drug overdose deaths in this country nearly tripled       from 1999 to 2014. Among the 47,055 drug overdose deaths that       occurred in the U.S. in 2014, 28,647 (60.9 percent) involved       an opioid. Like many states, Illinois has recently       experienced a notable increase in drug overdose deaths that       can primarily be attributed to an increase in opioid overdose       deaths. Provisional death records data obtained from the       Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) show 2,278 drug-      related overdose deaths during 2016. This represents a 44.3       percent increase over the 1,579, drug-related overdose deaths       that were reported by IDPH for 2013. This statewide increase       in drug-related overdose deaths is almost totally accounted       for by an increase in opioid-related overdose deaths. Of the       2,278 Illinois statewide drug overdose deaths during 2016,       over 80 percent were opioid-related fatalities. The 1,826       opioid-related overdose deaths among Illinois residents that       have been provisionally reported for 2016 represents an over       70 percent increase in the number of such deaths that were       reported in 2013, and a 32.1 percent increase over the 1,382       opioid-related overdose that were reported to IDPH for 2015.  [[Page H5170]]         The maps below illustrate the number and population rates       of opioid overdose deaths across Illinois' 102 counties       during 2016. The map based on the number of opioid overdose       deaths during 2016 provides evidence that the opioid crisis       continues to impact communities and individuals throughout       Illinois. Cook County accounted for nearly 50 percent of the       opioid overdose death in Illinois during 2016. The 911 opioid       overdose deaths reported for Cook County in 2016 represented       an 87.4 percent increase from the 486 such death that were       reported for this county during 2013. Specific to the City of       Chicago, the 581 opioid overdose deaths in 2016 represented a       93 percent increase from the 301 such deaths reported in       2013. As has been the case in previous years, the counties       bordering on Cook and other counties with relatively high       resident populations, particularly Madison, Peoria, St.       Clair, and Winnebago counties, were major contributors to the       statewide number of opioid overdose deaths in 2016.        The state map based on county population rates of opioid       overdose deaths provides further insight into the locality-      specific and statewide severity of this problem in Illinois.       This map shows that several Illinois counties have resident       population rates of opioid overdose deaths that are not only       equal to, but greater than, that of Cook County. In fact,       there were 18 Illinois counties that had 2016 population       rates of opioid overdose deaths that were greater than that       of Cook County. Twelve (12) of the counties with the highest       2016 population rates of opioid overdose deaths are in IDHS       Regions 4 and 5. These two service regions have the lowest       levels of currently-available opioid use disorder (OUD)       medication assisted treatment (MAT) resources in the state.     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the STOP  Act is to address the influx of synthetic opioids arriving through  international mail. Given the growing harm to our communities from  substance abuse, I, too, want to thank and commend the Ways and Means  Committee for its hard work on developing this legislation. Especially,  I want to point out the efforts of Mr. Pascrell and Mr. Bishop.   I am strongly committed to preventing the shipments of dangerous and  illegal opioids into the United States. I support the intent of this  bill to limit illegal trafficking of drugs, and I voted in support of  this bill in the Ways and Means Committee.   However, after the last-minute changes made to this bill in the Rules  Committee, I, unfortunately, cannot support H.R. 5788. The Republican  leadership insisted on last-minute changes to impose civil penalties on  the Postal Service for any accepted shipment lacking advance electronic  data without allowing enough time to fully vet the impact of the  changes with critical stakeholders.   I am concerned about the fairness of imposing civil penalties for  individual shipments lacking electronic data when the Postal Service  lacks direct control over whether foreign postal operators provide this  data. I am concerned that having one executive branch entity impose  penalties on another would set up an adversarial relationship in  addressing illegal drug trafficking rather than a collaborative  relationship. I am also concerned that penalties are imposed based on  individual shipments rather than systematic violations.   I appreciate the work of my Democratic colleagues to mitigate the  negative effects of these civil penalties; however, due to the concerns  of the U.S. Postal Service and the postal unions about the negative  impact of these last-minute changes by Republican leadership, I cannot  support this bill at this time. I am committed to stopping the shipment  of dangerous drugs and to working to resolve these problems as this  legislation continues to move forward.   I urge that we continue to work to improve it and make it the very  best that it can be without threatening in any way the viability of  postal operations.                                time  1245
