 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Riverside Community  College District Trustee Tracey Vackar for her esteemed service to  public education throughout California's 41st Congressional District.   Trustee Vackar embodies steadfast commitment to Riverside Community  College students, helping them realize and achieve the American Dream  through education.   Tracey is the immediate past president of the RCCD board and was  elected by her out-of-district peers to serve on the California  Community College Trustees Board, a massive indication of her  leadership. With over two decades of working in the Moreno Valley  Unified School District, and in my colleague Pete Aguilar's neighboring  district with Fontana Unified School District, Tracey's dedication to  students spans the Inland Empire.   Tracey deeply understands the critical role that our community  colleges play in creating workforce training opportunities to expand  middle-class families' pathway toward college degrees.   With her unparalleled passion for service, Tracey is an exemplary  role model for Inland Empire students. She will be missed on the board,  but I wish her best of luck on her next journey.                            ____________________
