 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Carter for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who represents the great University of  Georgia, it is nice to see him pick up the football and run with this  thing. My friend is also right. I have spent my private life, over 30- plus years, in one of the most regulated and taxed industries that  there are in this country. So, yes, it is very near and dear to my  heart.   I want to thank the gentleman also for leading on a Georgia original  bill which originated with Congressman John Linder.   The IRS was weaponized early on in the Obama administration, and the  only thing that came out of that, the result of that, was Lois Lerner  being found in contempt of Congress, and then we saw the issue go away.   Now the Biden administration, with the addition of 87,000 IRS agents,  has a new target: the middle class and small businesses.    It is time for a new tax system that works for all Americans. So  today I rise in support of H.R. 25, the FairTax Act.   Our tax system is in desperate need of reform, and this bill will let  Americans keep their hard-earned paychecks and get rid of the IRS.   The FairTax Act will eliminate payroll and income taxes and greatly  reduce compliance costs on small businesses by replacing all of these  with a consumption tax on new goods and services.   The current tax system is purposely complicated, burdensome, and  confusing so only the well-navigated can navigate the loopholes.   So why wouldn't we want to make it simpler and more understandable so  small businesses and workers can thrive?   From my first day in Congress, I have been focused on making the  Federal Government more transparent and accountable to the American  taxpayer. The FairTax Act does just that. Every time Americans buy a  product or service, they will know exactly how much they will pay in  taxes and will be able to factor that into their decisions. There will  be no more complex and expensive end-of-the-year Federal tax filings.   The only way big legislation is passed in this town is when the  American people demand it. The way we get them on board is we need to  hold hearings across this country to explain the ideas and the details  of the FairTax Act. We need to discuss and debate the bill publicly so  that the Americans can consider this proposal. Once they hear about it  though, I am confident that they will support the concept of the  FairTax Act.   Let's get to work.                                time  1815
