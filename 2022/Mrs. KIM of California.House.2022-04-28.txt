 Mr. Speaker,   I rise to recognize the participants and winners of the 2021  Congressional App Challenge. This is the largest App Challenge to date.   The App Challenge gives students of all backgrounds and from  communities across the Nation the opportunity to move from passive  consumers of technology to active creators of technology.  [[Page H4585]]    Coding and technological skills will only become more important in  the economy of the future. These students blew us away by creating apps  that would make a difference, tackling real-world challenges and  reflecting their commitment to making our world a better place.   I thank and offer my congratulations to all the students that  participated this year, and I wish every single one of them the best of  luck in their future endeavors.                            ____________________
