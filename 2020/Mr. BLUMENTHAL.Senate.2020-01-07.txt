 Madam President, I rise today with a heavy  heart to pay tribute to Robert ``Red'' McKinney, an outstanding friend  and public servant. Sadly, Mr. McKinney passed away on December 24,  2019, at the age of 72. He will be remembered for his devotion to East  Hampton and his bright, loving nature.   Born in Hartford, CT, Red spent his entire life in East Hampton. He  earned his higher education degrees in the State, as well, with an  associate's degree from Mitchell College and a bachelor's degree from  Central Connecticut State University. Red spent five decades as a  chemical specialist, focused in metal working fluids. For 40 years, he  and his wife, Anne, co-owned a commercial and residential property  acquisition and management company, HTA, LLC.   Outside of his work, Red dedicated himself to supporting his  community. Giving back to those around him brought Red an unparalleled  joy, dating back to his role as a member of East Hampton Parks and  Recreation in the 1970s. He was the youngest member of the East Hampton  Board of Selectmen ever elected and proudly served for 4 years.  Notably, Red also served as chairman of the East Hampton Democratic  Town Committee for 10 years and remained a member for his entire life  since 1974.   That same year, he joined the East Hampton Rotary Club, making him  the longest tenured member. His impressive level of involvement is also  evident through his over four-decade-long role as a charter member of  the Old Home Days Association. The association coordinates the annual  East Hampton Old Home Day parade--a signature celebratory tradition  attended by hundreds of people. As a regular participant in the parade,  I saw firsthand the professionalism and dedication that Red brought to  that event. He was always a joy to talk with.   Red was especially pleased to have the opportunity to celebrate the  people  [[Page S55]]  of his town and surrounding communities. He treasured the residents of  East Hampton the same way he valued his close friends and family.   Through his active role in these organizations and many others,  including the Middle Haddam Library and Middlesex Hospital, Red  positively impacted countless members of his community. His commitment  to supporting those around him was recognized through three Paul Harris  Fellow Awards and numerous other honors.   Red's remarkable legacy of service is an inspiration to all of us and  sets a model of service that will continue in East Hampton for years to  come.   My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Red's family  during this difficult time, particularly to his wife, Anne, along with  their children and grandchildren. May their many wonderful memories of  Red provide them solace and comfort.                            ____________________
