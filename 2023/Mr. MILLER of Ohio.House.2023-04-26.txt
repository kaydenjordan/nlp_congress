 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize World War  II veteran Robert Rothenberg, an American hero from Ohio. Robert was a  landing ship motor machinist's mate 2nd class on the USS La Moure  County (LST-883).   Robert sailed the Western Pacific, from the Marshalls and the  Marianas to battle-torn Okinawa.   After discharging the men and equipment on Okinawa, Robert traveled  with the 6th Marine Division to Pearl Harbor.   After Japan surrendered, his ship delivered occupying troops to that  country.   Despite his service in the war, Robert was never presented with any  of the service medals and decorations he earned for his courage and  sacrifice to our Nation. I am so pleased that we recently were able to  finally present him with the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic- Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.   I thank Robert for his service. Let us never forget the service and  sacrifice of America's Greatest Generation.                            ____________________
