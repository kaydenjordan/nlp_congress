 Madam Speaker, President Biden's reckless  agenda is sending our Nation hurdling towards a recession.   The President wants people to believe 40-year high inflation is  someone else's fault. But his solution to this crisis highlights his  complicity in driving up the cost of everything, from gas to groceries.   One of President Biden's solutions to rising energy costs is begging  foreign countries to pump more oil. This is the same President who is  waging a regulatory assault on U.S. energy production. His  administration has sold nearly 1 million barrels of oil from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a Chinese energy company.   It is unbelievable. I am coauthoring an amendment to block the  administration from ever doing this again.   As a fighter for working families, I will keep doing everything I can  to hold the administration accountable for driving inflation to the  highest level in 40 years.                            ____________________
