 Mr. President, the most important item on the Senate's  to-do list before the end of the year is a bipartisan emergency relief  package for a nation suffering the worst month of the COVID-19  pandemic.   Negotiations continue between a bipartisan group of Senate and House  Members who, last week, agreed in principle on a $900-plus billion  emergency relief proposal. As the details continue to get sorted,  Speaker Pelosi and I have encouraged everyone to use this bipartisan  proposal as a framework for negotiations.   Yesterday, the White House presented us an offer of similar size,  around $900 billion--an encouraging sign that Republican leadership is  moving in the right direction by endorsing the size of the Gang of 8's  bill. But the President's proposal must not be allowed to supersede or  obstruct the bipartisan congressional talks that are underway. That is  where the real action is and where bipartisan agreement on the basic  concepts will ultimately be forged.   The President's proposal, for instance, completely misses the mark on  unemployment benefits and aid to American families. In order to include  $600 stimulus checks, it actually cuts proposed unemployment benefits  by greater than a factor of 4, from $180 billion to just $40 billion-- an unacceptably low amount--while tens of millions of Americans remain  out of work, almost all of whom have lost their jobs because of COVID.   Economists from every end of the spectrum, including the conservative  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are warning us that the United States faces  the prospect of a double-dip recession without another round of  emergency fiscal stimulus. A robust unemployment benefit is crucial-- crucial--to that program. Earlier in the pandemic, it helped keep 12  million Americans out of poverty and propped up consumer spending. We  shouldn't be cutting unemployment benefits now, as the President's team  proposes; we should be extending them.   Now, the Republican leader, as usual, gave a very angry speech this  morning accusing Democrats of all manner of things, including  intentionally blocking aid to thwart President Trump. I don't know what  evidence he has of that, but there are actual reports--honest-to-God  reports--in the New York Times and the Washington Post that Leader  McConnell was warning the White House not to cut a deal on COVID relief  before the election.   Here is the Washington Post: ``McConnell warns White House against  making stimulus deal as Pelosi and Mnuchin inch closer.'' That is from  October 20--2 weeks before the election.   Meanwhile, Democrats have continually lowered our proposals, now by  over $2 trillion, to move closer to our Republican colleagues in the  spirit of compromise and for the sake of getting something done for the  American people. It would do a whole lot of good if the Republican  leader would drop the daily tirades and diatribes, which seem to be  based in some alternative reality, and join the rest of the Senate in  urging the bipartisan negotiations now underway to continue.   Families all over the country are nearing a point of desperation,  unable to put food on the table, a roof over their children's heads. By  January, nearly 12 million renters will owe an average of nearly $6,000  in back rent and utilities--a shocking figure.   We need to deliver an emergency relief package to keep American  families, workers, and businesses afloat until the crisis finally  begins to subside. The only way to get that done is in a bipartisan  fashion. The sooner the Republican leader realizes it, the better.                       Biden Administration Nominations    Mr. President, on Biden nominations--President-Elect Biden continues  to roll out an impressive slate of Secretaries-designate to lead  Cabinet agencies in his administration.   Yesterday, he selected Lloyd Austin to be the next Secretary of  Defense, another groundbreaking selection. Mr. Austin would be the  first African-American to lead the largest Cabinet agency in our  government. Secretary-designate Austin is a familiar face to many of us  on Capitol Hill, and I am also pleased to say he is a familiar face to  many in the North Country in New York. He is the former commander of  the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum--the pride of Jefferson County.   Like all of President-Elect Biden's national security nominees,  Senate-designate Austin is deeply experienced and familiar with our  Nation's national security, as well as the many issues that face our  servicemembers and their families each and every day. Lloyd Austin  served our Nation for more than four decades, and his willingness to  serve his country again is admirable. He will make an excellent  Secretary of Defense.   Now, an hour ago, I met with President-Elect Biden's economic team by  teleconference, including Secretary-designate of Treasury, Janet  Yellen, to discuss priorities with the incoming administration on how  to get our economy back on track. I urged them, once President-Elect  Biden becomes President, to go bold. Austerity right now is not what  America needs but a bold program to stimulate our economy and get  things moving, to help get people jobs--good-paying jobs--because our  economy is suffering. I look forward to our continued conversations.   A few weeks ago, I predicted that we would see some crocodile tears  from the Republican majority about Biden's Cabinet nominees, but I  didn't think it would occur this fast. It began when several Republican  Senators raised some objections over Neera Tanden's Twitter feed. After  4 years of pretending that they ``didn't see'' President Trump's latest  online outburst, it seems that Senate Republicans have rediscovered  their Twitter passwords now that Joe Biden is the President-elect.   This week, after President-Elect Biden announced that Xavier Becerra  is his pick to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services,  Republican Senators raised concerns, in their minds, about Mr.  Becerra's qualifications. The senior Senator from Texas said:   [[Page S7296]]              I'm not sure what his Health and Human Services credentials       are. It's not like Alex Azar who used to work for pharma.    With all due respect to the senior Senator from Texas, working for  the pharmaceutical industry is not the only way to get experience in  healthcare. Some might argue it is the wrong kind of experience for an  HHS Secretary.   The truth is, Xavier Becerra is eminently qualified. He worked in the  House of Representatives for two decades, always very involved in  advancing the healthcare of his constituents, and he has a particularly  long track record as an advocate of women's health. As the attorney  general of California, he became one of the foremost legal experts on  our Nation's healthcare laws.   I must say, it is particularly rich for this Republican majority to  raise ``concerns'' about whether Biden Cabinet nominees have every last  pristine qualification for their posts. Not so long ago, nearly every  Republican in this Chamber lined up to make an oil executive the  Secretary of State. I don't remember too many Republican ``concerns''  when President Trump nominated a retired neurosurgeon to be the  Secretary of HUD or when he put Rick Perry in charge of the Department  of Energy--an agency he wanted to abolish before learning it maintained  the Nation's nuclear stockpile and that he would be in charge of it. If  memory serves, this Senate Republican majority confirmed a Secretary of  Education whose only qualification for the job was she used her  inherited fortune to try to privatize American schooling.   Look, the country needs to move on from the past 4 years, but Senate  Republicans can't pretend like it never happened. After the sordid  caliber of nominees that this Republican majority confirmed over the  past 4 years, it will be impossible to take these complaints about  Biden's nominees very seriously.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, sadly, I return to the floor today to say  farewell to another Member who will conclude his time in the Senate at  the end of the term, the junior Senator from Alabama, Doug Jones.   We all know Doug came to the Senate as a storied courtroom lawyer and  U.S. attorney, but fewer people know about his more humble origins.  Doug was born and raised in Fairfield, AL, just outside of Birmingham,  the son of a steelworker, the grandson of a coal miner. When he was 19  years old, he spent his summer working at the local cotton tie mill, 10  hours a day, 6 days a week.   One day, a freak accident sent a bit of shrapnel flying his way, and  he came within inches of losing an eye. Several stitches later, Doug  went right back to work--early evidence of a stubborn streak. Only at  the end of the summer did Doug decide it was time to focus a bit more  on his studies.   That same work ethic--the sometimes stubborn work ethic--followed him  his entire life. He brought it next to law school. On the one occasion  Doug decided to skip class, it wasn't to throw a pigskin around the  quad or engage in some extracurricular activity with friends. No, Doug  skipped class to attend the trial of the Klansman ringleader of the  1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, a tragedy that had  shaken the conscience of a nation.   A young Doug Jones was moved by the disposition of justice in that  trial, but he was left with the impression that other members of the  conspiracy had escaped the reach of the law. Only a scriptwriter could  have imagined that 24 years later, that law school truant would become  the U.S. attorney in Alabama and that his office would uncover the  evidence to bring charges against two more Klan members involved in the  bombing, and that 40 years after that awful crime, Doug Jones would win  the conviction of the remaining conspirators, delivering a long-delayed  yet righteous justice.   History would repeat itself a few years later, when Doug would again  find himself at the center of events. Doug was eating breakfast one day  just blocks away from the scene of the bombing of the All Women Health  Clinic. He took charge that day and made sure that investigators and  first responders worked together in perfect unison. Doug would later go  on to secure the indictment of Eric Rudolph, the perpetrator of that  heinous bombing, as well as the Olympic Park bombing 2 years later.   Of course, not every one of Doug's cases involved matters of life and  death. The U.S. attorney's office once prosecuted local officials for  trying to steal an election by bribing absentee voters with cash, beer,  and a little liquor for good measure. Now, if only the defendants had  known about Doug's affinity for bourbon.   Kidding aside, kidding aside, those years revealed for Doug something  profound about public service and government: You can have the best  laws in the world in principle, but it takes dedicated effort to make  the law work for everyone in practice, to take our ideals of justice  and equality and fairness and opportunity and make them real in the  everyday lives of citizens.   Doug brought that revelation with him to this Chamber. He worked with  his trademark determination to finally repeal the widow's tax. He  helped pass legislation to permanently fund historically Black colleges  and universities. He has worked across the aisle to combat veteran  suicide, strengthen the VA, and support our military bases--so  important to the great State of Alabama.   Not every issue would be so easy or so bipartisan, especially for a  new Senator facing a difficult reelection, but every time Doug  approached a politically sensitive vote--and I marveled at this--he was  untroubled. He would do what he always did: He would act on principle.  He would vote his conscience--politics be damned. President Kennedy had  a phrase for Senators whose abiding loyalty to their conscience  triumphed over all personal and political considerations. He called  them profiles in courage. Doug Jones is a profile in courage for our  times.   But before I get carried away with too many grand compliments, it is  important to remind colleagues that Doug Jones, as a human being, is  just a joy to be around. Just ask his good friend, the Senator from  Montana. More than once Doug would catch Senator Tester giving an  impassioned  [[Page S7302]]  speech on the floor and think to himself: I will bet you he didn't turn  his phone off. Let me give him a ring and see what happens.   (Laughter.)   Just look at Doug's office, festooned with memorabilia of every  particular: Crimson Tide footballs and keepsakes from his favorite  bands. You can go see his rocking chair--one of those southern-veranda,  sweet-tea-drinking chairs--and baseballs signed by Presidents,  statesmen, and most impressively to this Yankee fan, Joe DiMaggio.   If Doug Jones has one hobby besides hunting, it is autograph hunting.  He has managed to collect a signature on a baseball from every Senator  in this Chamber today, including its newest Member. The junior Senator  from Arizona was sworn in only a week ago, but 5 seconds after he  lifted his hand from that Bible, there was Doug to congratulate him,  furnishing a clean baseball, ready for Mr. Kelly's John Hancock.   That is Doug Jones--someone who never let the immense pressure of  this job change who he is, someone who has made life a joy for everyone  in our caucus, and someone who understands that, at the end of the day,  we get sent to this Chamber to make life better for our constituents,  to do it courageously even when the odds are not in our favor.   I will end with one final story. Several years ago, Doug was asked to  participate in a stage adaptation of his favorite work of fiction, ``To  Kill a Mockingbird,'' which, of course, includes his literary icon,  another great Alabama lawyer, Atticus Finch.   Hearing Doug's life story, you would be forgiven for thinking it was  ripped from the pages of that Harper Lee classic, so perhaps it was  fate that one day Doug would be asked to play a part in that story.  There was just one hiccup: Doug was asked to play the judge. So he  never got to deliver that passage, shortly after the death of Mrs.  Dubose, when Atticus explains to his son that real courage is not a man  with a gun in his hand; ``[real courage is] when you know you're licked  before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter  what. You rarely win, but sometimes''--sometimes--``you do.''   Doug spent his time in the Senate--indeed, his whole life--embodying  the courage that Atticus describes. The story of the 16th Street  bombings is a reminder of the fact that even against tremendous evil  and seemingly impossible odds, if you are dogged and determined and see  it through no matter what, sometimes you do win and justice prevails.   So while Doug didn't get to play Atticus Finch that weekend at the  Virginia Samford Theater in Birmingham, that is OK. It was already the  role of his lifetime.   Doug has said that it is the greatest honor of his life to fill the  seat of his mentor, Senator Howell Heflin.   Doug, you upheld the honor of that seat, and you have set an example  for every Senator who will follow in it.   Whatever the next chapter of your life may bring, the entire Senate  Democratic family wishes you and your family the very, very best and  politely requests that you do not call us when we are in the middle of  giving a speech.   (Laughter.)   I yield to my friend, the very distinguished and wonderful,  wonderful, wonderful junior Senator from the great State of Alabama.
