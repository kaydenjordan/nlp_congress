 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 1-year  anniversary of the Atlanta spa shootings.   Across our country, the Asian-American community has been under  attack because of misinformation and xenophobia that wrongly blamed  them for the COVID-19 pandemic.   On March 16, 2021, 1 year ago, in Atlanta, eight innocent people, six  of whom were women of Asian descent, were senselessly murdered. The  victims of this attack included mothers and grandmothers, fathers and  sons, teachers, and veterans. These are lives that cannot be restored,  leaving pain that cannot be forgotten.   These attacks in Georgia were a wake-up call for the public to the  reality the Asian-American community is facing each and every day.   Acts of violence like these demonstrate why we must always call out  bigotry and hate whenever or wherever we see it. We must all speak out  against it.   I would like to thank CAPAC Chair Judy Chu for her leadership on this  issue and encourage my colleagues to continue to speak out as we stand  together with the Asian-American community.                            ____________________
