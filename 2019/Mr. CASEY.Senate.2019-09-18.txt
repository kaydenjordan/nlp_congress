 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about  healthcare. I will not have long remarks, but I do want to highlight a  report that was just issued last week. The report I am holding is from  the Census Bureau. The report is entitled ``Health Insurance Coverage  in the United States: 2018,'' by the U.S. Census Bureau, dated  September of 2019.   On page 2, this fairly lengthy report, which goes on for about 29 or  30 pages, has the general comparison in healthcare coverage of  uninsured numbers--those without insurance in 2017 versus 2018. This is  what it says on page 2 of the report under ``Highlights'':         In 2018, 8.5 percent of people, or 27.5 million, did not       have health insurance at any point during the year. The       uninsured rate and number of uninsured increased from 2017       (7.9 percent or 25.6 million).    And then it refers to a figure and a table.   Basically, what is outlined is a drop in the number of Americans  covered. Looking at it another way, there was an increase in the number  of uninsured from 25.6 million Americans to 27.5 million Americans--a  difference of 1.9 million. Just for general reference, I will round  that off to say that roughly 2 million people who had insurance in 2017  were uninsured in 2018. That is deeply troubling because the number of  uninsured is up, not just generally from 2017 to 2018 but more broadly.  It is a change in the trend lines where we have been for most of the  last decade.    I think it is pretty clear that the Trump administration's sabotage  of health insurance is, indeed, working. It is reversing coverage gains  that were made under the Affordable Care Act in the years after  enactment and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We are told,  as well, that the number of uninsured children is up, so more children  were without insurance from 2017 to 2018.   Here is what one observer, whose name is Phil Galewitz, from the  Kaiser Health News said: ``For the first time in a decade, the number  of Americans without health insurance has risen--by about 2 million  people in 2018--according to the annual U.S. Census Bureau report  released Tuesday.''   That was Tuesday of last week. He goes on to cite the numbers that I  just cited.   Here is another comment from Katie Keith from Health Affairs:         Coverage losses are expected to continue in 2019. This is       due to a number of factors, including repeal of the       individual mandate penalty, the expanded availability of non-      ACA plans, and the final ``public charge'' rule.    She goes on from there.   These are people who spend their lives on the issue of healthcare.   A third commentator, Joan Alker, from Georgetown University Center  for Children and Families said: ``As a result, 4.3 million kids were  uninsured in 2018--a statistically significant increase of 425,000.''   Another commentator who follows healthcare, Matt Broaddus, from the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said:         [T]oday's Census data provide the clearest evidence yet       that Trump Administration efforts to weaken health coverage       under the  [[Page S5569]]       ACA are taking a toll. They include canceling most federal       outreach efforts for the open enrollment period for 2018       marketplace coverage, supporting new state policies that make       it harder for people to enroll or stay enrolled in Medicaid,       issuing rules to expand short-term and association health       plans . . . and creating public confusion about the ACA's       future by refusing to defend its constitutionality in a       lawsuit by Republican state officials.    Then I turn to the last reference by groups that follow this  information. I will just hold up this chart. This is a chart by the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This chart depicts where we  have been over the decade and where we could be at the end of the  decade on healthcare. This is a reference to the uninsured rate for  nonelderly Americans. That number was over 17 percent in 2009. So 17.2  percent of Americans were uninsured at that time. The chart says it  then fell each year, especially after the Affordable Care Act's major  coverage provisions took effect in 2014. You see it starting in 2009,  and then you see the big drop. Of course, that big drop of uninsured is  good news. When that chart depicts the number going down, that is  obviously good news.   Then you see the Trump administration sabotage has begun eroding this  progress. You see it flattening out. Now, instead of a continual  diminution or decline in the uninsured number, you see kind of a  flattening out of that. Then you factor in the census report, which  documents at least for 1 year an increase in the number of uninsured.  Then the last part of the chart says: ``If the administration gets the  courts to strike down the ACA, the uninsured rate would almost  double.''   It goes all the way up to 18.7 in 2019. Of course, the last part of  the chart is a projection. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  is asserting that if a lawsuit is successful in the Fifth Circuit Court  of Appeals, which we know was successful at the district court level  and is now on appeal--if they are successful, this think tank, the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says that in 2019, the number  of uninsured could go up to 18.7 percent, surpassing where we were in  2009, when we started to pass and then implement the Affordable Care  Act, reducing substantially the number of people who were uninsured.   If you look at it this way, roughly over 6 years, the uninsured  number went from about 47 million Americans down to about 27 million  Americans. Twenty million-plus people gained insurance coverage in  about 6 years--not even a decade.   The concern I have is that efforts undertaken by the administration,  unfortunately, are seen as successful, according to the Census Bureau  numbers, because the number of uninsured is going up at a time we want  the number to go down. When you add in the lawsuit, which, in my  judgment, is more likely to succeed than not--I don't want it to  succeed; I want it to fail because I think it is an insult to declare  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act unconstitutional,  therefore destroying protections for more than 100 million Americans  and ripping away coverage from so many Americans that the number of  uninsured would skyrocket. Why would we ever go back to the days when  the number of uninsured was that high and potentially growing? Why  would we ever take any step--whether there is a lawsuit or whether it  is sabotage or whatever--to drive up the number of uninsured?   Let me conclude with a couple of headlines. The front page of the New  York Times, dated September 11, 2019 reads: ``Fewer Insured After  Attacks On Health Act.'' If you go to the inside of the paper, on page  A15 there is a longer headline that says: ``Fewer Are Insured Amid  Administration's Attacks On Health Act.''   The Wall Street Journal--a newspaper, when I last checked, that was  not necessarily supportive of the Affordable Care Act, editorially-- dated September 11, page 83, reads: ``Insured Rate Logs First Drop in a  Decade.'' That means the number of uninsured is getting larger.   I would say in conclusion that we need to sound the alarm about the  threat to healthcare, sound the alarm about the threat to a growing  number of uninsured Americans. This is not even factoring in the  lawsuit, which, as the chart depicts, would make the uninsured number  skyrocket. It wouldn't go up by 1.9 million or a percentage point or  two; it would go up exponentially higher.   I hope that Members of this body in both parties not only would be  concerned about these trends and concerned about what would could  happen if the lawsuit were successful but also would take action to  prevent this dark result from playing out for the American people  because the number of uninsured would explode instead of continuing to  go down where Americans want it to go. We want the number of uninsured  to go down. We certainly want the number of uninsured children to go  down.   I yield the floor.
