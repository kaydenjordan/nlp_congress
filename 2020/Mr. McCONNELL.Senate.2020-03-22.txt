 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Senators have now spent days engaged in  vigorous bipartisan discussions among ourselves and with the  administration.   Earlier today, I hosted a productive meeting in my office with the  Democratic leader, the Speaker of the House, the House Republican  leader, and the Secretary of the Treasury. These intense conversations  have built a piece of legislation that is as bold and as big as the  American people deserve and as thoroughly bipartisan as our process  demands.   Now what we need to do is to move forward. This national crisis is  not going to wait around if Congress slips back into conventional  politics or haggles endlessly over the finer points.   Every day, more Americans' jobs are disappearing or coming ever  closer to the brink. Every day, more small businesses are faced with  hard decisions that could change local communities, literally, forever.  Every day, major American companies that employ countless people are  seeing their commerce crushed by their own government for the sake of  public health. Every day, doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals  will keep reporting to work and treating patients, whether or not  Congress has their back.  [[Page S1894]]    The risks to our country grow every single day that we do not act.  The needs of hospitals and healthcare providers grow every day that we  do not act.   That is why we have worked around the clock to craft a major  bipartisan relief package. That is why we are going to hold our first  procedural vote in just a few minutes. It is so that we can keep moving  forward, because this virus is not going to wait for politics as usual.   These past few days have brought unity and bipartisan energy here to  the Senate. I think Members on both sides agree that it has been very  encouraging.   Since Senate Republicans released our initial framework to give some  structure to these discussions, both sides have worked hard to create  something that can pass the Senate, pass the House, and be signed into  law by the President.   The bipartisan product delivers strongly on each of the core  priorities we identified at the outset. It puts urgently needed cash in  the hands of American workers and families. It delivers historic and  rapid relief to small businesses so they can make payroll and keep  people employed. It helps stabilize key industries to avoid layoffs  wherever possible and preserve the greatest economy in the world for  when we come out on the other side of this. And, of course, it sends a  massive--massive--new infusion of resources to the frontlines of the  medical response.   That is what we have to do: inject a significant amount of money as  quickly as possible into households, small businesses, key sectors, and  our Nation's hospitals and health centers.   This bill would do that, and it would do it fast. The comprise  product also contains many ideas that our Democratic colleagues brought  to the table. It balances the administration's focus on sending direct  cash to Americans as quickly as possible with our Democratic  colleagues' focus on bolstering State unemployment insurance programs.  It places conditions which our Democratic colleagues have sought on the  loans that would flow to major businesses, conditions which the  President has also endorsed. And both parties have made sure to keep  strengthening the resources that will be pushed out to the frontlines.   The bill includes $75 billion in a new fund for hospitals and health  providers, and more than three-quarters of the funds in the  appropriations section--nearly $200 billion--will not stay in  Washington but will go straight to State and local priorities.   So what we have is a comprise product which contains ideas,  contributions, and priorities from both sides and which can become law  as soon as tomorrow--as soon as tomorrow. In other words, it is just  about time to take yes for an answer.   We are now at a point which every American who has ever negotiated  anything would recognize, whether they have purchased a home, bought a  car, or negotiated for their small business. We are at the point where  both sides have come a long way toward each other, and each side has to  decide whether to continue elbowing and arguing over the last several  inches and risk the whole thing or whether to shake hands and get it  done.   Thus far, throughout this crisis, the Senate has risen to the  occasion. It was just a few days ago when the Senate Republican  majority moved expeditiously to pass the House Democrats' phase 2  legislation, even though many of my colleagues on this side of the  aisle and I had serious reservations and would have written it very  differently. We passed it anyway. It was basically written on the House  side. Nevertheless, as I just said, I pushed the Speaker's legislation  through the Senate because urgency and results matter during a national  crisis; because, imperfections notwithstanding, it was the right thing  to do for our country.   So, look--look--I hope and anticipate that a similar degree of  bipartisanship and urgency will be reciprocated now. I understand the  Speaker said following our meeting this morning that she may simply  give up on these bipartisan talks and begin writing her own separate  bill. Perhaps that is related to the remarks of one of her senior House  Democratic leaders who reportedly told colleagues a few days ago:  ``This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our  vision.''   `` . . . a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our  vision.''   Well, I sincerely hope that nobody actually views this crisis in such  a cynical manner. This is not a political opportunity. It is a national  emergency. That is why we have engaged in days of bipartisan talks to  get to this point. It is why it is time to move forward.   Americans don't need to see us haggling endlessly. They don't need us  to jeopardize all the progress we have made over the past several days  for the sake of some eleventh-hour brinkmanship. The American people  need an outcome, and they need it tomorrow. They need us to vote to  advance this legislation today and pass it tomorrow.   As I said yesterday, Congress should take inspiration from our own  constituents. We should be inspired by our own constituents. Look at  what they are doing. Even during this pandemic, the American people are  showing the world the soul of our country.   In my home State of Kentucky, the official motto is ``United we  stand, divided we fall.'' And every day I hear about new ways  Kentuckians are standing united, even if they have to stand 6 feet  apart.   I recently heard about a resident of Campbell County in Northern  Kentucky named Debbie Buckley. In her day job, Debbie works for the  local government, but recently she heard about some students at a  nearby university who were still living in the dorms even though in- person classes have been canceled. Some had to remain in the area for  work. Others were international students who couldn't get home. Their  situations were completely uncertain.   The local shelves were not fully stocked, so Debbie decided to do  something. She put out a call for help, and Kentuckians answered the  call. Churches, restaurants, and neighbors all pitched in with food and  supplies. Debbie drove all over Northern Kentucky collecting those  donations and then delivering them to these young people.   She has found everything a college student could need: canned goods,  microwaveable meals, and even Airheads candy, which I am proud to say  are made right there in Kentucky.   There are so many stories like this pouring in from all over our  country. Americans are stepping up to the plate. Americans realize this  is no time for selfishness and no time for division but a time for  solidarity, generosity, and, yes, courage.   Americans are rising to the occasion. The Senate must do the same.  Let's move this legislation forward this afternoon, as the last few  discussions begin to wind down, and then let's get this done tomorrow.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to  H.R. 748 occur at 6 p.m.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, colleagues, as everyone now knows,  the coronavirus has arrived here in the Senate. There are at least five  Senators who are in self-quarantine at the moment.   The discussions continue on the package that we have been working on,  on a bipartisan basis, over the last 2 days. It is time to move  forward, and the next step is the vote we are going to have at 6  o'clock. No one is disadvantaged by having that vote because, by  getting cloture on the shell that we are having the vote on, there is  time--what we call postcloture time--after that vote. So it doesn't  interfere with any further discussions that are going on, on a  bipartisan basis.   We need to signal to the public that we are ready to get this job  done, and the way to do that is to vote aye in 5 minutes on cloture on  the motion to proceed.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, the American people are watching this  spectacle. I am told the futures market is down 5 percent. I am also  told that is when trading stops. So the notion that we have time to  play games here with the American economy and the American people is  utterly absurd.   I want to explain what just happened. Our good friends on the other  side would not have been disadvantaged one bit if this vote had  succeeded because it would have required potentially 30 more hours of  discussion, during which these seemingly endless negotiations could go  on as long as they would like.   Now, the buildup to this, so everybody fully understands, is that we  had a high level of bipartisanship in five different working groups  over the last 48 hours, where Members who were participating were  reaching agreement.   Then, all of a sudden, the Democratic leader and the Speaker of the  House  [[Page S1902]]  show up, and we are back to square one.   We are fiddling here--fiddling with the emotions of the American  people, fiddling with the markets, fiddling with our healthcare. The  American people expect us to act tomorrow, and I want everybody to  fully understand that if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it will be  because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when  the country expects us to come together and address this problem.   Now, I changed my vote, which gives me the opportunity to move to  reconsider at a later time. That is all I can do in the face of this  obstruction.   Look, I can understand obstruction when you are trying to achieve  something. This obstruction achieves nothing--nothing whatsoever--other  than preventing us from getting into a position where there are  literally 30 more hours that they could use to continue to dicker.   So at a time when the country is crying out for bipartisanship and  cooperation, and we saw that over the last 48 hours when regular  Members of the Senate, not in the leadership office, not in the  Speaker's office--for goodness' sake, she is the Speaker of the House,  not the speaker of the Senate; we don't have one--we were doing just  fine until that intervention.   So I want the American people to fully understand what is going on  here. The markets are already reacting to this outrageous nonsense. We  have an obligation to the American people to deal with this emergency  and to deal with it tomorrow, and if we don't, I want everybody to  fully understand, you have seen everybody who is on record.   Now, I have conspicuously avoided trying to turn this into any kind  of partisan effort for 2 days, but it is pretty clear what is going on  here.   We will have this cloture vote again at some point of my choosing,  and, hopefully, some adults will show up on the other side of the room  and understand the gravity of the situation and the need to act before  the markets go down further and the American people become even more  depressed about our lack of ability to come together under the most  extraordinary circumstances. We have never been confronted with  anything like this before. It is totally different, and we are not  immune to it in terms of the public health risk. Coronavirus has hit  the Senate today as well. We have five Members--five Members--in self- quarantine.   Everybody understands the emergency, particularly when it hits close  to home. It is not just back in our States, but right here in the  Senate.   So I will say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Step  up. Step up. Help us reach an agreement so that we can do what needs to  be done for the American people no later than tomorrow.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, well, here we are, the eyes of the  Nation are on the Senate, but, tonight, Senate Democrats blocked  coronavirus relief from moving forward.   Republican and Democratic Senators just spent days collaborating in a  bipartisan way with these working groups that we set up. Democratic  ideas were incorporated, major changes were made at their request, but,  today, the Speaker of the House, is back in town after taking a week  off, and poured cold water on the whole bipartisan process.   Incredibly, what we witnessed a few hours ago is Senate Democrats  voting to filibuster the bipartisan package that they helped craft over  the last two days. It wasn't even a vote on final passage. It was  simply a vote to limit further debate, after which there would have  been 30 more hours to continue to negotiate if they wanted to drag this  out endlessly. After that, of course, the futures market tanked in  anticipation of an ugly tomorrow based upon an absence of the  bipartisan agreement we have been seeking.   They voted to block, specifically, surge resources for hospitals, a  massive expansion in unemployment benefits, historic relief for small  businesses to prevent mass layoffs, direct checks for millions of  Americans, and expanding healthcare workers' access to the masks that  they need. Even if Democrats reverse course tomorrow--tomorrow--the  vote they cast today will almost certainly cause more Americans to lose  their jobs and more seniors'  [[Page S1914]]  hard-earned retirement savings to literally evaporate.   Our Nation cannot afford the game of chicken. We can't afford the  cynical partisanship that one senior House Democrat owned up to just  the other day. Here is what he said: ``This is a tremendous opportunity  to restructure things to fit our vision.''   It is an unconscionable statement to view this as a partisan  opportunity. This is a national emergency, not a partisan opportunity.  Doctors, nurses, small business employees, laid-off Americans, and  vulnerable seniors need our help right now.   So here is the way ahead, colleagues. We are going to vote at 9:45 in  the morning--the same vote we had at 6 o'clock tonight. We are going to  vote at 9:45 in the morning, 15 minutes after the markets open, and see  whether there is a change of heart. That vote will occur, unless we can  finally reach an agreement sometime between now and then. I just want  all of our colleagues to know when our next vote will be in the absence  of an agreement--9:45 in the morning, 15 minutes after the markets  open.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9 a.m., Monday,  March 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to  H.R. 748.    Madam President, as I have said repeatedly and as, I  think, all 100 of us know, we had a good bipartisan bill that was  developed on a bipartisan basis with Members in the Senate, over the  last 48 hours, until the Democratic leader and the Speaker of the House  decided to blow it all up and play Russian roulette with the markets.  The futures market is dramatically down, going into tomorrow. The Asian  markets, I suspect--I haven't checked--are probably rattled by all of  this.   Nothing would have been lost by allowing us to get on the bill  because they could have used 30 more hours--not that they should have  but they could have used 30 more hours--to continue to negotiate. But,  alas, every single one of them has been on record as preventing us from  taking the next step toward getting the agreement the American people  are waiting and waiting and waiting for us to get.   The result of what the Democratic leader just did was to prevent us  from voting right after the markets open in the morning and will allow  the markets to be rattled until 12 noon, further evidence of the  reckless behavior we have witnessed on the Democratic side in the  Senate over the last hours.                      ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 23, 2020     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Monday,  March 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to  H.R. 748.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 11:39 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, March 23, 2020, at 12 noon.
