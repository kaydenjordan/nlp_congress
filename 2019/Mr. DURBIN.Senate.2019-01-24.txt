 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and  Democratic leader Senator Schumer for making clear what is going to  happen on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. We have a chance, an  opportunity when 100 Senators come to the floor, to put an end to the  government shutdown this afternoon. I want to tell you, there is  nothing more important than that, as far as I am concerned. I hope we  will rise to that occasion and rise to that challenge.   During the last 2 days, what I have done is travel across my home  State of Illinois and sit down and meet on an informal basis with  Federal employees who are going through this government shutdown. In  the last couple of weeks I have been to Peoria, Pekin, Aurora, Marion,  and I went to St. Louis, though it is clearly not in Illinois, to meet  with air traffic controllers who live in my State. I sat down and asked  them tell me the stories, to tell me what has happened in the 34 days  when they haven't been paid--34 days, as of today. They were a little  embarrassed and a little reluctant to talk about what it meant.   Eventually, I said ``Well, tell me about some of your coworkers,''  which is usually a way that people can tell their own stories without  embarrassment. I heard some stories that are breaking my heart as I  stand here at this moment.   Have you ever been in an air traffic control tower? It is amazing. I  have seen some of the biggest. We had one up in Elgin, IL, which takes  care of O'Hare and Midway and all of our great airports. It is a little  bit frightening to go into one of these towers and see 10, 20, 30 air  traffic controllers looking at these screens. On those screens are  little dots, and each one of the dots is an airplane, and in each one  of the airplanes there are going to be 20, 30, 40, 150, 200 people.  That air traffic controller has an awesome responsibility to make sure  that they are on the right path for takeoff and landing, to make sure  that their paths don't cross. A mistake in that job can be fatal. That  is the reality of what they face.    Air traffic controllers have one of the most stressful jobs in the  Federal Government. We don't think about it. We get on the plane; we  get off the plane. Thank goodness for those men and women who are there  to make sure it is a safe experience for all of us.   Do you know that the shifts that are worked by air traffic  controllers are 10-hour shifts? How would you like to face a 10-hour  shift with that kind of stress every single day you go to work? Do you  know how many days a week they work? Six. Six out of seven days they  are working 10-hour shifts in one of the most stressful jobs we have in  America. Do you wonder why they work 6 days? Most people work 5 days,  and they certainly don't work 10-hour shifts. It is because there is a  shortage of air traffic controllers. At age 56, you have to leave.  Literally, you have to leave as of the next day. You cannot continue to  work because they decided that at age 57, you are too old to do this  job. It is too stressful.   As these air traffic controllers are leaving, we are hoping, in a  system that works, they are being replaced by new air traffic  controllers who are skilled and trained so they can take over these  important, life-and-death jobs.   Do you know what happened because the government shut down? We  stopped the input of new air traffic controllers, so the number is  continuing to diminish because of mandatory retirement, and the  pressure on those air traffic controllers increases. It increases not  just because of fewer numbers; it increases because of what we have  done to their lives.   These men and women are totally innocent when it comes to our debate  about border security. They had absolutely nothing to do with the  President's promise of a grand and glorious wall from sea to shining  sea, paid for by the Mexicans. They didn't make that up; the President  did. Now he has called for a government shutdown until his campaign  promise is fulfilled.   I talked to some of those air traffic controllers. What is it like?  What are you facing? They went through a long litany of things they are  facing. Many of them are struggling because of no paycheck coming in.  It is difficult for them. A couple of them were embarrassed to say that  they are going to food pantries set up by churches and charities in  their hometown to pick up some groceries to feed their families during  this government shutdown. Others talked to me about children in their  families with serious medical problems. Yes, they continue to get their  health insurance as Federal employees, but there are copays they have  to pay out-of-pocket. They worry about making those payments now that  they are not getting a regular paycheck, and they can't see any end in  sight as to when they will.  [[Page S544]]    A couple of them have some very practical issues. One of them went to  one of his coworkers, who is the head of the local union for those air  traffic controllers, and he said: I want to tell you something in  confidence. I have 5 days left here. I cannot continue to come to work  beyond 5 days. I drive a long distance. I have to buy gasoline for my  car. I have to find another job. I may have to drive an Uber car. That  is what some Federal employees are doing. I may have to find some job  tending bar--which some Federal employees are doing--just so there is  income coming in for my family.   The worst one was in St. Louis, where this woman air traffic  controller said: One of my colleagues here at air traffic control  confided in me that he has to drive a long distance to get to work in  St. Louis. He buys a lot of gasoline each day to make that roundtrip.  To buy gasoline last week, he went and sold plasma from his own body to  get the cash to buy the gas. That is the reality of this government  shutdown.   All of us asked these air traffic controllers: Do you see any  evidence on the job that people aren't doing the job as they are  supposed to?   No, we have an awesome, life-or-death responsibility here, and we  take it seriously. But they quickly added: Senator, if this continues  and people are not replaced, we are going to reach a point where we  have to keep the system safe. To keep it safe, the distance between  aircraft flying into and out of airports will have to be increased and  the intervals between aircraft will have to be increased so there is  always a safe atmosphere when it comes to our airports.   What happens when that interval and distance are increased? Your  flight is late again. Mine was about an hour and a half late leaving  O'Hare last night. We asked why. A member of the crew was coming in on  an international flight. She had to go through Customs. Customs has  been reduced in number to two people at St. Louis because of the  government shutdown, so it took her an extra hour to join up with the  flight I was on. It was a minor inconvenience for me but maybe a major  inconvenience for some other passenger.   It is an indication of what happens when all these men and women who  are behind the scenes keeping our air control system working are under  pressure and when there are fewer of them than there should be doing  their job. It reflects what happens when we don't have enough people in  the Customs section at international airports to process people in a  timely way. The system slows down.   Why are we at this point? Did the air traffic controllers need to be  punished for something? If they did, I don't know what it might be.  They are good men and women. They are trained in such a fashion that  very few people could actually do their job. It is interesting. I have  been down to Oklahoma City and places where they have been trained.  Everybody doesn't cut it. You have to be pretty darn sharp to be able  to keep track of all those aircraft and to not buckle under pressure  because it is a pressure-filled job. President Trump's shutdown has  added pressure to that job. Does it make you feel safer when you get on  an airplane to know that? I don't. I worry about it. I worry about  those men and women who simply want to do what they were hired to do.    Incidentally, about one-third of them are veterans. They served our  country--many of them in the Air Force--and they took the skills they  learned in the military and brought them into air traffic control.   We give a lot of speeches on the floor here, Republicans and  Democrats, about how we want to honor our veterans. How can we be  honoring our veterans when 800,000 Federal employees have gone without  pay for 34 days, and between 25 and 35 percent of them, depending on  the Agency, are veterans? Are we honoring our veterans by not paying  them in a timely fashion?   The first bill we have today is President Trump's bill in dealing  with this crisis. It will deal with the shutdown he created, but it  also addresses several other problems which the President made a  decision on and we are trying to fix. I want to address one of them in  particular because it is an issue I have worked on for a long time;  that is, the fate of people known as Dreamers, those who are protected  by DACA.   These are people who were brought to the United States as children,  some of them as infants and babies. They grew up in this country  believing this was home. They went to school here. They prepared for a  future life. At some point, usually in their teenage years, their  parents brought them in and said: We never filed the papers for you.  You are undocumented in America. Through no fault of their own, they  were brought to this country, grew up here, and they learned some time  in high school that there is no future for them in America.   I have met so many of them over the years, these Dreamers. I appealed  to President Obama: Do something to help them. And he did. He created  the DACA Program. The DACA Program allows these young people I just  described to apply for protection for 2 years at a time--protection  from being deported from America--and to be allowed to work legally in  America. Almost 800,000 came forward across the Nation and signed up  for this protection under President Obama. These are amazing young  people. They are tomorrow's doctors and engineers and lawyers and  teachers and leaders. They are incredible young people. I have met so  many of them. All they are asking for is a chance to be part of  America's future.   President Trump came in September of 2017 and announced he was  abolishing this program, abolishing the DACA Program, which meant that  these young people had no protection for the future and really didn't  know which way to turn. President Trump challenged us to come up with  legislation to solve the problem he created. We were unable to do so.  We couldn't reach an agreement. The President's bill, his own solution  to the problem, came before the Senate and received 39 votes. It didn't  even receive the support of his own political party when he brought it  up. It just wasn't a reasonable approach.   The President said last weekend: I am going to address the fate of  DACA and Dreamers as part of this effort to end the stalemate in  Washington.   My hopes were raised. He talked about a bill that I had introduced  with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, 2 years ago  called the BRIDGE Act and said that is what we are going to do. It  sounded hopeful. Maybe this would be part of the solution. For these  young people, it meant everything that they might have a chance to be  able to stay in this country and not be deported.   It turns out that when the President produced this bill a couple of  days ago and we read the text, it was a bitter disappointment. It  really bears no resemblance to the BRIDGE Act, which he referred to.   I would say to my colleagues in the Senate who are considering voting  for the President's bill: Please don't vote for it if you think you  will be doing something to help DACA and the Dreamers. This bill, as  written by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen  Nielsen, and Mr. Miller, who is the President's adviser at the White  House, shows their barely masked contempt for these young people. They  have dramatically increased the costs of going through this process-- doubled it. They have set in new conditions so they can eliminate more  and more people from being eligible for this protection. They added  provisions that are totally unnecessary. During the 7 years DACA has  been in place, we have seen positive things happen, not negative  things. Unfortunately, what the President proposes now is a dramatic  step backward. This does not help.   After meeting with air traffic controllers and Federal prison guards  at Federal penitentiaries in Marion and Pekin, I can tell you what they  want. They want the shutdown to end today. They want to get a paycheck  for their families so they can get back to the business of being good  husbands, good fathers, and good members of their community. They are  embarrassed about going to these food pantries. They can't imagine what  they are going to do because of some problems that have been created  with their credit ratings because this President has shut down their  paychecks for 34 days.   These prison guards and air traffic controllers don't have any choice  but to come to work. They are called essential personnel. I would hope  at the end  [[Page S545]]  of this day that we would think of them first and make sure the  shutdown ends immediately, today.   One other thing. This needs to be the last time we have this  conversation on the floor of the Senate--the last time. We have to make  government shutdowns an unacceptable tactic of either political party  or any branch of our government. It is absolutely terrible that these  innocent people who work for our government are paying the price of our  inability to reach a political agreement on issues. We can find an  agreement on border security, but it shouldn't be because 800,000  innocent Federal employees haven't received a paycheck for 34 days.   Let's step forward and do this in a bipartisan fashion. Over this  last weekend, I received scores of phone calls from my colleagues in  the Senate. Some people may find it hard to believe, but Republicans  have called, and I have called them, and Democrats have called. There  is a bipartisan feeling that this crisis--this manufactured crisis--has  to come to an end.   The second vote that will be offered today--the one the Democrats  will offer--is simply to extend the continuing resolution to fund our  government, end the shutdown immediately, and give us a matter of days  to get this job done in coming to a compromise on border security. I  know we can do it. I am convinced we can do it. I know there is a  feeling of good will, but we need enough Republicans to join with the  Democrats to make this a bipartisan effort today.   I don't believe the President's bill is going to pass. There are  aspects to it that I described that are unacceptable to so many of us.  But this bare-bones approach--a 3-week extension; a number of days to  actually bargain and compromise while the government is up and running  and people are being paid--is a reasonable end to this.   I don't know how any of us can go home if, at the end of the day, we  have done nothing and the shutdown continues. Let's stick here and do  our job--the job we were elected to do to solve problems, not to create  them.   As Senator Schumer said earlier, there are so many individuals who  are providing security and safety across our Nation. Whether it is our  FBI, our prison guards, the Coast Guard, the air traffic controllers-- why in the world would we endanger any Americans because of our  inability to reach a political agreement? The votes today will give us  a chance to emerge from this with a positive approach to solving this  problem. I believe we can do it. The sooner the better.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Ms. Rosen) is  necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 88, nays 8, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 8 Leg.]                                  YEAS--88       Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blackburn      Blumenthal      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Duckworth      Durbin      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Gardner      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Harris      Hassan      Hawley      Heinrich      Hirono      Hyde-Smith      Isakson      Johnson      Jones      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McConnell      McSally      Menendez      Merkley      Moran  [[Page S549]]        Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Perdue      Peters      Portman      Reed      Roberts      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sanders      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shaheen      Shelby      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--8       Alexander      Booker      Cotton      Enzi      Hoeven      Kennedy      Lee      Toomey                               NOT VOTING--4       Inhofe      Paul      Risch      Rosen   The motion was agreed to.
