 Mr. Chairman, I simply associate myself with  the remarks of Mr. Nadler. I think he explained the history of this law  very, very well.   It is a very basic principle. People who work on these cruise ships  should be compensated and taken care of if they are injured. There is  no reason that the cruise line industry cannot afford to do this.   To discriminate against people who happen to be from different  countries who are working on these ships makes no sense whatsoever. Our  laws apply to whoever is working on the ships and should continue to do  so. This is simply an effort to deny workers' rights from a cruise line  industry that can more than afford to take care of the people who work  there.   These are not easy jobs. I confess, I have only taken one cruise in  my life, but the people who work there work very long hours, very hard,  in very difficult conditions. If they are injured or sick, they should  be taken care of. As Mr. Nadler said, the best way to do that is under  the current common practice, which is the cruise line does take care of  them and makes sure they get the healthcare they need until they are  able to work. But if that is not done, the right to sue in court to  protect your rights as a worker should not be taken away.   I do not believe that we have a problem in this country that workers  are being too highly compensated and have too many rights. We don't  need to take away the few that they have.   I urge opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy), a member of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).                                time  0945     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), a member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I don't have any speakers  either, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this bill. I want to begin by  thanking the chairman and all of the members of the committee. As has  been noted many times, this is the most bipartisan committee in  Congress; and I think, once again, even in difficult circumstances, we  have proved that this year. That is, in large part, due to the  leadership of Chairman Thornberry. I thank him for that.   I also thank our staff, which does an unbelievable job. There are  hundreds, if not thousands of amendments, that come at them. They  manage that. You see the very few that actually come through either in  committee or on the floor. They work through literally thousands of  ideas and do an amazing job, so I really want to thank our staff for  their great work.   In particular, I want to thank Vickie Plunkett. This will be her last  markup. She is retiring. She has done a fabulous job for our staff. She  basically exemplifies everything I just said about how great our staff  is, how they work in a bipartisan manner and do a great job to serve  our country. So, I thank Vickie for her incredible service to our  committee and to the country.   Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good bill that we should support  because, make no mistake about it, what the chairman and many others  have said is true: we face a complex threat environment. The U.S.  national security is at risk.   I take Mr. Nolan from Minnesota's point that spending a lot of money  on wars that we didn't need to engage in does cost us at home, and that  point is valid, but so is the point that we face threats we must  confront.   North Korea is testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is no  doubt that their goal is to develop a nuclear missile, capable of  striking the U.S.   Being from the West Coast--and they always say that it could hit  Seattle. I don't know why they don't talk about any other city on the  West Coast. It could hit a lot of different places. We need to be  worried about that. We need to be prepared to stop that.   Russia continues to undermine not just our elections, but democracy  itself, across Europe, and even down in the Middle East and Africa. We  need to be prepared to confront that.   We face a terrorist threat. 9/11 killed 3,000 people in this country  because we weren't ready to prevent it. The groups that supported that  attack have not gone away; they have metastasized.   Now, I will completely agree with some of my friends on the left, who  think that the terrorism threat is often overblown. I think it is often  also a mistake to demonize the Muslim religion. And even though I know  some people don't do that, they simply want to confront groups like al- Qaida and ISIS, Steve Bannon, who works right next to the White House,  has said that Islam is a totalitarian ideology of subjugation, it is  not a religion. He thinks all Muslims are a threat.   To the extent that we adopt a national security policy that views the  world that way, we make the problem worse. That is what ISIS wants;  that is what al-Qaida wants. They want a clash of civilizations. We  should not want that. They have killed more Muslims than any other  religion on Earth. Muslims have the biggest stake in this. We must work  with them, not against them, to confront that terrorist threat that  ISIS and al-Qaida and others present.   On the broader budget issue, as I mentioned a couple of times, the  first 6 months of this year, we had a number  [[Page H5859]]  of folks in the Pentagon come over and spell out all kinds of nightmare  scenarios about every bad thing that could conceivably happen--some of  ones that I mentioned, and hundreds of others that I haven't. And I  understand that. That is their job. Their job is to worry about what  could come at us.    But, past a certain point, that isn't helpful. We need a plan, we  need a strategy to confront this, and we need to make choices. That is  the one thing that I am still concerned about with this bill. It really  doesn't make choices. It continues to spend money in a variety of  different places, without a recognition of finite resources and choices  that need to be made about how to confront the threats that are most  dangerous to us--how to spend that money in the best way possible. That  is something that I think we need to work on going forward.   We also have the budget problem that I described. And I won't give  the same full speech that I gave before, but I will simplify it and say  that there is a consensus in Congress and in the country that we need  to balance the budget without raising taxes and without cutting any  programs that people might like. That doesn't work. It simply is not  possible. It doesn't add up.   That is why we don't have a budget resolution. Any budget resolution  that the Republican Congress could put on the floor will fail to meet  some of the promises that they, and others, have made. We have got to  be honest about that, because this bill, again, is $72 billion over the  budget caps. It is actually $91 billion over the budget caps, if you  add in--well, sorry, $81 billion over the budget caps, if you add in  the money that we took from OCO to put into the base.   So, if we do not raise the budget caps, this goes away and leaves us,  once again, in the land of uncertainty for the Department of Defense.  We have to make choices on the budget going forward so that we don't  leave the Defense Department in the lurch, not knowing how much money  that they are going to have. So, we still don't have a budget  resolution in front of us.   And, lastly, I do want to point out that the rest of the budget does  matter. The chairman and I have had a little bit of an argument about  this: we are the Armed Services Committee, we should pay attention to  that; you know, don't sacrifice our troops for the sake of domestic--he  always says political priorities. That is the one word in his argument  that I find not really appropriate.   There is nothing political about it. It is a policy choice. It is  basically deciding what domestic priorities are important.   And, make no mistake about it, the discretionary budget is a zero-sum  game. I mentioned yesterday the President's budget: a $54 billion plus- up for defense, and $54 billion cut from nondefense discretionary. So  don't tell me that one thing doesn't have anything to do with the  other.   But even the so-called budget resolution, the budget agreement that  the House Republicans have come up with, but have not yet dared to put  to a vote, has a $72 billion plus-up for defense, and a $5 billion cut  for domestic spending. So, again, the two are absolutely connected.   What are we talking about with domestic spending? I won't go through  all of it. I will just mention a couple of things.   Yesterday, I mentioned our infrastructure. Bridges are collapsing all  across the country. I saw a big story yesterday about how the Memorial  Bridge is about to fall down. We have incredible infrastructure needs  that lead to the strength of our country that are connected, just like  national defense is to the strength of this Nation.   But another example, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center--it  is close to my district, it is in Seattle--is doing incredible research  right now, that figured out how to not use chemotherapy but actually go  in, take out the white blood cells that aren't working, get them to  work, and send them back in to successfully fight cancer. This has  worked for blood cancers. They just started studies on lung cancer.  But, basically, we could cure cancer, without going through the hell of  chemo. The President's budget would cut Fred Hutchinson's funding by  over two-thirds.   I don't think curing cancer is a political agenda. That is a very  real need that has an incredible impact on the lives of Americans, just  like national security. It is like making sure that North Korea doesn't  hit us with a nuclear weapon, making sure that terrorist groups don't  attack us. Curing cancer, stopping bridges from collapsing, these are  priorities.                                time  1015    Because we are not making budget choices, these are priorities that  get pushed aside. And if you plus-up defense and take it from  nondefense discretionary, then you are having that very real impact.   Now, I am not going to say it has to be dollar for dollar. I think it  probably should be, but we can negotiate around that. But to simply gut  the nondefense discretionary budget to plus-up defense does not make  this country safer.   We heard yesterday, hey, in a time of war, you make domestic  sacrifices. And we have all read about World War II, all the domestic  sacrifices that were made at that time. I get that.   But you know what else you do in a time of war? Well, you don't cut  taxes. You raise them. Prior to 2001, we had never gone to war without  raising taxes or issuing war bonds or, basically, asking for more  money. But that, of course, we cannot do.   Again, I will say I care enough about the national security of this  country, I would raise taxes to pay for it instead of simply adding to  the deficit or stopping the ability of somebody like the Fred  Hutchinson Cancer Research Center from finding a cure for cancer. That  is the choice that I would make. These choices are not being made in  this budget resolution, and I think that places us at risk.   Lastly, the nondefense discretionary budget is the State Department,  it is USAID, it is the Department of Homeland Security. If you are  going to have a national security strategy, it can't just be the  military. And you know who will tell you that more often than anybody?  The military. They don't want to bear the entire burden.   General Secretary Mattis had the best quote on this. If you are going  to cut diplomacy, if you are going to cut development, you better give  me four more divisions because that is how many more wars I am going to  have to fight.   So to say we are going to add all this money to defense, and defense  is so important, and if you are against it because of other priorities,  then you just don't care about the troops, is incredibly disingenuous  because all of these other things matter to the national security of  this country. And all we are getting out of the majority right now is  an effort to plus-up defense at the expense of everything else.   I say an effort because they haven't actually voted on it yet. It  hasn't actually happened. And it is more likely than not that this  bill--good, though, it is--and the great work that has been done on a  number of different policy divisions that don't have anything to do  with the money, the good work on acquisition reform to try to make sure  we get more for the money that we spend, all of that is in jeopardy  because this bill has at least $72 billion in it over the budget caps  that is, more likely than not, not going to be there come October 1 or  the end of this year.   So if we don't make the choices on the budget that reflect the  priorities of the entire country, that actually reflect the budget  numbers, then we are doing a disservice to the men and women who serve  our country.   It is a good bill. It is going to be better once we figure out the  budget issues and actually start making the choices that are necessary  to make us stronger in every aspect of society.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
