 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 150th  anniversary of the Town of Frenchville, ME. As one who was born and  raised in Aroostook County, I am honored to celebrate the generations  of industrious and caring people who have made Frenchville such a  wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.   The story of Frenchville begins long before its incorporation in  1869. For thousands of years, the St. John River Valley has been the  home of the Maliseet Tribe. French explorers, led by Samuel de  Champlain, first visited the area in 1604 and established friendly  relationships with the Native Americans. In the late 1700s, French- speaking Canadians began settling in the area, and the Maliseets often  provided vital assistance during the first difficult winters. These  settlements laid the foundation for the vibrant Acadian culture that is  so important in Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and as far away as  Louisiana.   The Acadian settlers created a prosperous community. They planted  crops, established lumber and grain mills, and built schools, churches,  and thriving general stores. Later in the 19th century, the people of  Frenchville joined their neighboring towns in connecting their remote  region to the world with their own hands. Town by town, they built  roads and railroads with pick, shovel, and wheelbarrow. These  transportation networks, combined with rich soil. made the region an  agricultural center, and the potato industry remains an essential part  of the economy.   The town was incorporated in 1869 as Dickeyville, in honor of Major  William Dickey, an early civic and political leader in the region. Two  years later, the name was changed to Frenchville to recognize the  language and origins of its original settlers. Today, 80 percent of the  town's residents speak French, and they continue to uphold the Acadian  traditions of great food, music, and dance, and of close-knit families  and lasting friendships.   (English translation of the statement made in French is as follows:)   To my Franco-American friends, it is a pleasure to congratulate you  on this landmark anniversary. Across the generations, you have worked  hard and worked together to create a community that combines your rich  heritage with the values that define our State and our Nation.   While the people of Frenchville cherish their fascinating history,  they build for the future. Last year, the Dr. Levesque Elementary  School was named a 2018 National Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing  School, marking the second time this outstanding school received that  prestigious recognition. For nearly 50 years, Frenchville and  neighboring communities have joined hands to make the Northern  Aroostook Regional Airport an invaluable transportation link between  the St. John Valley and the world. In addition to the airport's  important role in economic development, the volunteer pilots of the  Patient Airlift Service provide a crucial lifeline to people needing  advanced medical treatment.   The celebration of Frenchville's 150th anniversary is not merely  about the passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We  celebrate the people who pulled together, cared for one another, and  built a great community. Thanks to those who came before, Frenchville,  ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to those there today, it has a  bright future.                            ____________________
