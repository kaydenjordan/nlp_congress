 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patriotic  Employer Protection Act. I am proud of this bipartisan legislation that  encourages small business owners to hire military reservists.   Military reservists bravely serve America and are also members of our  Nation's small business workforce. In east Tennessee and throughout  America, small business owners rely on the abilities and skills of  reservists. When an employee is activated from the Reserves to answer  the call of duty, small businesses should not struggle while that  employee is absent.   This legislation improves small businesses' access to Military  Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loans and Repayment Deferral for  Active Duty Reservists. These programs offer financial support to small  businesses that lose valuable production when a reservist is activated  for military service.   By improving access to these programs, small businesses can continue  to operate while an employee is serving in the military. Additionally,  it gives small businesses peace of mind that their businesses will not  suffer in the absence of military reservists.   It takes courage to put your livelihood and career on hold to serve  our country, and small businesses should be proud of their employees'  military commitments.   Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor to champion this legislation with  Representative Kim, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
