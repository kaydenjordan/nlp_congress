 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, migrants in Customs and Border Protection holding  facilities deserve to be treated with compassion and respect.  Unfortunately, due to the misguided policies of the Trump  administration, many migrants have found themselves stuck living in  inhumane conditions.   Earlier this month, I visited one of those facilities in McAllen,  Texas, and I was disturbed by what I saw.   I am proud of my colleague, Congressman Raul Ruiz, and the Judiciary  Committee and the leadership of Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for putting  together a comprehensive piece of legislation that will alleviate the  suffering of some of these migrants.   My amendment is very simple. It directs the Department of Homeland  Security's Office of Inspector General to pay particular attention to  whether CBP facilities comply with the Department of Homeland  Security's sexual abuse prevention policies while inspecting detention  facilities.   Many provisions in DHS' standards to prevent, detect, and respond to  sexual abuse and assault are very well intentioned. These include  requiring sexual abuse prevention training for staff, limiting cross- gender searches, ensuring there are plans in place to respond to sexual  violence, and providing survivors of sexual abuse with access to sexual  assault nurse examiners.   These policies should help reduce the prevalence of sexual violence,  enable victims to report abuse, and provide support for survivors after  experiencing trauma. But I am concerned that Customs and Border  Protection is not meeting DHS' own standards.   An Office of Inspector General report from 2016 recommended that DHS  identify which facilities qualify for routine auditing and ensure that  these facilities are audited by July 2018, as required by DHS' own  policies.   Today, nearly 1 year after CBP was supposed to complete these audits,  they have not finished the job. If Customs and Border Protection is not  taking this basic step of auditing facilities, we cannot be sure they  have properly implemented more onerous, yet crucial, policies. The best  plans to prevent sexual violence are worthless if they are not  followed.   This amendment, which I thank my colleagues, Representative Moore and  Representative Cisneros for cosponsoring, will help provide clarity  about whether CBP is taking steps to prevent and respond to sexual  violence.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Chair, could I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman  for agreeing to the amendment.   I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Brave survivors have begun to come forward detailing chilling  assaults by Border Protection agents. Some of the survivors are only in  their teens.   Despite these heartbreaking stories, there is a stunning lack of  transparency about sexual abuse at Customs and Border Protection  facilities.   According to the agency's most recent report on assessing sexual  abuse at holding facilities, in fiscal year 2017, CBP processed more  than 534,000 individuals in its holding facilities, and yet the agency  itself only received seven claims of sexual abuse.   Ten months after FY18, CBP has yet to release its report on abuse  last year. From my own experience working on sexual violence prevention  on college campuses and in the military, I have learned that the  absence of formal complaints of sexual abuse does not reflect the  absence of sexual violence but, rather, signals a culture that prevents  people from reporting violence.   According to a Freedom of Information Act request, between January of  2010 and July of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security Office of  Inspector General received 624 complaints about sexual abuse at Customs  and Border Protection facilities.   Considering this information, CBP's failure to promptly publish its  own sexual abuse data, and the stories of survivors who have come  forward, there is a clear need to improve transparency about sexual  abuse at CBP.   My amendment, which I was proud to introduce with Representatives  Moore and Cisneros, directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, working  with the DHS office that typically receives complaints of sexual abuse,  to release all complaints of sexual abuse at CBP once per quarter,  removing any information that would compromise the anonymity of  survivors.   This is an amendment that all Members should be able to support.  Releasing more data in a timely manner will help lawmakers grasp the  scope of this problem. Knowing that they are not alone may also  encourage other survivors to step forward.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, contrary to the allegations  by my colleague disparaging our view of Customs and Border Protection  agencies, I was actually very impressed by the professionalism of many  of the Border Patrol agents that we met and had the opportunity to tour  the facilities in McAllen and Brownsville with.   I share the gentleman's commitment to a zero-tolerance policy.  Frankly, one incident of sexual assault is far too much. This data will  provide more transparency for Congress and for survivors and, frankly,  more transparency for those members of the Border Patrol who are doing  their job with respect to migrants.   Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.
