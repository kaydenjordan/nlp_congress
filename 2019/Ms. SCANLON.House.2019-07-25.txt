 Mr. Speaker, a few months ago, my office launched a  Congressional Youth Cabinet, a yearlong opportunity for students in  Pennsylvania's Fifth District to share their ideas  [[Page H7444]]  on how to solve the most pressing issues facing young Americans while  learning more about the policymaking process and how Congress works.   I want to take a moment to acknowledge the students who applied and  will be participating in our PA-5 Youth Cabinet this year.   Those students are: Augustin Aliaga, Maayan Barsade, Jade Bennett,  Lucas Bennett, Lauren Block, Harry Cotter, Kieran DiasLalcaca, Annelise  DiClemente, Jack DiPrimo, Gabriel Donahue, Ethan Donnelly, Christian  Dormer, Grace Dougherty, Atreya Ghosh, Gwen Greene, Wali Hamid, Jahmiel  Jackson, Channing Jackson, Paige Kieft, Kathleen Lac, Katherine  Lanzalotto, Ryan Lynch, Luke Mandel, Aidan McGahey, Mya McKeown, Grace  McNelis, Brenna Montgomery, Johanna Murphy, June Park, Mira Patel,  Gwendolyn Pfister, Richard Quiah, Fiona Rae, Sarah Rossi, Joseph  Shapiro, and Vince Vento.   I look forward to working with and learning from these incredible  young people.                            ____________________
