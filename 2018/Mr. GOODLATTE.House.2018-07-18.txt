 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 990) supporting the officers and personnel who  carry out the important mission of the United States Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 990         Whereas the national security interests of the United       States are dependent on the brave men and women who enforce       our Nation's immigration laws;        Whereas abolishing United States Immigration and Customs       Enforcement (ICE) would mean open borders because it would       eliminate the main agency responsible for removing people who       enter or remain in our country illegally;        Whereas calls to abolish ICE are an insult to these heroic       law enforcement officers who make sacrifices every day to       secure our borders, enforce our laws, and protect our safety       and security;        Whereas abolishing ICE would allow dangerous criminal       aliens, including violent and ruthless members of the MS-13       gang, to remain in American communities;        Whereas during fiscal year 2017, ICE Enforcement and       Removal Operations (ERO) arrested more than 127,000 aliens       with criminal convictions or charges;        Whereas ICE ERO made 5,225 administrative arrests of       suspected gang members in fiscal year 2017;        Whereas criminal aliens arrested by ICE ERO in fiscal year       2017 were responsible for more than--        (1) 76,000 dangerous drug offenses;        (2) 48,000 assault offenses;        (3) 11,000 weapon offenses;        (4) 5,000 sexual assault offenses;        (5) 2,000 kidnapping offenses; and        (6) 1,800 homicide offenses;        Whereas ICE Homeland Security Investigations made 4,818       gang-related arrests in fiscal year 2017;        Whereas ICE identified or rescued 904 sexually exploited       children;        Whereas ICE identified or rescued 518 victims of human       trafficking;        Whereas abolishing ICE would mean that countless illegal       aliens who could pose a threat to public safety would be       allowed to roam free instead of being removed from American       soil;        Whereas abolishing ICE would mean more dangerous illegal       drugs flowing into our communities, causing more Americans to       needlessly suffer;        Whereas ICE plays a critical role in combatting the drug       crisis facing our Nation;        Whereas ICE seized more than 980,000 pounds of narcotics in       fiscal year 2017, including thousands of pounds of the deadly       drugs fueling the opioid crisis;        Whereas ICE seized 2,370 pounds of fentanyl and 6,967       pounds of heroin in fiscal year 2017;        Whereas ICE logged nearly 90,000 investigative hours       directed toward fentanyl in fiscal year 2017;        Whereas abolishing ICE would leave these drugs in our       communities to cause more devastation;        Whereas abolishing ICE would mean eliminating the agency       that deports aliens that pose a terrorist threat to the       United States;        Whereas ICE was created in 2003 to better protect national       security and public safety after the 9/11 terrorists       exploited immigration laws to gain entry into the United       States;        Whereas the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks found       that many of the 9/11 hijackers committed visa violations;        Whereas ICE identifies dangerous individuals before they       enter our country and locates them as they violate our       immigration laws; and        Whereas abolishing ICE would enable the hundreds of       thousands of foreign nationals who illegally overstay their       visa each year to remain in the United States indefinitely:       Now, therefore, be it  [[Page H6487]]         Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses its continued support for all United States       Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and       personnel who carry out the important mission of ICE;        (2) denounces calls for the abolishment of ICE; and        (3) supports the efforts of all Federal agencies, State law       enforcement, and military personnel who bring law and order       to our Nation's borders.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H. Res. 990, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H. Res. 990 introduced by Clay  Higgins to express our support for the men and women of the U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   Recently, Democrats nationwide, from the mayor of New York City to  Senators Gillibrand and Warren, have recklessly called for the  abolishment of ICE, the agency within the Department of Homeland  Security charged with enforcing Federal immigration laws within our  Nation's interior.   They have used rhetoric that is both bewildering and deeply  troubling. New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon has gone so  far as to call ICE a ``terrorist organization.'' The Democratic  candidate for the 14th Congressional District of New York just  yesterday stated: ``We have to occupy all of it. We need to occupy  every airport. We need to occupy every border. We need to occupy every  ICE office. . . . ''   What is remarkable is that these calls would undo what has been our  singular bipartisan achievement on immigration over the last two  decades--the creation of ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.   The late Barbara Jordan was one of the most distinguished persons  ever to serve in this body. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of  Freedom and NAACP's highest honor, the Spingarn Medal for highest and  noblest achievement by a living African American. She was appointed by  President Clinton to be chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration  Reform. Her commission found that:         Immigration law enforcement requires staffing, training,       resources, and a work culture that differs from what is       required for effective adjudication of immigration benefits.       Separating enforcement and benefits functions will lead to       more effective enforcement.        The commission is particularly concerned that although the       removal system produced more than 100,000 final removal       orders each year, the system did not have the corresponding       capacity to remove the individuals subject to those orders.    It noted that:         The system is bogged down with increasing numbers of aliens       who are put into removal proceedings, released due to a lack       of detention space, and never appear at their hearings, or       are never deported after a final order of removal is issued.       We must enable the immigration system to deliver better on       its commitment to actually remove those who are issued final       orders.    Those are the words of Barbara Jordan's Commission.   Following upon the Barbara Jordan Commission's recommendation, Sheila  Jackson Lee introduced the Immigration Restructuring and Accountability  Act establishing an Office of Immigration Enforcement to:         Implement the removal of deportable and inadmissible aliens       from the United States.    Ms. Jackson Lee has stated:         I have been a champion for years when it comes to       restructuring the Immigration and Naturalization Service. I       have been arguing for years that we need to separate out       services and enforcement functions of the INS.    In 2001, then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner  introduced the Barbara Jordan Immigration Reform and Accountability Act  which proposed to abolish the INS and established separate offices for  immigration enforcement and the provision of immigration benefits. The  bill was a bipartisan juggernaut. It passed the Judiciary Committee by  a vote of 32-2 and this body by a vote of 405-9.   Alcee Hastings stated during floor consideration that:         I want to commend the authors of this bill. They have       produced a bipartisan bill that is sure to improve       performance and accountability. I think Mr. Sensenbrenner and       Mr. Conyers have done an outstanding job.    The Barbara Jordan Immigration Reform and Accountability Act was, in  effect, enacted into law as part of the Homeland Security Act. In  creating DHS, it transferred over the INS's functions and placed  responsibility over Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the same  directorate. President Bush placed the final piece of the puzzle in  2003 when he submitted a DHS reorganization plan that created the  Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement with the primary mission  of:         Enforcing the full range of immigration and customs laws       within the interior of the United States.    In that bygone era, House Democrats were committed to effective  enforcement of our immigration laws. This was further evidenced by the  fact that in 1996, a majority of Democrats voted for Lamar Smith's  omnibus immigration enforcement legislation that was to be enacted as  the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.   That commitment has inexorably withered away. By 2005, only 36 House  Democrats voted for Jim Sensenbrenner's Border Protection, Anti- Terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act. Just a few weeks ago,  not one Democrat voted for either of two bills that would have  resuscitated immigration enforcement--the Securing America's Future Act  or the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act.   House Democrats once worked collaboratively with Republicans to  improve the effectiveness of Federal immigration enforcement. I hope  that we will resume that soon. Now it appears that they are outraged  when ICE has the audacity to actually enforce the laws that we have  enacted.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote on both sides of the aisle  for H. Res. 990. Let's honor the work of Barbara Jordan and our  Republican and Democratic colleagues who joined together to create ICE,  and the brave men and women of ICE to whom we owe so much.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), who is the chief sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the former chairman of the House  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to point out to  my Democratic colleagues that every single one of them had the  opportunity and every single one of them voted against H.R. 6136, which  addressed this issue and a solution for DACA recipients. Every one of  them voted against it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise), the House majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on  each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\3/4\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Montana (Mr. Gianforte).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on  each side?    Mr. Speaker, I have only one speaker remaining to  close the debate for our side. I believe we have the right to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 336.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, today I rise to urge support for my amendment, which  would reaffirm and preserve the rights of the States to write their own  water quality plans.   My amendment simply prohibits the EPA from using its Chesapeake Bay  Total Maximum Daily Load and the so-called watershed implementation  plans to hijack States' water quality strategies.   Over the last several years, the EPA has implemented a Total Maximum  Daily Load blueprint for the six States in the Chesapeake Bay  watershed, which strictly limits the amount of nutrients that can enter  the Chesapeake Bay. Through its implementation, the EPA has basically  given every State in the watershed an ultimatum: either the State does  exactly what the EPA says or it faces the threat of an EPA takeover of  its water quality programs.   Congress intended that the implementation of the Clean Water Act be a  collaborative approach, through which the States and the Federal  Government work together. This process was not meant to be subject to  the whims of politics and bureaucrats in Washington. Therefore, my  amendment instructs the EPA to respect the important role States play  in implementing the Clean Water Act.   I want to make it perfectly clear that this amendment would not stop  the EPA from working with the States to restore the Chesapeake Bay, nor  would it undermine the cleanup efforts already underway. My language  only removes the ability of the EPA to take over a State's plan or to  take retaliatory actions against the State if it does not meet EPA- mandated goals. Again, it ensures States' rights remain intact and not  usurped by the EPA.   It is important to point out that the correlation between the EPA's  outrageous waters of the United States rule and the Bay TMDL, at the  heart of both issues is the EPA's desire to control conservation and  water quality improvement efforts throughout the country and to punish  all those who dare to oppose them.   The bay is a national treasure, and I want to see it restored, but we  know that in order to achieve this goal, the  [[Page H6510]]  States and the EPA must work together. The EPA cannot be allowed to  railroad the States and micromanage the process.   This amendment has passed the House with bipartisan support several  times, and I urge my colleagues to once again vote to ask the EPA to  respect the important role States play in implementing the Clean Water  Act and prevent another Federal power grab by the administration.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 30 seconds to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the  committee.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me just say, this  amendment does not in any way take any resources away from any of the  six States in the Chesapeake Bay region to improve water quality. What  it does take away is the ability of the EPA to dictate to those States  one way, their way, to do it.   The Clean Water Act was written with it in mind that the Federal  Government would set the standards and the States would figure out how  to meet those standards. And that flexibility has been taken away  starting in the Obama administration, and it is time for this Congress  to stop them from doing that so that we can have the kind of  collaborative effort just described by the subcommittee chairman, Mr.  Calvert, and get back to doing things the right way.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
