 Mr. Speaker, a typical Rhode Island family with an  infant  [[Page H1737]]  and a 4-year-old pays $23,000 a year in child care. That is nearly  double the cost of tuition at the University of Rhode Island.   Nationwide, the cost of child care has increased 25 percent in the  past decade. That is a terrible deal. It is a raw deal for working  families. Democrats have proposed the Child Care for Working Families  Act, a better deal.   This bill ensures that no middle class family will pay more than 7  percent of their income on child care. It ensures universal access to  high-quality preschool programs. It also raises wages for childcare  workers. It focuses on the needs of middle class families and the high  cost of child care.   A few months ago, my Republican colleagues passed a huge tax cut for  powerful corporate special interests and the wealthiest Americans.  Democrats, on the other hand, are offering A Better Deal--a deal that  focuses on raising family incomes, reducing costs in people's lives,  and making sure people are prepared for jobs in the 21st century.   We propose A Better Deal                            ____________________
