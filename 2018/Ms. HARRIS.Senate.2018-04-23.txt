 Mr. President, Californians and San Franciscans  have lost a fearless advocate for racial and economic equality who  became the first African-American president of San Francisco's board of  supervisors. Ms. Doris Ward was elected to the board of supervisors and  was sworn in on January 8, 1980. In 1991, Ms. Ward became the first  Black woman to serve as board president.   Ms. Ward was a trailblazer from her earliest days. She attended an  integrated school from kindergarten through 12th grade. She went on to  earn her bachelor's and master's degrees in education at Indiana  University. Later she earned a master's degree in counseling from San  Francisco State University and a doctorate in education from U.C.  Berkeley. Ms. Ward was active in the civil rights movement and  participated in sit-ins at bars and other public areas in Indiana. Ms.  Ward began her career as a teacher in Gary, IN, her hometown, before  joining the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  NAACP, in Indianapolis.   During her time at the NAACP in the late 1960s, Ms. Ward cemented her  role as a leader for civil rights and social justice by opposing the Ku  Klux Klan and other forms of racism and discrimination before moving to  California.   Ms. Ward started her political career in 1972, after moving to San  Francisco, when she became a trustee for the city's community college  district prior to joining the board of supervisors.   Ms. Ward was a friend, mentor, and we will miss her vibrant spirit.  The thoughts of San Franciscans and Californians are with Ms. Ward's  sister, Debra Floyd, of Washington, DC, her family, city leaders, and  the people of San Francisco during this time.                            ____________________
