 Mr. Speaker, a few years  ago, New Mexico decimated its behavioral health system when it  terminated nearly every behavioral health provider in the State.   In fact, thousands of New Mexicans did not have access to medicine,  counselors, or treatment, increasing their risks of substance abuse,  health issues, and homelessness.   Many New Mexicans suffered, were incarcerated, or died because of the  State's negligence. Today, we are potentially seeing an even more  catastrophic State-created crisis in the making.   Just a few weeks ago, the State announced it intended to cancel its  contract with the Non-Metro Area Agency on Aging, which manages and  oversees critical services like adult daycare, meal services,  caregiving, transportation, and respite care for vulnerable seniors and  their families.   Decimating the current system without public hearings, due process,  or having a public plan to ensure the continuity of services will  disrupt these lifesaving safety net programs that serve nearly 80,000  seniors; and these seniors are going to suffer because of this reckless  and hasty decision.   I have written to HHS demanding that they immediately investigate the  State's negligent behavior.  [[Page H129]]                                ____________________
