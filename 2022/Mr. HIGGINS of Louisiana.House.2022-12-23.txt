 Mr. Speaker, witness then the demise of a  nation once great. Witness the arrogance of thieves in suits from their  wealth and comfort as they spend the American treasure of a generation  yet unborn.   Witness as they smile, in full knowledge that they are comfortable  with taking the position that they are better managers of our Nation's  decline.   But witness ye, also, that the American people have had enough. We  struggle, we the people. Americans from sea to shining sea cannot pay  for groceries or fuel. They are cold and hungry and feel betrayed by  this body.   I understand that sentiment and passion because I share it.
