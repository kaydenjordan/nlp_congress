 Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to be here to support--well, I don't  think it is going to be support. It is really more in opposition to  this so-called Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and  Settlements Act.   Well, why? Well, because it is anticonsumer.   Well, why? Because it is antienvironment.   Well, why? Because it is antiprivacy.   Not surprisingly, a broad consortium of more than 150 organizations  strenuously oppose this bill, including some of our best nonprofits:  the National Resources Defense Council, for example; the Sierra Club,  for another example; Public Citizen; and a lot of labor organizations  and other groups.   Title I of this bill, for example, has one goal: it is to discourage  the use of settlement agreements and consent decrees that compel  agencies to follow the law.   When enacting new statutes, Congress routinely establishes deadlines  for agency action, particularly when it involves urgent public health  and safety concerns. When agencies fail to meet these deadlines, a  party with standing may file a lawsuit under section 7 of the  Administrative Procedure Act to ensure that the agency performs this  mandatory, nondiscretionary duty. By delaying the enforcement of  statutory deadlines, the bill, however, jeopardizes public health and  safety, which explains why the previous Obama administration issued a  veto threat to similar legislation considered only last Congress.   Title I imposes nearly impossible hurdles for agencies seeking to  resolve the deadline lawsuits and gives opponents of regulation  multiple opportunities to stifle agency regulatory actions.   With respect to consent decrees concerning a rulemaking, an agency  would be forced to go through two public comment periods--one for the  consent decree, and one for the rulemaking that results from the  consent decree--doubling the agency's effort. In addition, it would  allow any affected party to intervene in opposition to a proposed  settlement agreement or consent decree.   Contrary to the claims of those who support this measure, the  Government Accountability Office has found no evidence that these  deadline lawsuits are collusive. As the Justice Department, which  represents most Federal agencies, acknowledged earlier this year, these  agencies are left with few defenses, if any, to these lawsuits.   I am also concerned that H.R. 469 will inevitably generate more  litigation that will result in millions of dollars of additional  transactional costs, all of which will be borne by you know who--the  American taxpayer.   For example, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in its  analysis of the bill's predecessor from the last Congress, concluded:         The measure would impose millions of dollars in additional       costs, most of which would be incurred because the litigation       involving consent decrees and settlement agreements would       probably take longer under the bill, and agencies would face       additional administrative requirements.    That is a quotation. In other words, Title I of this bill is a costly  solution, again, in search of a problem.   Now, Title II of the bill isn't much better. For instance, Title II  overrides the Privacy Act to require publication of sensitive personal  information of victims of government abuse or unlawful conduct, which  raises serious privacy concerns.   Although proponents of this measure argue it will increase government  transparency, its real effect will be to force the Treasury Department  to publish, on the Internet, the names of individual victims of  government misconduct compensated for their claims by the Judgment  Fund, including victims of race and sex discrimination, and so, in  effect, revictimizing victims harmed by the Federal Government.   Finally, Title III would facilitate the ability of the House majority  to intervene in pending cases where the Justice Department has already  determined that it will not defend the constitutionality of a Federal  law.   Not only do these provisions raise possible separation of powers  concerns, it is unclear why they are even needed.   This measure has not ever been the subject of a single hearing or  markup by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. As a  result, there has not been any opportunity to consider these critical  issues and to analyze the ramifications presented by Title III.   For all of these reasons, I must, accordingly, urge my colleagues to  oppose H.R. 469.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.R. 469  settlement agreements and consent decrees intended to prevent  discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, or other  protected category.   Given the often systemic nature of discriminatory conduct, settlement  [[Page H8203]]  agreements and consent decrees provide an invaluable means to provide  for general relief for non-identifiable victims and to prevent future  discriminatory acts.   In particular, they are instrumental in enforcing critical civil  rights protections in a wide variety of cases, including voting rights  violations and predatory lending practices based on race. Other  examples include the use of consent decrees by the Justice Department  to address unconstitutional police pattern or practice activities.   For example, in 2003, the City of Detroit entered into a consent  decree with the Justice Department concerning the inappropriate use of  force and arrest practices by the city's police department. As a result  of this decree, the police department implemented vastly improved  practices that have substantially reduced the incidence of fatalities  caused by law enforcement activities, a goal that the Judiciary  Committee Chairman Goodlatte and I very much endorse.   According to the department's civil rights division, these decrees  facilitate institutional reforms, such as improving systems for  supervising officers and holding them accountable for misconduct, as  well as ensuring officers have the policy guidance, training,  equipment, and other resources necessary for constitutional and  effective policing.   Unfortunately, H.R. 469 would make the use of such remedies  exceedingly difficult by subjecting them to numerous procedural and  potentially meritless court challenges.   A particularly concerning provision of this bill is its broad and  ill-defined authorization allowing virtually anyone to intervene with  respect to a proposed settlement agreement or consent decree.   For example, imagine a proposed settlement agreement intended to  restrict a city's school district from discriminating against Muslims.  Under the bill, any anti-Muslim or neo-Nazi organization could petition  the court to intervene for the purpose of opposing such agreement on  the ground that it ``would affect'' such person.   This is just one of the many fundamental problems presented by this  thoroughly flawed and, I think, harmful measure, and, so, accordingly,  I ask my colleagues here to join me in opposing H.R. 469.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, although H.R. 469 has many flaws, I am  particularly concerned that the bill's broad and ill-defined  requirements would effectively delay and possibly deter civil  enforcement agencies from providing general relief in discrimination  cases, discourage courts from enforcing these settlements, and also  invite costly and needless litigation.   In response to this problem, my amendment would simply exclude from  the bill's burdensome requirements settlement agreements and consent  decrees intended to remediate generalized harms in civil rights cases.   Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment, and I urge my  colleagues here to support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
