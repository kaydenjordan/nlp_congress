 Mr. Speaker, workforce development programs are spreading  across the country because of organizations like Be Pro Be Proud.   In March of 2016, Be Pro Be Proud was launched by the Arkansas  Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Arkansas to serve  the future leaders of America's workforce more effectively.   Thanks to Be Pro Be Proud, more young people know that they can find  a good-paying job and have a successful career without going to  college. They have learned that there are alternatives to a  baccalaureate degree--alternatives that can produce equal, if not  better, outcomes.   In June of this year, I had the privilege of traveling to Arkansas  and attending the national Be Pro Be Proud conference alongside  Representative French Hill and Senator John Boozman.   The progress that has been achieved to date by this organization is  remarkable, and in the realm of workforce development, its gains are  second to none.   In February of this year, officials in North Carolina signed a  contract that established a Be Pro Be Proud pilot program within the  State. This is wonderful news indeed.   As you can probably tell, Mr. Speaker, this is truly a State-led  effort that is a model to other States and becoming a national  movement, and it is one that is a force to be reckoned with.   States need to know that the power is in their hands to implement  strong and effective workforce development programs. They need to know  that they, in fact, are in the driver's seat.   I thank everyone who has worked so diligently to make Be Pro Be Proud  what it is today. The work they are doing will go on to leave a  positive impact on America's future leaders for generations to come.                        Americans Are Not Celebrating     Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder the American people believe  that Washington is out of touch. Last week President Biden held an  event on the White House lawn to celebrate the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act.   He took a victory lap in front of the entire country alongside his  allies on live television.   But, Mr. Speaker, do you know who was not celebrating with President  Biden?   Hardworking taxpayers and their families who are being pummeled by  the President's inflation catastrophe and inflation tax. That same day,  new numbers were released showing that inflation continues to surge.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden couldn't read a room if he tried. The  rising cost of goods and services will cost the average American  household over $700 a month. When added up, that is over $8,000 that  they will be forced to fork out in a year.   Grocery prices are up 13.5 percent, and food prices are up 11.4  percent since last year. This is the largest 1-year increase in prices  since 1979.   Mr. Speaker, anyone who believes that these numbers are worth  celebrating needs a serious reality check. The Biden administration's  fiscal irresponsibility put us in this mess. Come  [[Page H7971]]  November, Republicans will be the ones to fix it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I thank my colleague for yielding the time.   While I fully support the underlying intent of S. 1098, the Joint  Consolidation Loan Separation Act, I have concerns about the bill as  drafted. The purpose of this bill is to protect student loan borrowers  who consolidated their loans with a spouse but now seek to reverse this  process. Yet, as written, this bill undermines that purpose.   I am concerned this bill will hurt the very borrowers we are trying  to help. We never want to see a spouse, especially one that is a victim  of domestic violence, forced to be financially tied to his or her  abuser. We want to give these borrowers a way out. However, we also  recognize that it is not only the abused spouse who may be applying for  these new consolidations.   Under the Senate-passed language, when a borrower files for a new  consolidated loan, he or she could potentially leave his or her spouse  with the remaining balance. We must be cognizant of the fact that a  borrower could use this new legislation as a weapon. This is why we  need safeguards in place to ensure that both parties are not subject to  potential abuse through the separation process and not just the one  filing for a new consolidation.   Additionally, the Department of Education has stated that it will  take 12 to 18 months to implement this bill. Given the urgency of the  situation that many borrowers are in, this kind of delay is  unacceptable. We need to provide these borrowers with a quicker way out  of their joint consolidation loan. Yet, Democrats rejected the  Republicans' solution that will give these borrowers an almost  immediate separation without unnecessary paperwork that will bog down  the process.   Further, I am concerned that this bill could be used by the Secretary  of Education to stage an even broader takeover of student loans. It  would be simpler and more straightforward to allow these loans, once  separated, to remain with their current holder, but instead, this  legislation attempts to drive as many of these loans as possible into  the government-run Direct Loan program.   We have ample evidence to believe that the Biden Department of  Education will take the inch given in this legislation and use it to go  a mile. The administration's illegal expansion of the income-driven  repayment program and Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, let  alone Biden's student loan bailout, are evidence of that.   For example, the vague language included in this bill, namely, the  authority for the Secretary of Education to allow for new consolidation  loans if it is in ``the fiscal interest of the Federal Government.''  The Department of Education has not been able to provide clarity on  what this phrase means or how it applies to this bill, but it has been  used previously by this administration to force billions of dollars'  worth of loans made by private lenders  [[Page H7995]]  onto the government's books. Moreover, the President's $1 trillion  transfer of wealth from hardworking taxpayers to college  graduates clearly illustrates this administration had no intention of  protecting ``the fiscal interests of the Federal Government.''    We must not create any loopholes or back doors for the Biden  administration to exploit. Transferring massive amounts of student loan  debt to taxpayers is harming our economy and setting a horrible  precedent for future borrowers, not to mention failing to solve the  underlying problems in postsecondary education.   Because of these issues, Republicans have a solution that will allow  student loan servicers to separate joint consolidation loans almost  immediately, instead of having to wait over a year to receive relief.   Our solution is a commonsense and practical way to accomplish the  same goal as this legislation but more quickly and efficiently.   Republicans are willing to work across the aisle to ensure borrowers  are taken care of, but unfortunately, Democrats are more focused on  opening more avenues for the administration to expand its radical loan  bailout.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment to S. 1098 would establish a more efficient  process for separating joint consolidation loans to ensure timely  relief for borrowers, protect victims of abuse seeking to sever their  financial entanglement with their abuser, and protect taxpayers by  ensuring that the Secretary's authority is narrowly tailored to help  those in need.   It allows borrowers to separate their loans immediately rather than  having to apply for a new loan in the Direct Loan Program, a process  that can take as long as 18 months to implement.   Moreover, it ensures that those who are victims of economic or  domestic abuse can split their loans without opening up avenues for  their abuser to game the system and inflict further harm on those we  are trying to help.   This is a commonsense fix to a bill that all of us agree is well- intended but falls short of ensuring adequate safeguards for borrowers.   S. 1098 also fails to protect against the abuse of executive  authority, something this administration has already proven it will  happily do.   If we adopt the motion to commit, we will instruct the Committee on  Education and Labor to consider my amendment to S. 1098 to establish a  more efficient process for separating joint consolidation loans to  ensure timely relief for borrowers that need it.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the  Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to commit.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass the amendment so  we can provide timely relief to the borrowers who need it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider the solution  Republicans have put on the table. Borrowers wanting out of joint  consolidated loans should have the opportunity to separate, but the  method we use to get this done is important.   S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, will take the  Department 12 to 18 months to implement, far too long for some  borrowers who are in urgent need of help. This legislation could also  backfire on the very borrowers we are all working to help.   Additionally, this bill's sloppy and vague language could pave the  way for even more Federal power grabs over the student loan system.  Given what we have seen from this administration, we cannot open any  doors to further student loan debt schemes.   Bottom line, S. 1098 delays support for borrowers who need assistance  immediately, cedes more control to the Education Secretary, and fails  to protect the borrowers and taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
