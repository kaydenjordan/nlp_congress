 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of former Knox  County Executive Dwight Kessel, who passed away on June 3 at the age of  96.   Dwight was born to Wayne and Edith Kessel and grew up in Beckley,  West Virginia. After serving in the United States Navy during World War  II, he came back to Knoxville and graduated from the University of  Tennessee with a degree in industrial engineering.   Dwight started his political career in 1963 by serving on the  Knoxville City Council, then as Knox County clerk, and eventually  became the Knox County executive in 1980, which is the position we now  call the Knox County mayor.  [[Page H2775]]    He also worked with a whole lot of charity organizations, including  the YMCA, Boys and Girls Club of the Tennessee Valley, Boy Scouts of  America, and National Conference of Christians and Jews.   He was a family man who loved the Lord and was a longtime member of  the First Baptist Church of Knoxville, where he was a trustee for 15  years, served as a deacon, and faithfully taught Sunday school.    Behind me right here is a picture of all the Knox County mayors who  went to last year's Knox County budget address--myself, Mayor  Schumpert, Mayor Jacobs, and Mayor Ragsdale, and Mayor Kessel is down  on the bottom.   I know we are all thankful for Dwight's work that paved the way for  Knox County mayors who followed him, including myself.   My wife and I are praying for Dwight's family. He will be greatly  missed by our community in Knox County.                            ____________________
