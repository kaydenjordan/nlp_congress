 Mr. President, today it appears that the House  Democrat majority will finally stand behind its decision to impeach the  President of the United States. Last year, the House of Representatives  rushed through the least thorough and most unclear impeachment inquiry  in American history. They took just 12 weeks--12 weeks.   There was more than a year of hearings before the impeachment of  President Nixon. There were multiple years of investigation for  President Clinton. When people are serious about compiling evidence and  proving a case, these things take time.   That is not what happened this time. House Democrats performed a pale  imitation of a real inquiry. They did not pursue their own subpoenas  through the courts. They declined to litigate potential questions of  privilege. They pulled the plug as soon as Speaker Pelosi realized she  had enough Democrat votes to achieve a political outcome.   This isn't really about Ukraine policy or military assistance money.  It can't be because, for one thing, prominent Democrats were promising  to impeach President Trump years--years--before those events even  happened.   The day this President was inaugurated, the Washington Post said:  ``The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' That was the day  he was inaugurated, stated in the Washington Post.   More than 2 years ago, Congressman Jerry Nadler was campaigning to be  the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, specifically because  he was an impeachment expert.   Just a few weeks ago, when a reporter asked Speaker Pelosi why the  Democrats were in such a hurry, here is her response:         Speed? It's been going on for 22 months. Two and a half       years, actually.    That is really interesting--really, really interesting. The events  over which the Democrats want to impeach happened just 6 months ago-- just 6 months ago--not 2\1/2\ years ago.   So how has impeachment been underway for 2\1/2\ years? The Speaker  tried to say she was referring to the Mueller investigation, except the  House couldn't impeach on the Mueller investigation because the facts  let them down; remember?   The House impeached over events in Ukraine, events that happened only  6 months ago, but they still admit this was years in the making. It was  not some earnest factfinding mission that brought us to where we are.  This is not about the nuances of foreign assistance to Eastern Europe.  This has been naked partisanship all along--naked partisanship all  along.  [[Page S202]]    If that weren't already obvious, our colleague the Senate Democratic  leader helpfully removed any shred of doubt just this past weekend.  Here is what he said: He told reporters that as long as he can try to  use the trial to hurt some Republican Senators' reelection chances,  then whatever happens, ``it's a win-win.'' That is what the Democratic  leader said. This is a stunning statement.   Presidential impeachment may be the gravest process our Constitution  contemplates. It undoes the people's decision in a national election.  Going about it in this subjective, unfair, and rushed way is corrosive  to our institutions. It hurts national unity, and it virtually  guarantees--guarantees--that future Houses of either party will feel  free--free--to impeach any future President because they don't like  him. If you don't like him, impeach him. That is the message coming out  of this.   But as long as our colleague the Democratic leader can weaponize this  process in the next election, he thinks ``it's a win-win.'' That really  says it all; doesn't it? That really sums it up.   This partisanship led House Democrats to cross a rubicon that every  other House of Representatives had avoided for 230 years. They passed  the first Presidential impeachment that does not even allege an actual  crime under our laws. We had a 230-year tradition of rejecting purely  political impeachments, and it died last month in this House of  Representatives.   So Speaker Pelosi and the House have taken our Nation down a  dangerous road. If the Senate blesses this unprecedented and dangerous  House process by agreeing that an incomplete case and a subjective  basis are enough to impeach a President, we will almost guarantee the  impeachment of every future President of either party when the House  doesn't like that President.   This grave process of last constitutional resort will be watered down  into the kind of anti-democratic recall measure that the Founding  Fathers explicitly--explicitly--did not want.   The Senate was designed to stabilize our institutions, to break  partisan fevers, and to stop short-term passions from destroying our  long-term future. House Democrats may have descended into pure  factionalism, but the U.S. Senate must not.   This is the only body that can consider all factors presented by the  House, decide what has or has not been proven, and choose what outcome  best serves the Nation. This is what we must do.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  with the House signaling that they will move forward later today,  Members can expect to receive further guidance about the logistics and  practicalities of the next several session days in short order.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, before  the Senate shifts into the trial, we hope to complete an enormous  accomplishment for this administration and, most importantly, for  American families. It has now been more than 1 year--1 year--since  President Trump hammered out the USMCA with the Governments of Mexico  and Canada.   These two neighbors buy more than $5 billion of American goods and  services every single year. They buy nearly 30 percent of all the food  and agricultural products we export to the entire world, and for 90  percent of our manufacturing sectors, Mexico or Canada rank as the No.  1 or No. 2 export destination.   Over the past quarter of a century, 12 million U.S. jobs have come to  depend on U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada. That includes many  livelihoods in my home State of Kentucky, from agriculture to  manufacturing, to aerospace and motor vehicles, to our signature  industries, like distilled spirits.   That is why workers, families, and small businesses in Kentucky and  around the Nation have been clamoring to get this deal done for a year  now. In addition to all the American livelihoods that this commerce  already supports, experts predict the USMCA will create 176,000 new  jobs as well.   On behalf of all of these Americans, we were troubled to see Speaker  Pelosi slow walk this agreement for the better part of a year. But,  finally, late last year, the overwhelming bipartisan pressure to move  forward made an impact on the House. So we are finally on the threshold  of approving this agreement and sending it to President Trump's desk to  become law.   Our colleagues on the Finance Committee have already approved it by  an overwhelming margin. Other committees of jurisdiction are wrapping  up their consideration as we speak. Very soon, we hope the Senate will  be able to vote on the floor and put this landmark accomplishment right  on the President's desk.   It will be a major win for Kentucky and for all 50 States, a major  win for our country, a major win for the Trump administration, and a  major win for those of us who are already ready to move past this  season of toxic political noise and get back to doing even more of the  American people's business.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Res. 471) authorizing the taking of a       photograph in the Chamber of the United States Senate.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The resolution (S. Res. 471) was agreed to.   (The resolution is printed in today's Record under ``Submitted  Resolutions.'')                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, a  few minutes ago, the Senate was notified that the House of  Representatives is finally ready to proceed with their Articles of  Impeachment. So, by unanimous consent, we have just laid some of the  groundwork that will structure the next several days.   We have officially invited the House managers to come to the Senate  tomorrow at noon to exhibit their Articles of Impeachment. Then later  tomorrow afternoon, at 2 p.m., the Chief Justice of the United States  will arrive here in the Senate. He will be sworn in by the President  pro tempore, Senator Grassley. Then the Chief Justice will swear in all  of us Senators. We will pledge to rise above the petty factionalism and  do justice for our institutions, for our States, and for the Nation.  Then we will formally notify the  [[Page S236]]  White House of our pending trial and summon the President to answer the  articles and send his counsel.   So the trial will commence in earnest on Tuesday.   First, Mr. President, some important good news for the country. We  anticipate the Senate will finish the USMCA tomorrow and send this  landmark trade deal to President Trump for his signature. This is a  major victory for the administration, but more importantly, for  American families.   Let me close with this: This is a difficult time for our country, but  this is precisely the kind of time for which the Framers created the  Senate. I am confident this body can rise above short-termism and  factional fever and serve the long-term best interests of our Nation.  We can do this, and we must.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all debate  time on H.R. 5430 expire at 11 a.m. tomorrow; further, that prior to  the expiration of debate time, it be in order for Senator Toomey, or  his designee, to raise a budget point of order; and that if a point of  order is raised, it be in order for Senator Grassley, or his designee,  to make a motion to waive the point of order.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  this means we will have two rollcall votes tomorrow morning at 11 a.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 336, H.R. 133.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 338, S. Res. 371.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendment to the resolution be agreed to.    I know of no further debate on the resolution, as  amended.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  amendment to the preamble be agreed to; that the preamble, as amended,  be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 472, submitted earlier today.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today it adjourn until 9:45 a.m., January  16; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that following leader remarks,  the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 5430 under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order, following the remarks of Senators Hoeven and Cramer.
