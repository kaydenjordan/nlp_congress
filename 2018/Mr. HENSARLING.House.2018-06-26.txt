 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5841, the Foreign  Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, which the Financial Services  Committee approved last month by a unanimous vote of 53-0.   I want to thank both Republican and Democrat Members for their  effort, but I especially want to thank the bill's sponsor, the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), who has worked  tirelessly to develop this legislation and bring it to the House floor.  Mr. Speaker, we would not be here but for his expertise and leadership.   I also want to thank Chairman Royce for the cooperation of the  Foreign Affairs Committee working with us on this very important piece  of legislation.   Finally, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who  chairs our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, as well as his  ranking member, Ms. Moore of Wisconsin.   I also happen to see the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Heck, and I  want to thank him for his contributions as well.   The subcommittee held no fewer than four hearings prior to marking up  this legislation, and the thoughtfulness that they brought to the issue  is something we should all emulate.   The bill is a comprehensive reform of the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, as it is known; the first  update of its kind in over a decade.   CFIUS is authorized to review foreign investment transactions that  may threaten our national security. And although these authorities have  been wielded carefully, Congress must remain vigilant when delegating  additional powers that may have far-reaching effects.   The reason, Mr. Speaker, is simple. According to a Department of  Commerce study from 2016, 12 million American workers have jobs  resulting from foreign investment; 3\1/2\ million in the manufacturing  sector alone.   On top of that, the vast majority of foreign investments' value added  comes from deals with U.S. allies. We need to protect our national  security while also ensuring that America stays open for business.   This is exactly what the House version of FIRRMA does. It closes real  gaps in CFIUS' jurisdiction that could otherwise be exploited by bad  actors, but it doesn't give the government a foothold to go after deals  or entire sectors on a whim.   We target those transactions in countries, including China and  Russia, that truly present a national security risk, but without  strangling the investment and innovation that makes our country strong  to begin with.   We also focus on particular assets that are sensitive, assets like  sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens or technical information on  critical technologies and critical infrastructure rather than walling  off entire categories of U.S. companies and industries.                                time  1400    It is also important to know what that bill doesn't do, Mr. Speaker.  We don't change due process under CFIUS, and we don't weaken  confidentiality requirements that CFIUS is subject to. H.R. 5841 keeps  CFIUS accountable.   Finally, this legislation recognizes that CFIUS and export controls  are complementary. As two sides of the same coin, reforms to both  clearly belong in the same bill.   We are pleased to see this legislation include such reforms to the  export control regime, again, reforms that passed the Foreign Affairs  Committee by voice vote in April. They make the House version of FIRRMA  even stronger.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Members on both sides of the  aisle, especially Mr. Pittenger, but all Members on both sides of the  aisle who contributed so thoughtfully to this legislation, including  the cooperation of the ranking member.   I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), the vice chairman of the  Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee and the author of the FIRRMA  bill before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Monetary Policy  and Trade Subcommittee, and the subcommittee chairman who helped craft  the bill and helped shepherd it to the markup process.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), who is a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee and a member of the Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee that dealt with this FIRRMA legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is the chairman of our Monetary Policy and  Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I think this is a very important piece of  legislation that has come before the body. I also want to acknowledge  that, yes, it is very challenging for this body to engage in bipartisan  legislation. But we have clearly achieved it today. I think we have  achieved it because we know that as Americans we must rally around when  it comes to issues of national security.   So, again, I want to thank the ranking member. I want to thank the  gentleman from Washington and all other Members on the other side of  the aisle for coming together. And as the gentleman from Washington  said, perhaps not getting exactly the bill that they wanted--I assure  the gentleman from Washington I didn't get exactly the bill I wanted-- but we have a very strong bill that I think balances our critical need  to safeguard our technology and at the same time recognizes how  important foreign direct investment is in growing our economy and being  able to afford the type of defense structures that we need so that our  national security is never second to none.   Again, Mr. Speaker, we could not have done this first without the  leadership, the expertise, and the drive of the gentleman from North  Carolina. I believe that some form of this bill will soon end up on the  President's desk and we will all thank the gentleman from North  Carolina for his leadership in getting America to this point.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
