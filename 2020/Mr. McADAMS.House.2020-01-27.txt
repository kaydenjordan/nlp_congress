 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4704) to direct the Director of the National Science  Foundation to support multidisciplinary research on the science of  suicide, and to advance the knowledge and understanding of issues that  may be associated with several aspects of suicide including intrinsic  and extrinsic factors related to areas such as wellbeing, resilience,  and vulnerability, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4704         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Research to       Prevent Suicide Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The rate of Americans dying by suicide is on the rise,       increasing 10.7 to 14.0 deaths per 100,000 people from 2001       to 2017.        (2) Suicide is the tenth-leading cause of death among       people in the United States and the second-leading cause of       death for young people between the ages of 15 and 34.        (3) The National Science Foundation funds research that is       improving our basic understanding of factors with potential       relevance to suicide, including potential relevance to       prevention and treatment.        (4) Despite progress in mental health research, current       gaps exist in scientific understanding and basic knowledge of       human neural, genetic, cognitive, perceptual, behavioral,       social, and environmental factors with potential relevance to       suicide.       SEC. 3. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH.         (a) The Director of the National Science Foundation, in       consultation with the Director of the National Institutes of       Health and the Director of the National Institute on Mental       Health where appropriate, shall, subject to the availability       of appropriations, award grants on a competitive, merit-      reviewed basis to institutions of higher education (or       consortia of such institutions) to support multidisciplinary,       fundamental research with potential relevance to suicide,       including potential relevance to prevention and treatment,       including but not limited to--        (1) basic understanding of human social behavior;        (2) the neural basis of human cognition;        (3) basic understanding of cognitive, linguistic, social,       cultural and biological processes related to human       development across the lifespan;        (4) basic understanding of perceptual, motor, and cognitive       processes, and their interaction, in typical human behavior;       and        (5) basic understanding of the relevance of drug and       alcohol abuse.        (b) To promote the development of early career researchers,       in awarding funds under subsection (a) the National Science       Foundation shall encourage applications submitted by early       career researchers, including doctoral students or       postdoctoral researchers.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4704, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan legislation,  H.R. 4704, the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act, which directs  the National Science Foundation to support fundamental,  multidisciplinary research to further our understanding of suicide.   In Utah and across the country, communities are facing a mental  health crisis. Public health and medical professionals are tracking an  alarming rise in the rate of death by suicide, a 30 percent increase  from 2000 to 2016 occurring in nearly every State.   Suicide is now the second leading cause of death among Americans age  15 to 24 and the first cause of death for Utahns in the same age range.  Behind the statistics are heart-wrenching stories, such as the one I  heard in Utah last month.   A local television news anchor courageously told her family's  personal story. Her 44-year-old husband, who was a physical therapist  working toward a doctorate degree, died by suicide. She thought their  family was doing well, but what she did not know was that her husband  had struggled with depression in secret for years.   A week after his death, she went through his phone and noticed a call  to a national suicide hotline. The call was placed the day before he  died. He didn't say anything to his wife, not that he was struggling or  having a hard time.   Now, she is using her platform in the newsroom to talk about her  experience and break the stigma that surrounds mental illness. People  need to understand, she says, that this is not something to be ashamed  of and to ensure that we can get help and support to those who find  themselves in crisis.   In developing this legislation, I recently convened a panel of  experts in Utah, including healthcare providers, advocates, and  community leaders. One constituent shared with me that her school  district has had three students die by suicide in this school year  alone. The immense tragedy of this--young people who die far too  early--has left an entire community grieving and reflecting upon how we  can help those in need.   This epidemic has led to much-needed action in Utah to identify and  to support those at risk and those in crisis. It has also brought new  attention to the need to understand suicide and to help develop  interventions to support people at risk.   How we understand human behavior, our social ties, and the  environments in which we live connects us to understanding what puts  people at risk of suicide and how we can support those in crisis, not  to mention the changing issues that people face, particularly young  people, from economic change and the constant presence of technology  that reshape how we live, how we connect, and how we communicate.  [[Page H550]]    This legislation will contribute to the foundational research that we  need to give our mental health professionals the tools to save lives.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have developed the Advancing Research to  Prevent Suicide Act with my colleague and my friend, Congressman  Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, to direct research into these questions and  issues through the National Science Foundation.   The National Science Foundation is a cornerstone of our Nation's  scientific efforts and leadership. It supports fundamental research in  many key fields related to our understanding of suicide--social  behavior, cognition, development, genetics, and so much more.   I extend my thanks to the teams at the American Foundation for  Suicide Prevention and the American Psychological Association for their  insight on and endorsement of this legislation.   I also thank Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for her support and  cosponsorship of this bill and for her leadership on our committee to  address the scientific and research issues facing our Nation today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill  that will advance our national efforts to address the suicide crisis,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we are facing a suicide epidemic in this  country. This legislation will bring resources to address this epidemic  and to identify solutions that help to bend the curve and help to  prevent future death by suicide.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this important bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 153) to promote veteran involvement in STEM education,  computer science, and scientific research, and for other purposes.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on S. 153, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise today in support of S. 153, the Supporting Veterans in  STEM Careers Act. I thank Representatives Dunn and Lamb and our  colleagues in the Senate, Senators Rubio and Klobuchar, for their  leadership on this important bipartisan bill.   The Nation's economic growth and global competitiveness are  increasingly reliant on a workforce that is equipped with STEM  knowledge and skills. Nearly every aspect of modern life, from  transportation, agriculture, and healthcare, to energy and national  defense, is built on a foundation of science and technology. To  maintain our standing as the global leader in innovation, we must  continue to invest in and expand our STEM workforce.   While these challenges have been well defined for some time, we  continue to struggle as a Nation to produce enough workers with the  STEM skills and knowledge that their employers need.  [[Page H552]]    Business leaders have expressed concern that the STEM skills shortage  will impact their ability to develop new technologies and to grow their  companies.   The veteran population represents an underutilized pool of talent for  our Nation's STEM workforce. Often, the skills these individuals  obtained during their military service are transferable directly to  STEM occupations. We must do more to tap into this diverse, highly  skilled, and experienced population to not only strengthen our STEM  workforce but also empower veterans to pursue high-paying and rewarding  STEM careers.   S. 153 directs the National Science Foundation to report data on  veterans in STEM studies and careers and to develop a plan to increase  outreach to those veterans.   The bill also creates an interagency committee that will examine how  Federal programs and policies can be best leveraged to equip veterans  with the skills they need to transition into STEM careers.   S. 153 is a good step toward addressing our STEM skills shortage and  creating opportunities for those who have served our country.   Once again, I thank my colleagues in the House and the Senate for  their leadership on this very important issue. I also thank Chair  Takano from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for helping us to  expedite consideration of this bill today on the floor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to send this  bill to the President's desk for signature, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I have no other requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I urge adoption of this measure, S. 153. I commend my colleague for  this important legislation and the impact that it will have on our  veterans who have served our country and want to continue to serve and  provide for themselves and serve in STEM fields.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
