 Mr. President, I rise to recognize Didar Singh  Bains, a community leader in California, who passed away on September  13, 2022, at the age of 84.   Didar embodied the pioneer spirit of the Golden State. He left a  small village in his native Punjab, India, for America with almost no  money to his name. Didar found agricultural work in the Imperial Valley  before eventually working his way to Yuba City in the northern part of  the State.   Through hard work he tapped into California's fertile soils and rich  agricultural bounty to build a farming empire that spanned California,  Washington, and British Columbia. His particular gift for cultivating  peaches earned him the moniker of ``Peach King.''   But Didar was much more than a farmer; he was a philanthropist, a  pillar of his community, and a beacon of hope for Sikh immigrants  across the country who were often fleeing violence in search of a  better life.   A man of great faith, Didar raised money to build a Sikh temple in  Yuba City, and he became the youngest president of the Stockton  Gurdwara Sikh temple in 1965. He also founded the World Sikh  Organization in 1984, which has donated millions of dollars to  philanthropic causes around the world. After Sikhs became targets of  discrimination and violence following the September 11 terror attacks,  he worked with community leaders to meet with President George W. Bush  in hopes of educating the Nation on the Sikh community.   The nearly 100,000 Sikh Americans who travel from across the country  each year to Yuba City's annual Nagar Kirtan festival have Didar Singh  Bains to thank. Didar was a champion for Yuba City and the surrounding  region. His legacy is felt to this day by the businesses that now line  the largely rural area. It can be seen in the political gains for Sikh  Americans, exemplified by his nephew winning mayoral office in 2009 and  becoming the first Sikh  [[Page S6664]]  American elected to lead a city in United States history. And it can be  told by the countless number of immigrants whom he helped achieve the  American dream.   My deepest condolences to his family, community, and Sikh Americans  everywhere.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life  of Carmen Ramirez, a relentless advocate for Oxnard, CA; a champion for  the environment; and a dear friend to so many.   Born in Oklahoma--but a true daughter of California--Carmen grew up  in the community of Pico Rivera in Los Angeles County. She attended the  University of San Francisco and California State University, Los  Angeles, before graduating from Loyola Law School.   Her passion for improving the lives of others eventually brought her  to Oxnard. Beginning in 1978, Carmen served as a legal aid attorney  working to represent low-income Californians of La Colonia. Among her  many legal and professional accomplishments, she later served as  president of the Ventura County Bar, president of the Women Lawyers of  Ventura County, a trustee for The Colleges of Law for Santa Barbara and  Ventura, a member of the board of governors for the California State  Bar, and a member of the executive committee of the California Bench  Bar.   But what drew Carmen into public service was her passion for the  environment. In 2007, she joined the fight to oppose a liquefied  natural gas project proposed near the beaches of Oxnard, and she fought  successfully to protect her community. She would go on to become a  staunch advocate in our fight against the climate crisis and to promote  renewable energy, always leading with kindness, compassion, and  composure.   She was elected to the Oxnard City Council for 10 years, where she  served for 8 years as Mayor pro tem, promoting the causes of social and  environmental justice. She went on to serve as the first Latina on the  Ventura County Board of Supervisors in 2020.   Carmen cared deeply about her community. And in turn, her community  cared deeply about her. Just ask one of the hundreds of Californians  who crowded Plaza Park to pay tribute at her vigil. Remembered that day  in tearful embraces, cutting through the sounds of the mariachi, and  echoed in shouts of ``Viva Carmen Ramirez!'' we can see the lasting  memory she leaves behind.   While she was taken too soon from family, friends, and her community,  we will always have the example she set--defined by moral leadership  and a fundamental care for others--to follow.   ``Viva Carmen Ramirez.''   Oxnard, Ventura County, and all of California mourns her  loss.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate  Bishop Charles E. Blake, Sr., on a lifetime of service to his community  and a career of caring for others.   Bishop Blake has served as pastor of the West Angeles Church of God  in Christ for 53 years--53 years as a pillar of Crenshaw and South Los  Angeles.   While it may be hard to believe, there was a time before the name  Blake was synonymous with Crenshaw. Charles E. Blake, Sr., was born in  Little Rock, AR, into a family of faith. His father was a preacher and  well-respected leader in the Pentecostal faith. Both Charles and his  brother, J.A., would go on to preach in the Church of God in Christ.   After his family moved to California and notably after his first  sermon at the age of 16, he attended California Western University and  subsequently earned his master's degree at the Interdenominational  Theological Center in Atlanta. It was there--as student body president,  surrounded by Black students and faculty, and as a leader of student  civil rights marches in Selma and Montgomery--where he began to see the  strength of Black community power.   In 1969, he became senior pastor of West Angeles Church, where his  powerful sermons from a pulpit in South Los Angeles grew his  congregation rapidly and brought together the community. By 1999, what  had once been a 300-person church on 5th Avenue and Adams Boulevard had  grown to require the construction of the ornate, 5,000-seat West  Angeles Cathedral.   Bishop Blake's unwavering faith and exalted message of devotion  earned his election as presiding bishop of the Church of God in Christ  four times, representing millions of worshippers around the globe. It  also led to his appointment by President Obama to the Inaugural  Advisory Council on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships.   But to countless families in South Los Angeles, whether attending a  Sunday service or watching the Crenshaw corridor grow around them, his  commitment to his community is what is most memorable. Over his decades  of leadership, he brought to Crenshaw affordable housing, a performing  arts theater, and a K-12 school; encouraged economic growth and  businesses that provided jobs to Angelenos; created programs to lift up  Black men with educational and financial literacy resources; and  secured invaluable attention and resources for neighborhoods in South  Los Angeles.   He invested in the Crenshaw corridor when it needed it most, and we  thank him for his faith and service.   All of California wishes him and his wife, Lady Mae L. Blake, well in  retirement, and we wish his son, Charles E. Blake II, luck in his new  role as senior pastor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate  Father Greg Boyle on 50 years of service as a Jesuit priest and as a  compassionate leader for families in East Los Angeles.   For over three decades, Father Boyle has served as founder and  director of Homeboy Industries, the largest gang rehabilitation and re- entry program in the world. Based in Los Angeles, Homeboy provides an  off-ramp for thousands of former gang members and at-risk youth.   Born in Los Angeles in 1954, Father Boyle first joined the Society of  Jesus in 1972. After being ordained as a priest in 1984, he went on to  serve Dolores Mission Church in Boyle Heights, where he saw the  severity of poverty and violence in Los Angeles that condemned  generations of Angelenos to hardship, incarceration, and--all too  often--the loss of loved ones.   But he didn't shy from the dangers before him or ignore a community  in need of care. Guided by the tenets of his faith--of nonviolence, of  love, of care for others--he brought together his parish and community  leaders to found what would later become Homeboy Industries. At its  start, the organization focused on providing educational resources and  employment services.   It would soon grow into a haven for hope for thousands of people in  East Los Angeles, throughout the region, and beyond. Through Homeboy  Bakery, Homeboy Diner, Homeboy Merchandise, and more, hundreds of  people find job training and a reason to get up and get better each and  every day. And once inside their doors, surrounded by people who have  been through similar challenges, Angelenos are provided support for  substance abuse, mental health services, and legal and educational  resources.   Each month, Homeboy Industries also provides free tattoo removal  services for nearly a thousand Californians to remove gang-related  tattoos, removing a common barrier to finding work, and providing  safety from visible signs of gang affiliation.   Father Boyle has lived his faith through action. Over five decades of  service, he has believed in the goodness inherent in each of us. He has  had the compassion to give second chances when others wouldn't. And for  those who needed a little light, true to his Jesuit mission, he has the  persistence to ``go forth and set the work aflame.''   In the ``lethal absence of hope,'' as he describes it, Father Boyle  has brought love, understanding, and a bright future to thousands of  Angelenos, and we are grateful for his service.  [[Page S6665]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Empowering and  Enforcing Environmental Justice Act to improve efforts at the  Department of Justice to hold polluters accountable and to build  capacity at State, local, and Tribal governments to do the same.   The Empowering and Enforcing Environmental Justice Act builds on the  recent announcement by the Department of Justice to launch a new Office  of Environmental Justice. My bill would make this new office permanent  and authorize $50 million in grant funding to assist State, local, and  Tribal governments with their own environmental enforcement efforts. It  would also create a new Section for Environmental Justice within the  Environment and Natural Resources Division to bring cases for  violations of environmental laws in low-income communities and  communities of color burdened by pollution.   Environmental hazards like air, water, and land pollution  disproportionately affect communities that have been historically  marginalized, such as Tribal communities, low-income populations, and  communities of color. Many of these communities have been further  neglected by decades of underinvestment in housing, transportation,  water and wastewater infrastructure, and healthcare. The codification  of a permanent Office of Environmental Justice will ensure that DOJ  coordinates with Federal, State, local, and Tribal agencies to advance  environmental justice and will give communities a seat at the table  where decisions impacting their communities are being made. Further, a  permanent Environmental Justice Section will help ensure that  environmental justice is at the forefront of DOJ's enforcement work  while improving enforcement of title VI of the Civil Rights Act to  investigate civil rights complaints related to environmental justice.   Finally, the new grant program this legislation would establish would  improve the capacity of State, local, and Tribal agencies to launch  their own environmental enforcement efforts--which is necessary for a  whole-of-government approach to reversing environmental injustice.   Enforcement of our Nation's bedrock environmental laws cannot be  something that ebbs and flows between administrations but must be a  constant commitment from the Federal Government to protecting the  communities most over-exposed to pollution. Enacting this legislation  will guarantee a long-term commitment by the Federal Government to  advancing environmental justice and to building healthier, cleaner  communities.   I am grateful to Representative Barragan for leading this effort in  the House of Representatives, and I am thankful that the Department of  Justice is willing to prioritize defending environmental justice. I  look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this bill as  quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Empowering and  Enforcing Environmental Justice Act to improve efforts at the  Department of Justice to hold polluters accountable and to build  capacity at State, local, and Tribal governments to do the same.
