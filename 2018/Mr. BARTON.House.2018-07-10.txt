 Mr. Speaker, as dean of the Texas delegation, I ask  unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas, the Honorable Michael  Cloud, be permitted to take the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce to the House of  Representatives the new Congressman for the 27th Congressional District  of Texas, the Honorable Michael Cloud.   Michael is a husband and a father. His wife and three children are  either in the gallery or on the floor. He lives in Victoria, Texas. He  is a graduate of Oral Roberts University, so the Oklahomans will enjoy  that.   He has been a Republican county chairman in his home county for 7  years. He has been a member of the State executive committee of the  Republican Party of Texas for a number of years.   He won a primary of six people. He got into a runoff and became the  Republican nominee. He won the special election against nine people. He  is the 10,949th Member of the House of Representatives. He is the 264th  Member to represent the great State of Texas. He is the 23rd Member to  represent Victoria, Texas, and he is the third Member to represent the  27th Congressional District of Texas.   I want to introduce to Mr. Cloud the House of Representatives. This  is the greatest legislative body in the world, whether you are  Don  Young, who has been here for more than four decades, or Debbie Lesko,  who has been here for less than 4 months.   You now have a voting card. You have an equal vote to all other  Members here. You are part of a group that has to be elected.   Not one Member is on this floor because they were appointed. They  were all elected by their constituents to represent the greatest Nation  in the world.   Congratulations, and welcome to the House of Representatives.                            ____________________
