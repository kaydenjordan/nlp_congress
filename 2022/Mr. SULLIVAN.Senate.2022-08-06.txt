 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5435, and I  ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask that the reading be waived.    Mr. President, we have a true crisis--a humanitarian  crisis, a national security crisis--right now on our southern border.   It is a huge tragedy that my Democratic colleagues want to ignore,  and that tragedy has spread across our Nation--crime; victims of human  trafficking, many of them children; a fentanyl epidemic killing our  young people; chaos--all fueled by a lawless border.   Secure borders work. Walls work. Just ask the Biden administration,  as they are quietly building sections of the wall in Arizona right now.   The Democrats' partisan reconciliation bill does nothing--nothing--to  address this crisis.   Instead, it gives DHS $500 million for sustainability and  environmental programs when our kids are dying from drugs streaming in  from the border, when our communities are under siege. This should not  be the priority for DHS.   My amendment would take this half a billion dollars and recommit it-- this DHS money--to building the wall and securing our border, which is  DHS's primary mission, not environmental programs.   I ask that all my colleagues vote yes on this commonsense amendment.    Mr. President, how much time do I have left?    I ask for the yeas and nays.
