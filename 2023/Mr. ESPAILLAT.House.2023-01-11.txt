 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 26.   H.R. 26 is presented within the context of what happened last year  when the Supreme Court stripped millions of women in our country of  their status and free right for equal access to reproductive freedom.   As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to correct this  wrong and bring back reproductive freedom for women. This bill is not  about the safety of children. This is more of the same. This is about  policing the bodies of women.   A bunch of middle-aged guys in Brooks Brothers' suits stand here  today and try to tell women what to do with their bodies. That is what  this is about. This is not about the safety of children. That is  already illegal.   Madam Speaker, I stand here to oppose H.R. 26. There are 64 million  women across America of reproductive age. Many of them live in States  that are beating up on their rights to reproductive freedom.   Madam Speaker, I stand here in opposition to H.R. 26 and ask my  colleagues also to vote against it.
