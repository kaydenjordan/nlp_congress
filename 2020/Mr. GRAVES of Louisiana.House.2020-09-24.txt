 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, let's look at this process. Here we have a bill that was  a bipartisan bill, H.R. 4447, that passed out  [[Page H4910]]  of the committee on a bipartisan vote, and it was eight pages. It was  eight pages.   Today, this bill is nearly 900 pages. Miraculously, from committee to  the floor, it just exploded and became nearly 900 pages of text. This  bill is now scored to cost the American taxpayers $135 billion.   This is an issue that we agree that we need to be discussing. We need  to be discussing America's energy future. We need to be discussing the  fact that Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, and other countries are trying  to decimate the American energy industry. They are trying to force our  dependence upon them.   Unfortunately, while there are some good components of this bill,  much of it plays into the hands of those very countries by forcing the  use or pushing the use of technologies by manipulating markets, by  distorting costs, that forces us to play into the hands of those  countries and become subject or dependent upon them for different  resources.                                time  1130    Mr. Speaker, the United States, as I have heard people talk about  emissions, we are the leader in the world in terms of reducing  emissions. The United States has reduced emissions more than every  other country.   People talk about emissions reduction. Under President Obama, there  was the Clean Power Plan. We have actually hit the Clean Power Plan  target established by President Obama, but we have done it 10 years  early.   We haven't done it by distorting markets. We haven't done it by  forcing the use of technologies. We have done it by letting the market  do what it does, by letting innovators innovate, like they do.   So to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I will say it again:  We absolutely would love to engage with you on America's energy future,  on how we ensure the use of clean energy technologies moving forward,  but also on building upon the success of the United States and how we  are the global leader in reducing emissions.   We don't have to have a Democrat bill. We have got all these  amendments. They have been thrown together en bloc, where maybe we have  a great amendment, but it is paired together with nine others that are  awful. This distorts the process, and it really makes us unable to even  represent our constituents at home.   So I want to urge: Let's sit down and engage in this bill in a  bipartisan way. Let's not take a bill that was 8 pages and add over 800  pages to it in the dark of night. Let's have a transparent process.  Let's let us vote on amendments that make sense, that ensure America's  energy future is based upon our resources, not those of Russia, not  those of China, as this bill does.   This is a fatally flawed process. It is not in the interests of  America. It is not in the interests of our children's and our  grandchildren's future, and it ignores the fact that America is the  leading reducer in emissions.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Oregon  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, first of all, I respond to comments earlier from my  friend from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), who noted that the Congressional  Budget Office's score on this bill was zero.   Madam Speaker, as we all know, this bill authorizes $135 billion in  new programs. And so if my friend from New Mexico is suggesting that  this whole thing is a charade and that my friends across the aisle do  not anticipate actually seeking appropriations for this legislation,  then it would be very interesting to hear those comments, but I think  to suggest that the bill does not implicate appropriations is simply  misleading, and I would urge that we have more transparency in this  process.   Madam Speaker, we have two amendments that are in this en bloc, and  what they do is, they focus on the critical minerals, the rare Earth  minerals that are important components of renewable energy. It is what  is used in solar panels. It is what is used in energy storage  technology. You can't suddenly say, Hey, we are going to use  renewables, and not address this component.   What happens is the United States has become energy independent, and  we have done that because of the policies that have been enacted over  the last few years. What this bill does is, by not addressing the  critical minerals, we become energy dependent again. We become  dependent upon China, dependent upon Africa, and other nations where  China controls the resources. Why would we do that to ourselves?   So we have an amendment in this en bloc that helps to address that  because we have those minerals right here in the United States. Why in  the world would we go mine them in other countries that have lower  environmental standards to where you have a net adverse impact on the  global environment?   Madam Speaker, this is trying to nationalize California policy--the  8th worst emissions in the United States is in California, twice the  electricity costs of my home State of Louisiana. Why would we want to  do that to Americans, disproportionately impacting the poor?   So we set up this farce process where this amendment goes down to  where we miss the opportunity to ensure that we truly advance an  America-first independent energy policy.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this underlying legislation.
