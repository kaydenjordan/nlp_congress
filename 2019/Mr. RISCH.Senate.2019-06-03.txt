Hard work, innovation, and  perseverance are some of the characteristics that have helped so many  of our Nation's citizens achieve the American Dream. As a member and  former chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, it is my distinct privilege to recognize Partner  Steel Co. as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for June 2019.   Partner Steel Co. first opened its doors in Pocatello, ID, in 1947 as  a custom steel fabricator and wholesaler. Since then, Partner Steel has  expanded to provide Idaho-made products not only to Idahoans, but to  consumers all over the world. Partner Steel uses high-quality raw  materials to produce custom creations, meeting the unique needs of each  individual customer. As a commercial steel supplier, Partner Steel Co.  provides steel to large and small clients across the United States.   Spanning beyond the realm of commercial steel supply and custom steel  fabrication, Partner Steel Co. has an outdoor camping equipment line.  They create products such as camping stoves, Dutch ovens, griddles,  coffee pots and water purifiers for outdoor sanitation. These camping  supplies have generated an international customer base, from the United  States to Canada, Europe, and Australia.   After operating Partner Steel for more than five decades, the Partner  family decided to sell the business in 2005. Having worked at Partner  Steel for more than 30 years, Rick Eskelson had a deep understanding of  the operations of the company, and he and his wife Debbie made the  decision to buy the business. Now owners for 15 years, the Eskelsons  have continued supplying steel products to Pocatello residents and  consumers around the globe.   In addition to operating their small business, the Eskelsons have  prioritized reinvesting into the Pocatello community. Rick and Debbie  are avid supporters of the local 4H club, local sports teams and high  schools, and are involved in the Pocatello business community.   It is my honor to recognize Rick and Debbie Eskelson and the  employees of Partner Steel Co. for their outstanding contributions to  the Pocatello community. You make our State proud, and I look forward  to your continued success.                            ____________________
