 Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Roe).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, first of all, the statement that this bill caps or  limits States on economic or noneconomic damages is incorrect. In fact,  I would point the gentlewoman from Texas to page 6 of the bill, that  says, under State Flexibility, that specifies a particular monetary  amount of economic or economic damages, there is no provision in this  section that shall be construed to preempt State law. We wrote that  specifically to respect the States' rights.   I recall a number of these pieces of legislation that have come  before this Congress. I can remember it back at least until 2007. I was  uneasy about the constitutionality because it did reach in and preempt  State law.   And I am a respecter of States' rights, but we have a Federal  interest in healthcare. That is the provision that is written into the  bill. If there are Federal dollars involved, if it is a Federal  program, then the Federal Government has an interest in limiting these  damages.   We capped the damages in this bill, not the economic damages. Those  real damages that are economic damages are fully compensated, without  limit, without cap, and without the interference of this law, unless  States choose to cap economic damages.   Noneconomic damages, however, are capped at $250,000; and that  $250,000 cap is something that has existed in California State law for  more than 40 years, signed into law by the very durable Jerry Brown.  But if the States want to change that, if they want to raise the cap  beyond $250,000, that is their right to do so. We specify that in the  bill.   I would like to discuss a need for this bill. It is necessary to  preserve fiscal sanity in Federal healthcare policy. And I would like  to point out, also, at the outset that this bill only applies to claims  concerning the provision of goods and services for which coverage is  provided in whole or in part by a Federal program, a Federal subsidy,  or a Federal tax benefit. It is a clear, clear, Mr. Chairman, Federal  nexus. Wherever Federal policy affects the distribution of healthcare,  there is a clear Federal interest.   So, the bill's commonsense reforms, which have been the law in  California for over 40 years and that the CBO has scored a couple of  times here--the previous score was $54 billion; this score is $50  billion--is over $50 billion in savings to the people who are paying  for healthcare in this country, and that includes our taxpayers and the  healthcare users.   But the $250,000 cap is reasonable. It has sustained itself over  those 40 years in California, and it is good enough for other States to  emulate.   When I hear some pushback from Texas, I am kind of thinking they want  to keep the system they have, and they don't want to have to compete  with the rest of the country. I think we might lose a vote or two to  from Texas on that alone: We have ours; we don't want America to have  anything like that because then we have to compete with all of America.   This bill will allow courts to require periodic payments for future  damages instead of lump sum awards. That helps limit bankruptcies so  plaintiffs that might receive only pennies on the dollar can be  prevented. And it includes provisions creating a ``fair share'' rule by  which damages are allocated fairly in direct proportion to fault. That  has got to help a lot when you are thinking about the cost of  healthcare.   The bill does all this without in any way limiting compensation for  100 percent of the plaintiffs' economic losses, which include anything  to which a receipt can be attached, including all medical costs, lost  wages, future lost wages, rehabilitation costs, or any other economic  out-of-pocket loss suffered as a result of a healthcare injury.   Far from limiting deserved recoveries in California, these reforms  have led to medical damage awards in deserving cases, Mr. Chairman, in  the area of the $80 million to $90 million range.   The Washington Post reported a few months ago: ``U.S. healthcare  spending . . . is projected to accelerate over the next decade. . . . A  study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects that  the average growth in health spending will be even faster in 2016'' on  up through the decade of 2025. ``The projections are based on an  assumption that the legislative status quo will prevail.''   If we don't change the law, we are going to see these costs going up.   As Nate Silver pointed out in The New York Times, not my favorite  document: ``All the major categories of Federal Government spending  have been increasing relative to inflation. But essentially all of the  increase in spending relative to economic growth and the potential tax  base has come from entitlement programs, and about half of all of that  has come from healthcare entitlements specifically.''   Studies show that as healthcare costs rise, wages fall; and the more  companies pay in healthcare costs, the less they can pay in wages. So  when healthcare costs increase and that growth increases, wages  stagnate; and when healthcare costs growth slows, wages go up.   Members who want to see wages increase should vote for this bill--it  is good for the healthcare workers--because one of the drivers of  higher healthcare spending is so-called defensive medicine.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 2  minutes.   That is a very real phenomenon confirmed by countless studies in  which healthcare workers conduct many additional costly tests and  procedures with no medical value. That is charged to our Federal  taxpayers, and it is simply to avoid excessive litigation costs.   A survey published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that 91  percent of the over 1,000 doctors surveyed ``reported believing that  physicians order more tests and procedures than needed to protect  themselves from malpractices suits.''    The study also asked: ``Are protections against unwarranted medical  malpractice lawsuits needed to decrease the unnecessary use of  diagnostic tests?'' And the answer, an identical number: 91 percent of  the doctors surveyed agreed.   But there is one Newsweek reporter who described the personal  experience of individual doctors this way: ``Typical was one doctor,  who had a list as long as my arm of procedures ER docs perform . . .  for no patient benefit. They include following a bedside sonogram . . .  with an ``official'' sonogram because it's easier to defend yourself to  a jury if you've ordered the second one; a CT scan for every child who  bumped his or her head, to rule out things that can be diagnosed just  fine by observation; X-rays that do not guide treatment, such as for a  simple broken arm; CTs for suspected appendicitis that has been  perfectly well diagnosed without it.   ``Although doctors may hate practicing defensive medicine, they do it  so they don't get sued. . . . Nationwide, physicians estimate that 35  percent of diagnostic tests they ordered were to avoid lawsuits, as  were 19 percent of hospitalizations, 14 percent of prescriptions, and 8  percent of surgeries. . . . All told,'' according to the Newsweek  article, $650 billion in unnecessary care every year was provided by  these doctors. Another ER doctor said he ordered 52 CT scans in one 12- hour shift for a total of $104,000 in a single day.   These are the things we are dealing with, Mr. Chairman.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 1  minute.   One of the most recent studies, published a few months ago in the  Journal of the American College of Radiology studied the effects of  tort reform on  [[Page H5269]]  just radiographic tests alone and found that there were ``2.4 million  to 2.7 million fewer radiographic tests annually attributed to tort  reforms.''   Just imagine what savings would occur if such reforms were attached  to all Federal healthcare programs, as this bill would do.                                time  1445    It causes me to think of an orthopedic surgeon who told me that he  can diagnose an ACL almost every time, yet he is compelled by his  liability insurance to do additional tests, 97 percent of which are  unnecessary.   That is the kind of thing we are dealing with, Mr. Chairman, and it  is time for us to bring sanity to this litigation that we have in this  country.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, it is just interesting to me to hear this discussion  about the Senate addressing the healthcare situation in America. I  stood on this floor time, after time, after time, and in 2010, March 23  of 2010, the final passage of ObamaCare was sent out of the Congress to  the President of the United States, who signed it immediately before  the sun could come up in the morning.   And I was sick at heart at what happened to our Constitution, our  rule of law, our individual rights. And now we have a mess of a  healthcare system in America. This is a component of the fix. We don't  have a single Democrat in the House or Senate that is willing to even  commit to work with us to put up a single vote to try to improve the  healthcare system in America.   They made a mistake, and they passed ObamaCare. They served it over  to us and said: Now you fix it. Well, we are going to declare it a mess  no matter what you do. We are going to fix it. It is going to take some  time.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, as you listen to the stories that are here that have  been delivered by the gentleman from Florida, I am wondering why we  haven't heard these stories come out of California. Because this  legislation essentially mirrors California legislation. That was the  model that we followed. And they have had over 40 years to repeal or  amendment it, and it has been sustainable.   There is a right to a jury trial under this. It is just that there  are caps that are set, that are reasonable caps, and the States are  free to change those caps up or down.   So I don't quite follow this, but I would say someone who is raped in  a nursing home is not covered under this. This legislation doesn't  affect it at all. It has to have an affect by a diagnosis, a  prevention, or a treatment of a disease impairment; and a rape is not  that. So it would not be covered under this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I know that my opposition would like to have this  legislation killed. I would just point out something that I heard on  the floor of the House here about 10 years ago, and it was this: We can  pass this legislation, but the Senate may not pass it. And I would urge  them to take it up. There is a special interest, and it is the Trial  Lawyers Association. They are the ones who will not come out of this  very well.  [[Page H5270]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, I point out also that this bill keeps these cases in  State court. It doesn't move them to Federal court. Previous  legislation that has been brought to this floor, a decade or so ago,  did move a lot of these cases to Federal court. But it is carefully  drafted to keep this with the maximum amount of respect for States'  rights that can be held and still have a Federal interest.   There has to be a Federal interest in every dollar involved in this.  In every single case, there has to be Federal dollars involved in it,  or this bill wouldn't affect it at all. And so I am one who is also a  great respecter of States' rights. And in this legislation, as drafted,  there are provisions in there over and over again that protect as many  of the States' rights as can be. And if you take the other side of this  argument, then it is far stronger that the right of the Federal  Government would be usurped by the States if we don't have this  legislation.   That is what is taking place now--States that choose not to make a  decision, not to set caps, and we are seeing huge settlements going on  around the country. This is what we want to end, so that we can save  the $50 to $54 billion for the taxpayers. But the thing that is even  worth more than this is, how much of that $650 billion in defensive  medicine will no longer be used in this country, and how much safer and  less expensive will our healthcare be in America?   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, I was a little surprised to hear that a judge in the  State of Washington had ruled that caps are unconstitutional. In fact,  it is kind of curious to hear the same arguments--or conflicting  arguments coming out of the other side. One of them says it is the  States' rights to be able to set the caps. The other one says it is  unconstitutional to set the caps. So I think that conflict, it would be  good if that were resolved.   I think, in either case, that I disagree with both of those  positions, Mr. Chairman.   If a Washington State judge says caps are unconstitutional, on what  basis?   That would say, then, that a State legislature couldn't cap them;  Congress can't cap them; that this is essentially, then, a function of  the courts.   I remember a decision that came out of the State of Washington. It  was a Federal judge that essentially ruled that the President's  executive order on, let's say, migrants coming into the United States  was unconstitutional, even though Congress specifically granted the  authority to their President. So I am not going to defer to a single  judge's opinion in that fashion.   I would point out, too, that we do protect States' rights. There is  provision in this bill after provision, and it is titled State  Flexibility. Look through their and find all the provisions of State  Flexibility where we respect States' rights. And it is written as  carefully as it can be to respect the maximum amount of States' rights.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds.   I would just point out to the body that I didn't hear a single fact  in the previous 2 minutes. It is all opinion and hurled accusations.  But I think it is important for this body to deliberate over the facts  themselves, and I have delivered a lot of that data.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, I would point out, first of all, the gentleman from  Maryland must know that this isn't a criminal statute. This is civil  law. It doesn't have anything to do with crime or criminal law, so  let's keep our discussion to the civil actions that we are discussing  here.   It is not propaganda. It is facts that we have delivered on this  side. So I want to put this into the Record verbatim, Mr. Chairman.  Regarding cases of rape or physical abuse, H.R. 1215 does not cover  such cases at all. That is because the bill only applies to medical  malpractice claims based on the provision or use of healthcare  services; and healthcare services are defined in the bill as things  related to the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any human disease  or impairment.   Clearly, rape or any other physical abuse, and the neglect of basic  sanitary conditions, is not related to the diagnosis, prevention, or  treatment of any human disease or impairment. So in cases involving  rape or physical abuse by anyone, or neglect of basic needs, the bill  simply does not apply.   But it does respect States' rights. It is carefully written to  protect States' rights. It is a significant and huge improvement upon  some efforts we have seen in the past, and one of those reasons is  because many of us care about States' rights, and we pay attention to  the Constitution. There is a Federal nexus in everything that goes on  here, and States are not limited from raising caps on economic or  noneconomic damages or lowering those caps. We respect the States in  every way possible, and still get a positive result out of H.R. 1215.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Chairman, I have heard the gentleman from Maryland say that this  legislation would override the laws of 28 States. That was a surprise  to me to hear that when I heard the number before Rules Committee,  which I think I actually recall it was 27. But 28, 27, it doesn't  override laws. It is the absence of laws.   There are States that don't have caps. That is what we are talking  about here. So it is not overriding State laws in States where there  are no laws. It simply is setting a Federal foundation and a guideline  for them.   And if I am in a State legislature, I know I have the authority to  raise or lower the cap on economic and on noneconomic damages, and that  my laws are not being overridden, but they are being provided by the  wisdom of the American people, then I am going to be thankful I have  that to work with until I can amend it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I inquire as to the amount of time I  have remaining.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First, I say in response to the gentleman from Maryland's discussion  about the States courts that have prohibited caps. That is one of the  reasons that we need this legislation, is that you have out-of-control  liberal judges that have decided that even their State legislatures  can't pass the laws. They want to come in and preempt the states'  rights of we, the people, of the individual States who elect their  general assemblies to make their decisions.   Often, the judges are set in lifetime appointments where they are not  held accountable, so it would be interesting to look back into each of  these States that the gentleman from Maryland has mentioned and address  this thing from ``we, the people'' because we, the people, are the  power in this country. Our rights come from God, and they are vested in  we, the people.   I thought the gentleman from Pennsylvania's look at H.R. 1215 was a  really deft way to focus on this and speak about the Magna Carta, but  there wasn't anybody back in old England in that time that had any shot  at filing a liability claim, let alone receiving a frivolous claim that  would make one individual vastly wealthy at the expense of a lot of  other folks. So this is something that has accumulated over the last  502 years since the Magna Carta was signed.   So I would say this: healthcare costs are out of control due in large  part to unlimited lawsuits and other problems ObamaCare failed to solve  or else ObamaCare made worse. H.R. 1215 is commonsense litigation  reform legislation that will rein in overly aggressive and healthcare  lawsuits while preserving the ability of plaintiffs to recover  unlimited economic damages.   The bill applies only to claims concerning the provision of  healthcare goods or services for which coverage is provided in whole or  in part by a Federal program, a Federal subsidy, or a Federal tax  benefit giving it a clear Federal nexus.   This isn't criminal legislation. It doesn't address the cases of  rape. We should arrest those people and lock them up in prison and  punish them to the max, but it is not the subject of this legislation.   So wherever the Federal policy directly affects the distribution of  [[Page H5273]]  healthcare, there is a clear Federal interest in reducing the cost of  such Federal policy. This bill's commonsense reforms, which have been  the law in California for over 40 years, are conservatively estimated  by CBO to save at least $50 billion. The previous estimate was $54  billion in Federal healthcare dollars. At the same time, this bill  doesn't in any way limit compensation for 100 percent of plaintiffs'  losses.   As reported in The Washington Post last month, the U.S. healthcare  spending is projected to accelerate over the next day. A study by the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services project that the average  growth in healthcare spending will be even faster between 2016 and  2025. The projections are based on an assumption that the legislative  status quo will prevail. Studies show that, as healthcare costs rise,  wages fall. H.R. 1215 will save billions of dollars in healthcare costs  and will, thereby, increase wages for workers nationwide.    Mr. Chairman, as I look at the picture of how I watched this  defensive medicine grow over the years and over the decades, $650  billion potentially, reported by a Newsweek article, in unnecessary  defensive medicine tests that are done. A doctor that ordered CT scans  in massive numbers in a single day, when I see 97 percent of the MRIs  just to be sure that the diagnosis of an ACL knee injury is protected  in the case of liability insurance, we are not going to see just $50  billion in savings here. We are going to see hundreds of billions of  dollars in savings.   And as an anesthesiologist told me that--he was practicing in Texas-- when Texas passed the law that is roughly a mirror of California law,  that his premium as an anesthesiologist was $26,000 a year; and after  the law passed in Texas, it dropped to $6,500, exactly one-fourth. A 75  percent reduction in that particular case. He is now practicing in  Iowa. Iowa passed mirror legislation as well.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this vital legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.   In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by  the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, it shall be in  order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment  under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute  consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-10. That amendment  in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.   The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as  follows:                                 H.R. 1215         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting       Access to Care Act of 2017''.        (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act       is as follows:         Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.        Sec. 2. Encouraging speedy resolution of claims.        Sec. 3. Compensating patient injury.        Sec. 4. Maximizing patient recovery.        Sec. 5. Authorization of payment of future damages to             claimants in health care lawsuits.        Sec. 6. Product liability for health care providers.        Sec. 7. Definitions.        Sec. 8. Effect on other laws.        Sec. 9. Rules of construction.        Sec. 10. Effective date.       SEC. 2. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.         (a) Statute of Limitations.--The time for the commencement       of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 years after the date of       injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the       use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the       injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time       for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years       after the date of injury unless tolled for any of the       following--        (1) upon proof of fraud;        (2) intentional concealment; or        (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no       therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of       the injured person.      Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the       date of the injury except that actions by a minor under the       full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of       injury, or 1 year after the injury is discovered, or through       the use of reasonable diligence should have been discovered,       or prior to the minor's 8th birthday, whichever provides a       longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for       minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a       health care provider have committed fraud or collusion in the       failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured minor.        (b) State Flexibility.--No provision of subsection (a)       shall be construed to preempt any state law (whether       effective before, on, or after the date of the enactment of       this Act) that--        (1) specifies a time period of less than 3 years after the       date of injury or less than 1 year after the claimant       discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should       have discovered, the injury, for the filing of a health care       lawsuit;        (2) that specifies a different time period for the filing       of lawsuits by a minor;        (3) that triggers the time period based on the date of the       alleged negligence; or        (4) establishes a statute of repose for the filing of       health care lawsuit.       SEC. 3. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.         (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses       in Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing       in this Act shall limit a claimant's recovery of the full       amount of the available economic damages, notwithstanding the       limitation in subsection (b).        (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care       lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages, if available,       shall not exceed $250,000, regardless of the number of       parties against whom the action is brought or the number of       separate claims or actions brought with respect to the same       injury.        (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--For       purposes of applying the limitation in subsection (b), future       noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value.       The jury shall not be informed about the maximum award for       noneconomic damages. An award for noneconomic damages in       excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either before the entry       of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after entry of       judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting       for any other reduction in damages required by law. If       separate awards are rendered for past and future noneconomic       damages and the combined awards exceed $250,000, the future       noneconomic damages shall be reduced first.        (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each       party shall be liable for that party's several share of any       damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each       party shall be liable only for the amount of damages       allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party's       percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of       liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment       shall be rendered against each such party for the amount       allocated to such party. For purposes of this section, the       trier of fact shall determine the proportion of       responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.        (e) State Flexibility.--No provision of this section shall       be construed to preempt any State law (whether effective       before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act)       that specifies a particular monetary amount of economic or       noneconomic damages (or the total amount of damages) that may       be awarded in a health care lawsuit, regardless of whether       such monetary amount is greater or lesser than is provided       for under this section.       SEC. 4. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.         (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to       Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall       supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect       against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of       reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid       to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in       which the attorney for a party claims a financial stake in       the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall       have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage       recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to       the claimant based upon the interests of justice and       principles of equity. In no event shall the total of all       contingent fees for representing all claimants in a health       care lawsuit exceed the following limits:        (1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the       claimant(s).        (2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000       recovered by the claimant(s).        (3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by       the claimant(s).        (4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by       the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.        (b) Applicability.--The limitations in this section shall       apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement,       mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative       dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involving a       minor or incompetent person, a court retains the authority to       authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum       permitted under this section. The requirement for court       supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a)       applies only in civil actions.        (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this section shall       be construed to preempt any State law (whether effective       before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act)       that specifies a lesser percentage or lesser total value of       damages which may be claimed by an attorney representing a       claimant in a health care lawsuit.

The provisions governing health care lawsuits set       forth in this Act supersede chapter 171 of title 28, United       States Code, to the extent that such chapter--        (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent       fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be       commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope  [[Page H5275]]       of periodic payment of future damages, than provided in this       Act; or        (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding       collateral source benefits, or mandates or permits       subrogation or a lien on collateral source benefits.        (b) Protection of States' Rights and Other Laws.--Any issue       that is not governed by any provision of law established by       or under this Act (including State standards of negligence)       shall be governed by otherwise applicable State or Federal       law        (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this Act shall be       construed to preempt any defense available to a party in a       health care lawsuit under any other provision of State or       Federal law.       SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act shall apply to any health care lawsuit brought in       a Federal or State court, or subject to an alternative       dispute resolution system, that is initiated on or after the       date of the enactment of this Act, except that any health       care lawsuit arising from an injury occurring prior to the       date of the enactment of this Act shall be governed by the       applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect at the       time the cause of action accrued.    The CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115- 179. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in  the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered  as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report  equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall  not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for  division of the question.                   Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Sessions    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  House Report 115-179.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   I want to express, Mr. Chairman, how much I appreciate the work that  has been done by so many people and their part in this bill.   I rise in support of this improving amendment--it comes out of the  minds of Texas, I might add--which would clarify the timing of the  statute of limitations in the provision base of the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of the Sessions amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  leadership on the Rules Committee and in many other ways; and I also  thank Dr. Burgess, another gentleman from Texas on the Rules Committee  whose amendment is being offered by Mr. Sessions.   As I listen to this dialogue, Mr. Chairman, I am just thinking that  States do have rights. They have the right to control any of the  healthcare services that are funded by individuals or States. This only  affects that because it has Federal dollars in it. We drive at a 55- mile-an-hour speed limit because the Federal Government sets that.   So I rise in support of this amendment, but the States are not  funding Medicare, Medicaid, or ObamaCare.    Mr. Chair, I am happy to accept the time from the  gentleman from Tennessee and make the point that hasn't been made very  well here today that--apparently, not well enough or the gentleman  wouldn't have yielded the time to me, I don't believe--where there are  Federal dollars involved, there have been Federal regulations that have  matched along with that.   We have written all kinds of legislation in this Congress, a lot of  which I disagreed with. But there was a Federal nexus, and it hasn't  been litigated successfully time after time after time.   We saw ObamaCare itself was litigated over and over again and the  Supreme Court came down with rulings that let that legislation stand.  That is one of the reasons why we have the angst that we have today.   But the case that this usurps States' rights is thin. It is not  without some consequence, but it is very thin. We have gone way over to  the other side, and we have written everything that we can possibly  write into this bill that respects the rights of States. There is  always a Federal nexus--we can count on that--and it is so small in  comparison to so many other Federal things. Some of the things in our  Federal Government are overreach. This is not. This is a minimal, de  minimis reach in order to regulate over-the-top trial lawyers, who are  the ones who are the only losers today, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Dr. Roe, the gentleman from  Tennessee, for bringing this amendment.   Looking at the language here, it is interesting that the concern was  that the witnesses may not be available within a large State. I notice,  as I read the language, that unless the person was licensed for  practice in the State or a contiguous border State--that is pretty  good. If you are Hawaii, maybe not so good. But Dr. Roe, typical to his  style, anticipated these things by putting the waiver authority in the  last provision in the amendment, which says: ``The court may waive the  requirements in this subsection if it determines that the appropriate  witnesses otherwise would not be available.''   So this is a sound, well thought-out directive that ensures that we  have a high level of professionalism.   When the gentleman earlier talked about a jury of your peers, what  about having professionals who are highly credentialed that do  understand the locality and the normal practices within the region?   So not only do I support this amendment, but I encourage its  adoption. It requires expert witnesses to have knowledge of the  standard of care in their local communities. It is a commonsense  amendment, and I urge its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding  time to me.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this improving amendment which  would save even more Federal taxpayer dollars by requiring the filing  of affidavits of merit from an appropriately qualified specialist,  requiring that expert witnesses have speciality backgrounds relevant to  the case, allowing doctors to apologize without fear of penalty, and  requiring a 90-day cooling-off period before lawsuits can be filed to  facilitate voluntary settlements.   I urge its adoption by the House, and I would point out that, as the  gentleman from Tennessee referred to a fraternity of healthcare  professionals as if somehow they couldn't come to an objective decision  on their own profession, there has to be a fraternity of lawyers that  are making these decisions for all of America right now. What we are  seeking to do today is to bring this back to common sense, bring it  back to we the people, keep it within the bounds of the Constitution,  and reduce the cost of healthcare across America $54 billion, and we  are looking at a potential for $650 billion a year.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  [[Page H5283]]    Mr. Chairman, I have a statement before me from Chairman Goodlatte,  the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee. I am going to represent  this as his statement, but the chairman thanks the gentleman from  Kentucky for his clarification while he remains opposed to the  amendment because it provides an overly broad definition of the  eligible professional organizations authorized to issue the guidelines  that would be used as an affirmative defense, and because it is not  supported by the wider coalition of medical groups supporting the base  bill. He looks forward to working with the gentleman to further refine  and improve his legislative proposal.   That concludes Chairman Goodlatte's statement that he would like read  into this Record.   And I would say on my own behalf, Mr. Chairman, that I very much  appreciate the work that Mr. Barr has brought to this. The language  that he presented originally, that had to be amended in order to  conform with the parliamentarian, I believe, does define this with  clarity. So I am inclined to support the gentleman from Kentucky. We  will see what happens if there is a recorded vote.
