 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas.   This en bloc includes my amendments to strike the EV funding program.  Do you know why? Because the EV funding program pays the Communist  Party of China. That is who it pays. You don't have to believe me. You  can just listen to the chairman. He said it in his remarks, right? That  is the future, and China is building it. That is where your money is  going.   My amendment also prohibits loans to high-speed rail projects that  fail to meet the FRA safety standards, our safety standards. We just  ask that they meet them. But since they don't, we shouldn't be building  them.   It strikes the carbon reduction program. Why? Because that, again,  pays the Communist Party of China. It prohibits Amtrak from expanding  their network because they can't afford the network they have now. You  don't believe me? Talk to Mr. Butterfield. He just talked about it.   It strikes the Capital Investment Grant program because all of  America shouldn't pay for a couple of pet projects in somebody's  location.   It strikes the section restricting the right of States to set their  speed limits because, I don't know, I think there should be a different  speed limit in Center City Philadelphia than one in Nebraska or across  Wyoming.  [[Page H3543]]                                     time  2000    Now, Madam Speaker, I am grateful to have some amendments finally  heard here, but this system is broken. The Speaker and the majority  have chosen a closed process that restricts debate.   Why have they done it?   Because they are scared to death of the radical green left. That is  what we are doing here is supporting the Green New Deal and Communist  China.
