 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (S. 1694) to require any Federal agency that  issues licenses to conduct lunar activities to include in the  requirements for such licenses an agreement relating to the  preservation and protection of the Apollo 11 landing site, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1694         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H7220]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``One Small Step to Protect       Human Heritage in Space Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched       from the John F. Kennedy Space Center carrying Neil A.       Armstrong, Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin, Jr., and Michael       Collins.        (2) July 20, 2019, marked the 50th anniversary of the date       on which the Apollo 11 spacecraft landed on the Moon and Neil       Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot       on a celestial body off the Earth.        (3) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft and humanity's       first off-world footprints are achievements unparalleled in       history, a direct product of the work and perseverance of the       more than 400,000 individuals who contributed to the       development of the Apollo missions on the shoulders of       centuries of science and engineering pioneers from all       corners of the world.        (4) Among the thousands of individuals who have contributed       to the achievements of the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration (in this section referred to as ``NASA'') are       African-American women such as Katherine Johnson, Dorothy       Vaughn, Mary Jackson, and Dr. Christine Darden, who made       critical contributions to NASA space programs. Katherine       Johnson worked at NASA for 35 years and calculated the       trajectory of the Apollo 11 landing and the trajectories for       the spaceflights of astronauts Alan Shepard and John Glenn.       Katherine Johnson, together with many other individuals the       work of whom often went unacknowledged, helped broaden the       scope of space travel and charted new frontiers for       humanity's exploration of space.        (5) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft was made on       behalf of all humankind, and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin       were accompanied by messages of peace from the leaders of       more than 70 countries.        (6) The lunar landing sites of the Apollo 11 spacecraft,       the robotic spacecraft that preceded the Apollo 11 mission,       and the crewed and robotic spacecraft that followed, are of       outstanding universal value to humanity.        (7) Such landing sites--        (A) are the first archaeological sites with human activity       that are not on Earth;        (B) provide evidence of the first achievements of humankind       in the realm of space travel and exploration; and        (C) contain artifacts and other evidence of human       exploration activities that remain a potential source of       cultural, historical, archaeological, anthropological,       scientific, and engineering knowledge.        (8) On July 20, 2011, NASA published the voluntary guidance       entitled ``NASA's Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities:       How to Protect and Preserve the Historic and Scientific Value       of U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts''.        (9) In March 2018, the Office of Science and Technology       Policy published a report entitled ``Protecting & Preserving       Apollo Program Lunar Landing Sites & Artifacts''.        (10) Article one of the ``Treaty on Principles Governing       the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer       Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,''       commonly known as the ``Outer Space Treaty,'' states       ``[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial       bodies, shall be free for exploration and use by all States       without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of equality       and in accordance with international law, and there shall be       free access to all areas of celestial bodies.''        (11) Article eight of the Outer Space Treaty states, ``[a]       State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object       launched into outer space is carried shall retain       jurisdiction and control over such object, and over any       personnel thereof, while in outer space or on a celestial       body. Ownership of objects launched into outer space,       including objects landed or constructed on a celestial body,       and of their component parts, is not affected by their       presence in outer space or on a celestial body or by their       return to the Earth.''        (12) Article nine of the Outer Space Treaty states, ``[i]n       the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon       and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty       shall be guided by the principle of co-operation and mutual       assistance and shall conduct all their activities in outer       space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, with       due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States       Parties to the Treaty,'' and continues, ``[i]f a State Party       to the Treaty has reason to believe that an activity or       experiment planned by it or its nationals in outer space,       including the moon and other celestial bodies, would cause       potentially harmful interference with activities of other       States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer       space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, it       shall undertake appropriate international consultations       before proceeding with any such activity or experiment. A       State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an       activity or experiment planned by another State Party in       outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies,       would cause potentially harmful interference with activities       in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including       the moon and other celestial bodies, may request consultation       concerning the activity or experiment.''.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) as commercial enterprises and more countries acquire       the ability to land on the Moon, it is necessary to encourage       the development of best practices to respect the principle of       due regard and to limit harmful interference to the Apollo       landing site artifacts in acknowledgment of the human effort       and innovation they represent, as well as their       archaeological, anthropological, historical, scientific, and       engineering significance and value; and        (2) the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration should continue to develop best practices to       respect the principle of due regard and limit harmful       interference with historic Apollo lunar landing site       artifacts.       SEC. 3. BEST PRACTICES RELATED TO APOLLO HISTORIC LUNAR                     LANDING SITE ARTIFACTS.         (a) In General.--The Administrator of the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration shall--        (1) add the recommendations in subsection (b) as a       condition or requirement to contracts, grants, agreements,       partnerships or other arrangements pertaining to lunar       activities carried out by, for, or in partnership with the       National Aeronautics and Space Administration;        (2) inform other relevant Federal agencies of the       recommendations described in subsection (b); and        (3) encourage the use of best practices, consistent with       the recommendations in subsection (b), by other relevant       Federal agencies.        (b) Recommendations Described.--The recommendations       described in this subsection are--        (1) ``NASA's Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities: How       to Protect and Preserve the Historic and Scientific Value of       U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts'' issued by the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration on July 20, 2011, and       updated on October 28, 2011; and        (2) any successor recommendations, guidelines, best       practices, or standards relating to the principle of due       regard and the limitation of harmful interference with Apollo       landing site artifacts issued by the National Aeronautics and       Space Administration.        (c) Exemption.--The Administrator may waive the conditions       or requirements from subsection (a)(1) as it applies to an       individual contract, grant, agreement, partnership or other       arrangement pertaining to lunar activities carried out by,       for, or in partnership with the National Aeronautics and       Space Administration so long as--        (1) such waiver is accompanied by a finding from the       Administrator that carrying out the obligation of subsection       (a)(1) would be unduly prohibitive to an activity or       activities of legitimate and significant historical,       archaeological, anthropological, scientific, or engineering       value; and        (2) the finding in paragraph (1) is provided to the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate not later than 30 days prior to       the waiver taking effect.     HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 1694, the bill now  under consideration.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1694, the One Small Step to  Protect Human Heritage in Space Act.   First, I thank Senators Peters and Cruz for their leadership in the  Senate on this important legislation, as well as Chairwoman Johnson and  Ranking Member Lucas and Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Ranking  Member Babin, along with myself, for introducing the companion bill in  the House of Representatives, which we are all cosponsors of.   Mr. Speaker, I think we can all recognize the incredible  accomplishments of the United States and our leadership in space and  particularly when, 51 years ago, our Nation sent Apollo 11 on its  journey to the Moon and back, when some 650 million people tuned in to  watch this historic first Moon landing and see astronaut Neil Armstrong  take humankind's first step onto the lunar surface.   Now, half a century later, the rugged boot print of Neil Armstrong's  and Buzz Aldrin's feet and their walk on  [[Page H7221]]  the Moon remain at Tranquility Base. The first American flag to be  planted on the Moon's surface still marks the site of their landing, as  do the scientific hardware and other items that Armstrong and Aldrin  left behind.   These objects and others from the Apollo era tell the story of  humankind's extraordinary journey to the Moon. They have historical,  archaeological, and inspirational value, and it is up to us to work to  protect them.   Mr. Speaker, following the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon  landing, the One Small Step Act both recognizes the achievements of the  Apollo program and takes important measures to preserve our Nation's  human heritage in space, heritage such as the rover tracks, footprints,  scientific experiments, and spacecraft hardware, among others, at these  lunar landing sites.   Now, today, as more and more actors enter the space arena, including  other nations and commercial entities with plans to carry out lunar  activities, and we as a nation are working our way to send humans back  to the Moon and then on to Mars as part of our deep space exploration  program, it is more important today than ever that we take action to  protect the historic artifacts that memorialize our first exploration  of the Moon and the advancements achieved by the Apollo program. The  One Small Step Act does this by taking timely action based on guidance  from NASA.   In 2011, our Nation's space agency released recommendations on how to  preserve the first lunar landing sites. Their report states that future  visits to the Apollo landing sites ``could impose significant  disturbance risks to these sites, thus potentially destroying  irreplaceable historic, scientific, and educational artifacts and  materials.''   The act we are considering today requires action to follow this  report's recommendations. S. 1694, the One Small Step to Protect Human  Heritage in Space Act, directs the NASA Administrator to include in its  contracts, grants, and agreements lunar activities carried out by, for,  or in partnership with conditions and requirements of its 2011  recommendations about how to protect and preserve the historic and  scientific value of U.S. Government lunar artifacts.   The One Small Step Act further directs the NASA Administrator to  inform other relevant Federal agencies of the recommendations in the  2011 NASA report.   The bill we are considering today makes changes to the language  originally passed by the Senate last year. It recognizes NASA's central  role in working with partners on lunar activities and ensures they  follow best practices regarding U.S. lunar landing site artifacts. This  approach strikes an important balance in preserving lunar heritage  sites, while not imposing regulatory framework.   Further, this act builds on NASA's work through the Artemis Accords  to establish principles and set positive examples of responsible  behavior, including ``to preserve outer space heritage, which they  consider to comprise historically significant human or robotic landing  sites, artifacts, spacecraft, or other evidence of activity on  celestial bodies in accordance with mutually developed standards and  practices.''   Mr. Speaker, NASA's Apollo program was an inspiration to so many  across this country and around the world. Its lunar landing artifacts  are of cultural, historic, archaeological, and scientific significance  for all of humanity, beyond just the United States.   The Senate is prepared to pick up this version of their bill as soon  as it passes the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the One Small  Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act and to ensure that this  important legislation is enacted into law.   Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I thank the Committee on Foreign  Affairs for helping us to bring this bill to the floor today, and I  reserve the balance of my time.          House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                 Washington, DC, December 14, 2020.      Chairman Eliot L. Engel,      Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Eliot: I am writing to you concerning S.       1694, the ``One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space       Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology, and in addition to the Committee on Foreign       Affairs on July 19, 2019.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       bill. I recognize that S. 1694 contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.       I appreciate that your Committee will waive further       consideration of the bill and that this action is not a       waiver of future jurisdictional claims over this subject       matter.        I will make sure to include our exchange of letters in the       Congressional Record and will support the appointment of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-      Senate conference. Thank you for your cooperation on this       legislation.

Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: I am writing to you concerning S.       1694, One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act.       I recognize that the bill contains provision that fall within       the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.        In an effort to work cooperatively and to expedite the       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Foreign Affairs       will waive referral of S. 1694. This, however, is not a       waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Committee on       Foreign Affairs over this legislation or its subject matter.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record. Additionally, I ask that you       support the appointment of Committee on Foreign Affairs       conferees during any House-Senate conference convened on this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by first thanking Ranking Member Babin,  as well as Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas and Senators  Peters and Cruz, for their work on this.   Particularly, I thank Ranking Member Babin. It has truly been an  honor to be able to work with his on these issues and to do so in a  constructive way that advances policy that is good for the United  States, for discovery, for innovation, and for our leadership in a way  that we can come together.   Space is one of those areas where it is and should be bipartisan,  where we can come together for the best interests of our Nation, to  continue to advance discovery and to encourage innovation.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does just that. It finds the right balance  between preserving the heritage of the Apollo era, for a reminder of  what we can accomplish when we come together to work, to advance  technology, to do what has never been done before, while not placing  too much burden on our ability to move forward into the future and  advance that discovery.   Our Nation's space program has long served as a source of inspiration  and innovation and helped make sure that we, as a nation, are a leader  in technology, innovation, and discovery.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage swift passage of this bill. I encourage all  of my colleagues to vote ``yea,'' and I yield back the balance of my  time.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (S. 2472) to redesignate the NASA John H. Glenn  Research Center at Plum Brook Station, Ohio, as the NASA John H. Glenn  Research Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2472         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Neil A. Armstrong Test       Facility Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) Neil A. Armstrong, through his own definition, was       first and foremost as a test pilot.        (2) A native of Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong began his       inspiring career in space exploration in Cleveland, Ohio, at       what is now the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center.        (3) Becoming the first human to land a spacecraft, and then       set foot upon, the moon, represents the greatest dream of any       test pilot.        (4) Therefore, it is fitting that the premier aeronautics       and space test station in Ohio should be renamed in his       honor.       SEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF NASA JOHN H. GLENN RESEARCH CENTER                     AT PLUM BROOK STATION, OHIO, AS NASA JOHN H.                     GLENN RESEARCH CENTER AT THE NEIL A. ARMSTRONG                     TEST FACILITY.         (a) Redesignation.--The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center       at Plum Brook Station, Ohio, is hereby redesignated as the       NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at the Neil A. Armstrong       Test Facility.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       station referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a       reference to the ``NASA John H. Glenn Center at the Neil A.       Armstrong Test Facility''.  [[Page H7223]]         (c) Savings.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to       alter the relationship between the Plum Brook Station and the       NASA John H. Glenn Research Center.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2472, the  bill now under consideration.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2472, the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act.   NASA astronaut and Apollo 11 spacecraft commander Neil Armstrong  inspired all of humanity by taking ``one small step for man, one giant  leap for mankind,'' touching down on a planetary body hundreds of  thousands of miles away as a part of the Apollo 11 Moon landing  mission. He is a national hero, a naval aviator, and one of many early  pioneers of human space exploration.   Mr. Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, and started his NASA  career in 1955, at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics--or  NACA--Lewis Research Center, now the NASA Glenn Research Center.   This legislation recognizes his significant achievements, service,  and contributions to the Nation by renaming the NASA John H. Glenn  Research Center at Plum Brook Station, Ohio, as the NASA John H. Glenn  Research Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility.   NASA's Plum Brook Station, located in Sandusky, Ohio, is home to  world-class test facilities, where NASA and the international space  community perform complex, critical ground tests of space vehicles and  systems.   Just this year, the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle finished its  final campaign of environmental testing at Plum Brook Station as NASA  prepares to return humans to deep space exploration.   Mr. Armstrong returned to his home State of Ohio after his service to  the Nation and NASA. It is truly appropriate that a world-class  aerospace test facility in the State of Ohio be named for a native son  and one of the world's most accomplished and dedicated pilots.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S. 2472, the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act, to honor an American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur). It is very fitting that we have  another Ohioan to speak on this bill.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Mr. Gonzalez for his work on  this legislation and to say how much of a privilege it has been to be  able to serve with him and work with him on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee and on the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee.  Indeed, this is one among many ways that we have proven that there is  still the ability to work together to achieve common ends.   To my colleague, Ms. Kaptur from Ohio, thank you for your friendship  and support. It is an honor to be able to work on issues that  acknowledge and recognize the accomplishments of those heroes in the  Apollo program who showed us what it means to come together to achieve  something that has never been done before.                                time  1630    As we recognize Neil Armstrong with this renaming of this facility,  it is in honor of perhaps one of the most well-known quotes of all  time. Because of the magnitude of that accomplishment, ``One small step  for man, one giant leap for mankind,'' was only made possible through  the innovation and the effort of Neil Armstrong and so many others  across this Nation who invested in the Apollo program.   As an Oklahoman, although we cannot claim Neil Armstrong but can  claim a rich heritage in the aerospace arena and have astronauts at  every phase of the Apollo program, I can think of no more appropriate  recognition of Neil Armstrong than to name this facility after him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
