 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Tom Smiley, whose compassion and character have made him a true leader  in Gainesville and northeast Georgia.   Dr. Smiley grew up in Gumbranch, Georgia, where he received his call  to preach. After graduating from Blue Mountain College in Mississippi,  Pastor Tom attended Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary and  Columbia Theological Seminary, where he obtained his doctorate in  ministry, with an emphasis on marriage and family ministry.   As senior pastor of Lakewood Baptist Church, Dr. Smiley has led the  congregation--including my own family--for over 25 years. The vision  for Lakewood is to be a regional church that raises up fully devoted  followers of Christ who are trained and equipped to love and reach lost  people, locally and globally.   In addition to his work at church, Pastor Tom has established himself  as a successful writer, authoring three books: ``Runaway Lives,''  ``Angels All Around,'' and ``Uncommon Common Sense.''   Dr. Smiley is engaged with the Gainesville community at every level,  and our neighbors have enjoyed his contributions as a Little League  baseball and basketball coach, as well as the work that he does at the  community YMCA branch.   Dr. Smiley is my pastor and friend, and in every aspect of his life,  he leads with grace and devotion. I am proud to welcome him here to our  Nation's Capitol in Washington, D.C.                            ____________________
