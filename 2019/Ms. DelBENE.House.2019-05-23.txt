 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise today in support of the SECURE Act. It is time that we address  the retirement crisis in our country.   The SECURE Act takes several important steps to make it easier for  Americans to save for retirement, and one important example is helping  provide retirement benefit opportunities to home care workers.   Home care workers provide critical services for the elderly and  disabled. Their service is vital to ensure that patients under their  care lead a dignified life, and it is only right that they are able to  have a secure retirement.   The SECURE Act fixes a tax inequity that unintentionally prohibits  many home care workers from participating in a 401(k) or contributing  to an IRA.   If we do not pass the SECURE Act, between 15,000 and 30,000 workers  in my home State of Washington could be kicked out of their defined  contribution plan. With passage of the SECURE Act, home care workers  will rightfully have the same opportunity to save for retirement as  other workers.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
