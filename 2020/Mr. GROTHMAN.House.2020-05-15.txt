 Mr. Speaker, I will bring up three things that are very  wrong with proxy voting that I don't think have been brought up today.   First of all, one of the problems we have in this building is, even  though we all represent 700,000 people, there are some Congressmen who  are a great deal more powerful than others, and this bill will greatly  increase the power of leadership.   Right now, people run into each other in the halls, talk to each  other in the Cloakroom, question parts of the bill, and sometimes  question leadership's narrative. This bill says everybody is going to  be back at home, which greatly strengthens the power of leadership  because people aren't around to question the bill.   Secondly, it lessens bipartisanship. When we are gone, we do have  conference calls with other Republicans, but I find I talk to Democrats  much more when we are in this building; and by taking people out of  this building, you will decrease bipartisanship as you make proxy  voting the norm.   Finally, you are penalizing the press. We should all be available to  the press after these votes so they get a variety of perspectives. We  are going to work our way down to the point where it is the Speaker and  a few other Democrats around, and the press are not going to be able to  talk to us all. It is an insult to the press.    Mr. Speaker, the first point I would like to make is  some people feel this bill is a political instrument that will never  become law. I see the current leader in the polls for next year's  Presidential election signing this bill next February. So we have to  pay careful attention to what is in it.                                time  1600    I take three things out of this bill.   First of all, another $3 trillion further in debt together with the  $3 trillion we have already passed and the natural trillion-dollar  deficit we have here. In the current year, we will go about $22,000  more in debt for every man, woman, and child in the country.   The second thing we take out of this bill is it is designed to  discourage work. We extend, by Wisconsin standards, another 6 months in  which people will be paid the equivalent of $50,000 a year not to work,  and we are moving the work requirements for SNAP. In other words, it is  an embracing of the idea that we want to discourage work and destroy  our economy.  [[Page H2229]]    Finally, it is this effort to get more and more people to come here  illegally. We are removing the requirement that you have to have a  Social Security number for the earned income tax credit, and we are  saying not only the new $1,200 per person but the old $1,200 per person  will go to people who do not have a Social Security number. I cannot  think of a quicker way to ruin the country.
