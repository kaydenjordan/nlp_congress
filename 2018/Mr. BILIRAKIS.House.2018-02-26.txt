 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1222, the  Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act, which will reauthorize  and ensure continued investment in surveillance research to assess the  lifelong needs of individuals with congenital heart defects, or CHDs.   These surveillance efforts will help improve our understanding of CHD  across the lifespan, from birth to adulthood. This research will help  us learn more about demographic factors such as age, race, gender, or  ethnicity.   In addition, the legislation emphasizes the need for continued  biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health on the  diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CHD.   NIH will further research into the causes of congenital heart  defects, including genetic causes, and study long-term outcomes in  individuals with CHD of all ages. Also, NIH may study data to identify  effective treatments and outcomes and identify barriers to lifelong  care for individuals with congenital heart defects   CHD is the most common birth defect and the leading cause of birth  defect-related infant mortality. For the Down syndrome community, about  half of the children born with Down syndrome have CHD. It is a true  public health issue and, as late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel noted, it  does not discriminate by race, gender, or socioeconomic status.   The road ahead may be scary and uncertain for any parent with a  newborn who has CHD, but this bill helps give hope to those coping with  the diagnosis. Nearly 1 in 100 babies are born with CHD, and more than  5 percent will not live to see their first birthday, unfortunately. We  have to change that.   Even for those who receive successful intervention, it is not a cure.  We have to change that.   Children and adults born with CHD require ongoing, costly,  specialized cardiac care and face a lifelong risk of permanent  disability and premature death. We must change that.   As a result, healthcare utilization among the CHD population is  significantly higher than the general population. It is estimated that,  compared to their peers, the medical costs for individuals with  congenital heart defects are 10 to 20 times greater.   Hospitalization costs for pediatric patients alone total more than  $5.6 billion each year, which is 15 percent of  [[Page H1240]]  all hospitalization costs for patients 20 years of age and younger.   Despite its prevalence and significance, there are still gaps in  research and standards of care for CHD patients. But for the sake of  the estimated 40,000 babies, Mr. Speaker, who will be born in the next  year with CHD, there is more work to be done.   Mr. Speaker, I began this journey almost 10 years ago, when then- Congressman Zack Space and I first introduced the Congenital Heart  Futures Act. Last Congress, Congressman Schiff and I reintroduced the  reauthorization of the original bill. During that time, I met a lot of  patients with congenital heart defects along the way, and I have been  touched by their stories.   There are people like Trey and Nicole Flynn, a young Floridian couple  who lost their son, Holden, while waiting for a heart transplant. He  was only 2 years old.   This bill supports the essential research necessary to make sure  another family doesn't have to leave the hospital without their child  in their arms.   There is also Lucas Iguina, a young man born with a complex  congenital heart disease that essentially left him with half a heart.                                time  1730    Despite having three open-heart surgeries, Mr. Speaker, and countless  doctor visits and medical procedures, Lucas has hopes and dreams like  every other child. This bill ensures that the medical research will  keep pace with his generation as they grow to be adults.    Jackson Radandt, born with half a heart, has  hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which means the left side of his heart  was underdeveloped. He depended on lifesaving research to help his  failing heart survive until his heart transplant at age 11. He is a  teenager now and will live his life with a heightened sensitivity for  his new heart.   Nicholas Basken was born with complex heart disease and wasn't  getting blood to the lower half of his body, requiring heart surgery  when he was just 2 days old. He is now at the top of his class, and  this bill will ensure that his future remains bright as he navigates  this chronic illness throughout his adulthood.   Abigail Adams is a young Florida advocate, whom I will meet again  tomorrow, with Down syndrome. Roughly half of the babies born with Down  syndrome, Mr. Speaker, have a congenital heart defect. Abigail  continues to advocate for individuals with Down syndrome.    My friend, David Peluso, was born with pulmonary  stenosis, a condition where the pulmonary valve will not open properly.  He had surgery, again, emergency open-heart surgery, at 2 days old,  another corrective surgery at age 10, and many hospital visits and  procedures in the meantime.   Today, again, we are giving these children hope. Today, he is a  husband and a father to two kids, trying to live a normal life with  atrial flutter that requires additional surgeries. This bill will  continue the surveillance program so we can collect data on children  and adults with congenital heart problems.   I can go on and on, Mr. Speaker. Thank you so very much, and let's  pass this great bill for our children and give them hope.
