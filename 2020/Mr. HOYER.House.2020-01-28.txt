 Madam Speaker, we have gone through and are going through  a serious time in our country. The Senate is engaged, as was said the  other day, in one of its most important duties and responsibilities.   This weekend, a draft of the upcoming book by President Trump's  former National Security Advisor, Ambassador John Bolton, was reported  on by The New York Times.   In that book, Ambassador Bolton, who was the National Security  Advisor and foreign policy advisor for President Donald Trump, revealed  additional evidence pertinent to the impeachment trial now underway in  the Senate. There is strong and direct evidence that the President  linked critical military aid to Ukraine. It is reported that so many of  his advisers, including Mr. Bolton, could not understand that aid being  withheld to our ally.   He reveals that the President linked that critical military aid to  Ukraine to the announcement of an investigation by President Zelensky,  which was intended to benefit President Trump personally and  politically.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged concurrent  resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the concurrent resolution, as follows:                               H. Con Res. 86         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That the two Houses of Congress assemble in the       Hall of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, February 4,       2020, at 9 p.m., for the purpose of receiving such       communication as the President of the United States shall be       pleased to make to them.    The concurrent resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I come to the floor this afternoon with a  number of my Democratic colleagues to speak about the subject of  paramount concern for most Americans: the economy. Healthcare, the  economy, and their jobs are what folks are focused on when they wake up  in the morning.   The Joint Economic Committee now headed on our side of the aisle by   Don Beyer from Virginia, released two reports today that all Americans  should look at carefully. One of them focuses on the failure of the  2017 Trump tax cuts which Chairman Neal will be focusing on shortly.   Republicans claim that the tax cuts would pay for themselves and not  add a penny to deficits and debt. That is a theory that we have heard  time and time again from Republicans to support their tax cuts for the  wealthiest in our country. Both experience and evidence tell us that  their tax cuts always end up driving our deficits up, hurting the  middle class, and placing the burden on future generations.   I hope Americans will read that report and draw the same conclusions  that so many economists have made about the dangerous tax scam.   The second report which we will be focusing on this evening concerns  the economy more broadly. It asks a question that many Americans may be  asking this year: Is the Trump economy doing as well as the President  claimed it would?   And: Can the President take credit for economic growth that began  long before he took office?   I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) for his  efforts as vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee, as well as the  former vice chair, Carolyn Maloney, who now heads up the Oversight and  Reform Committee.   I will be yielding to Mr. Beyer soon to speak more about the content  of the committee's report. He will be followed by Mr. Neal who is the  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and a senior member of this  body. He is probably one of the most knowledgeable people, not only  about taxes, but about the economy in general.   But first I want to speak a little bit about this President's record  on the economy.   President Trump sought office on a raft of economic promises. He  promised to create 25 million new jobs in 10 years.   He promised 6 percent growth in our domestic product.   He promised to eliminate the $19 trillion national debt.   He promised to get wages up for American workers with $4,000 raises  as a result of the tax cuts.   And the President promised to make healthcare much less expensive and  much better.                                time  1645    Let's see how he is doing.   On the first measure, job growth, job growth has slowed under  President Trump. Let me repeat that. Job growth has slowed under  President Trump compared to the level of the economic expansion that  began under his predecessor.   This chart--and it will probably be hard to see for many viewers-- shows that job growth was highest here in the years before President  Trump took office and then lower, following.   Now, what does that mean?   Let me give you the big figure, Madam Speaker, because the specifics  of the chart will be difficult for people to see on the floor and in  the gallery.   What it means is that, on average--and this is an important fact to  remember--under President Obama, there were 227,000 jobs created per  month over the last 35 months of his term.   Now we have had 35 months of the Trump term. What has he done to  realize that promise of 25 million jobs?   Madam Speaker, 36,000 less jobs per month have been created under  Donald Trump than under Barack Obama in the same timeframe.   Now, that is important because the President, of course, claims that  this is the best economy we have ever seen. As I said, that is 36,000  fewer jobs per month, and 1.26 million fewer jobs over President  Trump's term from the trend he inherited.   Madam Speaker, I am going to show you a chart on how the economy that  President Obama had put in place with the help of the Congress was  going straight up.   At this pace, President Trump's 4-year term will not achieve the same  level of job creation as the previous 4-year term of President Obama.  In fact, he would fall--listen to this figure--2.5 million jobs short.   So, when we hear the President at a rally claiming this great  economic boom, remember, 2.5 million less jobs created.   President Trump also loves to cite the low unemployment rate, which,  in December 2019, stood at 3.5 percent. That is, indeed, a low number.  It is a good number in the sense that it shows that so many of our  people are working. But underlying those facts are so many of our  people are working one, two, and three jobs so they can support  themselves and their family.   Now, when he took office, the rate was 4.7 percent. It is 3.5 percent  now and 4.7 percent when he took office. Compare that to the decline in  the unemployment rate during the same period in President Obama's  second term.   At his second inauguration, the rate was 7.9 percent. He left office  with 4.7 percent. That is 3.2 percent less. He left the office with a  4.7 percent unemployment rate, continuing a strong decline.   Under President Obama, a decline of 5.3 percentage points from when  he took office; under President Trump, a decline of 1.2 percentage  points.   Madam Speaker, let me give you that figure again. Under President  Obama, he inherited from George Bush a declining employment. It spiked  at 10 percent, and under President Obama,  [[Page H610]]  that came down to 4.7 percent. That is where you get the 5.3 percent  reduction. Actually, he halved the unemployment rate if you figure it  that way.   Under President Trump, however, he inherited a downward trend--in  other words, less unemployment as opposed to more unemployment from  Bush to Obama--and he has failed to keep the pace that President Obama  established.   This was the decline in the unemployment rate under Barack Obama.  This is what has happened: steeper decline under Obama, got to a low  number, and it has been reduced by 1.2 percent as opposed to the 4.7  percent that Obama reduced it to.   While President Trump boasted that his administration would see a 6  percent GDP--that is growth in the domestic product of our country, our  entire production--that would have been good; 6 percent would have been  phenomenal. It was also not attained.   Over the first 11 quarters of his term, that figure was 2.6 percent,  dropping to 2.1 percent in the third quarter of last year. The Federal  Reserve estimates that 2020 will see it fall even lower as any short- term stimulus from his tax cut disappears. Mr. Neal is going to talk  about the tax cut and what was promised and what was delivered.   Madam Speaker, I would simply point out to you that what you see is,  essentially, a level 2.5 percent average growth under President Obama  and under President Trump, notwithstanding the extraordinary trillion- dollar tax cut that was infused in the economy. Again, Mr. Neal will  speak more to that.   It is clear the Trump tax cut did little to boost GDP as he claimed  it would, and, of course, he claimed many more jobs.   On deficits and the debt, President Trump's promise would seem  laughable if the reality weren't so dangerous.   Instead of reversing deficits and eliminating the debt, he has  overseen an increase fueled by his 2017 tax cut that gave $2 trillion  in new, unpaid-for tax cuts primarily to the wealthiest in our country.   Last week, to the surprise of no one who understands the history of  Republican tax cuts, President Trump suggested he might seek cuts to  Medicare and Social Security to offset the deficits created by his tax  cuts. I will leave it to Chairman Yarmuth to go into greater detail  about the Trump deficits.   We have all seen this President's campaign on reducing America's  trade deficit, but it has increased on his watch. In fact, according to  the Joint Economic Committee's report, as many as 450,000 jobs were  lost in 2019 alone as a result of this President's trade wars.   The President loves to stand at the podium at his rallies and shout  slogans about how his is the best economy ever and how he inherited a  mess from President Obama. Those statements, sadly, as so many of his  have been shown to be, are not accurate. That is a polite way to say  it. The facts tell the opposite story.   Over the course of the Obama Presidency, 10.8 million jobs were  created as the unemployment rate fell from, as I said, 10 percent to  4.7 percent. In the last 11 quarters of President Obama's term, real  GDP growth was averaging 2.6 percent--a remarkable turnaround from the  8.4 percent deficit, decline, that he inherited, a decrease in the last  quarter before he took office.    Now, annual median income, Madam Speaker, you will note, under  President Obama, the red line starts declining 2008, 2009. The deepest  recession that we have experienced in our lifetimes, which started in  December of `07, you will see real household income declined  significantly.   But you will see, when the recovery program that President Obama and  Democrats put in place in our country, the American Recovery Act, you  saw employment going up, average income going up, and you see it going  up to $63,179.   The tax cut, you will see a real spike here. This is under President  Obama, and then you see the tax cut, this line here, and then you see a  flattening out. While it has increased, it has been a much slower  increase. So, when he says it is the best economy, the folks here who  were experiencing this kind of increase would beg to differ.   Compare that to the first 2 years of Trump's Presidency with an  increase in annual median household income of $1,400. This indicated,  under President Obama, an increase of $4,800 in median income, three  times as much--as a matter of fact, more than three times. In fact,  incomes at every level have grown faster under Democrats than under  Republicans since 1968.   So this is not just picking a particular year to make a point. This  is 68 years, average. The blue, Democrats, increase in every quintile.  That means those at the bottom increase substantially and, yes, those  at the top increase.   This is not, as some Republicans charge us with, class warfare.  Everybody did better, on average, with Democratic Presidents in the 20  years during that period of time that we had the Presidency and the 30  years that the Republicans had the Presidency. Those are the averages,  and you can see, in every quintile, everybody in America did better  under the Democrats' economic programs.   President Trump's economy is just the latest chapter in a long story  in which, time and time again, Democratic leadership has seen our  economy out of a recession and danger as President Obama did when he  inherited, as I said, the deepest recession anybody less than 95 years  of age in our country has experienced.   This is a contrast that House Democrats will be highlighting this  year when Americans will again entrust the President and Congress with  crafting economic policies. That means jobs for them. That means some  money to invest in their children, in their families, in their  mortgages, in buying a car, a refrigerator, or a new stove or fixing  their heat when it goes out.   What President Trump doesn't seem to understand, however, is that a  thriving economy is more than growing the stock market.   Let me say this as an aside. I don't have a slide here now, but the  average growth in the stock market under Democrats from 1948 until  2008--I am not sure exactly when we ended the study--was more in every  Democratic administration.   It is about real economic security for American workers and their  families; it is about whether America is still a place where everyone  has a fair shot, where everyone has access to opportunities, and where  everyone can get ahead. That is what that chart shows, and that is over  a significant period of time.   By that measure, the President's record has been dismal.   Now, healthcare, what I started with, is one of the greatest  concerns. Jobs and healthcare were our issues in the last election. We  added 63 Members to the Democratic side of the aisle, which is why we  are in the majority, because people knew that we were the party that  was focused on healthcare and on jobs and had delivered.   This chart shows the uninsured rate. It was going down over the last  3 years, but because of the assault on the Affordable Care Act and the  uncertainty that was created, as you will see, 2014, 2013, 2016 the  President is elected, it comes down and flattens out. Why? Because they  are not supporting healthcare. We need to get it back up so there are  less and less uninsured.   Mr. Neal represents the State of Massachusetts where 100 percent of  children are covered and 97 percent of adults. That is what the  Affordable Care Act was based upon, the Massachusetts plan, when  Governor Romney was the Republican Governor in Massachusetts.   As a result of the policies of this President, the number of  Americans without health insurance rose to 8.5 percent in 2018. That  was the first increase in a decade.                                time  1700    Not having health insurance is bad for your health and bad for your  psyche and bad for your family.   His efforts, meaning President Trump, alongside congressional  Republicans to repeal, undermine, and sabotage the Affordable Care Act  have brought uncertainty to health insurance markets and made it harder  for working families to get affordable coverage for the care they need.   We are working very hard on that. We are trying to bring prescription  drug costs down. We are trying to fix the problem of surprise billing.  We want to make sure that Americans have affordable, quality  healthcare.  [[Page H611]]    On wages, we see another lost opportunity. For 3 years, President  Trump and the Republican-led Senate have refused to support legislation  to raise the minimum wage, which has not been raised in over a decade,  which the House finally passed a bill last year, under the Democratic  majority, which tries to lift that minimum wage so people can live and  support themselves when they are working 40 hours a week. No American  working 40 hours a week ought not to be able to afford to support  themselves and to help support a family.   According to the monthly jobs report for December, hourly wage growth  slipped to its lowest rate in 18 months. When you listen to the  President talk at these rallies about this economy, remember that  figure and check it. Go to Google or go to some reference point. Check  it.   According to the monthly jobs report for December, last month, hourly  wage growth slipped to its lowest rate in 18 months. That is a far cry  from the $4,000 annual salary increase President Trump promised would  trickle down from his tax cuts for the wealthiest in America.   American workers deserve better. America deserves better. American  exporters deserve better. American farmers and small business owners  deserve better than this uncertain Trump economy. All Americans deserve  better.   That is why the Democratic-led House voted last year to raise wages,  ensure equal pay for equal work, and give Federal employees a long- overdue cost of living adjustment.   That is why we voted to lower prescription drug prices, a bill that  sits in the Senate, untended by Senator McConnell.   That is why we voted to make it easier for more workers to save for  secure retirement, thanks to Chairman Neal and the Ways and Means  Committee.   That is why we voted to protect multiemployer pension funds, so that  hundreds of thousands of people would not be left out in the cold after  contributing to and being promised a pension in their old age.   Now, as we look to 2020, House Democrats will continue to make  economic opportunity our focus. I look forward to bringing more  legislation to the floor this year to ensure that we do not squander  the gains of our recovery under President Obama. We will keep looking  for ways to help America get ahead.   I hope all of my colleagues will look at the facts that I put forward  and see what the Obama economy did and that the last 3 years have been  a continuation of the Obama economy. Just look at the line. It is  almost a straight line up.   I appreciate that a number of my Democratic colleagues are here this  evening to add to this conversation. I yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my friend, former Lieutenant Government, former  Ambassador, and the vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Beyer, and I appreciate  his leadership on the Joint Economic Committee.   I am now pleased to yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Neal), one of the senior Members of the House of Representatives, the  dean of the Massachusetts delegation and the chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee, who, as I said earlier, is as knowledgeable about tax  policy and its consequences as anybody in this House.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and  I hope the American people really focus on this. So much has been said  by both sides that the American people really need to look at this  themselves and figure out when did they do well, when did their  families do well, who was watching out for their healthcare, who wanted  to make sure that we bring up the income of those at the lowest levels  of incomes in our country, and make a decision on their behalf as to  who they want to support and who they believe.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth),  chairman of the Budget Committee in the House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and  I thank him for his leadership on the Budget Committee.   I might say, as a result of his work, last year, 2019, we completed  the appropriations process. Unlike the previous year, when our  Republican colleagues were in charge and the government was shut down  when the new Congress took office, we kept the government open. There  was no drama. On January 3, everybody was working and being served by  their government.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne),  whose father was such a good friend of mine and who does such an  excellent job. His dad would be proud of him here in Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments; for  his leadership on the minimum wage, to try to lift people up at the  bottom of the wage scale; and also for his leadership on healthcare, to  ensure that they have access to affordable, quality healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Houlahan), a Representative from the Philadelphia suburbs who served so  well in the military of our country and then became a very successful  businesswoman. I know she knows a lot about how to run a business and  how to run an economy.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments,  and I know that she is working her district very, very hard, and  listening to people, which is what we need to do.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams), who is the leader of the group that I am very enthusiastic  about that is helping our historically Black colleges and universities.  I thank her for her leadership on that and so many other educational  issues and economic issues for our families.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.   I am now pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro), one of the senior Members of the House of Representatives,  the chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee that  deals with so many of these issues that have been discussed over the  last hour.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.   Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Stevens).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
