 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague from  North Carolina, Congresswoman Alma Adams, as we introduce a resolution  recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four sit-in protest  which took place on February 1, 1960, 60 years ago.   The Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-in was a civil rights protest  that commenced when four young African American college students staged  a sit-in at the segregated lunch counter of F. W. Woolworth department  store in Greensboro. They refused to leave after being denied service  only because of their race.   The four young men--Ezell Blair, Jr.; David Richmond; Franklin  McCain; and Joseph McNeil--were students from North Carolina A&T  College, now known as North Carolina A&T State University. I might add  that A&T State University is now the largest HBCU in the country.   Mr. Speaker, I would also mention that Congresswoman Alma Adams is a  graduate of A&T State University and served as a college professor  across the street at Bennett College for more than 40 years.   The Greensboro Four students were influenced by the unanimous Supreme  Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, wherein the Court  ruled that State laws establishing racial segregation in public schools  are unconstitutional even if the segregated schools are otherwise  equal.   The students were also influenced by the Supreme Court decision in  Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, 1955, wherein, the Court broke with its  historic adherence to the Plessy v. Ferguson separate but equal  doctrine and interpreted the Interstate Commerce Act as banning the  segregation of Black passengers on buses traveling across State lines.  The Keys case originated at the bus station in Roanoke Rapids, North  Carolina, located in the heart of my congressional district.   The Keys ruling was announced 6 days prior to Rosa Parks' refusal to  move from her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery. And without  question, the Rosa Parks Montgomery bus boycott, lasting 381 days, also  inspired the Greensboro Four students.   The students were also inspired to act following the 1955 brutal  lynching of Emmett Till after he was accused of offending a White woman  in a Mississippi grocery store.   These four college students blazed a trail that ignited a movement to  challenge racial segregation in public facilities throughout the  segregated South. The sit-in movement soon spread to college towns  throughout the South.   The Greensboro Four sit-ins contributed greatly to the civil rights  movement and served as a catalyst for the mobilization of college  students in the movement, evolving into the formation of the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which was founded in Raleigh, North  Carolina, in April 1960. Some of the organizers of SNCC were  Congressman   John Lewis, Congressman  Jim Clyburn, and Diane Nash.   Nationwide participation in this new movement included over 700,000  people, including students, clergymen, and unified citizens, both Black  and White. Many of the protestors, more than 3,000, were arrested for  trespassing, disorderly conduct, or disturbing the peace.   However, the Greensboro Four remained peaceful throughout the  6-month sit-in, and their actions made an immediate and lasting impact,  forcing Woolworth's and other establishments to change their  discriminatory policies. On July 26, 1960, the Woolworth's lunch  counter was finally integrated. Today, the former Woolworth's now  houses the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, which features  a restored version of the lunch counter where the Greensboro Four sat.  Part of the original counter is on display at the Smithsonian National  Museum of American History here in Washington.    On Saturday of this week, February 1, the museum will commemorate the  60th anniversary of this historic event at the Greensboro Coliseum.  Past award recipients have been numerous. They include Oprah Winfrey;  Jesse Jackson, Sr.; President Nelson Mandela; and many, many others.   The award recipients this year will be: President Barack Obama, the  Reverend Al Sharpton, Danny Glover, Mrs. Clayola Brown, Reverend Cardes  Brown, Dr. Linda Brown, and Mrs. Emma Washington.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution that Ms. Adams and I introduce seeks to  encourage all of the States to include in their educational curriculum  the history and contributions of the Greensboro Four. It is imperative  that we learn the lessons from the past and reaffirm that the ethnic  and racial diversity of our country enriches our Nation.   We are always stronger together. We must never forget, in all things,  to demand justice and equality for all.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Greensboro Four. I congratulate the  International Museum, and I look forward to participating in the great  gala they will have this weekend in Greensboro.                            ____________________
