 Mr. Speaker, I rise in  celebration of Caribbean American Heritage Month. In June 2005, the  House of Representatives adopted H. Con. Res. 71, recognizing the  significance of the Caribbean people. In February 2006, the resolution  passed in the Senate, and was signed by President George W. Bush in  June 2006.   Since the declaration, the United States has celebrated June as  Caribbean American heritage month every June, this year marks the  twelfth anniversary. Approximately 3 million people in America can  trace their ancestry to the Caribbean.   Historically, African-Caribbean migration to the United States can be  traced back to the 17th century during British colonial slavery. While  enslaved Africans imported from the Caribbean decreased after revolts  in the 1700s, Caribbean immigration grew in the mid-1800s. After World  War II, Caribbean immigration boomed during periods of economic growth.  Between 1960 and 2009, the number of Caribbean immigrants grew from  190,000 to 2 million.   Caribbean Americans have contributed the fabric of our society,  bringing a unique and vibrant culture to mesh with that of America's.  Just to name a few, Colin Powell, Eric Holder, Cicely Tyson, and Lenny  Kravitz are all Caribbean Americans.   I urge my fellow members of Congress to commemorate this month as  National Caribbean American Heritage Month.                            ____________________
