 First, Madam President, I want to reiterate a point I  made yesterday about Senator Tuberville's military holds. The bottom  line is very, very simple: Republican leaders and many of Senator  Tuberville's Republican colleagues oppose what Senator Tuberville is  doing because it puts at serious risk our military preparedness, our  military security, our national security.   Very simply, the onus is on Republican Senators to prevail on Senator  Tuberville and get him to back off his reckless pursuit. That is the  crux of the matter. It is on the backs of his Republican colleagues to  get Senator Tuberville to back off. It is hurting our military  security. It is dangerous, unprecedented, and they have the power and  the ability to stop him from doing it.                            ____________________     Madam President, on inflation, let me begin with some  welcome news for the American people. This morning, reports came out  with new signs that inflation came down last month. The price of gas  has come down over 25 percent since last year, and wages are now up  also. Wage growth is significantly above inflation for the first time  since the spring of 2021, right after President Biden took office. This  news means one thing: more money in people's pockets, greater financial  security, and affirmation that Democrats' agenda is working. We made a  promise to lower costs, and today we have proof that we are making  progress towards keeping that promise.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the AI briefing, yesterday, the  Senate held its first-ever--its first-ever--classified briefing on the  national security implications of artificial intelligence. It was an  eye-opening presentation. Many of us spent a lot of time educating  ourselves on AI, talking to experts, and holding hearings, but  yesterday's briefing was a candid wake-up call on how truly complicated  AI is and how much work, hard work, we have before us.   This will be an ongoing effort. We want to move quickly but not too  quickly. We need to move quickly so bad countries--authoritarian  countries and bad actors, not countries themselves--don't get ahead of  us, but we can't move too quickly because we have to get this right,  and it is very complicated. Action on AI will not be a matter of weeks,  nor of years but, rather, of months.   I want to thank my colleagues who attended yesterday's briefing. We  had a terrific turnout of roughly 70 Members--even better than the  first.   I want to thank the briefers by name: Dr. Arati Prabhakar, Director  of the White House Office of Science and Tech; Avril Haines, Director  of National Intelligence; Kath Hicks, Deputy Secretary of Defense; VADM  Trey Whitworth, Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency; and Dr. Craig Martell, Chief Digital and AI Officer at DOD.  Each briefer was clear, concise, and informative.   I was gratified my Republican colleagues came out of the briefing and  said: Yes, this was a real back-and-forth, not just people reading a  piece of paper and not just people answering questions.   For sure, we are not done. Very soon, I will announce the timing for  our third all-Senate briefing and again urge my colleagues to attend,  especially those who couldn't make the first two briefings. Learning as  much as we can about AI as quickly as possible is essential.   AI is unlike anything Congress has dealt with before. It moves and  changes so quickly. It is going to affect our world so dramatically. It  is so much deeper in its complexity and lies so far outside our  expertise. Coming up with legislative solutions will be one of the most  difficult things Congress has ever, ever faced, so these briefings are  an important initial step.   I don't kid myself on how difficult this is going to be. Some people  asked why did I decide to take this on. Well, just because an issue is  difficult or unfamiliar to Congress is no excuse to turn away,  especially when it is so important and is going to have such a huge  effect on every American and every person in the world's life. We can't  throw our hands in the air and hope someone else figures it out.   Of the many things yesterday's briefing made clear, one of them was  that government must play a role in making sure AI works for society's  benefit. The private sector has made stunning progress innovating on  AI, and Congress needs to be careful not to curb or hinder that  innovation. But we are going to need guardrails, and the only agent  that can do that is government.   Yes, some companies may put guardrails on on their own, but when  another company refuses to put on those guardrails, that company, the  original company, will feel the pressure--political or, more  importantly, economic--and say: Look, we can't have those guardrails  either. Even if many developers have good intentions, there are always  going to be rogue actors, unscrupulous companies, and foreign  adversaries  [[Page S2333]]  that seek to harm us and discard any guardrails at all. We can't expect  companies to adopt guardrails, as I said, if their competitors won't be  forced to do so as well.    So it is only a task that government can do with help and input from  the experts. That was made clear at the hearings yesterday. Even those  AI companies that are way out front on this now admit that they need  some government action, we need some kinds of guardrails.   Later this year, Congress will host the first-ever AI Insight Forums  to bring the best developers, experts, and legislators in one room to  identify the areas where we can take action and to make sure we are  asking the right questions to begin with. Ensuring our national  security and safety will be one of the most important issues we  discuss.   I want to thank everyone who attended yesterday. It was bipartisan,  and we must keep this issue bipartisan. How to deal with AI is not a  Republican issue; it is not a Democratic issue; it is a national issue.   I really want to thank our little group of Senators--Heinrich,  Rounds, and Young--for helping organize these briefings. I look forward  to the third briefing soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, on forum shopping in the judiciary, our  Federal judiciary is built on the trust and confidence of the American  people, but right now, sadly, Americans' faith in the judicial system  is at an alltime low thanks to the hijacking of our courts by the MAGA  hard right and the unfair practice known as forum shopping.   Forum shopping essentially allows litigants in certain cases to  handpick judges sympathetic to their cause. At its core, forum shopping  undermines the spirit of a fair and balanced judiciary. That is why  earlier this week I sent a letter to 18 of my Democratic colleagues and  to the chair of the Advisory Committee on Civil Rights, calling on the  Judicial Conference to consider reforms that would put an end to forum  shopping.   If Americans want to see a clear example of why forum shopping is a  serious problem, consider the Northern District of Texas. In that  district, civil cases are often assigned to a single judge, if not one  of just a few.   And it so happens, one of those judges is infamous--infamous--for his  well-documented opposition to freedom of choice.   Do you know who knew that? The MAGA Republicans. So when MAGA  Republicans sought to strip away access to FDA-approved abortion  medication, widely available for decades, they intentionally targeted  the Northern District of Texas, where only one judge sat. They knew  which judge they would get.   To those who don't follow judiciary procedure, in most districts  there are a bunch of judges. They put the case on wheel, and they spin  the wheel around, and whomever the arrow lands on gets the case. You  can't pick your judge.   But in this case, you can pick your judge, and in this case, it is an  extreme MAGA judge, who we know has views that are so, so deeply held  that no unbiassed bystander can think a fair trial will be held.   And, lo and behold, of course, that judge sided with the anti-choice  extremists, marking the first time ever that a judge has ordered a drug  to be taken off the market nationwide. It doesn't just affect Amarillo  and northern Texas. It affects the whole country.   This isn't equal justice. This isn't a fair or impartial application  of the rule of law. This is extremists using forum shopping to pull a  fast one on the vast majority of Americans who opposed this ruling.   And, of course, women's freedom of choice isn't the only issue at  stake. When extremists can manipulate our judiciary to get judges of  their preference, it endangers everything from healthcare to  immigration reform, to commonsense gun safety, to voting rights.   Forum shopping is a serious problem that will only worsen Americans'  crisis of faith in the judiciary. The letter Democrats sent offers a  path for sensible, good-faith reforms that will preserve an independent  Federal judiciary, while letting in much needed fresh air into  America's halls of justice.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on nominations, today, we will  confirm two more district judges: Tiffany Cartwright to serve in the  Western District of Washington and Myong Joun to serve in the District  of Massachusetts. We will also move forward on two executive  nominations: Kalpana Kotagal to be a member of the EEOC, and David  Uhlmann to be an Assistant Administrator of the EPA.   Ms. Kotagal is exceptionally qualified to serve on the EEOC, and, if  confirmed, she will shift the balance of the Commission.   So it is going to be a busy day here on the Senate floor with several  votes on nominees, and I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, all time on the Joun nomination be  considered expired; that the confirmation vote on the Joun nomination  occur at 4 p.m.; that the cloture motions on the Kotagal, Uhlmann, and  Bloomekatz nominations ripen upon disposition of the Joun nomination;  and that the order with respect to the postcloture time on the Kotagal  nomination be vitiated.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 119,  S. 2226.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the Kotagal  nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, if cloture is invoked on the Kotagal  nomination, all postcloture time be considered expired at 11:30 a.m. on  Thursday, July 13; further, that if cloture is invoked on the Uhlmann  nomination, all postcloture time be considered expired and the vote on  the confirmation be at a time to be determined by the majority leader  in consultation with the Republican leader; further, that following the  cloture vote on the Uhlmann nomination, the Senate proceed to  legislative session and be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each; further,  that at 1:45 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to vote on  the motion to invoke cloture on the Bloomekatz nomination.    For the information of the Senate, the 4 p.m. votes will  be the last votes of the day.    Madam President and Madam Vice President, I want to note  that this is a history-making moment for the United States Senate.   Today, Vice President Kamala Harris matches the record for the most  tie-breaking votes ever passed in the United States by a Vice  President.   The Constitution says that ``the Vice President Of The United States  shall be the President of the Senate,'' and with that comes the immense  burden of casting votes whenever this Chamber is evenly split.   When it has mattered most, Vice President Harris has provided the  decisive vote on some of the most historic bills of modern times, from  the American Rescue Plan to the Inflation Reduction Act, to so many  Federal judges who now preside and provide balance on the Federal  bench. She has carried out her duties with supreme excellence, and  today, all of us--all of us--thank her for making the work of the  Senate possible.   We also thank Vice President Harris for doing all this work despite  all the other demands she faces as the Nation's Vice President, from  leading the charge on protecting freedom of choice to speaking out on  criminal justice reform and gun safety, to pushing for climate justice.  Our Nation is stronger, fairer, and more prosperous because of the work  of the Vice President.   So, Madam Vice President, on this historic day, thank you. Thank you  for your leadership and your service to this institution and to the  United States of America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
