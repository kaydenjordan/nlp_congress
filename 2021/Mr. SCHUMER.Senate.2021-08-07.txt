 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, I am going to do the  administrative stuff.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.    Mr. President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, this morning, we resume consideration of  the bipartisan infrastructure bill. There will be a vote at noon to  invoke cloture on the substitute amendment, which will move the process  forward by the book.   Democrats are very eager to start voting on further amendments, but  we need consent from the Chamber to schedule those amendment votes. We  worked all day Thursday to come up with an agreement with our  Republican colleagues on such a package but unfortunately were not able  to. So we can get this done the easy way or the hard way. In either  case, the Senate will stay in session until we finish our work. It is  up to my Republican colleagues how long it takes.   I yield the floor.    Well, I thank my good friend from Maryland for offering  this UC, and strongly and fervently support it.   I have been proud to join Senators Cardin and Sinema in leading the  fight to provide direct relief to this industry. We all know  restaurants were particularly hard hit during COVID, and the idea that  they have all recovered is just so far from the truth.   You know, any business where people had to gather were hit hard--hit  the hardest; restaurants at the very top of the list, and they are a  lifeblood to our cities and our communities. They, of course, are a  place where people get food, but they get community. They join  together. They feel roots. Whether it is a small town or a large city,  restaurants in neighborhood after neighborhood, community after  community, are often the glue that make communities tick; and they were  hurt.   The funds that we provided, provided a lifeline to 100,000 applicants  across the country. In my State of New York, $3.6 billion went to 9,775  restaurants. But the job wasn't done. They ran out of money long before  restaurants were helped.   And anyone who thinks our restaurants are out of trouble, I just ate  at one last night--a Polish couple in Greenpoint--lovely little  restaurant: Are you hurting? Yes; we might go under.   And this story could be repeated in restaurant after restaurant after  restaurant.   In New York, 27,000 restaurants are waiting in desperation. These are  hard-working people--very hard-working people. They struggle. They put  their all, their whole heart and soul, into the business and provide,  as I said, often the glue for our communities.   This legislation is fair. It is smart. It is right. We will get  economic payback over and over and over again from keeping these  restaurants going because they employ so many people, contract with so  many independent suppliers and others. It just makes such sense   It is almost cruel to tell these restaurants, ``You are on your own  now,'' when, through no fault of their own, they have suffered through  with COVID.   So I strongly support this proposal by Senator Cardin. We are going  to keep at it and keep at it and keep at it because our restaurants so  desperately need the help.   It was bipartisan in the past. Let's keep it bipartisan, but let's  get the job done. Our restaurants need help, and our communities, our  cities, our rural towns, our suburbs will be so rewarded when these  restaurants are allowed to continue to stay open and to flourish.   I thank the Senator for his leadership.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a minute, I am going to ask to vote on  confirmation for Eunice Lee to be a U.S. circuit judge on the Second  Circuit. She is an amazing person. I interviewed her and recommended  her to the President. She will be the only public defender on the  Second Circuit. We have had very, very few public defenders on that  circuit and largely on our Federal bench. They tend to be prosecutors,  partners in big law firms. We are changing all of that and getting  people who have different walks of life--like public defenders, like  people from the ACLU, like people from different organizations--so we  have a new perspective on the bench. She is a phenomenal person. I am  so proud that she will now get on the bench.   I ask that the Senate now vote on confirmation of the Lee nomination  to be a U.S. circuit judge.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time  during any recess, adjournment, or period of morning business count  postclosure.    For the information of all Senators, the Senate will  convene at noon tomorrow and resume consideration of the infrastructure  bill.   We have been working hard all day on amendments, and, hopefully, we  can come to some agreement tomorrow, but time is burning as we go  forward.   So for the information of Members, keep working, and we will resume  at 12 noon.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
