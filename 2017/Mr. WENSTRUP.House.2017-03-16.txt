 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert any extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 1367.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Ohio?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 198 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1367.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1811                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1367) to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, with Mr. Budd  in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) and the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Walz) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1367, to  improve the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit  and retain employees.   VA's mission of honoring and serving our Nation's veterans is second  to none in the Federal Government, and a high-quality, high-performing  workforce is key to VA's ability to successfully execute on that  mission.   H.R. 1367 contains a number of provisions that would strengthen VA's  ability to identify staffing shortages, recruit employees to fill  vacant positions, quickly onboard new hires, and retain high-performing  workers across the country. It also contains provisions that would  improve leadership and accountability throughout VA and increase the  number of veterans in the Federal workforce.   To assist VA in identifying and addressing local staffing  deficiencies, this bill would modify the annual determination of  staffing shortages to include five clinical occupations and five  nonclinical occupations for each VA medical center. Staffing needs can  vary significantly from facility to facility, even within the same  State, and create a variety of delays, backlogs, and other challenges  for veterans.   This provision would allow VA to use this existing reporting tool,  which dates back to the 2014 Choice Act, to target a total of 10  occupations at each VA medical center and use VA's existing direct hire  authority to expeditiously address shortages for those occupations.   To increase leadership development opportunities for emerging leaders  and encourage the dissemination of best practices between and among VA  and private sector, the bill would establish an executive management  program to allow eligible VA and private sector employees the  opportunity to take 1-year fellowship positions in either comparable  private sector entities or VA, respectively. This idea was brought to  us by a veteran participating in the joint Veterans of Foreign Wars- Student Veterans of America legislative fellowship program and would  mirror a successful fellowship model used by the White House and the  State Department.   To increase accountability for senior VA decisionmakers, the bill  would require annual performance plans for VA political appointees,  similar to the annual performance plans that are required for Senior  Executive Service employees.                                time  1815    Like SES employees, political appointees perform at the very highest  levels and play critical roles in setting and achieving high profile  policies and priorities. It is only appropriate that they too be held  accountable for their performance.   To incentivize the hiring of veterans across the Federal Government,  the bill would change the service requirement for reservists and  guardsmen to be eligible for veterans' preference from 180 days of  consecutive Active-Duty service to 180 days of cumulative Active-Duty  service, and expand those considered preference eligible to include all  retired servicemembers.   Veterans gain a variety of skills during their time in uniform and  are often  [[Page H2137]]  uniquely suited to Federal employment. In recognition of this, some  form of veterans' preference has been in place since the Civil War. By  modernizing this important benefit today, we can bring needed skill  sets to the Federal workforce and promote employment opportunities for  veterans, a win-win if there ever was one.   To encourage former VA employees who left VA service to gain relevant  education or experience and then return to the VA, the bill would allow  the VA to noncompetitively reappoint a former employee to a position  not more than 1 grade higher than their former position.   I believe we must do everything possible to encourage former  employees to come back and work at the VA and reward them for  furthering themselves and using their new skills to benefit veterans.   In order to be eligible for reappointment under this authority, the  former employee must have voluntarily, within the prior 2 years,  maintained a satisfactory performance record while at the VA, and  retained any necessary licensures or credentials.   To assist the VA in identifying and prioritizing vacancies, the bill  would require the VA to establish a recruiting database listing each  vacant position that the VA determines is critical to the VA's mission,  is difficult to fill, or both.   Also, the bill would authorize and encourage the VA to track  qualified applicants for vacant positions and use the recruiting  database and the qualified applicant pool to quickly fill vacancies  that have gone unfilled for a prolonged time.   To ensure the VA human resources professionals have a thorough  understanding of the VA's unique hiring authorities, the bill would  require Veterans Health Administration HR employees to receive regular,  ongoing training.   The VA healthcare system benefits from direct hiring authorities for  clinical personnel under title 38, United States Code. However, these  hiring authorities are unique to the VA and can be complex and  difficult for HR employees to understand and work with, which increases  the likelihood that those authorities go underused and HR professionals  experience burnout.   This provision would support those professionals in their important  work while ensuring that veterans benefit as much as possible from the  special hiring authorities that Congress has granted the VA in statute.   To encourage highly skilled employees wishing to advance in their  career at the VA without taking on a management role, this bill would  require the VA to establish a promotional track for technical experts  that does not require transition to a managerial position. This is a  commonsense provision that would increase the VA's ability to retain  employees in highly technical positions who want to remain at the VA  and continue moving forward in their careers, but are either  uninterested in or ill-suited to becoming a manager.   To increase the understanding of the VA's succession planning  efforts, the bill would require the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a study on succession planning at each VA medical facility, as  well as within the Veterans Benefits Administration and the National  Cemetery Administration.   Earlier this week, the VA confirmed that 80 percent of current  Veterans Integrated Service Network directors and 25 percent of current  VA Medical Center directors are eligible to retire. Last year, the VA  testified that it can take more than 6 months and multiple  reannouncements to fill these important positions in both rural and  major metropolitan areas.   Effective succession planning is critical to ensuring stable  leadership and to identifying and developing emerging leaders who are  ready, willing, and able to step up when existing directors or other  managers retire or depart. I look forward to reviewing the results of  GAO's work to see what further improvements can be made in this area.   To improve recruitment and retention of younger employees, the bill  would require the VA to allow for excepted service appointments leading  to conversion to career or career-conditional employment for students  and recent graduates.   VA's existing workforce is aging and, as I mentioned just a moment  ago, increasingly retirement-eligible. Unfortunately, the VA has  historically performed poorly in comparison to other Federal agencies  when it comes to hiring younger employees, which could put the VA's  future at risk. I am hopeful that this provision will increase the VA's  ability to build a pipeline of young talent.   Finally, to increase the VA's understanding of why departing  employees choose to leave the VA and, in turn, how the VA could improve  in order to retain other employees, this bill would require the VA to  develop and deploy a standardized, anonymous exit survey process. The  VA has an existing survey process but it is underutilized, with just 30  percent of all clinical employees completing it prior to their  departure over the last 5 years, according to a GAO report issued last  year.   Factors that contribute to employees voluntarily leaving VA service  cannot be addressed unless they are identified, and this provision  would help us do that.   In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the future of the VA, our Nation's  second largest bureaucracy, depends on the VA's ability to effectively  and efficiently recruit and retain highly qualified and motivated  employees in towns and cities across this country. In an increasingly  competitive market with an increasingly retirement-eligible workforce,  the stakes are simply too high for the VA to continue to struggle to  hire the employees it needs.   While more remains to be done to simplify and shorten the VA's hiring  process and strengthen the VA's ability to bring the very best  professionals onboard to serve our veterans, H.R. 1367 is the first  step to ensuring a sufficient VA workforce is available to veterans for  generations to come.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                    Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. David P. Roe,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 1367, ``to       improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to       hire and retain physicians and other employees of the       Department of Veterans Affairs; and for other purposes.'' As       you know, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs received an       original referral and the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform a secondary referral when the bill was       introduced on March 6, 2017, I recognize and appreciate your       desire to bring this legislation before the House of       Representatives in an expeditious manner, and accordingly,       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will forego       action on the bill.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1367 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation. Further, I       request your support for the appointment of conferees from       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.        Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz: In reference to your letter on       March 10, 2017, I write to confirm our mutual understanding       regarding H.R. 1367, to improve the authority of the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians       and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs and       for other purposes.        I appreciate the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform's waiver of consideration of provisions under its       jurisdiction and its subject matter as specified in your       letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to       expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1367 and does not in any       way waive or diminish the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform's jurisdictional interests over this or       similar legislation. I will support a request from the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for appointment       to any House-Senate conference on HR. 1367. Finally, I will       also support your request to include a copy of our exchange       of letters on this matter in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration.  [[Page H2138]]         Thank you for your attention and assistance in this matter.       Sincerely,            Sincerely,                                                David P.

Mr. Chairman, I would just like to take a second here  to thank the ranking member for his hard work and putting forth many of  the ideas that are in this bill and working with us, and thank him for  his service to our country in the military and the high rank that he  achieved, and bringing those experiences to us.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Chaffetz).    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to take a second here  to thank the ranking member for his hard work and putting forth many of  the ideas that are in this bill and working with us, and thank him for  his service to our country in the military and the high rank that he  achieved, and bringing those experiences to us.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Chaffetz).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who has been a very vocal supporter of our  veterans every step of the way.    Mr. Chair, once again, I encourage all Members to  support H.R. 1367, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Poliquin) having assumed the chair, Mr. Budd, Chair of the Committee of  the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1367) to  improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and  retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
