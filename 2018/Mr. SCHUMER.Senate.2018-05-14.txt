 Madam President, first, I recently heard that my dear  friend Harry Reid has just gotten out of an operation to treat  pancreatic cancer. I have spoken to his family, and it seems that  everything went very well with the operation. The doctors say  pancreatic cancer is not a great thing, but given that the operation  couldn't have gone much better, we are all praying for Harry's speedy  recovery. Harry is a fighter literally and figuratively. I know he is  going to approach his recovery with the same energy and tenacity and  resolve that defined his public life. We all send our prayers to him.  We also wish a speedy recovery to the First Lady, who underwent a  medical procedure today as well.
