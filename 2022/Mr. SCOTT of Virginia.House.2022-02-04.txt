 Madam Speaker, this amendment would  significantly strengthen how the America COMPETES Act will work by  improving access to affordable high-quality higher education.   First, the amendment includes the JOBS Act, which expands how  individuals can use the Pell grant, using the short-term programs  enabling them to get good jobs quickly and retrain for better paying  jobs while we recover from the pandemic.   It also includes the College Transparency Act, which has helped the  Department of Education address longstanding racial and socioeconomic  inequities in higher education and track the quality of programs.  Importantly, the amendment ensures that we continue to protect the  privacy of students' personal information.   These proposals have strong bipartisan support, and I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying legislation.
