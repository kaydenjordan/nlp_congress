 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Elgin and Joanne  Darling of Willis, Michigan, for being inducted into this year's  Michigan Farmers' Hall of Fame.   Elgin and Joanne have been married for 61 years, and for decades,  they have been respected farmers and community leaders in Monroe  County. From dawn to dusk, year after year, they toiled in bountiful  fields to produce crops that fed their fellow citizens.   Through their involvement with Michigan Farm Bureau, Michigan Corn  Growers, and a host of other organizations, Elgin and Joanne have been  champions of the agriculture industry.   This remarkable legacy of service and stewardship has now been passed  down to their son, Doug. In total, six generations of Darlings have  worked on the family farm, which dates back to 1833.   Michigan farmers are among the most patriotic and hardest working  individuals I have the privilege to represent, and very few have  demonstrated more humility and work ethic than Elgin and Joanne.   On behalf of Michigan's Seventh Congressional District, we wish to  congratulate Elgin and Joanne Darling on a lifetime of farming  excellence.   They certainly belong in the Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
