 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Well, at long last the Senate will officially turn to  the NDAA. Every day, world events remind us that America faces serious  rolling threats. In too many cases President Biden's decisions have  actually made things worse, so our annual opportunity for the Senate to  have its say is as important this year as it has ever been.   Over in Russia, Putin is preparing to escalate military hostilities  along the border with Ukraine, and he is using Europe's reliance on  natural gas to bully our friends. But President Biden actually removed  obstacles to Putin's brandnew pipeline that will further extend his  leverage and further enrich his cronies.   So I hope the Senate will consider an NDAA amendment to sanction this  project and to provide additional lethal support to Ukraine. These  initiatives have previously won bipartisan support, so I would hope  Democrats would join Republicans in pushing back on Moscow.   China is flaunting major military innovations, like hypersonic  weapons systems, stepping up airspace intrusions over Taiwan, and  blaming America for their bad behavior. But while President Biden and  our colleagues like to talk a good game about China, they have yet to  really walk the walk. President Biden's budget request for our military  and defense does not even keep pace with President Biden's inflation.   In addition, while Russia openly threatens its neighbors and China  builds up its conventional and nuclear forces, there are reports that  Democrats are considering unprecedented new constraints on America's  own nuclear options through a ``no first use'' or ``sole purpose''  policy.   Our allies have strong concerns about this. I hope the Senate will  use the NDAA process to demonstrate bipartisan support for finally  modernizing our nuclear triad. That is the bedrock of deterrence and  our strongest defense against these serious threats.   So, what about terrorism?   Following President Biden's Afghanistan disaster, we are facing new  and growing threats there as well. The new Taliban government has made  cabinet ministers out of terrorists whom the Obama-Biden administration  let out of Guantanamo Bay. But the Biden-Harris administration still  naively acted like these characters care one bit about international  norms.   That is why Republicans have an amendment to ensure that none of the  funding for Afghanistan aid can flow to the Taliban. It is an  indictment of President Biden's policy that such an amendment is even  necessary, but yet that is where we are.   In the Middle East, Iranian-backed terrorists are rampaging from  Yemen to Iraq to Syria. They are emboldened as our deterrence has  eroded. Given the multiple attacks on U.S. forces and facilities, we  are fortunate more Americans haven't been killed. It may only be a  matter of time before we see U.S. casualties at the hands of Iranian- backed terrorists.   However, in the wake of these growing threats, Democrats want to use  the NDAA--a bill that should strengthen our national defense--as an  occasion to weaken the authorities that support our military's presence  and operational flexibility by repealing the 2002 AUMF. I expect a  robust debate about that.   I am glad we will finally be able to have these debates and these  votes. America needs a course correction, and the Senate needs to  supply it.                                 The Economy    Madam President, on an entirely different matter, American families  are  [[Page S8409]]  dealing with painful inflation every single day. They have been  fighting this daily battle for months now.   A few months ago, a grandfather raising four grandkids in Missouri  told reporters he had to cancel summer camp for his 8-year-old and his  6-year-old in order to keep affording diapers for their twin younger  brothers.   One Maryland woman told the local news she had gone to the grocery  store to buy meat for her family, but was turned away by the pricetag  and had to leave with a $2 loaf of bread instead.   One man in Massachusetts, who cares for his elderly mother, told  reporters that his 94-year-old mom needs the house kept warm, so they  are getting absolutely crushed--crushed--by runaway heating costs.  Here's what he had to say about it:         Before, you'd go to the store, and if you had a $100, you       could buy four bags of groceries and be happy. Now you are       lucky to get a bag. Milk, orange juice, eggs. Plus the oil       for the house, the water bills. It's just crazy. It's so much       money. How is someone supposed to survive?    This persistent and painful inflation has been directly fueled by the  reckless spending spree that Democrats rammed through in March. Even if  Washington Democrats didn't inflict more new damage, economists still  say ``we're going to see inflation get worse before it gets better.''   The Democratic leader said on March 12: ``I do not think the dangers  of inflation, at least in the near-term, are very real.''   He was catastrophically wrong. And these same people want yet another  multitrillion-dollar bite at the apple.   Look, American families know the spending part of Democrats' reckless  tax-and-spending spree would spell disaster. Sixty-seven percent just  told a survey that Washington should cut back on printing and spending  because of inflation and rising costs.   And then there is the taxing part of their reckless taxing-and- spending spree. The bill that Democrats are writing behind closed doors  would hike taxes on the American people by an estimated $1.5 trillion-- a trillion and a half dollars in tax increases.   Democrats have already turned a strong economy into a shaky economy.  Now they want to add the biggest tax hikes in a generation. A huge  chunk of that is hundreds of billions of dollars for tax hikes on  American industries and employers, because the Biden administration has  become enamored with a global scheme where countries around the world  supposedly all agree to hike their tax rates together.   This is an awful idea. Remember, in 2019, Republican policies had set  up the best economy for working Americans in a generation. This is in  large part because we just cut taxes substantially. We made America a  more attractive place to do business.   So President Biden wants to do just the opposite of that: thrust  America into some kind of global noncompete agreement. We are supposed  to promise Europe and Asia that we won't make America an especially  attractive place to bring jobs and prosperity.   Let me say that again. We are in the process of promising Europe and  Asia that we won't make America an especially attractive place to bring  jobs and prosperity.   Look, it gets worse. President Biden and Secretary Yellen want  America to leap over the cliff first, tax the heck out of American  industries while we just wait and see if our competitors actually  follow suit.   Well, you better believe China would be just thrilled to see the  Democrats' bill drain hundreds of billions of dollars out of our own  private sector as a symbolic gesture to the rest of the world.   Democrats' tax policies are just like their energy policies. They  won't build back better. They will build back Beijing. They won't build  back better. They will build back Beijing.   This is just one part of a $1.5 trillion job-killing tax hike. There  are all kinds of tax increases that would hit major employers, Main  Street small businesses, and American families. Nonpartisan experts  have confirmed the Democrats' bill would completely break the  President's promise not to raise ``a single penny more,'' he said, in  taxes on middle-class households.   They even want to send tens of billions in extra funding to the IRS  so they can hire an army of new agents to snoop and audit their way  across the country. But less than 3 percent of the huge IRS windfall  would fund better customer service for taxpayers.   Finally, in the midst of all these tax hikes, Democrats from New  York, New Jersey, and California have managed to include--listen to  this--a massive tax cut for wealthy people who choose to reside in  high-tax blue States. This bonanza for blue State millionaires and  billionaires would cost almost $300 billion on its own.   Even the Washington Post could only marvel at the audacity of this.  Here's their headline: ``The second-biggest program in the Democrats'  spending plan gives billions to the rich.'' That is the Washington  Post's assessment of it.   In fact, even though Democrats want to hike taxes by $1.5 trillion,  their bill still manages to give a net tax cut to 89 percent of people  making between $500,000 and $1 million, and 69 percent of households  making over $1 million.   This bears repeating. Even though Democrats want to hike taxes by  $1.5 trillion, their bill still manages to give a net tax cut to 89  percent of people making between $500,000 and $1 million, and 69  percent of households making over $1 million.   All of this is a huge blow to American competitiveness: job-killing  tax hikes. But Democrats make sure to look out for the ultrawealthy out  on the coasts. A supermajority of them get tax cuts. I am almost  impressed our colleagues have found a way to be this out of touch.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
