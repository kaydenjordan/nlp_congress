 Madam Speaker, this holiday season, most Americans are  using the conventional shopping method. They choose their item in the  store and pay for it at the checkout.   However, this year, others are going with a different approach: smash  and grab robberies. Thugs are ambushing stores, breaking windows, and  destroying store property, then walking out with all the merchandise  they can carry. Robberies at pharmacies and retail stores are on the  rise this year, mostly in liberal cities like San Francisco, Chicago,  and New York City. There is a clear pattern here.   Store robberies are up in Democrat-run cities that push defund the  police agendas and refrain from punishing criminals in the name of  equity. Criminals in these cities figured out there is no consequence  for busting up a Gucci store and walking out with thousands of dollars  of merchandise.   For example, in California, people can steal up to $950 worth of  merchandise without being charged with a felony. Many looters in  California cities who get arrested are quickly released because they  don't even have to pay bail.   Unfortunately, many Democrats are willingly ignorant of this trend.  They even attribute the rise in smash-and-grab robberies to the  coronavirus or deny the problem exists at all. They keep pushing their  antipolice, procriminal policies, and it is hardworking businessowners  and employees who end up paying the price.   Madam Speaker, I always remember what my parents told me: Let's not  close the barn door after the cows have already left.                            ____________________
