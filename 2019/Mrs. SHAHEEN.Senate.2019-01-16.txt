 Madam President, I join my colleagues this morning to  share the stories of the people in New Hampshire who are currently  enduring hardships because of this Trump shutdown--a shutdown that has  been termed by a number of my colleagues as the longest government  shutdown in U.S. history.   I have here a picture of Andre and his wife Maria and their three  beautiful children, from Derry, NH. Andre is an air traffic controller  who works at the Boston Terminal Radar Approach Control facility in  Merrimack, NH. It is sounds like it would be in Boston, but it is not.  It is in New Hampshire, where we have hundreds of air traffic  controllers and FAA personnel.   Andre works at the center to keep the airways safe for passengers who  are flying over the Granite State. He also represents and talks to a  number of other air traffic controllers in the New England region to  hear what they have to say.   With what he is hearing right now regarding the shutdown, Andre  writes:         Air traffic controllers have remained on the job, dedicated       to the safety of every flight, but we don't know when we will       receive our next paycheck. My colleagues and  [[Page S241]]       I have suffered the sudden loss of our income due to the       government shutdown. It's going to be hard for me to meet all       of my financial obligations.    What I am most impressed by with regard to the Federal workers with  whom I have met is their dedication to their jobs. All of those air  traffic controllers understand that the safety of the skies in the  United States depends on them, and they are there. They are not getting  paid. They are experiencing hardships like Andre is talking about, but  they are there and are doing everything they can to make sure that the  American public can fly safely.   In addition to Andre's story, I have heard from nearly 100 other air  traffic controllers in New Hampshire who are all calling for an end to  the shutdown--air traffic controllers who are protecting our safety and  who are working without pay.   I want to read an excerpt from a letter that I received from Jamie in  Auburn, NH, because I think it so exemplifies where we are and how the  American people are feeling about this government shutdown.   Jamie writes:         Dear Senator Shaheen, there are many stories to be told       regarding the effects of the government shutdown on Federal       employees--the stress of financial uncertainty, the inability       to take necessary time from work to care for our families,       and the continued degradation of FAA resources. . . . These       are but a few examples shared amongst us, but there is       something that tears at the very fabric of who we are. We       take deep pride in serving our country and providing the       safest and most efficient air traffic control system in the       world. We do so with an unwavering sense of duty and a deep       understanding of the trust bestowed on us by the American       people. To be used as pawns in a political chess match not       only disrespects us as dedicated Federal employees, but it       serves to weaken our democracy. A government that must hold       hostage the livelihood of its citizens is the very definition       of a failed democracy.    Sadly, that is what President Donald Trump is doing. He is holding  hostage hundreds of thousands of Federal workers, and he is being  enabled in this effort by the Republican leadership in this Senate who  is unwilling to bring forward the bills that would open the government  today. We could pass them today.   These are just two examples that I think articulate the very real  impact this shutdown is having on many hard-working Americans and their  families.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record these letters that I have received from air traffic controllers.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dear Senator: I'm writing to you today because of the       effects of the government shutdown on my profession and       family. My coworkers and I have remained on the job dedicated       to the safety of every flight despite the concern of when our       next paycheck will come. The government shutdown has effected       me professionally and personally.        My husband and I are both air traffic controllers and we       have 6-month-old twins. We go to work normally like any other       day and we pay for childcare. It is going to be hard to meet       all of my family's financial obligations without knowing when       our next paychecks will be. My family has no income while the       government remains shutdown.        The shutdown affects us all in many ways, but the other       major way it is effecting me is professionally. This       government shutdown is setting back air traffic control       staffing numbers.        The FAA Academy is closed during the shutdown which is       where all of our new trainees train initially.        There are controllers being forced to retire because of       age, but with the shutdown new replacements cannot be       trained. We are at a 30-year low in staffing and every day       the FAA Academy is closed the more set back staffing becomes.       New trainees that are unable to train due to the Academy       closure may lead to fewer new hires for 2019. Many       controllers are working 6-day work weeks and these new hires       will help.        This career has been all I wanted to do since I was little.       Like my coworkers I perform my duties professionally and to       the highest safety standards despite not knowing when my next       paycheck is. We will all continue to do so, but with       financial concerns until the shutdown ends. Please End the       government shutdown. Thank you for your time.            Sincerely,      Kristen (Milford, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen: I write today to urge you to end the       current partial government shutdown caused by a lapse in       annual appropriations. As a federal air traffic controller       and constituent, I want you to know how the shutdown is       affecting me.        Since air traffic control specialists perform life and       safety excepted activities as defined by the Antideficiency       Act, controllers like me have remained on the job, dedicated       to the safety of every flight, since the beginning of the       partial shutdown on December 22nd. However, my family will be       placed under significant financial stress if the shutdown       lasts beyond the current pay period. We don't know when we       will receive our next paycheck.        The Federal Aviation Administration has closed its training       academy in Oklahoma City, where new controllers arrive to       begin their careers, as I did ten years ago this week.       Classes have been cancelled, which will invariably lead to       fewer new hires in 2019. Stopping the hiring and training       pipeline exacerbates the current controller staffing crisis.       The number of fully certified air traffic controllers is now       at a 30-year low.        Please do whatever you can to end the government shutdown       without delay.            Sincerely,      Aaron (Milford, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen: There are many stories to be told       regarding the effects of the government shutdown on federal       employees. The stress of financial uncertainty, the inability       to take necessary time from work to care for our families,       and the continued degradation of FAA resources. . . These       are but a few examples shared amongst us. But, this is       something that tears at the very fabric of who we are. We       take deep pride in serving our country, providing the       safest and most efficient air traffic control system in       the world.

To be used as pawns in a political chess       match not only disrespects us as dedicated federal       employees but it serves to weaken our democracy. A       government that must hold hostage the livelihood of its       citizens is the very definition of a failed democracy.        The Congress, Senate, and The White House has once again       tarnished what was once considered the beacon of democracy. .       . The image of the United States of America.        Yes, I and my family need this government open. I need to       be paid for my continued dedication. . . for my work. . .       But, the American people need the practice of government       shutdowns to end. The way for political agendas to be       advanced is through diplomatic compromise not party-lined       standoffs.        Please free my family, my colleagues, and the American       people from this governmental siege of our livelihoods and       open our government. Restore the faith of the American       people.            Sincerely,      Jamie (Auburn, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen: I am writing to you today because of       the partial government shutdown that is causing 800,000       federal employees to go without the certainty of their       paychecks. This uncertainty is adding undue stress to       ourselves and our jobs because of financial obligations.        As an air traffic controller and constituent, I want you to       know how the partial government shutdown is affecting me. For       the last TWO weeks, other controllers and I have remained on       the job, dedicated to the safety of every flight. Even       without knowing when we will get paid, or even if we will get       paid.        As my husband and I do not know when or if I will receive       my paycheck, we are having to stretch every last penny to       meet all our financial obligations. If this shutdown       continues for much longer, we do not know how or if some of       our bills will be paid.        We ask you to end this shutdown immediately!            Sincerely,      Caitlin (Amherst, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Jeanne Shaheen: As an air traffic controller       and constituent, I want you to know how the partial       government shutdown is affecting me. For the last two weeks,       air traffic controllers have remained on the job, dedicated       to the safety of every flight. Yet, we don't know when we       will receive our next paycheck. My colleagues and I have       suffered the sudden loss of our income due to the government       shutdown. I am a college graduate and have numerous student       loans to pay as well as trying to provide for my family.        Please, we as air traffic controllers beg, end the       government shutdown.            Very Respectfully,      Adam (Hudson, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen: As an air traffic controller and       constituent, I want you to know how the partial government       shutdown is affecting me. For the last couple weeks, air       traffic controllers have remained on the job, dedicated to       the safety of every flight. Yet, we don't know when our next       paycheck will come. This has placed an immense amount of       stress and financial burden on me and my family. We are       having to make choices on whether or not to pay certain bills       or buy groceries.        Please end the government shutdown immediately!            Sincerely,      Joshua (New Boston, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen: I am writing to let you know that the       government shutdown is negatively impacting me, my wife and       family.        As the shutdown continues my wife and I are having to make       some difficult financial decisions. We have two daughters,       one just out of college and the other in her senior  [[Page S242]]       year at UVM. Along with all of our regular monthly bills we       have student loan payments and tuition due.        Not knowing when to expect our next paycheck is causing       undue stress on me, my wife and family.        I would like to see you help end the shutdown as soon as       possible!      Ronald (Brookline, NH).                                   ____         Dear Jeanne Shaheen: First, thank you for all that you do       for our state and country. I am writing you today with regard       to the government shutdown. As an air traffic control       trainee, my job security is something I have to worry about       until I certify. Unfortunately, the shutdown has me worrying       about my income and financial obligations as well. Morale is       notably down at work, and the staffing only gets worse as the       more senior controllers approach retirement. Anything you can       do to assist in the swift cease of this shutdown would be       greatly appreciated by air traffic controllers nationwide.       Thank you for your time.            Sincerely,      Andre (Nashua, NH).                                   ____         Dear Jeanne Shaheen: I'm writing to you in regards to the       government shutdown. If this shutdown continues it will put a       huge financial burden on my family. At this time I am the       sole provider for my household. My husband is a small       business owner in New Hampshire and is currently not       collecting income to keep his business going. We have two       children. A two-year-old boy and a five-month-old daughter.       Since there is currently no paid maternity leave I had to       live off of my savings while out with my new born, which is       why I have no money saved up to cover all of our expenses       during this shutdown. Going into debt because I can't pay for       the childcare I use (while still working) is not an option.       Please find a way to stop this shut down.      Lanna (Nashua, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen: Please, put an end to the government       shutdown. I soon will have used my entire savings to pay my       current bills. I now, don't have the down payment for a house       that I was ready to buy. I've had to pass up on a vacation       this month, skiing in NH, in fear that I won't get paid.        Please Senator Shaheen, put an end to this government shut       down. After 30 years of service in the USAF and FAA, this is       a slap in the face.      James (Manchester, NH).                                   ____         The Honorable Jeanne Shaheen: Please- end the shutdown!        I am a 30-year controller, and I don't think I will be       employed at the end of January.        The financial impact of the shutdown is a burden that I       should not have to deal with at this stage in my career.        Staffing is the worst it has ever been and a continued       shutdown will have negative effects on the air traffic system       for years!        Please work to end the shutdown!!!      Maurice (Derry, NH).                                   ____         Dear Honorable Shaheen: I am writing to you today to inform       you of the impact the partial government shutdown is having       on me, as an air traffic controller, and my family. For the       last two weeks, I have worked air traffic, not knowing when       I'd be paid next. I am dedicated to the safety of every       flight. This sudden loss of income as well as paid leave is       impacting my life multiple ways. First, I missed paid time       off that was prescheduled, around the holiday with my family.       With one child, a patient at Mass General, and another at       Boston Children's Hospital, I have had to miss out on paid/      earned sick leave for both their appointments. Lastly, as a       support for the training department, I am seeing a direct       impact on future controllers.        Please end the government shutdown immediately!            Sincerely,      Kristine (Nashua, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen As an air traffic controller and       constituent, I want you to know how the partial government       shutdown has affected me. As an air traffic controller I work       a job that is 24/7, 365 days a year.        We plan and bid our vacations 15 months in advance.       However, because I am an excepted employee engaged in life-      saving activities, my vacation time during Christmas and New       Year's was canceled. I had to work over the holidays and       missed this time spent with family. This combined with       uncertainty of when my next paycheck will come is adding       stress that is not needed.        PLEASE END THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY!            Sincerely,                                                 Seth (Hollis, NH).     I know every Member of the Senate has heard from  constituents who are facing significant hardships as a result of the  shutdown. I know every Member wants this shutdown to end.  Unfortunately, President Trump doesn't seem to want this shutdown to  end.   The House has already passed appropriations bills that would reopen  the government. This appropriations legislation is not partisan. In  fact, they are bills that have already had bipartisan support in the  Senate. So I urge President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and our  Republican colleagues to take up these bills to reopen the government.  I believe we should reopen the government. Let's do our jobs so the  rest of America can do theirs.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
