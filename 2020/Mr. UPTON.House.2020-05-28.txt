 Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank Mr. Phillips and  Mr. Roy for working together on this important legislation.   When the President signed the Paycheck Protection Program nearly 2  months ago, it provided a real lifeline to our small businesses,  without a doubt. We have had some pretty rough seas, a typhoon. But at  the end of the day, after 8 weeks, Mr. Speaker, if you were a  small business and you allocated 75 percent of the money that you  received as that loan for employees' salaries, healthcare, et cetera,  that loan would become a grant; and the response was overwhelming. A  $250 billion program was exhausted after 10 days.    After we came back and did another job, we doubled down. We gave it  another $310 billion on top of that. Unbelievable.   As much as all of us wanted this nightmare to end by Easter, we are  now past Memorial Day, and those small businesses are still not open.  Many of them are still shuttered, and they can't possibly meet that 75  percent standard that their lender, their community bank, or their  credit union offered them to be able to convert that loan to a grant.   So, without the changes in this bipartisan bill, that program instead  will be an anchor that will take them down to the very bottom. We can't  let that happen, no way.   The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus endorsed this flexibility bill.  It is one that we need to get done. I hope that the Senate can take  what we do today and pass it before the end of the week. We need to  provide that relief to our small businesses and the millions of  employees that it impacts.
