 Mr. Speaker, the American people and Members of  Congress cannot ignore being on the brink of war. Nor can we ignore the  fact that the Constitution indicates in Article I that it is the  Congress that has the responsibility and duty to declare war.   Nor can we ignore the breaking news of 10 rockets that have just hit  a base in Iraq that houses U.S. troops or the 4,000 troops that have  been sent in the last 24 hours or the reckless decision made by this  administration to kill a very bad man in a manner that has created  havoc in the Mideast.   It is interesting to suggest that our allies are supportive when, in  the last 24 hours, Israel said they had nothing to do with it.  Presidents Obama and Bush, competent and prepared, indicated that this  was not the right thing to do.   My concern is that we, as a Nation, are defenders, and we can defend  ourselves. We are powerful. That is not the point.   The point is that we can do a tactic, but where is the strategy? It  is crucial that we do not send young men and women into battle  recklessly.   I believe the Congress needs to pass a war powers resolution, an  AUMF, immediately.                            ____________________
