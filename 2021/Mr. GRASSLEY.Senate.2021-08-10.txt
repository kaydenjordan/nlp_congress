 I call up amendment No. 3251, and ask that it be  reported by number.    Now hear me. You will be shocked what the Democrats  want to do in their budget. They want to use reconciliation to provide  a $120 billion tax cut to the wealthy through SALT relief. The  nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates 51 percent of the  benefit from that repeal would go to those making over $1 million,  while those with incomes under $50,000 wouldn't see any benefit.   The liberal Tax Policy Center says the top one-tenth of 1 percent of  households would receive an average tax cut of $144,000 a year.   Democrats cry the wealthy are not paying their fair share, at the  same time proposing to give billionaires six-figure tax cuts. If my  Democratic colleagues are genuine in their concern about the wealthy  paying too little taxes, their budget is not the way to do it.   So vote to support my amendment to impose restrictions on repealing  and modifying the SALT cap that would result in tax cuts for the  wealthy.   I reserve my time.    Do I have any time left?    Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon should have read  the 2017 tax bill, and he wouldn't give a speech like that. The Wyden  amendment is an example of Democrats on the one hand complaining the  wealthy pay too little tax while supporting massive tax cuts for the  rich.   Nothing in my amendment prevents changes to the Tax Code that would  make it more progressive. Capping the SALT deduction as part of the  2017 tax bill increases the progressivity of the Tax Code and allowed  for larger tax cuts to the middle class. Undoing the SALT cap would  make the Tax Code less progressive and jeopardize middle-class tax cuts  that it helped enable.   Anyone who supports the wealthy paying their fair share should have  supported my amendment and vote no on the Wyden amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3569     Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3650 and  ask that it be reported by number.    This amendment creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund  for legislation that would prevent illegal immigrants with criminal  records from obtaining lawful permanent resident status in our country.  It is pretty simple. Prohibiting illegal immigrants with criminal  convictions or pending criminal charges from receiving legal status in  the United States should be a very easy call and shouldn't be very  controversial. I urge my colleagues to support it.   I reserve my time.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, yesterday, the Democrats unveiled their  reckless tax and spend budget plan.   With our country experiencing the highest inflation it has seen in  decades and our national debt approaching an alltime high, common sense  would dictate that we ought to use the budget process to get our fiscal  house in order.   Instead, my Democrat colleagues are intent on using the budget to  embark on a liberal wish list spending spree.   My Democrat colleagues' budget calls for over $4 trillion in new  spending over the next decade and annual deficits would average $1.6  trillion over that period. As a result, the national debt would reach  119 percent of our economy, shattering the World War II record of 106  percent.   Much of this new spending, ballooning the debt and deficits, is the  product of a single bill Democrats hope to pass before the end of the  year under the guise of so-called ``human infrastructure.''   Infrastructure is popular and needed. It helps keep our economy  competitive over the long run. That is why Democrat leaders initially  wanted their multitrillion dollar wish list to ride along on an  infrastructure package. That plan fell apart when a bipartisan group  was able to agree on a separate bill with just real infrastructure.   This new spending spree, far from being an infrastructure bill like  the bipartisan bill, has nothing to do with building roads or bridges.  Instead, it would create massive new entitlements and impose massive  new tax increases.   This mishmash of massive new spending and job-killing tax hikes would  act as a double whammy on middle-income Americans, small business  owners, and farmers.   Trillions of dollars in new spending is likely to set inflation  ablaze. Inflation is a stealth tax that steals the value of the dollars  Americans already earned. Hard-working Americans are already paying the  price of excessive spending in the form of inflation with prices rising  throughout the economy.   As a result, while wages increased at a pace of 3.6 percent last  month, Americans found themselves struggling to keep their heads above  water with prices soaring 5.4 percent.   Now, Democrats want to add tax hikes on top of this, which will slow  economic growth, reduce business investment, and result in lower wages  and fewer jobs over the long-run.   What is more, the tax hikes that are being discussed take direct aim  at family run business and farms.   This includes raising their income taxes, their capital gains taxes,  and imposing a confiscatory new death tax when operations are passed to  the next generation.   Higher taxes, excessive spending, and escalating debt are not a  prescription for prosperity. They are instead are a recipe for fiscal  disaster.   I urge my Democrat colleagues to tap the brakes before it is too  late.   Please think about the future and abandon your reckless tax and spend  agenda.                            ____________________
