 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we consider  legislation to strengthen supply chains and to stand up for our small  businesses. For years, we have been too reliant on goods made in other  countries.   The pandemic has exacerbated and exposed that reality. We have seen  shortages from personal protective equipment to ventilators and  semiconductor chips. Those supply chain weaknesses continue to  contribute to rising prices and inflation.   We should be making more in America. We have many small businesses in  Kansas and across the country that are willing and able to step up to  the plate.   As we take up the America COMPETES Act this week, legislation drafted  with both parties and aimed at creating jobs, addressing inflation, and  strengthening American manufacturing, it is absolutely essential that  we include small and medium manufacturers in our consideration.   In my district, the Kansas Third, we have businesses who pivoted  their entire production lines to fill gaps in our medical supply  chains, helping protect frontline healthcare workers amid significant  shortages in personal protective equipment early in the pandemic. At  that time, nurses and hospital staff were having to reuse masks and  gowns, putting themselves at incredible risk.   We were slowed by our reliance on foreign-made supplies, and here we  had small businesses that were ready to help if we had just given them  a chance.   The America COMPETES Act includes a program to build a stable and  adaptable supply chain for our national stockpile, one that is flexible  enough to react in emergency situations without completely breaking  down, as it did before. As we work to build that flexibility, it would  be a mistake to shut out the producers we have right here at home.   My amendment is going to ensure that when we are restocking and  restructuring our strategic national stockpile that we are working with  a range of businesses. It would require that smaller manufacturers get  a seat at the table, not just big corporations, because I can tell you  from experience that they stand ready to pitch in, ready to train and  employ our workers. It is our job to ensure they get the chance to do  just that.   The America COMPETES Act is a major opportunity to deal in our  domestic industries and workers. It is an opportunity to address root  causes of inflation and bring down our costs long term, one  particularly important example being incentives for domestic  semiconductor manufacturing. And it is an opportunity for us to invest  in  [[Page H335]]  our global standing, putting our workers, farmers, manufacturers, and  businesses on a level playing field with countries like China and other  nations.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and to support  small manufacturers.                            ____________________
