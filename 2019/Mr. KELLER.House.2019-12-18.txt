 Madam Speaker, today will forever be remembered as a  stain on our Republic.   These impeachment proceedings are not based upon facts, evidence,  reason, or any inappropriate or impeachable actions by our President.  Instead, the actions being taken by those favoring impeachment are a  product of their disdain for President Trump, his America First agenda,  and, particularly, a disdain by the other party for the 63 million  Americans who elected him as President.   Again, these Articles of Impeachment are not based on any facts but,  rather, on hearsay, presumptions, innuendo, and feelings, feelings by  Democrats and career bureaucrats who have wanted President Trump  removed from office since the day he was elected.   In defense of the Constitution, I urge all Members to oppose both  Articles of Impeachment. It is unclear who will judge those voting for  impeachment today more harshly: history or voters.   I want Democrats voting for impeachment today to know that I will be  praying for them from the Gospel of Luke, the 23rd chapter, verse 34:  ``And Jesus said, `Father, forgive them, for they know not what they  do.'''
