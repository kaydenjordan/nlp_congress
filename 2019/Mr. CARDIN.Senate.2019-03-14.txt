 Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to President  Trump's so-called emergency declaration of a crisis and invasion on our  southern border, an attempt to misappropriate funds to build the  President's border wall. The President's actions here are an affront to  the constitutional separation of powers, our checks and balances, and  the congressional power of the purse to set appropriation levels.   The very nature of how President Trump decided, finally, to declare a  so-called emergency at our southern border shows that he, too, knows  that there is no real national emergency at our southern border.  President Trump himself admitted, in announcing this so-called  emergency in the Rose Garden:         I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't       need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.    It doesn't sound like a national emergency. We know that a medieval  border wall would be a tremendously wasteful expenditure of resources,  as opposed to smarter border security technology that would enhance  screening at our ports of entry and specifically target transnational  criminal operations smuggling contraband into the United States.   The Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power of the  purse.  [[Page S1876]]  Article I, section 9, clause 7 provides that ``No Money shall be drawn  from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''   Article I, section 8, clause 1 provides that ``the Congress shall  have Power To . . . provide for the common Defence and general Welfare  of the United States.''   Additionally, the presentment clause of the Constitution requires  that the President either approve or veto a bill, and it does not give  him the power to change the text of a law or appropriation levels or to  cast a line item veto for certain provisions.   The Supreme Court held in the line-item veto case of ``Clinton v.  City of New York'' in 1998:         There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes       the President to enact, to amend or to repeal statutes. . . .       Our first President understood the text of the Presentment       Clause as requiring that he either ``approve all the parts of       a bill, or reject it in toto.''    The courts have regularly upheld the authority of Congress by  statute--and not the President by fiat--to set funding levels. As the  Supreme Court said in Hooe v. United States, in 1910, ``it is for  Congress, proceeding under the Constitution, to say what amount may be  drawn from the Treasury in pursuit of appropriations.''   The Ninth Circuit held in United States v. McIntosh, in 2016, that if  the executive branch spends money in violation of appropriations law,  ``it would be drawing funds from the Treasury without authorization by  statute, and thus violating the Appropriations Clause.''   The Supreme Court held in the Office of Personnel Management v.  Richmond, in 1990, that ``any exercise of a power granted by the  Constitution to one or the other branches of Government is limited by  the valid reservation of congressional control over funds in the  Treasury.''   Beyond the legal challenges in court to the President's emergency  declaration, Congress has a responsibility to act, as well, and rein in  the President's abuse of power in order to maintain the proper  separation of powers and checks and balances under our Constitution.   Former Republican Members of Congress recently wrote a powerful open  letter to the current Republican Members of Congress on this issue.  Signatories include former Members John Danforth, Mickey Edwards, Chuck  Hagel, Jim Kolbe, Olympia Snowe, and Richard Lugar. Let me quote:         Our oath is to put the country and its Constitution above       everything, including party politics or loyalty to a       president. . . . That is why we are coming together to urge       those of you who are now charged with upholding the authority       of the first branch of government to resist efforts to       surrender those powers to a president.        We offer two arguments against allowing a president--any       president, regardless of party--to circumvent congressional       authority. One is the constitutional placing of all lawmaking       power in the hands of the people's representatives. . . . The       power of the purse rests with Congress. . . . If you allow a       president to ignore Congress, it will be not your authority       but that of your constituents that is deprived of the       protections of true representative government.    Let me just add that, in addition to what was said in that letter, we  have made appropriations here. We expect those appropriations to be  carried out. We are the representatives of the people. In my own State  of Maryland, we have many military construction contracts on many of  the military installations that could be put at jeopardy. Maryland is  the proud home of major military installations, including Pax River,  Indian Head, Andrews, Fort Detrick, Fort Meade, and the APG, or the  Aberdeen Proving Ground. It is our responsibility to make those  appropriations. If you let this emergency power go, that action could  be compromised by the President of the United States, denying the  people of this country their representative government.   Let me continue the letter from our former Republican colleagues. The  letter continues:         The second argument goes directly to the question each of       you must face: how much are you willing to undermine both the       Constitution and the Congress in order to advance a policy       outcome that by all legitimate means is not achievable? The       current issue--a wall on our southern border--has gone       through the process put in place by the Constitution. It has       been proposed by the President, it has been debated by       Congress, and the representatives of the people allocated       funding at a level deemed appropriate by Congress. We       understand that there are many Members of Congress who       disagree with the final funding compromise reached by a       bipartisan group of legislators.    And it was approved overwhelmingly by Congress.         To you, we ask this question: what will you do when a       president of another party uses the precedent you are       establishing to impose policies to which you are unalterably       opposed? There is no way around this difficulty: what powers       are ceded to a president whose policies you support may also       be used by presidents whose policies you abhor.    The letter then concludes:         We who have served where you serve now call on you to honor       your oath of office and to protect the Constitution and the       responsibilities it vested in Congress. We ask that you pass       a joint resolution terminating the emergency declared by the       President on February 15, 2019.    Congress should therefore take all necessary action to overturn this  unlawful Presidential declaration on border security under the National  Emergencies Act or other authorities. Instead of trying to raid funds  that have been designated for critical military construction and  environmental projects, the President should work with Congress to  enact comprehensive reform.   The Senate should vote to uphold the Constitution and its legislative  prerogatives, including the power of the purse, and to cancel the  President's emergency declaration.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
