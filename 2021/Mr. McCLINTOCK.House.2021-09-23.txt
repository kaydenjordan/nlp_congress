 Mr. Speaker, the collapse of our southern border now  poses a mortal danger to our country. No civilization has ever survived  the magnitude of mass migration that this administration is not only  accommodating but is encouraging.   When Donald Trump left office, we had operational control of our  borders. The border wall was nearing completion. Court-ordered  deportations were finally being enforced. The Migrant Protection  Protocols negotiated with Mexico reduced the number of fraudulent  asylum claims to a trickle.   All that Biden needed to do was to continue these policies. Instead,  he reversed them on his first day in office. He ordered the border wall  to be abandoned, leaving construction gaps that make it useless. He  ordered ICE to cease enforcing the law. He reversed the remain in  Mexico policy. And he sent a clear and unmistakable message heard  around the world: America is now a nation without borders. And nations  without borders aren't around very long.   The numbers are staggering. In July, Customs and Border Patrol  encountered 212,000 foreign nationals illegally entering our country.  That is the entire population of Birmingham, Alabama, in a month. In  August, another 209,000, which is Des Moines, Iowa.   There have been, already, 1\1/2\ million such encounters this year,  and the Gallup organization warns us there are 42 million people living  in poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean who intend to come here  if they can. And they are.   Almost overnight last week, 15,000 Haitian nationals illegally  crossed the border and set up camp in Del Rio, Texas. It is reported  that DHS is tracking an additional 40,000 to 60,000 Haitian migrants  between Colombia and the U.S. border. Contrary to claims by the  administration, only a fraction of them have been returned to Haiti. It  appears the vast majority are being rapidly and furtively processed  into our communities.                                time  1030    There is no denying the fact that this is a deliberate policy by this  administration to fundamentally change the economy, politics, culture,  customs, and institutions of the American Republic.   Democrats on the Judiciary Committee just voted to grant amnesty,  permanent legal residence, and a fast track to citizenship for between  8 and 10 million foreign nationals who have already illegally entered  our country, defied our laws, thumbed their noses at our sovereignty,  and are demanding to stay and are expecting American taxpayers to  continue to support them.   Eight to 10 million, we need to understand what that means. Eight  million is the entire population--every man, woman, and child--living  in the States of Alaska, Maine, Delaware, Wyoming, North Dakota, South  Dakota, Rhode Island, Montana, and Vermont combined.   This is at a time when real family earnings are declining, crime is  increasing, homelessness is rampant, and mounting debt is killing the  American Dream of a better future for our children.   Is it any wonder our borders are overwhelmed? Ask the migrants why  they are coming. Every one of them will tell you it is because of Joe  Biden's promise of admission, amnesty, and citizenship.   That is why we are seeing this tragic and shocking trafficking of  young children, and it is going to continue until we secure our border  and start enforcing our immigration laws, which are already among the  most liberal in the world.   We are told we need to legalize those who illegally took Americans'  jobs as essential workers during the pandemic. The fact is, 45 percent  of the entire workforce is considered essential by the government. That  is hardly an exclusive group. What the Democrats are really saying is  that if you are part of the 55 percent of Americans they don't consider  essential and you lost your job during their leftist lockdowns, you  will be pushed aside for those who violated our laws, broke the rules,  and now compete in the job market that you are trying to get back into,  while using your money to do it.   Please, someone, explain to me: How are American workers helped by  flooding the labor market with another wave of illegal immigration? How  are our children, who have been robbed of an entire year of their  educations, helped by filling their classrooms with non-English- speaking classmates? How are our communities made safer by making it  harder to deport criminal illegal aliens and gang members? How are our  hospitals made more accessible by overwhelming emergency rooms with  illegal immigrants demanding care?   Mr. Speaker, people are asking me every day: How could this have  happened to our country? And the answer is simple. If you voted for the  Democrats, this is what you voted for. And if you are surprised, you  weren't paying attention.                            ____________________
