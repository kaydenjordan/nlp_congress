 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate  companion to my bill, S. 4075 the Reinvigorating Lending for the Future  Act of 2020. The U.S. Economic Development Administration and its  Revolving Loan Fund program provide desperately needed loans to small  businesses and local community organizations across the United States.   This funding is often a lifeline to rural communities overlooked by  traditional financing. However, under current burdensome regulations,  EDA RLF grantees must report on these funds ``in perpetuity''--even on  loans made and paid back decades ago. I have heard from the Minnesota  Association of Development Organizations, 8 of the 10 organizations  serve my district, that this requirement takes away valuable time from  the work at hand which is providing access to capital and supporting  businesses.   Now more than ever, as many Americans are struggling to stay afloat  during the COVID-19 pandemic, the RLF Act is a vital sign of support to  our small businesses back home. My bill would remove this unnecessary  requirement and allow local communities the freedom they need to  recover their economies. This bipartisan legislation requires no  additional funding, and creates more flexibility for regional economic  development. The RLF Act returns decision making to the local units of  government, eliminates unnecessary reporting and is just good common  sense. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
