 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Tax Reform     Mr. President, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed  into law in December, we heard a lot about what was going to  immediately happen. This was going to be a tax cut for the rich.  Corporations were going to use their money to buy back their stock and  not share it with the people who work for them.   The Senate was as divided on a partisan basis as the Senate could be.  Every person in the majority voted for the tax bill. Every person in  the minority voted against the tax bill.   We heard from some of the leaders of the other side that it would be  Armageddon. We heard from President Obama's Treasury Secretary that  10,000 people would die every year if the tax bill was signed into law.  We heard that the average family would only get crumbs and scraps from  the tax bill. It is turning out that this is not what appears to be  happening at all.   Companies have stepped up to show that in a growing economy--in an  economy they believe is going to grow--they value the people they work  with and they value the employees of their company in a way we wouldn't  have anticipated. I thought this would happen as we saw the economy  take off from the tax bill. It didn't occur to most of us that  companies would step up on day one and say: We are going to value and  show our value to the people who work for us.   Over 3.8 million people now have received over $4 billion in bonuses.  A lot of those happened in my State of Missouri. The Central Bank of  St. Louis, which employs over 2,000 people, gave a $1,000 bonus to all  full-time employees, and the 246 part-time employees will get a $500  bonus.   Charter Communications announced, as many people have, that they are  going to increase their own minimum wage. Whatever their minimum  salaries have been in the past, those are now going to be higher. The  best kind of minimum wage increase is because you believe that is the  fair thing to do for your employees and also because you believe it is  what you need to do to keep good employees in a rising economy. I think  we had gotten so used to the stagnant economy of the last 8 or so years  that people had forgotten what happens when the economy begins to grow.  So Charter Communications is now increasing their minimum wage to $15  an hour.   Commerce Bancshares, in Kansas City, has more than 2,300 employees in  Missouri, and they gave a $1,000 bonus to all of their full-time  employees and a $250 bonus to their part-time employees.   Mid-Am Metal Forming in southwest Missouri gave all 140 of their  employees a cash bonus.   This is not just about big companies. This is about little companies  looking at how they want to grow and knowing that to grow, they need to  keep a workforce that can be part of that growth.   Great Southern Bank, in my hometown of Springfield, has over 800  Missouri employees. They gave a $1,000 bonus to full-time employees and  a $500 bonus to part-time employees.   Walmart announced that the 25,700 Missourians who work for them are  not only getting bonuses, but they are raising the starting wage for  full-time employees to just under $14 an hour--substantially higher  than the wage otherwise.   That doesn't sound like crumbs to the people who are getting those  bonuses. They see what they can do with it.   Solomon Essex, a warehouse worker at Dynamic Fastener, in Raytown,  told us he was using his $1,000 bonus to help his daughter buy a car.   Mary Beth Hartman, who owns a construction company in Springfield,  said: ``I've been able to offer my long tenured employees a week of  vacation'' that they didn't have before. ``They're getting plenty of  overtime; they have job security.'' She is also creating new jobs in  her business.   It is a good start, but I think there are even more announcements and  more good opportunities ahead.   Senator Capito and I were on the floor talking about this before the  bill passed. I said several times that there are two ways to increase  your take-home pay. One is for the government to take less out of it,  and another one is for you to get a better job to start with. We are  already beginning to see both of those things happen. When you double  the standard deduction, when you double the child tax credit, and when  you lower the rates, the new code allows you to have more money.   Our friends on the other side said people wouldn't get a tax cut. But  90 percent of the workers in the country who have income tax deducted  from their paycheck are going to have less income tax deducted on the  same pay in February than they would have had in December. What does  that mean?   I will mention here that the University of Missouri just beat  Kentucky in basketball for the first time since we got into the SEC, a  handful of years ago. We didn't want to let that go unmentioned.   The Boone County clerk announced that he had run the payroll for the  first time for all 485 county employees, and the average county  employee was getting $150.54 a month more than they were getting on  that same salary last year. Many of those employees have two people in  their house working. This is just the one salary--an average of  $150.54. That is about $1,800 a year.   A brand-new deputy sheriff in Boone County who earns $45,905 will  have an extra $1,929 this year that they didn't have if they started  that same job in November or December of last year. Now, $1,900 does a  lot of things. Two hundred dollars a month only seems like a lot if you  don't have it. In Boone County, that payroll for 485 people calculates  right at $945,000 a year that those employees will have that in the  past they would have sent to the Federal Government. Some of it will be  saved. Some of it will be spent.   When I was flying back from Kansas City on Sunday, a guy behind me on  the plane, as we were getting off, tapped me on the shoulder and said:  Thanks for the tax cut. My wife and I just got our first checks with  the new tax rates, and we are going to have $5,000 more this year than  we had last year. We are going to put every penny of it in our kids'  college savings account and we are really happy about it. We are really  happy about it.   We don't often hear people say: We are really happy about something  you have done for us because it is going to make a difference for the  future of our family.   But this tax bill will.   For a single parent with one child in Missouri who makes $41,000 a  year, their taxes are going to go down 75 percent. That single parent  with one child will have $1,400 more this year than they had last  year--over $100 every single month.   A family of four who makes about $75,000 will have $2,000 more. That  is a 50 percent tax cut for that family. For most people, that is 2  months' worth of groceries. It is gasoline. It is an electric bill.   If you get your electricity from a privately owned electric company,  like many people do in 47 States, some of the electric companies are  going to be reducing their rates. Now, if you have a rural electric  coop, like my farm in Strafford has, or a public utility, like my house  in Springfield has, you will not get that tax cut, but lots of  Missourians get their electric from somebody that pays taxes. If you  pay taxes, you are going to be reducing your electric bill because that  35 percent rate  [[Page S678]]  was figured into what you are allowed to charge. Now you are paying 20  percent. That is money you are going to be giving back to the families  and businesses you serve.   Helping families means ensuring that they have more opportunities in  the future. Being part of a growing economy means you are going to have  more opportunities in the future. We are seeing all those things  happen, and I think we are going to continue to see them happen--not  just in businesses like AT&T, Boeing, and Apple, which, by the way,  just brought all of the money they had earned outside the country back  home. They just announced that they are bringing 100 percent of  everything back, which they would have not brought back at a 35-percent  rate. But they are glad to bring it back at the rate in this tax bill.  We are glad to see all those companies in a more competitive  marketplace, just like small businesses are.   So even though the law went into effect just a little over a month  ago, I think we are seeing the kind of reaction we would have hoped  for. Families are beginning to see that what they were told about the  tax bill wasn't true. You should never want to say something that is  not true, but surely you should not want to do it when in 60 days you  are going to be proven not true in the one thing that everybody looks  at--which is a bigger paycheck than they had 60 days ago.   In spite of what was said, 9 out of 10 workers are going to have a  bigger paycheck, and those are hard-working families. The people who  don't benefit from the tax cut are the people at the richest end of the  tax scale, not the other end of the tax scale.   So I think we are off to a good start. I think we ought to be talking  about a growing economy. All of us ought to be watching, after a decade  of not seeing the economy grow, what has happened over the last few  months and what really happens now as we move to a better place for  families, a better place for jobs, and a better place for competition  because of the tax bill we passed in December and the President signed  into law.   With that, I think other colleagues of mine are here. Senator Capito  and I have been on the floor a number of times talking about this  together, and I know she is here to follow me now.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from West Virginia.
