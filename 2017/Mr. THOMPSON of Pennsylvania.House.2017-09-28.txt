Today, we no longer refer to it as food stamps, but as the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. In 40 years, there  have been numerous changes and updates, but the goal remains the same:  to end hunger in America.   SNAP lessens the effects of poverty on some of our most vulnerable  citizens. The results are proven. According to the Census Bureau, SNAP  lifted 5 million Americans, including 2.2 million children, out of  poverty in 2012 alone. SNAP generates $1.80 in economic activity for  every $1 in new SNAP benefits.   In 2013, SNAP payment accuracy was 96.8 percent, which was a historic  high.  [[Page H7592]]  Participating in SNAP for 6 months decreased food insecurity up to 10  percent, including households with children.   Mr. Speaker, for over four decades, the program has become more  effective, more efficient, and more modern. I look forward to  continuing our work to improve SNAP, to serve those in need, and to  provide pathways out of poverty.                            ____________________
