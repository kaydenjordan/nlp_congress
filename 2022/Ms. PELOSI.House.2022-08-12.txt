 Madam Speaker, I thank you for your tremendous leadership  and the other chairs for bringing this legislation to the floor.   The hour is growing late, and as a courtesy to my colleagues, I  intend to shorten my remarks. For those that I shorten the remarks, I  promise to put them in the Record if you promise to read them.   Let me also begin by saying that I associate myself with the remarks  of all of my Democratic colleagues, and that covers a lot of territory.   Madam Speaker, under the visionary leadership of President Biden,  Democrats have forged historic progress for America's families.   First, we enacted our life-saving American Rescue Plan: to propel us  out of the pandemic by putting money in pockets, vaccines in arms,  children safely in school, and people back to work.   Next, we secured the transformative bipartisan infrastructure package  to create good-paying union jobs rebuilding our Nation.   This week, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which  declares our economic independence, strengthens our national security,  and enhances our families' financial future. We also honored the  valiant service of our men and women in uniform with the PACT Act.   Today, Madam Speaker, is a day of celebration, a day we take another  giant step in our momentous agenda. Our Inflation Reduction Act is a  robust, cost-cutting package that meets the moment: ensuring that our  families thrive and that our planet survives.   This is landmark legislation which we send to the President's desk,  and it is a resounding victory for America's families starting at their  kitchen table. What it means to you--to our constituents, to people out  there whom we serve in terms of healthcare--if you are one of  Medicare's 64 million enrollees, this bill brings down the out-of- pocket costs in prescription drugs.   We do this by empowering the Secretary of HHS to negotiate lower  prices, at long last. We have been fighting for this for years. We do  so by capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. And you, our  constituents, will not pay one more cent for life-saving medication.  This includes a $35 cap on insulin copays.   We do this by banning drug manufacturers from raising prices faster  than inflation, protecting you against predatory price hikes. Make no  mistake: these measures are a big blow to Big Pharma, which has had a  stranglehold for decades, preventing us from making this move. Now we  have relaxed that stranglehold a bit--there is more to be done--but we  give more leverage and more breathing room to America's families.   At the same time, this bill locks in lower premiums that Democrats  secured first in the rescue package. Together, lowering the cost of  prescription drugs and healthcare premiums are vital strides in our  fight for economic justice. This is particularly important to low- income communities, underserved communities, and communities of color.   In doing so, we honor the call of Dr. King, who said: ``Of all the  forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the  most inhumane because it often results in physical death.''   The inflation bill is a plan divided into three parts: Prescription  drugs and healthcare; second, the most consequential climate action in  the history of our Congress of our country. Doing these two things will  reduce the deficit. At the same time, this legislation advances  President Biden's and Democrats' relentless commitment to putting  justice first.   All of these crucial investments are fully paid for by making sure  the ultra-rich and biggest corporations pay their fair share.   The climate provisions will make a meaningful difference for  America's working families. I am going to put that in the Record, if  you promise to read it, but it is about clean air and clean water for  our children. It is about 9 million good-paying union jobs. It is about  preventing conflict over resources and habitat. It is about values-- values espoused by Pope Francis when he said earlier this summer that  our planet has reached a ``breaking point'' in the fight against  climate crisis. Extreme weather continues to wreak havoc across the  country and around the world, and it is clear the costs of inaction far  outweigh the costs of action.   The bill saves the planet while keeping more money in your pockets.  For working families, you will save an average of $1,000 a year and  lower energy bills. For underserved communities, this bill invests $60  billion in environmental justice initiatives to ensure that everyone  enjoys the benefits of a cleaner, green economy.                                time  1700    Again, the bill pays down the deficit by $300 billion in the first  decade.   Here is what it means to you: it lowers the deficit and drives down  inflation in the long term.   These monumental investments for families and healthcare are fully  paid for ensuring the biggest corporations and wealthiest pay their  fair share. That is an estimate of about $160 billion a year of taxes  that are unlawfully not paid. Right now families are being harmed by  corporate profiteering.   But let me just say that I don't want you to take it from me. I want  you to take it from a large number of economists--126--including seven  Nobel Prize winners and three former chairs of the Council of Economic  Advisers in a letter urging passage of this bill.   I want you to hear this, my Republican friends, because clearly you  don't know this. But now that you do, perhaps you will change your  comments.   These investments will fight inflation and lower costs for American  families while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly- shared, long-term economic growth.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record their letter.                                                     August 2, 2022.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Minority Leader       McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, and House Minority Leader       McCarthy: We write to strongly urge you and your colleagues       in Congress to swiftly pass the Inflation Reduction Act of       2022. This historic legislation makes crucial investments in       energy, health care, and in shoring up the nation's tax       system. These investments will fight inflation and lower       costs for American families while setting the stage for       strong, stable, and broadly-shared long-term economic growth.        This legislation represents the single biggest step to date       in tackling the climate crisis. It makes key investments to       incentivize the transition to cleaner energy sources and       greater efficiency. It also invests in the current energy       distribution system to make it more resilient, lowers energy       costs for families, and helps protect U.S. family budgets       against future shocks.        This legislation will quickly and noticeably bring down       health care costs for families. It allows Medicare to       negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, reduces       Medicare out-of-pocket costs for drugs, and reduces insurance       costs for 13 million Americans by building on provisions in       the Affordable Care Act.  [[Page H7698]]         These investments would be more than fully paid for. The       revenue raised to finance them would come exclusively from       wealthy individuals and corporations. Further, the revenue       stems from enhanced tax enforcement and closing some of the       most distortionary loopholes in the tax code.        This proposal addresses some of the country's biggest       challenges at a significant scale. And because it is deficit-      reducing, it does so while putting downward pressure on       inflation. We strongly recommend Congress act decisively to       build a stronger economy by passing the Inflation Reduction       Act as soon as possible.

Another point I want to make is I hear them saying that  this is going to be such a thing about the audits. Despite the  Republicans' desperate falsehoods, this bill does not increase IRS  audits on America's working families. The IRS commissioner himself, a  Republican appointed by Donald Trump, said these resources are  absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or  middle-income Americans.   So there you have it.   So I would just say at the end of all of this, I ask these questions:   When you hear about what this means to America's working families,  how can you vote against lowering healthcare costs and prescription  drugs costs for seniors and underserved communities as we continue to  fight inflation?   How can you vote with pharma at the cost of America's seniors and  America's working families?   How can you vote against protecting future generations from rising  sea levels, raging wildfires, and crippling drought?   How can you vote against reducing the deficit and asking  billionaires, companies, and wealthy avoiders of taxes to pay their  fair share?   I am not talking about people who work the system. I am talking about  people who illegally do not pay their taxes.   So, Madam Speaker, every Member of this body is confronted with a  choice. We either put people over politics or politics over people. For  centuries, Members of Congress have stood exactly where we stand facing  the exact same decision as they constructed the pillars of America's  economy and safety: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the  Affordable Care Act, things that the Republicans opposed all along the  way.   This bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, a package for the people,  increases the leverage of the public interest over special interests  and expands the promise of health and financial security now and for  generations to come.   Madam Speaker, I urge every Member to put aside their  misunderstanding of this and vote for the Inflation Reduction Act as we  send this historic legislation to President Biden's desk for signature  this evening for him to sign into law.   Madam Speaker, under the visionary leadership of President Biden,  Democrats have forged historic progress for America's families.   First, we enacted our life-saving American Rescue Plan: to propel us  out of the pandemic by putting money in pockets, vaccines in arms,  children safely back to school and people safely back to work.   Next, we secured a transformative Infrastructure package: to create  good-paying union jobs rebuilding our nation--in a way that strengthens  our middle class, advances justice and protects the environment.   This week, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which  declares our economic independence, strengthens our national security  and enhances our families' financial future. We also honored the  valiant service of our heroic veterans with the PACT Act.   And today, we proudly take another giant step in our momentous  agenda.   Our Inflation Reduction Act is a robust cost-cutting package that  meets this moment: ensuring that our families thrive and that our  planet survives.  [[Page H7699]]                            HEALTH CARE: PRESCRIPTION DRUGS    This landmark legislation, which we send to the President's desk  today, is a resounding victory for America's families--starting at the  kitchen table.   Here's what the Inflation Reduction Act means to you in terms of  health care.   If you are one of Medicare's 64 million enrollees, this bill will  bring down your out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.   We do so by empowering the HHS Secretary to negotiate for lower drug  prices--a long-standing House Democratic priority.   We do so by capping your out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at  $2,000, so you will not pay one cent more for life-saving medication.  This includes a $35 per month cap on insulin co-pays.   And we do so by banning drug manufactures from raising prices faster  than inflation, protecting you against predatory price hikes.   Make no mistake: these provisions will strike a big blow to Big  Pharma, while giving families more breathing room in their budgets.                          HEALTH CARE: ACA SUBSIDIES    At the same time, the Inflation Reduction Act also locks in lower  premiums that Democrats secured in our Rescue package.   If you are one of 13 million working Americans who has affordable  coverage under the ACA: you'll be able to keep your insurance--and  you'll continue to save $800 per year on your premium.   Together, lowering the costs of prescription drugs and health  premiums are vital strides in the fight for economic justice.   Indeed, these benefits will flow heavily to those most in need:  vulnerable seniors, underserved communities and communities of color.   And in doing so, we honor the call of Dr. King, who said: ``Of all  the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and  inhuman because it often results in physical death.''                                 IRA OVERVIEW    The Inflation Reduction Act is a plan divided into three parts:   first--as I just discussed--lowering the cost of prescription drugs  and health care premiums   second, delivering the most consequential climate action in history   and third, dramatically reducing the deficit.   At the same time, this legislation advances President Biden and  Democrats' relentless commitment to putting justice first.   And all of these crucial investments are fully paid-for by making  sure the ultra-rich and biggest corporations pay their fair share.   To my House Democratic colleagues, make no mistake: this important  progress rests on the foundation that we built--with the Build Back  Better Act last fall and in the last Congress.   So let us salute the tenacious and tireless leadership of our Chairs,  Members and staff, who helped make this joyous day possible.                                CLIMATE ACTION    The climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will also make  a meaningful difference for America's working families.   Our bill cuts carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030--and powers our  nation toward a clean energy future.   It's about health: clean air and clean water for our children   It's about jobs: 9 million good-paying union jobs   It's about security: preventing conflict over resources and habitat   And it's about values: passing on a healthy planet to future  generations   As Pope Francis said earlier this summer, our planet has reached a  ``breaking point'' in the fight against the climate crisis. As extreme  weather continues to wreak havoc across our country and around the  world, it is clear the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of  action.   This bill saves the planet, while keeping more money in your pockets.   For working families: you'll save an average of $1000 per year on  your energy bills by the end of the decade.   For our farmers: this bill supports you in cultivating a diverse,  climate-friendly agriculture system--which will help address food  inflation.   For underserved communities: this bill invests $60 billion in  environmental justice initiatives to ensure everyone will share in the  benefits of our transition to a cleaner, greener economy.   In doing so, we ensure we not only mitigate a far more catastrophic  future--but build a safe, sustainable planet for our children and  grandchildren.                              DEFICIT REDUCTION    America's working families will also greatly benefit from the  Inflation Reduction Act's historic investment to get our fiscal house  in order.   This bill pays down the deficit by $300 billion over the first  decade.   And nonpartisan analysis shows that it will reduce the deficit by  nearly $2 trillion over two decades decade.   Here's what that means to you: slashing the deficit will drive down  inflation in the long-term.   This builds on the progress Democrats have already forged: with our  nation on track to slash the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this  year alone.   Meanwhile, Democrats' record of fiscal responsibility stands in sharp  contrast to the Trump Tax Scam, which ballooned the deficit by nearly  $2 trillion and left working families behind.                           PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE    These monumental investments for our families--in health care,  climate action and deficit reduction--are fully paid for by ensuring  the biggest corporations and the wealthiest few pay their fair share.   Right now, families are being harmed by corporate profiteering with  impunity: billion-dollar companies paying little-to-no taxes, while  jacking up prices and refusing to fairly pay their workers.   That's why we're closing loopholes by implementing: a 15 percent  corporate minimum tax only on billion-dolar companies; and a 1 percent  tax on stock buybacks, which enrich executives and shareholders.   We're also taking on ultra-rich tax cheats, ensuring they can't  continue to dodge what they owe to our nation: an estimated $160  billion each year.   Let me be clear: this bill does not raise taxes on anyone making less  than $400,000 a year, honoring the President's promise to America's  families.   And despite Republicans' desperate falsehoods, this bill does not  increase IRS audits on America's working families.   Treasury Secretary Yellen has directed the IRS Commissioner not to  increase the audit rate for households making under $400,000 a year.   And the IRS Commissioner himself--a Republican appointed by Trump-- said: ``These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit  scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans.''                              FIGHTING INFLATION    The provisions in this legislation are a powerful force to fight  inflation.   It is encouraging that prices at the pump have fallen for nearly  sixty days straight--and that the latest data shows 0 percent inflation  in July.   But Democrats know that higher prices still weigh heavy on America's  families. And now, we take another strong step to further drive down  kitchen table costs.                               OUTSIDE SUPPORT    But don't take my word for it.   Take the word of 126 economists--including seven Nobel Prize winners,  three former chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers and two farmer  Treasury Secretaries.   In a letter urging passage of this bill, they wrote: ``These  investments will fight inflation and lower costs for American  families--while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly- shared long-term economic growth.''                                PUBLIC SUPPORT    And proudly, the American people are with us:   Three-quarters support our action to lower prescription drug costs,   Two-thirds support our clean energy provisions,   60 percent support billion-dollar companies paying their fair share.                                GOP OPPOSITION    But sadly, our colleagues across the aisle clearly prefer to keep  costs for families sky-high.   Senate Republicans unanimously voted against this bill. And now,  House Republican Leaders are whipping against it.   Their opposition is unconscionable.   How could anyone vote against lowering health care costs on seniors  and underserved communities as we continue to fight inflation?   How could anyone vote against protecting future generations from  rising sea levels, raging wildfires and crippling droughts?   How could anyone vote against reducing the deficit or asking  billiondollar companies and wealthy tax cheats to pay their fair share?                         CLOSE: PEOPLE OVER POLITICS    Madam Speaker, today, every Member of this body will be confronted  with a basic choice. Will you put People Over Politics--or Politics  Over People?   For centuries, Members of Congress have stood exactly where we stand  now, facing this exact same decision, as they constructed the pillars  of the American economy and society. Social  [[Page H7700]]  Security. Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act.   Today, the Congress carries forward this all-American tradition.   The Inflation Reduction Act is a package For The People:   Increasing the leverage of the public interest over the special  interest,   And expanding the promise of health and financial security, now and  for generations to come.   So I urge every Member to put aside partisan difference--put People  Over Politics--and vote YES on the Inflation Reduction Act, as we send  this historic legislation to President Biden's desk for his signature.
