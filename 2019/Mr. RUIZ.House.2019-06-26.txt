 Mr. Speaker, I rise to announce the introduction of my  bill, the Protecting People from Surprise Medical Bills Act,  legislation to protect patients from unfair and expensive surprise  medical bills. By working together as a bipartisan team of 30 original  cosponsors--and growing--we are gaining momentum because we agree that  patients must come first.   For too many middle-class families, receiving an unexpected and very  expensive bill from an out-of-network provider is devastating and can  lead to severe anxiety, depression, and financial ruin.   Our bill creates the most fair and transparent system to end surprise  bills without picking winners or losers. This bill is the best solution  to protect middle-class families from receiving an unexpected and very  expensive bill from an out-of-network provider.   As an emergency room physician, I know patients come first and must  be protected. That is why this bill includes the strongest patient  protections of any surprise billing legislation proposed in this House  or Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Dr. Roe and the 30 Members who agree  that the Protecting People from Surprise Medical Bills Act is the most  effective legislation in Congress to end surprise billing once and for  all.                            ____________________
