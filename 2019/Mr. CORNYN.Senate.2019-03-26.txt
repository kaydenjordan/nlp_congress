 Madam President, last month our colleague, the Senator  from New York, the Democratic leader, said:         So when the Republican leader says he wants to bring the       Green New Deal resolution up for a vote, I say: Go for it.       Bring it on.    Well, here we are. Senators will soon have a chance to vote on the  Green New Deal, and we have already seen a lot of confusion and more  than a little waffling from our friends on the other side of the aisle,  some apparently confused on exactly what they should do on a resolution  they themselves proposed.   When it was announced, the senior Senator from Massachusetts quickly  pledged her support, as did the junior Senator from New Jersey. But I  find it pretty curious that some of our colleagues who were among the  first to join these Senators and voice their support for this proposal  are now among those saying they will simply vote present--present.   Even more interesting is one of the bill's authors, the junior  Senator from Massachusetts, who called this vote ``sabotage.''   Ordinarily, when proposing a piece of legislation around here, one is  tickled pink when the majority leader schedules it for a vote, but  somehow some of our colleagues will vote present--neither yea nor nay-- and others claim it is sabotage. As the vote approaches, we have seen  many of our Democratic friends running for the hills, trying to provide  space between them and this issue.   The Green New Deal is chock full of utopian ideas but completely  devoid of concrete plans to implement any of its overreaching policies.  Even the name is a little disorienting because the Green New Deal is  not just a new radical environmental policy; it is that, but it is  more. It encompasses much more than that with Medicare for All, free  college, and guaranteed jobs. I might add, parenthetically, you might  as well throw in free beer and pizza too.   What has been billed as an economy invigorator and job innovator in  order to lift up the middle class is really anything but. The bottom  line of this proposal is a solution in search of a problem. It is about  a message; it is not about finding solutions to real problems.   Maybe it is useful to take a step back to look at what we have  already done in this Congress to help the middle class and to generate  job growth. Over the last 2 years, we have worked to roll back  burdensome regulations left over from the previous administration and  make much needed reforms to our outdated Tax Code--the first time in 30  years.   My constituents in Texas have taken notice, and I have heard from  many of them who have seen an increase in their take-home pay, thanks  to the tax reform bill, for example. Small businesses in Texas have  been able to help give their employees more benefits. For example,  Village Foods and Pharmacy in Bryan, TX, said that because of the tax  reform bill, they were able to provide employee bonuses and implement a  401(k) retirement program, something they were previously unable to do.  In San Antonio, my hometown, Hinee Gourmet Coffee said they used their  tax cut savings to give their employees raises, as well as to increase  employee benefits and upgrade their equipment.   The unemployment rate in Texas remains at 3.8 percent, near its  historic 43-year low and on par with the national average. The Lone  Star State has added 268,000-plus jobs since February 2018. If you go  to Midland, TX, and the Permian Basin, the unemployment rate is 2.1  percent. Labor is tight, and employers are looking for workers because  the economy is booming, and they need good people to fill these  unfilled jobs.   I think my State is proof positive that when the government gets out  of the way, the economy can flourish. That is why we have seen so many  people flooding into Texas to take advantage of the low taxes and  abundant job opportunities. It is also why I find it so ironic that a  few weeks ago one of the Green New Deal creators, the Congresswoman  from New York, chose South by Southwest in Austin to peddle her  socialist agenda, because if implemented, the Green New Deal would wipe  out most of this prosperity. It would cut job growth; it would  dramatically increase taxes and cripple our red-hot economy.   One group has estimated that in order to achieve just one portion of  this radical agenda--a net-zero emissions transportation system--the  annual cost to families would be about $2,000. That is just for part of  the Green New Deal.   Add in another Green New Deal proposal, and it gets more expensive-- to  [[Page S1965]]  the tune of $26,000. No, I am not talking about somebody's annual  paycheck. I am talking about the estimated cost for families to  implement their universal healthcare program that would wipe out all  employer-provided coverage and bankrupt Medicare. Families in Texas and  across the country would be on the hook for more than $65,000 a year in  order to finance the Green New Deal's expensive and extravagant  promises.    Unfortunately, the list of expenses doesn't stop there. The Green New  Deal calls for a move to 100-percent clean and renewable energy in just  10 years. Right now, Texas generates about 19 percent of our energy  from renewables. We like renewables in Texas, but there needs to be a  baseload that provides energy when the sun doesn't shine and the wind  doesn't blow. The Green New Deal has no plan for how it expects States  to actually scale up their number from the 19 percent Texas currently  generates from renewables to this 100 percent--no plan at all.   Without a plan, Texans can forget about electricity that is  affordable and reliable; instead, they need to ready themselves for  electric bills that could jump to as high as $3,800 a year.   Instead of focusing on a grab bag of government mandates and  overreaching regulations that we know would bankrupt our country, we  need to follow existing models that point a way toward success. We know  what works, and, if you will forgive me, I would suggest the Texas  model is a good one. Our model values collaboration and partnership  with the private sector in order to create affordable and cutting-edge  solutions. We are all about innovation and experimentation. That is how  we come up with better, smarter, more efficient, and more effective  ideas to deal with problems. It is a model based on innovation that has  been the backbone of our successful economy. The last thing we need is  another Federal Government wet blanket that puts a damper on all of the  great innovation and activity that has caused our economy to boom.   Texas is really the best example of this with companies like NET  Power and NRG Energy, which are leading the way in innovation. NET  Power, which has a plant in La Porte, outside of Houston, has developed  a first-of-its-kind power system that generates affordable electricity  from natural gas with zero emissions--zero emissions.   Our State is also proof positive that one can promote innovation  while harnessing the traditional power of oil and gas development. In  other words, we can be pro-energy, pro-innovation, pro-growth, and pro- environment. But if we implemented the Green New Deal, we wouldn't be  talking only about the added costs and expenses to families; hundreds  of thousands of people would lose their jobs and our export economy,  which helps fuel our booming economy, would sharply decline. Our energy  independence would evaporate, but our need for and reliance on natural  gas, coal, and oil would remain. It would focus our efforts back on  being more dependent on foreign energy sources rather than generating  them domestically. I am sure Russia, for example, would be happy about  that.   Some have called the Green New Deal the road map for solving climate  change, but to be a road map, you have to have clear points on how to  get from point A to point B. You actually need to be clear-eyed about  the problem you are trying to solve, and you need details in terms of  how you actually hope to get to where you want to go. But this proposal  is a pie-in-the-sky, unattainable end destination with no details of  how to arrive there.   So as the Senate prepares to vote on the Green New Deal, I ask that  we keep in mind that our constituents didn't send us here to Washington  to vote present. That is a copout. Voting present? Give me a break.  People ought to vote their conviction. They ought to vote yes or no. To  hide behind some copout vote like present is just to take the easy way  out, and it is sad that appears to be the road many of our friends  across the aisle are about to take, rather than doing the job they have  been sent here to do and working with us to come up with actual,  tangible solutions that can become law. I know that if we just tried a  little bit harder and avoided these sorts of ideological talking  points, we could actually solve more of these problems and ours could  remain a strong economy. We could create jobs. We can maintain our  energy self-sufficiency here in America, and we can deal with  environmental emissions concerns. We can find solutions to those  problems, but one big power grab by the Federal Government that ruins  the economy, bankrupts us, and, frankly, doesn't really make things  better is a bad deal for Texans, and I believe a bad deal for  Americans.   Unsurprisingly, I intend to vote no, and I hope my colleagues will  join me in doing the same.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
