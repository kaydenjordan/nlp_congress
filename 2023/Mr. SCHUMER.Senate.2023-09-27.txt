 Mr. President, well, yesterday afternoon, Democrats and  Republicans reached an agreement on a CR that will keep the government  open until November 17, and, with a strong bipartisan vote of 77 to 19,  the Senate agreed to move forward last night on this legislation. It  shows that, in the Senate, both parties can work through our  differences for the betterment of the country.   But in the House, Republicans have tried everything but  bipartisanship. Last night, the Speaker twisted himself into pretzels  yet again, trying to avoid his responsibility of governing. But this is  the truth: Every bill House Republicans have pushed has been partisan,  every CR has been aimed at the hard right, and every path they have  pursued to date will inevitably lead to a shutdown.   Speaker McCarthy, the only way--the only way--out of a shutdown is  bipartisanship, and by constantly adhering to what the hard right  wants, you are aiming for a shutdown. They want it. You know it. You  can stop it. Work in a bipartisan way like we are in the Senate, and we  can avoid harm to tens of millions of Americans.   Bipartisanship is precisely what we have been pursuing here in the  Senate. We haven't agreed on everything, and there is still a lot more  work to be done. But we haven't let our differences paralyze us, and  the result has been a commonsense, bipartisan, sensible approach for a  CR.   It will keep the government funded at current levels until November  17. It will extend the Federal Aviation Administration until December  31. It will replenish the Disaster Response Emergency Fund to help  communities battered by natural disasters. It will continue paying  Federal firefighters. It will extend funding for community health  centers, the National Health Service Corps, and other healthcare  programs. And it will send more help to our friends in Ukraine.   Thank you to my colleagues who negotiated this bill in good faith.  Thank you to Chair Murray and Vice Chair Collins and all the staff on  the Approps committees, who worked all day and night through the  weekend. And thanks to Leader McConnell and the many, many Republicans  who worked with us and joined us in passing this, for moving forward on  this bipartisan CR.   Now, there is still much more work to do. Now that we are on the  bill, it will require consent and cooperation to move it swiftly  through the Chamber. We cannot have Members trying last-minute delay  tactics and risk a shutdown. The CR agreement the Senate has released  is a good, sensible, and bipartisan--let me emphasize ``bipartisan''-- bill. It is a bridge toward greater cooperation between the Chambers  and away from the paralyzing extremism we have seen in the House.   And a reckless shutdown will serve no purpose except for hard-right  partisans, whose only goal is to grind the gears of government down and  promote extremism. It will cause grave harm for communities across the  country. A reckless shutdown will cause grave harm to our border. It  will affect our military by withholding their pay. It will disrupt  everything from food safety inspection to TSA operations, to small  business loans.   This is the problem with MAGA extremism. It is not serious about  governing. Chaos is the only word in their playbook. Conflict seems to  be their natural state of being. And some of them seem to exult in  shutting down the government.   And if MAGA Republicans get their way, the danger for this country  will be great. Extremism will be dominant. The ultrarich will be  empowered. Working families will suffer. Women's healthcare will be  even more curtailed.   We don't want to go down that troubling road. The Speaker should  resist the 30 or so Republicans who want to drag us in that direction,  and he can do it by giving bipartisanship a chance, just as we are  doing here in the Senate.                              SAFER Banking Act    Mr. President, now on SAFER Banking, this morning, as we speak, the  Banking Committee is holding a markup on our bipartisan SAFER Banking  Act. Today's markup of SAFER Banking represents a huge step forward in  the Senate's effort to help cannabis businesses operate more  efficiently, more safely, and more transparently.   I worked long and hard to get to this point with Chairman Brown and  Ranking Member Scott; and special thanks  [[Page S4691]]  to Senators Merkley, Daines, Lummis, Sinema, and Reed, because I thank  them for their cooperation as well. It has been a goal of mine since we  started this session of the Senate to move forward on this legislation.   And the good news: The SAFER Banking bill is about to be reported out  of committee with strong bipartisan support this morning. Once it is  reported out of committee, I will bring SAFER Banking to the floor for  a vote as quickly as possible.    For too long, cannabis businesses have been forced to rely primarily  on cash transactions--no credit or debit cards. Dealing only in cash  stifles these businesses' growth, opens them up to so many risks, and  makes them easy targets for theft, robbery, and other crimes. No  industry has the ability to thrive if they can't access banking  infrastructure, especially not an industry that is growing as quickly  and is as new as the cannabis industry.   Congress has always been in the business of promoting entrepreneurs,  promoting small business, and promoting job growth. We should continue  doing so with the cannabis industry. Our SAFER Banking Act will connect  cannabis businesses, especially ones in minority and underserved  communities, to traditional financial resources like bank accounts and  small business loans, creating a safer and more transparent environment  for the industry to grow.   I am also committed to including criminal justice provisions like  HOPE and GRAM in SAFER Banking. I have long advocated for expungement  of records for cannabis offenses, and with SAFER Banking moving through  the committee in a strong bipartisan way, now is the time to get it  done.   So, again, I thank my colleagues on both sides for their work on this  legislation, which has been an effort years--years--in the making. And  once it is reported out of committee, I will put SAFER Banking on the  floor for a vote very soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 370, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to  and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a moment, my friend from West Virginia  will submit a resolution regarding the Senate dress code. Although we  have never had an official dress code, the events over the past week  have made us all feel as though formalizing one is the right path  forward.   I deeply appreciate Senator Fetterman's working with me to come to an  agreement that we all find acceptable, and, of course, I appreciate  Senator Manchin's and Senator Romney's leadership on this issue.   I will move for the Senate to adopt this resolution in a few minutes.   I now yield to my colleague from West Virginia.    Mr. President, as I mentioned a minute ago, although we  have never had an official dress code, the events over the past week  have made us all feel that formalizing it is the right way forward.   I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. Res. 376, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions: S. Res. 373, S. Res. 374, S. Res. 375, and S. Res. 377.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Madam President, I have nine requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
