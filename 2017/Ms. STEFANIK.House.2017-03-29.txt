 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our resilient  military families. These families endure countless relocations and  deployments every couple of years, transitioning to new schools, new  jobs, and fitting into new communities.   Military spouses wear their own patches of service and share a true  sense of duty to our country. They sacrifice a great deal of themselves  amid strain and the unknown, while providing unyielding support to  their spouse in uniform.   Military spouses are often employed in professions which require new  licensing that vary from State to State, with fees and wait times. To  alleviate this burden and provide predictability in the lives of  military spouses and their families, I have reintroduced the Lift the  Relocation Burden from Military Spouses Act.   Military spouses serve, too, and my bill will help alleviate  unnecessary stress and expenses, help make job changes easier, and will  give these spouses and their families some deserved predictability as  they serve their Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.                            ____________________
