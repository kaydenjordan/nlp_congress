 Madam Speaker, as a public servant,  Fred Keller has built a reputation for being hardworking, sincere, and  dedicated. He has worked passionately for everything he has achieved.   Things weren't always easy for Fred. In fact, he grew up in a house  where he had no running water or electricity. And he went straight from  high school to work in a factory and became the manager of that great  forest products manufacturer. He then served honorably for 8 years in  the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives.  [[Page H4206]]    Fred Keller's life is reflective of the American Dream, and it is my  privilege to welcome him to the House of Representatives today.
