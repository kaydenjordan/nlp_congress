 Mr. Speaker, this week I received a letter and these  photos, in fact, more photos than just this, from a constituent. The  photos were taken on his ranch at 5 a.m. earlier this week from a game  camera about 15 miles north of the border.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Russell Johnson  dated June 13, 2021, and I would like to read a few excerpts from the  letter.   ``When President Biden signed the proclamation ending border wall  construction, we saw a dramatic increase in illegal foot traffic  through our ranch.''         I can no longer allow my children to play outside unless an       adult is with them to monitor the areas around them. People       who have dropped out of groups crossing have stopped at my       house wanting to use the phone, WiFi, and call their       smuggler. This is very concerning, as often my wife is at       home alone with our children, and I am hours away working on       the ranch. These people are desperate. And it is only a       matter of time before someone gets hurt.    Now, Mr. Speaker, the border in New Mexico is not like the other  borders in cities around El Paso or the ports of entry, here there is a  huge difference.                                                      June 13, 2021.        Representative Herrell, My name is Russell Johnson. I am a       fourth-generation cattle rancher in southern Luna County. I       ranch along side my wife, two children, my father, and my       mother. Our ranch borders the international boundary with       Mexico for a little over 8 miles. My family has ranched on       this same piece of land since 1918. What we are experiencing       on the border today is not only a risk to my family, but our       state and this nation.        When President Biden signed the proclamation ending border       wall construction, we saw a dramatic increase in illegal foot       traffic through our ranch. There now exists a gap in the wall       that separates the United States from Mexico on our ranch. It       is approximately 3/4-mile wide along with a border monument       access gate that was not installed leaving a gap about 12       feet wide. Not only did President Biden's proclamation end       the construction of the physical barrier, but it also stopped       all other infrastructure and technology that was to go with       it. Improved access roads for Border Patrol, lighting, sensor       technology and camera systems were all part of the project       that was abruptly ended. The situation at the border has       progressively worsened because of this decision. Talking with       local Border Patrol Agents, group size in our area has gone       from four to six people in a group, to now being upwards of       twenty. This is all crossing and passing through not only my       property, but our homes and business.        I can no longer allow my children to play outside unless an       adult is with them to monitor the areas around them. People       who have dropped out of groups crossing have stopped at my       house wanting to use the phone or have access to my Wi-Fi to       call their smuggler. This is very concerning as often my wife       is at home alone with our children and I am hours away       working on the ranch. These people are desperate. It's only a       matter of time before our home is broken into.        The increase in traffic is also affecting our business.       Much of southern New Mexico is suffering a D4 drought. We are       having to supplement our cattle to get to the monsoon season.       This hardship is being compounded by the people crossing the       border illegally. Currently, we have decent natural grasses       in the pasture bordering Mexico. Our cattle are not utilizing       this rangeland properly because they are constantly getting       spooked by the people crossing. This is pushing them into       drier areas with not enough suitable feed for them to       consume. The cattle are also susceptible to contracting       stress induced illnesses like Pasteurella Pneumonia from       constantly being run off. We have experienced this before       under similar border conditions. If not treated quickly,       cattle can die within 48 hours. We are experiencing this not       only on parts of the ranch that border Mexico, but further       north as well.        Our day-to-day operations have been negatively impacted. We       now try to work in pairs at a minimum. With no cellphone       service in our area, it is safer to work with someone with       you, so you have somebody to watch your back. This slows our       work progress down and increases the length of time it takes       to get tasks down.        On June 4, 2021, my father and I encountered four groups of       illegal immigrants on our ranch totaling well over 30       individuals. Border Patrol was able to apprehend all four       groups, but they told me something that I found very       troubling. They said that there were only eight agents in the       field that evening. Deming Border Patrol Station is       responsible for the area we live in. The station's area of       responsibility includes well over 60 miles of border. Eight       agents were expected to cover all of that during their shift.       This does not make for a very secure border. Encountering       groups crossing and a lack of manpower in the field is       becoming the norm. The Patrol Agent in Charge at the Deming       Border Patrol Station told us that they are averaging 650       apprehensions a week. These are apprehensions, they do not       include the people that are successfully making their illegal       entry.        It is important to note that we do not have unaccompanied       minors or family groups crossing through our area. They are       all young, adult males in good physical shape. All the people       I have encountered are wearing full camouflage, to include       face coverings and carpet or sponge booties on their feet.       These people are not turning themselves in, they do not want       to be caught.        Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have       experienced issues regarding the border. What differs this       time from others is that our government is not trying to do       anything to resolve the issue. I feel like as a citizen of       this country, I do not matter in the eyes of our government.       The State of Texas has declared a state of emergency in many       if not all its counties that border Mexico. Texas is doing       this because the Federal Government is not addressing the       issue. Enough pressure will be put on the Texas border that       New Mexico will see an even larger increase in illegal       traffic as it will be pushed west. This bothers me greatly.        I am writing you today to make you aware of the situation       on the border in our area and to ask for help. Border Patrol       manpower is strained, and our local law enforcement is       stretched thin. Ideally, the border wall and all       infrastructure and technology need completed. In the       meantime, we desperately need more boots on the ground to       help with this surge in illegal traffic. We also need better       cellphone coverage in these remote areas. Not being able to       call for law enforcement or emergency service is a huge       safety concern. Last, but certainly not least, we need help       getting this administration to address the border crisis.       Thank you for your attention to these matters.            Respectfully,      Russell Johnson.                            ____________________
