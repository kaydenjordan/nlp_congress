 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Hispanic Heritage  Month by honoring one of our rich  [[Page H8893]]  treasures of the Midwest, El Museo Latino, on the occasion of its 25th  year of operation in Omaha, Nebraska.   El Museo Latino opened its doors in the historic Livestock Exchange  Building on May 5, 1993, as the first Latino art and history museum and  cultural center in the Midwest. Today, it is one of only 17 Latino  museums in the United States.   Since opening, El Museo Latino has been a nonprofit organization with  a mission to collect, exhibit, and interpret Latino arts of the  Americas. It is committed to strengthening the artistic and creative  culture of the greater Omaha area. It accomplishes this by providing  direct support to local artists, increasing the visibility of Latino  art forms, and fostering an appreciation of art for the benefit of a  diverse audience.   El Museo Latino creates and presents exhibitions year-round that  feature local, national, and international Latino arts. The exhibits  range from pre-Columbian to contemporary arts through both temporary  and permanent displays.   Central to El Museo Latino's programming are the educational programs  that are created for each of the exhibitions, including bilingual  guided visits, lectures, presentations, films, workshops,  demonstrations, and classes. The educational programs are designed for  children, teens, and adults and focus on the visual and performing  arts. The art classes offered throughout the year include traditional  art forms and those featured in the museum's active exhibits.   El Museo Latino also highlights special traditional celebrations and  community events throughout the year, including Cinco de Mayo, Family  Days, Dia del Nino, Hispanic Heritage Month, and many other holiday  celebrations. Other special community events include the presentation  of films throughout the year as well as summer outdoor free screenings  of Latino films.   As the founder and executive director of El Museo Latino, Magdalena  Garcia is passionate about the arts. Prior to creating El Museo Latino,  she volunteered at a number of museums, including the Joslyn Art  Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and the Erie Canal  Museum in Syracuse, New York.    After completing her master's of arts degree at Syracuse University,  Magdalena returned to Omaha and shared her dream to create a museum for  Latino culture in Omaha with the support of community leaders,  including activist-educator Jim Ramirez.   Through years of hard work, perseverance, and passion, her dream  became a reality. The museum officially opened on May 5, 1993, with the  help of many community leaders and volunteers.   Ms. Garcia has received numerous honors and recognitions for her hard  work and achievements. Most notably, in 2015, the Mexican Government  honored her lifetime of achievement in the arts with the Ohtli Award.   Over the past 25 years, El Museo Latino has presented more than 150  exhibitions. Without this special treasure, much of the local Hispanic  culture and history would be lost.   Thanks to the proven leadership of Ms. Garcia and her board and the  many contributions to the community over the past 25 years, we look  forward to many more years of Hispanic heritage and Latino culture on  display at El Museo Latino.                           Breast Cancer Awareness     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my mom and my sister  during this Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which will be in October.  While my mother survived this terrible disease, my sister lost her  battle at the young age of 39.   I also want to recognize the millions of people every year who are  affected by cancer.   Breast cancer, along with ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, endometrial,  colon, gastric, and melanoma cancers are all hereditary cancers that  can be passed down from parents to children through their genes.  Thankfully, there is testing that can make a significant and positive  impact in identifying hereditary cancers before they emerge.   Last month, I took a genetic test to determine if I have the genetic  mutations that could develop into any of these hereditary cancers.  While genetic mutations are thought to play a role in 5 to 10 percent  of all cancers, the chance of inheriting the cancer-causing mutation is  50 percent if one of the parents has it.   Because my mom and sister had breast cancer, I decided to be tested  to see if I have that mutation; because it is not only women who are  victims of breast cancer, but men as well. While only 1 in 1,000 men  will get breast cancer, it is still not something to ignore.   The genetic markers I was tested for are called BRCA 1 and 2, and the  chances of developing cancer if you have one of these genetic mutations  skyrocket by as much as 87 percent.   The test was simple. The staff drew my blood and collected  information about cancer, my family history, including my grandparents,  aunts, uncles, cousins on both sides of the family, my mom and dad.  That family history also included the types of cancer, treatment given,  and the age of diagnosis, or as close as known.   There are many organizations out there that offer information about  genetic testing and cancer, including the American Cancer Society, and  in my home district the Kamie K. Preston Hereditary Cancer Foundation.  In fact, the founder of this organization, Brandi Preston, joined me  during this test to offer support and guidance. The foundation not only  provides emotional support but financial support for those whose  testing may not be covered.   In going public with my test, I hope to encourage others who have a  history of cancers in their family to go get tested. Knowledge and  early detection are two of the many tools in the fight against cancer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the passing of  Major General Sun-Ha Lim, who passed away on July 22.   Throughout his life, he defended the Republic of Korea and the free  world from communism. As a second lieutenant, he helped form the U.S.  Korean Constabulary, a Korean government loyal to the United States.   He then continued his service in the Republic of Korea's Army. His  exceptional battlefield leadership led him to be promoted to the rank  of major general during the Korean conflict. He commanded the Republic  of Korea's 3rd Infantry Division, playing an instrumental role in  pushing the North Korean forces back and restoring the 38th parallel.   After coming to the U.S. with his family later in life, General Lim  advocated for the recognition of the U.S. Korean Constabulary.   General Lim was recognized on numerous occasions for his inspiring  leadership. President Eisenhower honored him with the Legion of Merit  in the Commander degree, the highest U.S. military honor given to  foreign combatants. He was awarded with the Republic of Korea's Order  of Military Merit in the 1st Grade, which is their highest decoration  for military valor.   General Lim was a beloved member of the South Korean community here  in Omaha, renowned by U.S. Korean war veterans in the metro area, and  he was my friend.                            ____________________
