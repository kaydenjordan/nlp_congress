 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge my  chief of staff, Julie Little Nickson, who, after 22 years of service in  the House and 20 years in my office, will soon be departing the Hill.   Let me take a moment to acknowledge Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, who  Julie worked for prior to coming to my office and for her gracious help  with Julie's transition to my office.   Julie joined my staff in 2002 and quickly distinguished herself as a  skilled manager and leader of Team Lee. She undoubtedly got to know  many district constituents and hit the ground running.   Her keen understanding of the intersection of policy, politics, and  procedure has helped drive so many accomplishments through the decades.  She has also ensured that my constituents understand the relationship  between our work in Washington, D.C., and their daily lives.   From her work advancing my efforts as coauthor of the President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, back in 2003 to the development  and enactment of the historic American Women Quarters act in 2020,  Julie has been the strategic guiding force propelling my agenda. She  makes sure that the inclusion of staff is prominent in everything I do  and that staff is recognized and is central to her work.   She has been the key and steady leader of my work to prevent the wars  in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of course, that work grew and expanded to  include numerous efforts to end our forever wars and rein in unchecked  executive war powers, including my work to repeal the 2001 and 2002  AUMFs.  [[Page H5828]]    As my chief of staff during my time as both the chair of the CPC and  later when I chaired the Congressional Black Caucus in 2009 and 2010,  Julie helped build coalitions and advanced our policy and  communications agenda forward. This was really not an easy task, but as  always, she rose to the occasion.   Her two decades of appropriations experience has helped me deliver  significant resources to my congressional district over the years,  including from major infrastructure and transit projects, critical  research and healthcare funding, and so many projects that have helped  improve the lives of my constituents.   Her knowledge of both domestic and international Federal spending  programs and policies has helped me champion and support the growth of  vital human needs programs along with domestic and international health  and development.   As a manager, Julie has always led by example with her deep  commitment and mission-driven approach to the work. She has helped and  led, shaped, and developed numerous staff, interns, and many fellows  over the years, and they have soared in their professions and what they  do after they leave my office.   In a very determined yet congenial way, she has made sure my district  staff and D.C. staff work together as one seamless staff, reflecting  the values and commitment to public service and constituent casework as  Team Lee.   I have had the privilege to know Julie through many phases of her  life. When she came to my office, she was single with no children. She  got married to a wonderful man, Mike Nickson. Later, when she became  pregnant, we were really all happy for her and Mike but wondered when  she would stop working. She worked until the last minute, and we all  were delighted that she had a beautiful daughter, Cate, who will turn  16 next month.   Cate has become a progressive, free-spirited young lady. Of course,  Cate spent many years in my office through the years and developed a  keen sense of social justice through watching and listening to her  mother as she executed our agenda for the people.   As the daughter of Sandra and Harell Little, who instilled such a  strong commitment to public service, Julie has been a caring and loving  daughter and has always demonstrated an amazing work-life balance. I  thank her parents for raising such a brilliant and passionate daughter.   As Julie enters her next phase of life, she will now work directly to  save lives as a representative of the American Cancer Society Cancer  Action Network. She has always been about life-affirming efforts, and  no doubt she will continue with her life's mission as she has answered  God's call for this next chapter of her life.   We wish her good luck. We wish her God's blessings.   And just a reminder, Julie, that once a member of Team Lee, always a  member of Team Lee.                            ____________________
