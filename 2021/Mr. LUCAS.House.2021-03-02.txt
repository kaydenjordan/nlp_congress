 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1.   As the ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, I am particularly concerned that H.R. 1 would adversely  impact the work done by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology on election security.   NIST is responsible for conducting research on voting technologies,  developing standards and best practices that help ensure the security  of voting systems, and providing technical guidance to the Election  Assistance Commission. In short, NIST's work is critical to helping  States and localities conduct safe, secure, and accessible elections.   So why doesn't this bill include any of the technical feedback  provided by NIST last year?   I am deeply concerned that we are limiting NIST's ability to do their  job. This is just one example of how this rushed attempt to score  political points has given precedence over putting forth meaningful  legislation. This legislation would do more harm than good. I urge my  colleagues to reject the bill.
