 Mr. Speaker, the ancient Greeks would have  appreciated the irony of this story. Kevin McCarthy spent his life  preparing for the job that he held for just 269 days. For decades, he  devoted all his energies and skills to building one of the most  formidable political organizations of our time that ultimately took  back the House last year.   In those 269 days as Speaker, despite the most slender of majorities,  and with Democrats controlling the Senate and White House, he cut $2  trillion of spending over the next decade. He forestalled the hiring of  an army of IRS agents. He curtailed the woke policies plaguing our  Armed Forces. He averted a government shutdown in a dangerous world.   He reopened the Capitol to the American people. He launched  historical investigations into government corruption. He produced the  strongest border security measure in a century and landmark legislation  to restore American energy independence.   On his 269th day as Speaker, he enjoyed the overwhelming support and  confidence of his Republican colleagues. He was completing the process  of adopting the most conservative appropriations bills in decades. He  had put House Republicans in a commanding position to sweep the 2024  election. National polls recorded that he had become the most popular  elected official in America.   His speakership ended on that day. It did not end because of the  Republican Conference. It ended because of eight sad and pathetic  mediocrities nursing petty personal grudges. As Shakespeare said:  ``This house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.''   This is not the end of the tale. History commands, and we must obey.  Soon, Kevin McCarthy will be called back to the national stage to play  a vital and leading role in a command performance by history to save  our beloved country.
