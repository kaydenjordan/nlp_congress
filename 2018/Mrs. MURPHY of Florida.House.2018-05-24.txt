 Mr. Speaker, the American people have little  faith in Congress. They don't trust Members to work together in a  bipartisan way, to put public interest above self-interest, and to do  their most basic job, which is to set a budget and be fiscally  responsible.   Our Nation is strongest when our democratic institutions generate  confidence, not cynicism, and when our leaders inspire pride, not  pessimism. That is why Congressman Fitzpatrick and I introduced the  FAITH in Congress Act.   It requires House leaders to prioritize bipartisan bills over  partisan ones, because we must put country over party.   It abolishes automatic pay increases for Members of Congress, and it  prohibits first-class travel at taxpayer expense, because it is time we  end these perks.   It enacts a simple principle called no budget, no pay, which says  that if Congress doesn't pass a budget and appropriations bills on  time, Members don't get paid, because the best way to stop incompetence  is to stop rewarding it.  [[Page H4698]]    Finally, it imposes a lifetime ban on former Members becoming  lobbyists, because there should be no doubt that Members come to  Congress to serve the public, not to line their own pockets.   It is up to Congress to take the tough but necessary steps to earn  the public's trust. The American people's faith in Congress has been  damaged, and it is our job to repair it.                            ____________________
