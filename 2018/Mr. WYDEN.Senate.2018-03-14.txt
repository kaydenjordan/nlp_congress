 Madam President, first of all, I wish to commend my  Pacific Northwest colleague Senator Murray for taking this time to talk  about these exceptionally important issues. I had a chance to listen to  the thoughtful remarks of our friend from New Hampshire--3,000 miles  away from the Pacific Northwest--and she has been, as usual,  extraordinarily eloquent and passionate about the cause of women's  health, and it is great to be able to follow her.   We can sum up the healthcare policy of the Trump administration in  just one word: discrimination. I am here with my colleagues today to  discuss a particularly alarming example of the Trump agenda of  healthcare discrimination and an example of where the administration is  working overtime to make women's healthcare worse.   What is particularly frustrating about this is we are dealing with a  bureaucracy run amok. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part  of the Department of Health and Human Services, has made a critical  judgment. They will put ideology over the law of the land when it comes  to the medical care available to the young women in its custody.   Under Director Scott Lloyd, the office has attempted to block several  immigrants from exercising their freedom of choice with respect to  reproductive health. It has no legal right to do so. This issue is  settled law, but this hasn't stopped the Director and its agency from  dragging young women into prolonged, taxpayer-funded court battles.   There are roughly 5,000 young people in the Office of Refugee  Resettlement's custody. Most of them are from Central American  countries. Many of these young women are survivors of sexual violence.  They are on their own, and they didn't come here to have somebody  else's ideology dictating their medical care. In my view, this office  ought to uphold its duty to provide all the care these young women have  a right to receive, and it ought to check the ideology at the door.   That is not how the Office of Refugee Resettlement is working under  Mr. Lloyd. According to a recent report from VICE News, ``Mr. Lloyd  receives a spreadsheet every week containing information on every  pregnant teen in their custody.''   He reportedly sought to interfere in a young woman's medical  procedure that was actually already underway. In another case, the  report says he put a young woman at further risk by directing staff to  inform her parents--against her wishes--that she had an abortion.   Last fall, an HHS official was asked about Mr. Lloyd's direction of  the office and the matter of interfering in the medical care of young  women. Here is what that spokesman said: ``He by law has custody of  these children, just like a foster parent, he knows that that's a lot  of responsibility and he is going to make choices that he thinks are  best for both the mother and the child.''   I say to my colleagues, that is just rampant government paternalism  summed up in just one sentence.   Now, it ought to be no surprise, given his background, that this is  the direction the office is taking. This is a gentleman who has made a  career out of opposing the right of women to make their own judgments  about their own healthcare choices. He has fought access to  contraception and to a variety of healthcare services that are  important to women. His views are right in line--right in line--with  this administration's agenda of healthcare discrimination against  women.   Right out of the gate, the administration and Republicans in Congress  pushed for legislation that would have deprived hundreds of thousands  of women the right to see the doctor of their choosing. They made it  harder for many of those women to obtain routine, vital medical care  from providers like Planned Parenthood, including cancer screenings,  prenatal care, preventive services, physicals, and a whole host of  preventive services that have absolutely nothing to do with abortion-- nothing to do with abortion.   Then the Trump administration sought to deny women guaranteed, no- cost access to contraception. When women have guaranteed access to  contraception, it means healthier pregnancies, healthier newborns, a  lower risk of cancer, and, particularly, economic fairness for women of  modest means, but the Trump administration wants to unravel that  guarantee as well.   Then, the Trump team is green-lighting junk insurance policies that  drive up the cost of healthcare for women with preexisting conditions,  and they are involved in very elaborate--as my colleague knows-- discussions with the State of Idaho. People ought to understand exactly  what the Trump administration is saying to Idaho because they are going  to say it to other people. The Trump administration is saying to Idaho:  You can discriminate, just don't be too obvious about it. That is their  position with respect to these junk insurance policies.   The administration is exploring ways to place lifetime limits on the  care people can get from Medicaid, and that is a frightful proposition  for the millions of older women who count on Medicaid to pick up the  tab for their nursing and home-based care.   These are serious healthcare problems around this country. By the  way, we never heard anything in the campaign of 2016 about how we were  going to turn back the clock on older women for whom Medicaid is often  a lifeline for long-term care, but that is what we are dealing with  now. These are serious healthcare challenges women face right now--on  top of it, a raging epidemic of opioid misuse and abuse and the  skyrocketing cost of prescription medicine. When we are talking about  the Office of Refugee Resettlement, as my colleagues talked about so  eloquently, there is also a lot to be done to fix our broken  immigration system.   Finally, it is important, as we get into these issues, to recognize  how deep-seated this policy of healthcare discrimination is. The  example my colleagues are talking about here today is an example of  massive ideological overreach and paternalism. It is happening at the  Office of Refugee Resettlement, but it is not the only example. This is  behavior that ought to stop.    I thank my colleague, Senator Murray, who has been our go-to person  for years and years on women's healthcare. I want her and our  colleagues to know that I will be doing everything I can to be a part  of their efforts to push back on these policies that turn back the  clock and particularly discriminate against the rights of women.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this new law has the power to better the  lives of hundreds of thousands of children and their families. It will  for the first time allow States to invest Federal foster care dollars  in evidence-based services, like substance use treatment and mental  health and parenting programs, to prevent the need for foster care by  keeping families safely together. It will provide critical new  opportunities for families adopting children and relatives caring for  kin by making these same services available when a child is at risk of  reentering foster care. It will also support investments in Kinship  Navigator programs to help grandparents and other relative caregivers  who often take on the parenting role at a moment's notice.   The opioid crisis is showing why these investments are absolutely  critical. After years of decline in the number of children in foster  care, we have begun to see a steady increase, which many attribute to  the opioid crisis. According to Federal data, at least 34 percent of  foster care entries are attributed to parental substance use. Family  First will be a game changer when it comes to fighting addiction, as  States will now have many more tools to address these issues without  breaking families apart. These tools will not only help with the  current opioid epidemic, but they will position our Nation's child  welfare system to respond to this crisis and any others that families  may face in the future.    Mr. President, I would also like to acknowledge the  dedication of key congressional staffers, including those at the  Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and  with House and Senate legislative counsel's office. These staffers pour  immense time, effort, and expertise into turning concepts into  legislation and are the epitome of dedicated public servants. In  particular, we would like to acknowledge and thank Emilie Stoltzfus,  Ruth Ernst, Jim Grossman, Susanne Mehlman, Sheila Dacey, and Jennifer  Gray. We would like to thank key congressional and administration  staffers, including Ryan Martin, Laura Berntsen, Anne DeCesaro, Morna  Miller, Becky Shipp, Scott Raab, Veronica Duron, Ted McCann, Stephanie  Parks, Wendell Primus, Samantha Offerdahl, Rafael Lopez, Jeff Hild,  Jenny Delwood, Rose Hacking, and Sonja Nesbit.   We recognize there is not the space to acknowledge all of the  countless individuals who made this law a reality, but we honor the  contributions of those individuals and their organizations across the  country as well. Opportunities for reform like this do not materialize  out of nowhere; they are the result of hard work and perseverance by  many committed to a cause. These individuals' vision for a better world  for vulnerable children and families guided our work and we will be  forever grateful for their commitment and dedication.                            ____________________
