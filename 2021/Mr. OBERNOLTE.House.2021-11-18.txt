 Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I led over 200 Members of  this House in sending a letter to the Speaker, urging that we do not  vote on this bill until the CBO had issued a cost score for this bill.  Yet, here we are, debating what is likely the largest spending package  in the history of this country, paired with the largest tax increase in  the history of this country. I say ``likely'' because we really don't  know what the bill will cost. Apparently, we are supposed to pass the  bill before we are allowed to know what it costs.   Madam Speaker, that is crazy. Here is why that matters. Our national  debt right now stands at about $29 trillion. Although we don't have a  CBO score on this bill, what we do have is an analysis by the Wharton  School at the University of Pennsylvania which says that this bill  would add $300 billion to that debt, at least, and that is if all the  programs in this bill sunset on time, which we know is not going to  happen. Further, the analysis says if they don't sunset, this bill  could add $2.5 trillion to our national debt.   Madam Speaker, here is the real tragedy: We run about a $2 trillion  deficit this year, and even in a good year it will be over a trillion  dollars. The tax increases alone in this bill would almost get us to  balancing the Federal budget, which would allow us to avoid leaving a  legacy of debt to our children and our grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, this bill is bad for our country, and it is bad for  our economy. I urge a ``no'' vote.                                time  1115
