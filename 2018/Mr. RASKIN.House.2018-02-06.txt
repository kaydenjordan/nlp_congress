 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman, Mr. Harper;  and the ranking member, Mr. Brady, for their excellent leadership on  this legislation.   I rise as a proud cosponsor and strong supporter of H.R. 4924, the  Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act; and H. Res. 724,  the companion resolution which strengthens antiharassment and  antidiscrimination policies and procedures in this institution.   These two bills show how Congress can make dramatic progress on a  bipartisan basis when we listen to the people; specifically, the Me Too  movement against workplace discrimination and harassment that has swept  America into the 21st century by demanding equality and dignity in the  workplace for all women as well as all men.   This continuing Women's March Across America for workplace fairness  has forced the Members of this body to acknowledge that, here in  Congress, sexual harassment has been a serious occupational hazard for  thousands of women who only want to come to work to support their  families and to contribute to the common good of the country.   We have heard about shameful cases of quid pro quo harassment,  hostile workplace environment, groping, forcible kissing, sexual  coercion, and reprisal and retaliation for saying no or complaining.   As the representatives of the American people, we have a compelling  obligation to lead America to a culture of zero tolerance for sexual  harassment and assault in the workplace; and we, in Congress, must  lead, not only by strong legislation, but by strong example.   Our current dispute resolution process is stacked against victims,  requiring people to go through a protracted and duplicative process.  Members are provided legal counsel, while victims are left to navigate  this convoluted process on their own. Settlements, if provided, are  paid for with taxpayer money instead of the money of the perpetrators  of the events.   This legislation eliminates protracted mandatory waiting periods. It  empowers victims to move directly to a court proceeding if they so  desire. It creates an Office of Employee Advocacy with lawyers on hand  to help people understand their rights.    It prohibits sexual relationships between Members of  Congress and their staffs. It holds offending Members personally  responsible for their conduct by requiring that they pay any  settlements that are actually made.   I thank Chairman Harper and Ranking Member Brady for their  leadership. I especially thank Congresswoman Jackie Speier for her  untiring and exemplary advocacy over the years on this issue. I am glad  that we are being part of this great cultural paradigm shift in America  right now.

Mr. Speaker, do the House rules in rule X, clause 11(g),  which define the conditions for public disclosure of classified  documents, authorize the chairman of the Intelligence Committee to  unilaterally make substantially and material changes to the document  after the committee has already voted to approve and release it in its  original form?    Further parliamentary inquiry then, Mr. Speaker.   What exactly is an advisory opinion? Because this relates, not to a  hypothetical situation, but to an actual situation before the House of  Representatives.
