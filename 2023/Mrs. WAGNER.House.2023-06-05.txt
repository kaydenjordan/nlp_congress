 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 835) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to codify certain  qualifications of individuals as accredited investors for purposes of  the securities laws, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 835         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Investment       Opportunities for Professional Experts Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ACCREDITED INVESTOR.         (a) In General.--Section 2(a)(15) of the Securities Act of       1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (i) and (ii) as       subparagraphs (A) and (F), respectively; and        (2) in subparagraph (A) (as so redesignated), by striking       ``; or'' and inserting a semicolon, and inserting after such       subparagraph the following:        ``(B) any natural person whose individual net worth, or       joint net worth with that person's spouse or spousal       equivalent, exceeds $1,000,000 (which amount, along with the       amounts set forth in subparagraph (C), shall be adjusted for       inflation by the Commission every 5 years to the nearest       $10,000 to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for       All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor       Statistics) where, for purposes of calculating net worth       under this subparagraph--        ``(i) the person's primary residence shall not be included       as an asset;        ``(ii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's primary       residence, up to the estimated fair market value of the       primary residence at the time of the sale of securities,       shall not be included as a liability (except that if the       amount of such indebtedness outstanding at the time of sale       of securities exceeds the amount outstanding 60 days before       such time, other than as a result of the acquisition of the       primary residence, the amount of such excess shall be       included as a liability); and        ``(iii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's       primary residence in excess of the estimated fair market       value of the primary residence at the time of the sale of       securities shall be included as a liability;        ``(C) any natural person who had an individual income in       excess of $200,000 in each of the 2 most recent years or       joint income with that person's spouse or spousal equivalent       in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a       reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in       the current year;        ``(D) any natural person who is currently licensed or       registered as a broker or investment adviser by the       Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or       an equivalent self-regulatory organization (as defined in       section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), or       the securities division of a State, the District of Columbia,       or a territory of the United States or the equivalent       division responsible for licensing or registration of       individuals in connection with securities activities;        ``(E) any natural person the Commission determines, by       regulation, to have demonstrable education or job experience       to qualify such person as having professional knowledge of a       subject related to a particular investment, and whose       education or job experience is verified by the Financial       Industry Regulatory Authority or an equivalent self-      regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a)(26) of       the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); or''.        (b) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall revise the definition       of accredited investor under Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 et       seq.) to conform with the amendments made by subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 835, the Fair Investment  Opportunities for Professional Experts Act.   I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, Congressmen Hill,  Schweikert, Vargas, and others, for working on this important piece of  bipartisan legislation that will expand the pool of eligible investors  who can build wealth through private placements. The current  ``accredited investor'' definition restricts access to investments in  private markets to a select few, largely based on income or net worth.  This excludes many individuals who have other types of expertise or  experience that would make them sophisticated investors.   According to SEC estimates, only 13 percent of U.S. households  actually qualified as accredited investors in 2016, and only a small  percentage of accredited investors are Black or Latino. This shows that  the current definition disproportionately excludes minorities from  accessing investment opportunities.   H.R. 835 expands the definition to include individuals with certain  licenses, educational qualifications, or job experience, opening up  more investment opportunities for those who are knowledgeable in  specific fields. I should also note that this bill passed on suspension  by voice vote in the 115th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, passing H.R. 835 will help level the playing field for  minority entrepreneurs who often struggle to secure funding due to lack  of access to accredited investors. It will also help diversify the pool  of eligible investors, providing more investment opportunities but also  unlocking new sources of innovation and economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  835, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the author of this bill, who is  also the chairman of the Digital Assets, Financial Technology and  Inclusion Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I would just simply urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 835, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1579) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to the  definition of accredited investor, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1579         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Accredited Investor       Definition Review Act''.       SEC. 2. CERTIFICATIONS, DESIGNATIONS, AND CREDENTIALS UNDER                     THE DEFINITION OF ACCREDITED INVESTOR.         Section 2(a)(15) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.       77b(a)(15)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating clauses (i) and (ii) as subparagraphs       (A) and (B), respectively;        (2) in subparagraph (A), as so redesignated, by striking       ``adviser; or'' and inserting ``adviser;'';        (3) in subparagraph (B), as so redesignated, by striking       the period at the end and inserting ``; or''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(C) an individual holding such certifications,       designations, or credentials as the Commission determines       necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the       protection of investors, where such list of certifications,       designations, or credentials shall be no less broad than       those certifications, designations, or credentials described       in the amendments made to section 230.501 of title 17, Code       of Federal Regulations, by the final rule of the Commission       titled `Accredited Investor Definition' (85 Fed. Reg. 64234;       published October 9, 2020).''.       SEC. 3. PERIODIC REVIEW OF CERTIFICATIONS, DESIGNATIONS, AND                     CREDENTIALS.         Section 413(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 77b note) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Periodic review of certifications, designations, and       credentials.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the       enactment of this paragraph and not less frequently than once       every 5 years thereafter, the Commission shall--        ``(A) review the list of certifications, designations, and       credentials accepted with respect to meeting the requirements       of the definition of `accredited investor' under section       2(a)(15) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15))       and rules issued pursuant to such section;        ``(B) add such certifications, designations, and       credentials to such list as the Commission determines are       substantially similar in measuring the financial       sophistication, knowledge, and experience in financial       matters of an individual to the certifications, designations,       and credentials included on such list at the time of such       review; and        ``(C) adjust or modify such list as the Commission       determines necessary or appropriate in the public interest or       for the protection of investors.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1579, the Accredited Investor  Definition Review Act.   I thank my colleagues, Congressmen Huizenga and Lawler, for working  on this important piece of legislation that balances increasing  investor opportunities with investor protection.   Currently, to qualify as an accredited investor, an individual must  have an annual income of at least $200,000 or a net worth of over $1  million. These thresholds exclude many sophisticated but not wealthy  investors from participating in high-growth private companies.   H.R. 1579 requires the SEC to review and update the list of  certifications, designations, and credentials that an investor must  satisfy to qualify as an accredited investor every 5 years, ensuring  that the definition remains relevant and accessible.   By supporting H.R. 1579, we can create a more democratized investment  landscape, where more Americans have the opportunity to invest in high- growth private companies, not just the wealthy elite.   This bill provides a pathway for sophisticated investors of all  backgrounds to accumulate wealth and participate in the success of  private companies.   Mr. Speaker, in short, by expanding the definition of accredited  investors and promoting greater access to private investments, H.R.  1579 will help to level the playing field and ensure that all Americans  have an opportunity to participate in the growth and success of our  economy.   For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1579.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the author of the bill, who is  also chairman of the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee of the  Committee on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 1579, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2593) to create an interdivisional taskforce at the  Securities and Exchange Commission for senior investors, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2593         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Senior Investor       Initiative Act of 2023'' or the ``Senior Security Act of       2023''.       SEC. 2. SENIOR INVESTOR TASKFORCE.

(c) Senior Citizen Defined.--For purposes of this section,       the term ``senior citizen'' means an individual over the age       of 65.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2593, the Senior Security Act.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I thank my  colleagues from both sides of the aisle, Representatives Gottheimer and  Lawler, for working on this important piece of bipartisan legislation  that will assist in the protection of our senior investors.   Fraud and exploitation of any kind in our capital markets threaten  the integrity of our markets. It is especially problematic when such  fraudulent activity targets senior investors.   According to some reports, around 20 percent of senior investors fall  prey to fraudulent investment schemes. Similar reports show that  seniors lose nearly $3 billion annually from financial fraud and  exploitation.   The Senior Security Act is designed to support and enhance efforts to  protect against and prevent the financial exploitation of senior  investors.   This bill establishes the senior investors task force within the  Securities and Exchange Commission, which must report on industry  trends and serious issues impacting investors over the age of 65. The  task force will also help inform policymaking in Washington by making  recommendations for legislative or regulatory actions to address  problems encountered by our senior investors.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2593 has received very strong bipartisan support in  the past, passing by suspension in both the 116th and 117th Congresses.  It remains a sensible solution to ensure that senior investors receive  adequate protection against fraud and exploitation.   For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2593, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield for the purpose of  a colloquy?    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to inform the ranking member  that we may be a bit out of order here. My deepest apologies, and we  will be returning to that order right after this bill is finished.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, am pleased to see that the author  of the bill, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), is here to  speak on his very fine piece of legislation that we are all supportive  of, in a bipartisan manner, H.R. 2593, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to  support H.R. 2593, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge all my colleagues to  support H.R. 2593, a wonderful piece of bipartisan legislation that is  going to help our seniors have the kind of financial security that they  need going forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2608) to amend the Federal securities laws to specify the  periods for which financial statements are required to be provided by  an emerging growth company, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2608         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR                     EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES.

[[Page H2724]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2608, a bill to specify the  periods for which financial statements are required by an emerging  growth company.   I thank my colleague, our esteemed chairman of the Financial Services  Committee, Mr. McHenry, for his leadership on this important piece of  bipartisan legislation which will ensure the continued success of the  IPO on-ramp enacted in the bipartisan JOBS Act of 2012.   To address the steady decline of small company IPOs, title I of the  JOBS Act of 2012 established a new class of public companies, or  issuers, known as emerging growth companies.   These companies are given an on-ramp of up to 5 years to comply with  certain regulatory requirements prior to, throughout, and immediately  after the company's IPO.   Under the JOBS Act, one particularly helpful accommodation provided  to EGCs is the requirement to provide 2 years of audited financial  statements instead of 3 years in its IPO registration statement.   Under certain circumstances, however, an EGC, or a company that went  public as an EGC, must provide financial statements for earlier  periods. This has occurred occasionally, for example, in the case of  acquired company financial statements and for follow-on offerings  involving an emerging growth company that lost its EGC status during  IPO registration.   H.R. 2608 resolves this misinterpretation by establishing that an  emerging growth company, as well as any issuer that went public issuing  EGC disclosure obligations, only needs to provide 2 years of audited  financial statements.   Mr. Speaker, by ensuring that EGCs can consistently rely on the JOBS  Act's scaled disclosure obligations by eliminating this irregularity,  H.R. 2608 will enhance the utility and the benefits of EGC  accommodations.   For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2608, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the chairman of the full  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2608, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2610) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  specify certain registration statement contents for emerging growth  companies, to permit issuers to file draft registration statements with  the Securities and Exchange Commission for confidential review, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 2610         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REGISTRATION STATEMENTS.         Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78l(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)(K), by striking ``years,'' and       inserting ``years (or, in the case of an emerging growth       company, not more than the two preceding years),''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:      ``Any issuer may confidentially submit to the Commission a       draft registration statement for confidential nonpublic       review by the staff of the Commission prior to public filing,       provided that the initial confidential submission and all       amendments thereto shall be publicly filed with the       Commission not later than 10 days before listing on a       national securities exchange. Notwithstanding any other       provision of this title, the Commission shall not be       compelled to disclose any information provided to or obtained       by the Commission pursuant to this subsection. For purposes       of section 552 of title 5, this subsection shall be       considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of       such section 552. Information described in or obtained       pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to constitute       confidential information for purposes of section 24.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2610, a bill to harmonize the  emerging growth company, EGC, financial statement requirements  originally enacted in the JOBS Act of 2012.   I thank my colleague, and our esteemed chair of the Financial  Services Committee, Chairman McHenry, for his leadership on this  important piece of bipartisan legislation that will attract companies  to go public here in the United States.   Title I of the bipartisan JOBS Act of 2012 established a new class of  public companies, or issuers, called emerging growth companies, to  attract small companies to go public and reverse the steady decline of  small initial public offerings, IPOs, in American capital markets.   Under the JOBS Act, EGCs are granted scaled reporting and disclosure  requirements for a limited time after they go public. This attractive  accommodation allows the company to grow before absorbing the costly  regulatory burdens faced by large public companies.   One accommodation EGCs may take advantage of under the JOBS Act is  providing 2 years of audited financial statements rather than 3 years  when conducting an IPO.   Sometimes an EGC in its entirety does not undertake an IPO and  instead spins off a segment of its business as a new company and takes  that spin-off public. However, spin-offs of an EGC may not take  advantage of the 2-year financial statement accommodation.                                time  1700    The EGC financial statement accommodations should apply equally,  whether an EGC is conducting an IPO or spinning off a segment of its  business and taking that company public.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2610 ensures consistency and equal application by  clarifying that an EGC may present 2 years rather than 3 years of  audited financial statements in both IPOs and spinoff transactions.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2610, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the chairman of the full  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I simply urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2610, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2793) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to expand the  ability to use testing the waters and confidential draft registration  submissions, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H. R. 2793         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Encouraging Public Offerings       Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. EXPANDING TESTING THE WATERS.         Section 5(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.       77e(d)) is amended--  [[Page H2728]]         (1) by striking ``Notwithstanding'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding'';        (2) by striking ``an emerging growth company or any person       authorized to act on behalf of an emerging growth company''       and inserting ``an issuer or any person authorized to act on       behalf of an issuer''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Additional requirements.--        ``(A) In general.--The Commission may promulgate       regulations, subject to public notice and comment, to impose       such other terms, conditions, or requirements on the engaging       in oral or written communications described under paragraph       (1) by an issuer other than an emerging growth company as the       Commission determines appropriate.        ``(B) Report to congress.--Prior to any rulemaking       described under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall submit       to Congress a report containing a list of the findings       supporting the basis of the rulemaking.''.       SEC. 3. CONFIDENTIAL REVIEW OF DRAFT REGISTRATION STATEMENTS.         Section 6(e) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.       77f(e)) is amended--        (1) in the heading, by striking ``Emerging Growth       Companies'' and inserting ``Confidential Review of Draft       Registration Statements'';        (2) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (4); and        (3) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:        ``(1) In general.--Any issuer may, with respect to an       initial public offering, initial registration of a security       of the issuer under section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange       Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l(b)), or follow-on offering,       confidentially submit to the Commission a draft registration       statement, for confidential nonpublic review by the staff of       the Commission prior to public filing, provided that the       initial confidential submission and all amendments thereto       shall be publicly filed with the Commission not later than--        ``(A) in the case of an initial public offering, 10 days       before the effective date of such registration statement;        ``(B) in the case of an initial registration of a security       of the issuer under such section 12(b), 10 days before       listing on an exchange; or        ``(C) in the case of a follow-on offering, 48 hours before       the effective date of such registration statement.        ``(2) Follow-on offering defined.--In this subsection, the       term `follow-on offering' means an offering by an issuer       during the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of       the initial public offering of the issuer or the initial       registration of a security of the issuer under section 12(b)       of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l(b)).        ``(3) Additional requirements.--        ``(A) In general.--The Commission may promulgate       regulations, subject to public notice and comment, to impose       such other terms, conditions, or requirements on the       submission of draft registration statements described under       this subsection by an issuer other than an emerging growth       company as the Commission determines appropriate.        ``(B) Report to congress.--Prior to any rulemaking       described under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall submit       to Congress a report containing a list of the findings       supporting the basis of the rulemaking.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  2793, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act.   This bipartisan piece of legislation would encourage more companies  to go public and expand provisions of the JOBS Act by codifying an  existing SEC rule.   The SEC rule that this bill codifies allows for all companies to test  the waters by communicating directly with certain potential investors  before filing for an IPO.   Although small companies are known to drive technological innovation  and job creation, they frequently face obstacles in obtaining funding  in the capital markets.   These obstacles often are the result of the disproportionately larger  burden that securities regulations--written for large public  companies--place on small companies when they seek to go public.   Title I of the JOBS Act established a new category of issuers known  as emerging growth companies or EGCs. To qualify as an EGC, a company  must maintain a certain threshold of annual revenue.   The law provides that EGCs with a 5-year on-ramp to comply with  certain regulatory requirements related to disclosure and reporting.   Additionally, title I allows for EGCs to test the waters by meeting  with investors to explain their business structure before issuing an  IPO.   Biotech companies, especially in the Second District of Missouri in  particular, have been vocal about the benefits that testing the waters  provides.   These meetings allow for additional time to explain to investors the  complicated technologies and regulatory pathways and complex product  offerings of the company to encourage greater participation in the IPO.   While the JOBS Act has made it easier for small companies to go  public, the JOBS Act alone has not been enough to entirely overcome the  capital formation obstacles that many companies face as they attempt to  go public.   The Encouraging Public Offerings Act ensures that all companies,  rather than just emerging growth companies, are allowed to test the  waters.   This bill will make listing on exchanges more attractive,  strengthening our financial markets and providing Main Street investors  with more opportunities to grow their nest eggs.   Mr. Speaker, this process may sound complicated, but it is actually  quite simple. Start-up companies are oftentimes doing innovative and  complex activities.   They should be encouraged to sit down with potential investors and  given the opportunity to explain why their business model is the right  one for an investment plan without additional regulatory burdens.   The best analogy that I can give here, Mr. Speaker, is when you are  trying to teach your children the value of a dollar and how to make a  good, sound argument.   I remember telling my sons, who were trying to get my husband and I  to pay for a new stereo, that they needed to present a plan to us for  this potential investment.   They went back to their rooms, did their preparation, and then sat  down with us and explained their argument for why they needed a stereo  and why we should make that investment.   Mr. Speaker, start-up companies need that same opportunity to pitch  their product to potential investors.   We need to incentivize start-ups to grow and expand, creating jobs  for American workers and strengthening our economy. While we don't  always fund the stereo purchases, we need to give them that chance.   I thank my good friend from New York (Mr. Meeks) for his longstanding  support of this legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to support  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2793, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2812) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  carry out a study of the costs associated with small- and medium-sized  companies to undertake initial public offerings, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2812         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Middle Market IPO Cost       Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON IPO FEES.         (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States,       in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission,       in consultation with the Financial Industry Regulatory       Authority, shall carry out a study of the costs associated       with small- and medium-sized companies to undertake initial       public offerings (``IPOs''). In carrying out such study, the       Comptroller General shall--        (1) consider the direct and indirect costs of an IPO,       including--        (A) fees of accountants, underwriters, and any other       outside advisors with respect to the IPO;        (B) compliance with Federal and State securities laws at       the time of the IPO; and        (C) such other IPO-related costs as the Comptroller General       may consider;        (2) compare and analyze the costs of an IPO with the costs       of obtaining alternative sources of financing and of       liquidity;        (3) consider the impact of such costs on capital formation;        (4) analyze the impact of these costs on the availability       of public securities of small- and medium-sized companies to       retail investors; and        (5) analyze trends in IPOs over a time period the       Comptroller General determines is appropriate to analyze IPO       pricing practices, considering--        (A) the number of IPOs;        (B) how costs for IPOs have evolved over time for       underwriters, investment advisory firms, and other       professions for services in connection with an IPO;        (C) the number of brokers and dealers active in       underwriting IPOs;        (D) the different types of services that underwriters and       related persons provide before and after a small- or medium-      sized company IPO and the factors impacting IPOs costs;        (E) changes in the costs and availability of investment       research for small- and medium-sized companies; and        (F) the impacts of litigation and its costs on being a       public company.        (b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 360-day period       beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Comptroller General shall issue a report to the Congress       containing all findings and determinations made in carrying       out the study required under subsection (a) and any       administrative or legislative recommendations the Comptroller       General may have.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2812, the Middle Market IPO  Underwriting Cost Act. I thank my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle, Representatives Himes and Lawler, for working on this important  piece of bipartisan legislation that will help ensure that our IPO  market remains competitive and attractive, especially for small- and  medium-sized companies.   I thank Mr. Himes for his willingness to work with the majority, and  specifically Congressman French Hill of Arkansas, to reach an agreement  on this legislation.   Staff have been working on this since the bill was marked up in  April, and I am happy to see that the study will now be carried out by  the GAO in consultation with the SEC and FINRA.   Companies have two ways of accessing capital in the securities  markets to fund their operations: an initial public offering, IPO,  where they sell securities publicly through a registered offering with  the SEC, or a private offering under an exemption from registration.   Accessing capital through an IPO is a significant step for a company  because there are considerable up-front costs, as well as ongoing,  increased costs associated with the company's reporting requirements as  a public company.   Before an IPO, companies often spend tens of millions of dollars  gathering and compiling mandatory information to submit to the SEC and  make available to the public for the sale of its securities.   The SEC itself has estimated that the average cost of just achieving  regulatory compliance for going public is $2.5 million, which may not  include additional costs of hiring professionals to help undertake the  IPO.   However, additional data is required to achieve a better  understanding of the costs of the added regulatory and  [[Page H2730]]  professional services associated with undertaking an IPO and becoming a  public company.   As a result, the study required under this bill will help Congress  and the market better understand the costs associated with small- and  medium-sized companies to undertake initial public offerings, IPOs, and  become public companies.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2812 is a balanced and thoughtful bill that will  give us the information to better understand those costs with going  public so that Congress can continue the work to make our public  markets the most attractive and competitive in the world.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2812, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2812, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
