 Mr. Speaker, if you were in western Pennsylvania for the  2020 campaign season, you would have seen a lot of commercials about  what Republicans were going to do on the issue of energy and for energy  workers and what Democrats were going to do. The contention was that  Republicans were going to make us energy dominant, that they were going  to help all these workers and give them more job opportunities, and  that the Democrats were going to take all that away.   So here today, we have a bill that is all about energy dominance and  energy jobs. If you build pipelines, this bill is for you because of  the increased money for carbon capture and hydrogen.   If you make the steel tube that goes into those pipelines, if you  work at a nuclear power plant, or if you build things for the nuclear  power plant, this bill is for all of you. It strengthens and widens our  energy portfolio and gives us more options at a better price.   Yet, today's bill is not a Republican bill. It is a Democratic bill.  I wish it wasn't only a Democratic bill, but it will be because when it  comes to the needs of these workers and the true need for our country  to be energy secure, we are the ones doing the job.
