 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the 74th anniversary of the GI bill, which we will be celebrating later  this week.   Before the Senator from Connecticut leaves the floor, I want to thank  him for his comments. I want to follow up briefly on what he has said.  As the Presiding Officer knows, and our colleague from Connecticut  knows, every Wednesday morning, there is a prayer breakfast. Democrats,  Republicans, Independents, and a number of Senators from both sides  have breakfast together. One of the Senators talks about their faith  and how their faith affects the way they approach their work here, our  work here.   Today, I was invited to speak, and I mentioned that sometimes when  people say ``What kind of Democrat are you?'' I say I am a Democrat who  has read Matthew 25.   People say: What is Matthew 25?   Matthew 25 goes something like this. When I was hungry, did you feed  me? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you  give me something to drink? When I was sick and imprisoned, did you  visit me? When I was a stranger in your land, did you welcome me?   Every day here, the Chaplain starts our session with a prayer, and we  have Bible study groups. I want to take a minute, and I don't expect my  friend from Connecticut to stay on the floor, but I want him to hear  the beginning of this. I just want to cite a couple of Scriptures.  There are one or two in the Old Testament and maybe one or two in the  New Testament.    In the Book of Leviticus in the Old Testament, chapter 19, we read  these words: ``When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall  not wrong him.''   The next verse, 34, reads: ``You should treat the stranger who  sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him [or  her] as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.''   In the New Testament are the words of Jesus. We read in Matthew 18, I  think verses 2 through 6: ``He called a little child [meaning Jesus]  and placed the child among them.''   Jesus said to them: ``Truly, I tell you, unless you change and become  like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven.  Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child [who was with  him that day] is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. And whoever  welcomes one such child in my Name welcomes me.''   Matthew 18:6 reads: ``If anyone causes one of these little ones,  those who believe in me, to stumble, it would be better for them to  have a large millstone hung around their neck than be drowned in the  depths of the sea.''   That is pretty straight talk or, as we used to say in the Navy, the  straight skinny. Those are good words from the Old Testament and the  New Testament to keep in mind.   Again, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his words.                       74th Anniversary of the GI Bill    Mr. President, our colleague from Connecticut, by the way, is  somebody who has spent time in uniform. His sons have spent time in  uniform, and I think one or two are still serving.   When I came back from Southeast Asia at the end of the Vietnam war,  after having been a naval flight officer for a number of years, I was  fortunate to have been eligible for the GI bill. The GI bill that I was  eligible for was a bill that provided me $250 a month to help pay for  my tuition and my expenses at the University of Delaware, where I was  in the business school trying to earn an MBA, which I ultimately did.   The benefit for GIs today is not $250 a month. As my colleagues know,  whatever the tuition costs are, they are paid for by the GI bill. If  you go to a private school or something like that outside of your  State, the benefit could be higher. There is a cap on that, but I think  it is over $20,000. The expenses for tuition, tutoring, books, and fees  are paid for by the GI bill. In Delaware, there is a monthly housing  allowance, and there is in every State. The monthly housing allowance  in Delaware is $2,000 a month. That compares with those of us who, at  the end of the Vietnam war, received $250 a month.   I don't deny or feel bad about the current GIs--sailors, airmen,  airwomen. I don't feel bad about their getting a lot more, because it  is a good benefit, and it is one that is worth celebrating.   My dad came back from World War II, and my uncle served either in  World War II or Korea. I was born after the war was over. Somewhere  along the line when I was a little kid, my dad talked about how he got  his early training after the war, but I was not old enough to  understand what he was talking about. Shortly after the war ended in  1945, he went back to West Virginia.   As best I could figure out, other people took advantage of the GI  bill, which was new then. They went to colleges and universities. My  recollection is that Frank Lautenberg, who was a Senator for a number  of years, went to Harvard. People went to different kinds of colleges  and universities and maybe to community colleges.   Apparently, my dad got training not by going to a 2-year school or a  4-year school but by gaining a skill. The skill that he apparently  gained was to be able to fix wrecked cars and to do bodywork on those  cars. He worked at a place called Burleson Oldsmobile in Beckley, WV.  He must have been pretty good at what he did. One day, an insurance  adjuster came in from Nationwide Insurance to look at a car that was  insured by Nationwide. He talked to my dad for a while.   The insurance agent from Nationwide Insurance said: You sound like a  pretty sharp guy. I am surprised that somebody who seems to have as  much on the ball as you do is here, fixing wrecked cars. You could  do what I do.    My dad asked: Do you mean be a claims adjuster for Nationwide  Insurance?   The fellow said: Yes.   Sure enough, a year later, my dad, apparently, became a claims  adjuster for Nationwide Insurance. He had a high school degree from  Shady Spring High School, which is just outside of Beckley. My mom did  as well. Neither of them ever went to college. My dad worked for  Nationwide for probably 25 years or more--maybe 30 years--in different  places around the country. One of his last assignments for Nationwide  Insurance, in its home office of Columbus, OH, was to run the training  school for Nationwide's insurance adjusters from all over the country.   Here was a guy with a high school degree, who had served in World War  II with honor, who had a chance to get a GI bill benefit and turn it  into a lifetime opportunity for himself and his family. It enabled my  sister and me to go on and finish school. Thanks to the Navy, I got my  Navy scholarship and used some money when overseas to help my sister go  to school.   The GI bill means a lot to my family, and it does to a lot of  families. I think this is a benefit which has been around now for I  believe 74 years this Friday. Think about that--three-quarters of a  century this Friday. This Friday marks the 74th anniversary of  President Franklin Roosevelt's signing of the Servicemen's Readjustment  Act of 1944 into law. This legislation is more commonly known as the GI  bill, and we have always called it the GI bill.   Thanks to the GI bill, millions of returning World War II veterans  flooded our Nation's colleges and universities,  [[Page S4271]]  and it ushered in an era of unprecedented economic expansion. Since  1944, the GI bill has transformed our country and the lives of millions  of veterans, including mine. It really helped to create a middle class  in this country, as millions of GIs came back and had a chance to learn  a skill and go to college in many cases and have economic opportunities  for themselves and their families that never before had been possible.   This week, we are recognizing--I think for the first time--the  historical significance of the GI bill. We are going to designate the  week from June 18 through June 22 as ``National GI Bill Commemoration  Week.''   I want to thank several Senators.   I thank Senator Sullivan from Alaska--a colonel in the Marine Corps.   As the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee, I thank Johnny Isakson and Senator Jon Tester for joining me  in submitting the resolution in the Senate to designate June 18 through  22 as ``National GI Bill Commemoration Week.''   I thank House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Roe and Ranking  Member Walz for submitting the same solution in the House of  Representatives.   I also thank the American Legion for its hard work in making this  resolution a reality and for advocating for veterans and veterans'  education benefits in Congress, as have other service organizations,  but I think the American Legion was present at the creation and worked  very hard right at the creation to make sure that we had a GI bill and  that it would survive.   Because this is GI Bill Week, I want to mention just a few reasons  some folks refer to the GI bill as the greatest legislation. We have a  greatest generation--my parents' generation. They are the folks who  grew up in the Great Depression and went on to do amazing things with  their lives.   Some have referred to the GI bill as the greatest legislation, and I  have already shared my own story today. The GI bill made immediate  financial support, education, and home loan programs available. I  bought my first home with the GI bill, with VA mortgage-backed  insurance. That is how I insured my mortgage. I was able to get the low  rate offered in the GI bill. Millions of veterans bought homes with the  help of the GI bill. This combination of opportunities changed the  social and economic fabric of our country.   A 1988 report from the Joint Economic Committee estimated that for  every $1 the United States invested in the GI bill, about $7 was  returned in economic growth. Think about that. For every $1 we  invested, there was a $7 return in economic growth thanks to the GI  bill.   Close to half a million engineers, close to a quarter of a million  accountants, close to a quarter of a million teachers, almost 100,000  scientists, about 67,000 doctors, over 120,000 dentists, and thousands  of other professionals entered the workforce of the United States. I  might add that they are still entering the workforce of the United  States.   The GI bill truly democratized our higher education system,  established greater citizenship and civic participation, and empowered  the ``greatest generation'' to lead our country following World War II.   Over the past 74 years, Congress has enacted subsequent GI bills to  provide educational assistance to new generations of veterans,  including the Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966, the Post- Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Act of 1977, the Veterans'  Educational Assistance Act of 1984, and most recently the Post-9/11  Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, which we voted on and  debated here, I think in about my eighth year here in the Senate.    After returning from three tours of duty over in Southeast Asia, as I  said earlier, I was fortunate enough to be able to use my Vietnam-era  GI bill benefits at the University of Delaware.   I close by saying that Senator Young is on the floor. I think he is  going to offer an amendment in just a moment. He is a marine, and I am  proud to serve with him. The Marine Corps and the Navy have different  uniforms but are on the same team. I salute him for his service.   If you go back to 2008, that was when we were falling into the worst  recession since the Great Depression, some of us will recall. These  pages up here were about half their current age. They are now about 15  or 16 years old. They were about 8 years old when we were falling into  the worst economic hole we had been in since the Great Depression. The  unemployment rate for our country, as I recall, reached or exceeded 10  percent. The unemployment rate--I was told by my staff--was higher for  veterans. It was higher than 10 percent. I have been told it was  significantly higher. That was where we were in 2009--at the bottom of  the great recession.   Since that time, a lot of veterans have come home. They have been  able to take advantage of the current GI bill, the new GI bill--a very  generous GI bill. Do you know what has happened? They have found jobs.  They have found economic opportunity. They are doing all kinds of  things with the education they have gained at sometimes 4-year colleges  with advanced degrees, at 2-year colleges, at trade schools.   The unemployment rate for our country has now dropped to under 4  percent. We are in the ninth year of an economic expansion--the longest  running economic expansion in our country's history. While the national  unemployment rate is about 3.9 percent, the veterans' unemployment rate  is no longer above the national average. It is below. The national  average is down to about 3.9, and the veterans' unemployment rate is  about 3.4. Again, I think we can say that the GI bill has helped to  educate a whole new generation of young men and women. The GI bill is  in no small part responsible for that.   I commend my colleague Jim Webb, a former Senator from Virginia, who  was the author of the legislation in 2008 that a lot of us supported  and voted for.   We are also grateful to those veterans and to the people of this  country for having confidence in us in making sure that we could make  an investment on their behalf and our behalf.   Later this week, on Friday--people ask, what day is Friday? It will  be the 74th anniversary of the GI bill. It is one of the greatest  pieces of legislation we have ever passed and enacted in this country.  It is the gift that keeps on giving, and it hopefully will continue to  do so for a long time.   Mr. President, there are two Senators on the floor who lead the  Veterans' Affairs Committee. I ask unanimous consent for Senator Young,  who is the author of an amendment that has been offered, to speak for 5  minutes and for Senator Tester to speak for 3 minutes.    I thank the Presiding Officer.
