 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse),  my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the  underlying legislation. This is the 23rd closed rule of this short, new  Congress. Both Democrats and Republicans have been denied the  opportunity to amend nearly 60 percent of the legislation that has been  brought to the floor through the House Rules Committee.   This effort by Speaker Ryan and the Republican leadership to halt a  fair and open debate in the people's House is outrageous. We are  supposed to be a deliberative body where both parties get to  deliberate. These Putinesque rules that shut down all debate need to  stop. This isn't the Kremlin.   You know, I think Representative Rooney, a Republican, said it best  last week: ``I've been in this job for 8 years, and I'm wracking my  brain to think of one thing our party has done that's been something  positive, that's been something other than stopping something else from  happening.''   Well, Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a piece of legislation  that seeks to prevent the EPA from protecting public health and the  environment--not exactly positive.   This bill was brought to the Rules Committee in an emergency meeting  last night. And let me emphasize that, an emergency meeting.   Mr. Speaker, I think the American people have a pretty good idea of  what is and what isn't an emergency. A tree falls on your house, that  is an emergency. Your rose bush needs pruning, not an emergency. Timmy  fell down a well, that is an emergency. Timmy might stub his toe, not  an emergency.   On April 28, the government will run out of money. That is an  emergency, even if it is self-inflicted by the Republicans. And we have  no shortage of other actual emergencies that we should be dealing with:  a devastating opioid epidemic, crumbling roads and bridges, mounting  evidence of Russian meddling in our election, and people being killed  every day due to gun violence, not to mention Flint, Michigan, is still  dealing with the residual health effects of toxically polluted water.   These are just a few examples of actual emergencies that Congress is  doing nothing to address. Instead, the underlying bill, the EPA Science  Advisory Board Reform Act, is brought to the Rules Committee and to the  House floor as an emergency piece of legislation.   As we learned last week, the American people are paying attention to  what we do here. They are smart enough to know what an emergency is.  And this bill isn't addressing an emergency, Mr. Speaker; it is  creating one.   The Science Advisory Board at the EPA provides a way for the Agency  to use sound, independent, and objective scientific data to help make  their decisions. Science, Mr. Speaker--you may have heard of it--is  kind of a big deal.   But this bill won't help the EPA to include more scientists in the  decisions. It will force them to include people with potential  financial conflicts of interest on the Science Advisory Board so long  as they disclose them. I mean, do we really want people on our advisory  boards if they could profit from a decision that they are about to  make? There is nothing scientific about corruption, and this is exactly  what this bill will open the door to.    This bill also limits the participation of scientific experts at the  EPA, leading to a disproportionate representation of big business and  corporate special interests. Are these really the people we want making  decisions about the health of our kids and the policies that should be  protecting our environment? Is that what we want?   So what is this bill really about? Well, it is about allowing the  Republicans' big corporate cronies a direct route to the decisionmakers  at the EPA. It is about disrupting the EPA's ability to fairly enforce  the rules, hold corporate polluters accountable, and protect our  health. It is about undermining scientific fact with political  cronyism.   Now, maybe things have changed lately. It has been a while since my  last science class. But I am pretty sure there is no step in the  scientific method that says consult corporate cronies. The truth is  that this Republican majority wants the EPA to base their decisions on  fiction, not fact.   Americans can't afford to have the EPA run by people who live in a  fantasyland where facts and science don't matter. Our environment and  the health of our families are too important.   This law is going to have real-life consequences. It undermines  science, hurts the environment, and it helps polluters. We need to  allow the EPA to make decisions based on fact. We need to ensure that  EPA is always free from financial conflicts, not making decisions based  on panels filled with industry insiders like the ones that this bill  would create.   Mr. Speaker, this bill defies logic. It defies reason. It defies  sanity. It will hurt the people who sent us here, and it will help  polluters. Republicans are putting corporate greed ahead of public  health, and the American people will be the ones who will suffer.  Americans deserve better. We should be fighting on behalf of the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell my Republican friends what I tell first  graders that I talk to back in my district in Massachusetts when I go  to visit their schools. I usually begin by telling them that science is  important. It is a big deal, and it is such a big deal that all our  schools teach it. And if you do your homework and if you study hard and  you pay attention, you might grow up someday to become a scientist, and  scientists are people who dedicate their lives to protecting the health  and well-being of people all over the world, and they dedicate their  lives to protecting our planet.   Scientists tell us things that are really important. They tell us  things like climate change is caused by greenhouse gasses, something my  Republican friends continually deny. They tell us that polluted air can  give children asthma. They tell us that lead in children's drinking  water causes learning problems. They tell us pesticide exposure can  cause cancer. These are important things.   We all learned in school, thanks to science, that the Earth orbits  around the Sun, that gravity causes this pen to fall when I drop it,  that plants turn sunshine into energy, that dinosaurs roamed the Earth  millions of years ago.   Mr. Speaker, the first graders I talk to, they get it. They  understand the importance of science. Unfortunately, many of my  colleagues in this Chamber do not. And I would bet that those first  graders understand the importance of making sure that it is scientists  who sit on scientific advisory boards and not corporate cronies.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his speech, but it  was on a different bill than the one we are talking about right now.  That was a rule we debated yesterday. The rule passed, but we are going  to be talking about it today. So I was a little confused trying to  follow the gentleman.   I also want to remind the gentleman that he mentioned Donald Trump's  election. I will remind him that less than half of the people of the  United States actually voted for him. Hillary won the popular vote by  close to 3 million. The gentleman keeps on talking about a better way,  a better way, a better way.   Was that what was on display last week when we spent 15 hours in the  Rules Committee debating a repeal-and-replace bill on health care that  only 16 percent of the American people thought was worth it and that  had to be pulled because it was such a lousy process?   If that is the better way, I don't think people want anything to do  with it.   I would say to the gentleman, my colleague, Mr. Newhouse, who is  talking about trying to justify the closed process and saying that some  of these bills were CRAs, just repealing regulations, well, my friends  chose to bring up these repeal regulation bills under a very closed  process. Interestingly enough, these rules were made under a very open  process where agencies solicited input from stakeholders and from the  public, and it was all out in the open. But the Republicans chose to  bring measures to the floor to repeal regulations in such a way that  that agency can't even go back and revisit the same subject of that  particular regulation.   I think people need to understand this. I don't think I can ever  recall a more closed, authoritarian process than the one that we have  experienced under this leadership. This is not only something that I  know Democrats have a problem with; I know a lot of Republicans do,  too, because what this closed process means is that anybody with a good  idea can't bring it to the floor and can't have an opportunity to  debate the issue.   It was funny last night in the Rules Committee, my colleague from  Texas (Mr. Burgess) was kind of crowing about the fact that no  amendments were brought before the Rules Committee. I reminded him the  reason why no amendments were brought before the Rules Committee is  because this bill was noticed as an emergency and there was no call for  amendments. Members weren't asked to bring their ideas or their  amendments to the Rules Committee. This would be laughable if it  weren't so tragic. I would say to my colleagues that it is this same  closed process that brought us this disastrous health repeal bill that  my friends had to pull last week that is on display today. When you  have a lousy process, you end up with lousy legislation.   This is the people's House. We are supposed to deliberate, and here  is a radical idea: let us deliberate a little bit. Open it up. Open it  up a little bit. Let there be some amendments on both sides of the  aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question. If we defeat the previous question, I will bring to the floor  an amendment, which I am going to talk about right now because, Mr.  Speaker, we are deeply concerned by reports from our intelligence  community regarding Russian interference in last year's election and  even more troubled by FBI Director Comey's sworn testimony that the FBI  is now investigating the possibility of collusion between members of  President Trump's campaign team and Russia.   Mr. Speaker, the legitimacy of our electoral system is at stake, and  it is time that this Republican-controlled Congress does its job and  gets to the bottom of this. Unfortunately, recent actions by the House  Intelligence Committee chairman have left many Members from both sides  of the aisle convinced that the committee will not be able to conduct  an impartial investigation of this crucial matter of national security.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Swalwell's and  Representative Cummings' bill, which would create a bipartisan  commission to investigate Russian interference in our 2016 election.  For the life of me I don't know why this is controversial. My  colleagues on the Republican side should be just as interested in  getting to the truth and getting to the truth in a way that has  credibility with the American people as we on the Democratic side do.  [[Page H2532]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire from the gentleman how many  more speakers he has?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me first remind Members that we are asking for a  ``no'' vote on the previous question. If the previous question is  defeated, we will bring up an amendment that will allow the bill that  Representative Swalwell and Representative Cummings have introduced,  which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian  interference in our 2016 election.   This is the appropriate place to do it because we are blocked in  every other way in terms of trying to bring this to the floor, and the  Rules Committee is a committee that prioritizes legislation that helps  set the agenda, so this ought to be part of it. This anti-science bill  can still be debated and voted on. It won't derail that, but it will  allow the House to be able to deliberate on this bill that would create  a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016  election.                                time  1300    This is a big deal. The American people deserve the truth. My  Republican colleagues ought to get out of the way and allow this  commission to be created so that the American people can actually have  some trust in a process that determines the extent to which the  Russians interfered in our election.   Again, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.   With regard to the rule that we are debating today, I would again  remind everybody that this is a closed rule. There are some Members of  this House who have never seen an open rule, ever. I hope that changes  because I do think that, again, there ought to be more deliberation  here, there ought to be more back and forth. Even ideas that I strongly  disagree with on the Republican side, they ought to have the  opportunity to come here and be able to present them and we can vote up  or down on them.   I think we need to break this pattern of shutting the process down.  It is what resulted in the debacle last week with your horrible  healthcare bill, the one that only 16 percent of the American people  supported. It is pretty hard to get that low, but my friends managed to  be able to set a new record on unpopular legislation--so bad that it  had to be withdrawn from the floor for consideration.   I would argue it is the closed, authoritarian-like process that  produced a lousy bill. If my friends continue to adhere to this closed  process, they are going to get more lousy pieces of legislation that  are going to do great harm to the American people brought to this  floor.   This bill that is before us today, again, has been brought to the  floor under this expedited procedure called an emergency provision. It  is just being rushed to the floor as an emergency.   This is not an emergency. The opioid crisis is an emergency; the  crisis in Flint, Michigan, is an emergency; our crumbling  infrastructure is an emergency. There are deficient bridges and roads  in every one of our congressional districts. That is an emergency. We  need to address that.   Keeping the government open is an emergency. But to say this is an  emergency is kind of ridiculous. It is not an emergency. It is kind of  like our house is on fire and you are saying: I will get out the hose  later, but I need to wash the dishes first.   That is how this kind of fits into what we are doing here today. This  doesn't qualify for that.   On the substance of the bill, we have this radical idea that  scientists ought to sit on scientific advisory committees, not  corporate cronies, not people who are interested in covering up for  polluters or doing their bidding. We think experts and scientists ought  to sit on scientific advisory boards. That is the radical idea that we  have. This bill, unfortunately, undermines that.   What this bill does is threaten public health by stacking advisory  boards with industry representatives, and it weakens scientific review.  It is that simple. I don't care what your political ideology is, I  don't think you want that.   Let me just mention some of the groups that are opposed to this:   The Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Geophysical  Union, and the American Lung Association strongly oppose this bill. The  American Public Health Association, the American Thoracic Society, and  the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America oppose this bill. Clean  Water Action opposes this bill. Earthjustice, the Environmental Defense  Action Fund, Health Care Without Harm, League of Conservation Voters,  and the National Medical Association oppose this bill. The Natural  Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and  Union of Concerned Scientists all oppose this bill. The Food Policy  Action opposes this bill.   I can go on and on. Every organization that is an advocate for the  health and well-being of the American people oppose this bill. We are  bringing it up for an up-or-down vote, no amendments, a closed rule,  and here we are.   I would just say, Mr. Speaker, again, this is a bad idea. I guess if  you are an ally of big corporations or of corporations that engage in  pollution, this is a good idea. But if you are interested in protecting  the health and well-being of the American people, and the globe, for  that matter, this is a bad idea.   As I began, I mentioned that when I speak to first-graders, they  understand the importance of science. They get it. They want us to be  good stewards of the environment. They want us to protect this planet.  They understand the importance of science.   But I am always amazed how many people in this Chamber just don't get  it. I find that really sad. I want to give my kids, and someday my  grandkids and great grandkids, a future where we respect the  environment. When we pass bills like this, it makes that less certain.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues again to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and, please, in a bipartisan way, reject this lousy  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
