 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my  amendment, which would allow SNAP users to purchase multivitamins.   First, I would like to thank Chairman Conaway for his hard work  during this farm bill process. H.R. 2 is a bill that will strengthen  the farm safety net for America's farmers and ranchers, and give folks  on SNAP a path out of poverty with workforce training programs.  [[Page H4125]]    The multivitamins can serve as an effective bridge between what  Americans should eat and what they actually consume. Repeated studies  have shown that Americans do not consume essential nutrients at  recommended levels through diet alone. Low-income and older Americans  are more likely than others to have insufficient and nutritionally  inadequate diets.   Multivitamins are not a replacement for a healthy diet, but these  supplements can help fill that nutrient gap. Safe, convenient, and  scientifically supported multivitamins represent a low-cost immediate  solution for SNAP recipients looking to ensure their families receive  adequate intake of essential vitamins and minerals.   It is my hope that by empowering low-income Americans to achieve  optimal nutrition, SNAP recipients will develop lifelong habits that  will eventually break the cycle of poverty and allow them to reach  their full potential.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this commonsense, no-cost amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
