 Madam Speaker, my first friend and mentor in Washington  was Chairman Dingell. Big John guided me during all of my years as HHS  Secretary. He was a towering figure in the House, passionate about  healthcare, and tough on unethical behavior by those who benefited from  the generosity of taxpayers.   He was, for all of us who knew and loved him, gentle and kind, and  generous with his time and advice. He was a gentleman legislator,  brilliant, tough, strategic, and extraordinarily effective. He was a  patriot.   My heart goes out to my good friend, his wife, Debbie, and his  family.                            ____________________
