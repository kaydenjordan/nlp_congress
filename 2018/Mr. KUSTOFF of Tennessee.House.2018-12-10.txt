 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  students of the Munford High School marching band.   About 265 students from Tipton County, Tennessee, will represent  Munford High School in the Tournament of Roses Parade. This annual  tradition takes place each year in Pasadena, California, on New Year's  Day. It is a distinct honor to be invited to march in the Tournament of  Roses Parade, with only five bands from across the Nation receiving an  invitation each year. Munford High School will be the only band from  the mid-South area selected for this event.   This talented group of students, led by Dr. Courtney Fee and director  Barry Trobaugh, will be proudly representing not only Munford High  School but the entire State of Tennessee. They have made our community  proud.   To the students: You have worked really long and hard hours for this  day to come. I hope you take in each and every moment of this  incredible opportunity in Pasadena. May you remember this moment and  this honor for many years to come. Best of luck, Cougars. Tennessee is  really proud of you.                            ____________________
