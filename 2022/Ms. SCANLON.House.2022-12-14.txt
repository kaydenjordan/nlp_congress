 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of an  admirable family in my district who has provided decades of service to  their friends and neighbors through the U.S. Postal Service.   John Keller worked at the U.S. Postal Service for 34 years, including  15 years as postmaster of the Ridley Park Post Office.   Now retired, his twin sons, Joe and Mike Keller, have worked for the  U.S. Postal Service for 23 years each and are now both postmasters in  Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District.   Our Postal Service is an essential part of our Nation's  infrastructure. The Postal Service delivers medicine to veterans,  birthday presents from grandma, and, even in this day and age, holiday  greetings from friends across the world.   The Postal Service keeps us connected with our communities, families  and friends, businesses, nonprofits, and public agencies all over the  country, and provides jobs to over 500,000 Americans; 3,000 in  Pennsylvania's Fifth District alone.   We are so grateful to the Keller family and to all of our Postal  Service workers for everything they do for us every day.                            ____________________
