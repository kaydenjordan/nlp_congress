 Madam Speaker, today Congress returns to session after a 6-week break, and I hope we are all motivated by the input we heard  while back home with the same people who sent us here to represent them  in the body.   I am urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put the  partisan rhetoric aside and get to work on delivering results for the  American people.   I ask that we start by addressing the funding of our government via  the appropriations process to ensure we do not have a government  shutdown.   A vast majority of Americans are struggling to make ends meet, and a  lot of those folks are in our Nation's Armed Forces. A shutdown would  only hurt the very people who are putting their lives at risk for all  of us.   Madam Speaker, I am certain that we can all rise above the din of the  media's attempts to influence what comes out of these Chambers.   I believe we can set aside our political differences and work  together for the sake of our country, just as we did 22 years ago  following the tragedies of 9/11.   Let's not forget that in the most solemn times in our Nation, we all  banded together the strongest to advance America's interests.   Madam Speaker, I would like to end with observing a moment of silence  in recognition of all who have fallen due to the unspeakable acts of  September 11, 2001.                            ____________________
