 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call upon my fellow Members  of Congress to support H.R. 1179, which will award the Congressional  Gold Medal to the survivors of the Iran hostage crisis and to the  families of the former hostages who are, sadly, no longer with us.   Over 40 years ago, in November of 1979, protests in the Iranian  capital of Tehran led to crowds storming the United States Embassy and  taking the staff inside as hostages. Fifty-two Americans, made up of  both civilian and military personnel, were made prisoners in our own  embassy and became victims of a terrorist attack upon international  law.   For over a year, the hostages were denied their basic human dignity  with their captors inflicting upon them increasing physical and  psychological torture, to include simulated executions. Madam Speaker,  they would take these hostages and go through the motions of being  executed, often pulling the trigger of an empty gun to instill fear. It  was wrong. These brave Americans held strong throughout their harrowing  ordeal, never once losing faith in each other or that they may return  home to their families again. Their courage and patriotism are an  inspiration to all of us today, just as it was to our Nation 40 years  ago.    Through diplomatic success, all 52 of the hostages were released in  January of 1981, free to return home to their loved ones and their  country, with this January 20 marking the 41st anniversary of their  freedom. Despite that, many of them have not recovered from their  trauma; to this day still haunted by what they had to endure. Alongside  having to carry these burdens for over 40 years, these 52 heroes never  received proper recognition from their government for the sacrifices  they were forced to make in captivity. They are true American heroes,  and it is time that Congress acknowledges them as such, which is why I  call upon my colleagues to support H.R. 1179. The awarding of the  Congressional Gold Medal to the survivors and the families of the  deceased will not only bring justice to these patriots, but also  demonstrate this Nation's commitment to protect those whose human  rights would be violated.   This bipartisan bill is a symbol of our Nation's ability to come  together to honor our heroes; currently there are 145 cosponsors of  this bill with a near even split between Democrats and Republicans.   Additionally, I would like to thank the tremendous efforts of  Commission 52 for helping to spread awareness of this bill and  gathering support for it. Their commitment to righting the wrongs of  over 40 years ago is an inspiration to all.                            ____________________
