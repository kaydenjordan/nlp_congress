 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to moving the previous  question so we can immediately consider my bill, H.R. 4698, the Say No  to Indoctrination Act, which prohibits Federal funds from advancing the  hateful critical race theory concepts.   I grew up in the Deep South during the days of KKK, Jim Crow, and  segregation. I have felt the pain of racism and have seen and  experienced firsthand when people act unjustly toward others due to the  color of their skin. And, yes, it still happens today when individuals  choose hate.   Once an unknown academic theory, the increasingly pervasive CRT says  that racism permanently stains the fabric of American society. The  critical race theorists believe that we are defined solely by our skin  color. They believe that America's institutions preserve white  supremacy. Some even believe that our Nation is hopelessly racist.   To try to make this divisive theory understandable, teachers often  separate students into separate groups based on intrinsic  characteristics like race, color, and national origin. In doing so,  students are taught to judge others based on their appearance. In the  1960s, this was called pure racism.   In the span of a few weeks, Democrats have gone from claiming that  CRT was only a myth to boldly embracing it. They have gone from  dismissing parental objections to endorsing indoctrination in schools  across the country. The American people are right in their distrust.   Make no mistake, I want our students to learn about the hundreds of  moments that shaped us into the country we are today. Students should  learn about slavery and its legacy. Students should learn about the  Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, the  Emancipation Proclamation, Juneteenth, Jim Crow, the Tulsa race  massacre, and the Civil Rights Acts.   They should also be taught and be proud of a Nation that, for over  200 years, has progressed, a country that has shown its commitment to  its mission statement that all men and women are created equal.   We have not always lived up to our ideals but have come closer with  each passing generation in doing so.   Racism exists. I grew up with it and have zero tolerance for bigotry  and hate. More can be done to create a world that teaches greater  tolerance and respects the dignity of every individual, regardless of  race, color, or creed. CRT is not the solution.                                time  1245    It is absolutely wrong and un-American to indoctrinate our children  into believing that because of their skin color, they are forever part  of the oppressed or oppressor class. Hate has no place in our schools,  and CRT has no place in our classes.   We live in a world of imperfect people and in a country that from its  inception understood this. It was, therefore, placed within our mission  statement a goal to grow, to change, and to form a more perfect union.   I choose to believe in a country where we are judged not by the color  of our skin but by the content of our character.   I choose to believe in a country that empowers all individuals to  dream big and to live fulfilling lives.   Madam Speaker, if you share my belief in our great Nation, then you,  too, will vote to defeat the previous question so we can take up and  pass, on behalf of the American people, the Say No to Indoctrination  Act. I urge my colleagues to do the same.
