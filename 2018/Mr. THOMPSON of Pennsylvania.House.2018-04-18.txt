 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my  condolences and my sympathy to the family of former First Lady Barbara  Bush.   Mr. Speaker, the Nation was heartbroken upon hearing the news that  Mrs. Bush passed away last night at her home in Houston. She was 92.   Mrs. Bush was widely admired and a beloved First Lady. She was a  leader not only for her family, but for this Nation.   She served as First Lady from January 1, 1989, to January 1993. She  was known for her immeasurable kindness, yet she wasn't afraid to be  outspoken--even frank--when the occasion called for it.   She was witty and feisty, and above all else, she was Barbara: a  wife, a mother, and a grandmother.   This Nation will remember her as a fiercely and devoted matriarch of  a great American family, but also as an advocate for all American  families.   Mr. Speaker, I leave you with the words of Barbara Bush: ``When all  the dust is settled and all the crowds are gone, the things that matter  are faith, family, and friends.''   May God bless Mrs. Barbara Bush.                            ____________________
