 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 4053,  and I thank Chairman Shimkus for the great leadership he has provided  on this bill on this really significant issue.   This bill authorizes the construction of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear  waste storage site, which would alleviate the burden of incredible risk  that is now borne by communities throughout the country, such as in my  district, where homes are not far located from the closed San Onofre  Nuclear Generating Station.   That, and many other plants throughout the Nation, have closed their  doors in decades. Yet, Congress has yet to agree how to safely store  that waste, and what is really important is we must store the waste.   But while we develop new nuclear energy technologies, that we are  capable of doing, that are safe, and produce less of their own waste,  and can consume the waste of older plants, I reminded Secretary of  Energy Perry of that yesterday; but, in the meantime, until that  technology--by the way, it is sinful that we have not developed that  technology, which we are capable of, that could eat this waste.   But until we do, having safe storage at Yucca Mountain makes all the  sense to me and is safe for my constituents.
