 Mr. President, I would like to take this  opportunity to recognize and congratulate Lt. Gen. Glen W. Moorhead III  on earning the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Air Force  Association.   Wally, as he is known to his close friends and colleagues, is a  native of Arkansas. He has an outstanding record in service to our  Nation's air superiority. He entered the Air Force upon graduation from  the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1969, after which he deployed to Asia and  earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery in the Vietnam  war.   As leadership noticed his ability to push his aircraft to the limit  in combat, they brought him back home to apply those lessons learned in  his A-37 to the Air Force's new platform, the A-10. The A-10 was  effective in military operations and was loved by those on the ground.  Moorhead played a leading role in the validation of the A-10 and  development of the training program, so much so that he led the  inaugural weapons school course on the platform. Moorhead was further  entrusted with leadership of the Air Warfare Center, which in addition  to serving as one of the major testing and evaluation operations of the  U.S. Air Force, is also the home of the revered Thunderbirds. He  ultimately was assigned to serve as deputy commander of U.S. European  Command.   Moorhead's long-lasting impact on the military space community is  evident. While commander of the 50th Space Wing at Schriever Air Force  Base, he was dual-hatted as commander of the Space Warfare Center,  which conducted tactics, techniques, and procedures development for  space operations and has evolved into a significant part of the Space  Force's Space Training and Readiness Command. Not only did he leave a  notable imprint upon those under his command, but his enduring legacy  will continue for generations of Guardians to come.   Perhaps Moorhead's most consequential role, however, has been as key  adviser in the development and standup of the Space Force. No one could  overstate the value of his mentorship to the leaders of the Space Force  as they assess its current and future needs in pursuit of the vital  mission to secure our national interests in, from, and to space.   The sustained record of excellence of Glen Wallace Moorhead has made  our country better and safer, and he is to be commended for his  lifetime of leadership to our Space Force and Air Force.   As the ranking member of the Senate appropriations subcommittee  responsible for ensuring our Armed Forces and their families have the  infrastructure and facilities to support their needs, it is an honor to  recognize Lieutenant General Moorhead on his outstanding impact within  our military.  [[Page S4651]]  Arkansas can be proud of his advocacy and leadership that integrally  contributed to the United States' ability to maintain our military  superiority.   On behalf of the U.S. Senate and a grateful nation, I extend my  deepest appreciation to Lieutenant General Moorhead for his many years  of exemplary military service and sacrifice. I wish him nothing but the  very best in the future.                            ____________________
