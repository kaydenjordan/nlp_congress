 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon on a few matters:  first, Russia and the continuing investigation into Russian  interference in our election and the ties between the Trump campaign,  transition team, and Russia.   The events of this weekend, which included another troubling,  baseless tweet from the President, highlight and, in fact, strengthen  the argument for a special prosecutor to conduct the investigation. And  the American people agree. A CNN/ORC poll this morning showed that  about two-thirds of Americans think a special prosecutor should conduct  the investigation--67 percent of the Independents and even 43 percent  of the Republicans. The trend line suggests these numbers will continue  to grow.   So my Republican colleagues should understand that what they know in  their hearts is the right thing to do. Do a strong, impartial  investigation and get to the bottom of this. That is where the American  people want them to go. The American people disagree with President  Trump and want a thorough and impartial investigation--even 43 percent  of Republicans. They are right.   A special prosecutor is the best way to ensure that an investigation  proceeds impartially for several reasons.   First, by Department of Justice guidelines that are set up for this  purpose, a special counsel is not subject to day-to-day supervision by  the Attorney General--now recused--or anyone else at the Justice  Department. That means the special prosecutor would have much greater  latitude in whom he can subpoena, which questions he can ask, and how  to conduct the investigation. Second, the prosecutor can only be  removed for good cause, such as misconduct, not to quash the  investigation. So there is an insularity there. He or she is protected  if they are moving forward on the investigation. Third, there is built  in congressional oversight. Congress is notified whenever a special  counsel is appointed, removed, or finished with the investigation.  Last, the special counsel has the independence to prosecute not only  the subject of an investigation but anyone who attempts to interfere.   This is the right way to go. Let me quote Attorney General Jeff  Sessions on this issue. Here is what he once said: ``The appropriate  response when the subject matter is public and it arises in a highly- charged political atmosphere is for the Attorney General to appoint a  Special Counsel of great public stature and indisputable independence  to assure the public the matter will be handled without partisanship.''   If there were ever a case that fit exactly what then-Senator, now- Attorney General Sessions called for, this is it.   This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to have a hearing  on the nomination of Mr. Rosenstein to serve as the Deputy Attorney  General. During that hearing, Mr. Rosenstein should commit to naming a  special prosecutor to look into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.  Mr. Rosenstein, by reputation, is a fair man. He is a career  prosecutor. Now that the Attorney General has recused himself, Mr.  Rosenstein, pending confirmation, will have the duty to appoint a  special prosecutor. If he will not appoint a special prosecutor, he  will need a darn good reason. It is hard for me to see one right now.   Whether Mr. Rosenstein will appoint a special prosecutor will be  front and center tomorrow at the Judiciary Committee's hearing and far  and away the most important question he needs to answer. As I mentioned  last week, if, pending confirmation, Mr. Rosensetin delays or refuses  to appoint a special prosecutor, Congress should consider reviving a  narrower version of the independent counsel law.   Also, we should make sure, certain, that the investigation has not  been interfered with thus far. I sent a letter today to the inspector  general of the Department of Justice, Michael Horowitz, which was made  public today, urging him to open an immediate investigation to  determine if anyone has interfered with this investigation up to now,  either attempting to influence the direction of the investigation or  those conducting it.   The Attorney General should have recused himself on day one. I asked  him to do it almost 3 weeks ago, on February 14. We need to know if he  or anyone else has meddled in this investigation in any way. His  misleading statements to the Judiciary Committee about his meetings  with the Russian Ambassador only add suspicion.   Attorney General Sessions has been in charge of this investigation  for 3 weeks. We need to know if he or anyone else did anything in that  time to  [[Page S1591]]  hinder the investigation because it is absolutely critical that we  protect the integrity of this investigation. That means ensuring that  it is completely independent going forward and that nothing has already  occurred that could compromise it. The good news is, the inspector  general can take this investigation on his own and go forward with what  we asked for in the letter on his own. I would urge him to do so.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the second issue I would like to discuss  is the travel ban, the recently issued Executive order on immigrants  and refugees. Now that we have the details, it is clear that while the  administration has made some very minor changes, it has done nothing to  alter the core thrust of the order, which I believe is terribly  misguided and does nothing to address the core concerns of the Ninth  Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled the original order was  potentially unconstitutional.   Moreover, we know that the administration delayed its announcement  and implementation so President Trump could bask in the aftermath of  his joint address. That should be all the proof Americans need to know  that this Executive order has everything to do with optics and nothing  to do with national security. If national security were at stake, it  should not have been delayed a single day.   The truth is, there is very little new or improved about this  Executive order. It is barely a fresh coat of paint on the same car  that doesn't drive. It is still a travel ban. It is still a refugee  ban. It still makes us less safe, not safer, according to not just me  but to Republicans like Senator McCain. It still attempts to turn  innocent immigrants and refugees into scapegoats and still does not do  the things that would actually make us safer, like going after lone  wolves and closing the loopholes in the Visa Waiver Program.   The new Executive order is still mean-spirited, misguided, and, in my  judgment, goes against what America is all about, being a country that  accepts and cherishes immigrants, not disdains them. I fully expect the  President's new Executive order will have the same uphill climb in the  courts that the previous version had.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on the Affordable Care Act. My  Republican friends have repeated the mantra for 7 years, ``Repeal and  replace, repeal and replace.'' It turns out, during those 7 years, they  never came up with a coherent plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.  It was all slogans, no policy.   Now they are scrambling to come up with something. The problem is,  every draft, every leaked detail or outline or list of principles we  have seen is tied together by one common thread: It will raise costs on  average Americans and cut back on their benefits. Average Americans,  under the Republican plan, will pay more and get less.   No wonder they are hiding the plan somewhere in a basement room, even  as they are scheduling markups on the bill for a week from now. They  don't want the folks to see it until the very last minute; just rush it  through. I don't blame them. It is going to be very hard for  Republicans to be proud of this plan, which hurts average Americans,  raising their costs and taking away benefits.   It is the absolute height of hypocrisy to be hiding this plan. My  Republican colleagues complained bitterly, day after day, week after  week, month after month, about not having enough time to read the  Affordable Care Act when it was being debated. At the time, my friend,  the distinguished majority leader, said:         Americans want us to slow down, and Congress is putting its       foot on the accelerator. Americans want to know what this       bill would mean for them, and Congress won't let them read it       before a vote . . . [on a] piece of legislation that will       affect one of the most significant aspects of their lives.       Americans [he continued] have concerns about what they're       hearing, and they are being told to shut up, sit down, and       take the health care we give you.    By keeping their replacement bill under lock and key, only a week  before potentially voting on it, the Republicans are engaging in  enormous hypocrisy--exactly what the majority leader complained about  only a few years ago. Their mantra in past years was always ``read the  bill.'' Now they will not even let us glance at it. Why are they hiding  it? I think I know why. They are not very proud of it. They know it is  not going to work.   They are being pushed blindly forward by their ideologues and their  incessant campaign promises. The American people ought to know how  Republicans plan to drastically reshape this Nation's health care  policy. I suspect Americans will not like it much. I suspect it will  raise costs and cut benefits. I suspect far fewer Americans will get  coverage. I suspect their plan will put the insurance companies back in  charge.   Whatever it does or doesn't do, the American people and their  representatives in Congress, after 7 long years of slogans, ought to  know the true face of ``replace.''   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from  Washington State who has been such a leader on issues like this,  throughout this session of Congress and throughout her entire career.   I want to add a few comments on H.J. Res. 37, which I strongly  oppose. More  [[Page S1601]]  than one in five Americans is employed by a company that has at least  one Federal contract. Unfortunately, every year tens of thousands of  workers are denied overtime wages, not paid fairly because of their  gender or age, or have health and safety put at risk by corner-cutting  contractors. Those contractors who obey the rules are put at a  disadvantage by those who cut corners, and that is what this proposal  that President Obama put into effect was supposed to curb. That was the  rule.   What do we find President Trump and our Republican colleagues doing?  Once again, favoring the special interests, Big Business, over the  working people. As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Warren,  just said: ``This is a debate about whom Congress actually works for.''  The President tries to present himself as a populist favoring working  people. That is in his speeches, but in all of his actions, just about  every single one, when there is a special interest, a business interest  at stake versus a worker interest, he sides with the special Big  Business interests.   The President promised to be a champion for working people in his  inaugural address. An hour later, he signed an Executive order making  it harder for working people to get a mortgage. Last week, the  President made a whole host of claims about what his government would  do only 24 hours after releasing a budget blueprint that would take a  meat ax to the Federal agencies he was talking about. He had this  beautifully sympathetic moment about medical research, and his budget  is going to slash it. He talked about education as a major issue in  America. His budget will slash that.   Again, less than a week after another populist speech to Congress,  the President is doing exactly the opposite of what he said he was  going to do--stick up for working men and women--by signing this  resolution. President Trump promised: I will deliver better wages for  the working class. Well, President Trump, more than 300,000 workers  have been victims of wage-related labor violations while working under  Federal contracts during the last decade. Are you now going to sign a  bill, President Trump, that would make it easier for recidivist Federal  contractors to skirt wage standards and hurt their workers? It sounds  like it to me. This administration's hypocrisy knows no end. It is not  populist. It is not for the working people, not in what they do.    In his joint address to Congress, the President said, he would  ``ensure new parents have paid family leave.'' Now is he going to sign  a bill that makes it easier for companies that violate family leave  laws to win contracts from the Federal Government? If the President was  true to his populist rhetoric, he would say this resolution is dead on  arrival because it hurts the working people. But if past is prologue,  he will not. He will think that his tough talk about standing up for  the working class is enough to cloak a hard-right, pro-corporate, pro- elite agenda.   So I challenge the President: If Republicans pass this resolution,  show some courage and veto it because you are not going to get away  with constantly, constantly saying that you are in favor of working  people and signing legislation that hurts them.   I yield the floor.
