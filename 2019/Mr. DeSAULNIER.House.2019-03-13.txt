 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 208 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 208         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the concurrent resolution       (H. Con. Res. 24) expressing the sense of Congress that the       report of Special Counsel Mueller should be made available to       the public and to Congress. All points of order against       consideration of the concurrent resolution are waived. The       amendments to the concurrent resolution and the preamble       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution shall be considered as adopted. The       concurrent resolution, as amended, shall be considered as       read. All points of order against provisions in the       concurrent resolution, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the concurrent       resolution and preamble, as amended, to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       March 15, 2019, through March 22, 2019--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 208, providing for the consideration  of H. Con. Res. 24, a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that  the report of Special Counsel Mueller should be made available to the  public and to Congress.   The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a closed  rule.   The rule self-executes two amendments to simply clarify that the  resolution is calling for the release of the special counsel's findings  in addition to any report.                                time  1215    It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.   Finally, the rule provides standard recess procedures for the period  of March 15 through March 22.   Mr. Speaker, when the Justice Department named the special counsel  for the Russia investigation, acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  said: ``A special counsel is necessary in order for the American people  to have full confidence in the outcome. Our Nation is grounded on the  rule of law, and the public must be assured that government officials  administer the law fairly.''   This investigation has been about following the facts wherever they  may lead, getting to the truth of Russia's involvement in the 2016  election, and ensuring government is transparent and accountable to the  American public.   This does not predetermine the outcome of that investigation. It  simply expresses that the report of the special counsel should be made  available to Congress and to the American people.   The public, including my constituents in California--our constituents  in California, Mr. Speaker--want to know what happened. Nearly 9 in 10  Americans in both parties say the investigation should produce a full  public report on their findings. Not only do the American people want  to know, but they deserve to know. Congress needs to preserve their  ability to know.   Our election system is an integral part of what makes us the beacon  of Western democracy. Any and all attempts to undermine this system is  an attack on our country's values and cannot be taken lightly.   This is a serious investigation with consequences for our elections,  democracy, government, and the future of this country and democracy  itself. There is no one with more intimate knowledge of Russia's  involvement in our election than the special counsel.   To date, this investigation has resulted in 34 people and three  companies being criminally charged; nearly 200 charges filed; seven  guilty pleas; one conviction following a jury trial; and the  investigation, while costing $25 million, has recovered approximately  $48 million in assets from tax evasion.   Mr. Speaker, eight Federal and congressional intelligence and  national security groups believe Russia interfered  [[Page H2691]]  in our election, with the Central Intelligence Agency, the National  Security Agency, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence concluding that Vladimir Putin personally ``ordered an  influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. Presidential election'' to  ``undermine public faith in the democratic process.''   The last time our country had a special counsel operating under the  same rules as this probe was in 1993 to investigate the Waco siege and  allegations of government wrongdoing. Prosecutors posted their final  report directly on the internet with hundreds of pages of exhibits and  timelines. The American people must receive the same transparency when  this report is released.   I encourage my friends across the aisle to support the release of  this report. We have commitments to support it from three House  Republican leaders, including the minority leader, the minority whip,  and the Republican Conference chair. I hope all my colleagues across  the aisle will join us in this vote to ensure that we are on the record  that we will share one of the most important investigations of our time  within these halls and with all of America.   This is happening on our watch, and it is our job to be faithful to  our oath to defend and uphold democracy. As Justice Brandeis famously  said, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me join with my friend from Georgia in noting how  important it is that you are presiding, my good friend, with lots of  history between the two of us in our political life in California and  our education, I might add to the Jesuits.   I want to say to my good friend, I look at this as one of those  opportunities where we may not get a headline. Unfortunately, too many  of the headlines talk about how divisive it is here. Certainly, there  is a lot of that.   But when I go home and do townhalls--and I do a lot of them in  northern California--when this question comes up about polarization, I  talk about all the times we do work together that don't get out,  certainly, in the headlines, because that is not what sells  advertising, apparently. I think this is one of those moments that we  aspire to that, that we actually aspire that somebody picks up on this;  that all of us, in these extraordinary circumstances, are being  faithful to our oath; that we make sure that the things that may have  happened, that apparently did happen, that the public needs confidence  in us.   When we look every day, including today, at the affronts and the  attacks on so many institutions in America, and this institution having  had challenges, this might be one of those opportunities, at least for  us, to say: We agree. We may have differences of opinion about who did  what, but we have faith.   For me, I think history will say that this special counsel is one of  those providential Americans. With his background, with his  determination to believe in fidelity and truth, we were lucky to have  this person at this point in time.   I put my faith in this institution. I put faith in the special  counsel. In this instance, I hear from you, my friend from Georgia,  that we are going to put our faith in this institution and one another,  that we can show the American people that this is, indeed, more  important than party, and it is more important than any of our  individual political careers.   I did want to mention, Mr. Speaker, that this is a sense of Congress  and that this is not the first time we have brought a resolution like  this to the floor. In fact, just last week, we brought a resolution to  the floor to send a message to the American people that Congress is  united in condemning anti-Semitism and bigotry in all its forms. There  are people who criticized us for bringing that and thought that it was  unnecessary, but we brought that to the floor.   A majority of Republicans joined Democrats, an overwhelming majority,  in voting for it. Leader McCarthy called it a resolution to make a  statement. Whip Scalise said, regarding the resolution, ``We must all  take a strong  [[Page H2692]]  stand against hatred and bigotry wherever we see it, and I am glad this  resolution makes'' sense.   We agree with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that  passing these types of resolutions can make a strong statement.  Although they may seem to some as unnecessary, these statements on  these kinds of important issues, I believe, are very necessary for this  institution to make, particularly when they are bipartisan.   Today, we are letting Attorney General Barr and everyone else know  that we are all united behind one common principle, which I believe he  agreed to in his confirmation hearings, which the Member from Georgia  alluded to. That complete transparency, consistent with law, is vital  to the success of our democracy. The American people deserve to have  access to this report.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished chair of the Committee on  House Administration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and  Administrative Law.    Mr. Speaker, in response to my friend from Georgia, I  want to agree--and maybe we disagree a little bit.   I do think this is important. I think it is the unusual circumstance,  and a lot of things that we have no direct control over have brought us  to this circumstance.   Social media and the use of social media in our elections is  relatively new, coming from the Bay area where so much of the genesis  happened.   So I think it is important, and I do think there is lacking--and  hyperbole is something that sometimes doesn't happen in this Chamber,  but I think it is not a hyperbole to say that the U.S. House of  Representatives, hopefully, unanimously says that the law should be  followed to its letter.   So I think we agree, and I don't want to look for a way to disagree.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Vermont.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for pointing  out that I am not a poker, that I might actually be trying to be  thoughtful. Maybe it is because I was once registered as a Republican.  I don't regularly admit that sometimes, at least not in my district.   But I do think this conversation is important on multiple levels, and  I appreciate the fact that the gentleman is here to present his side of  the aisle's position.   I think there is a danger here for us to resume to our corners, and  this is an instance where I really think it is important--and,  hopefully, it is newsworthy--to the media and to the general public  that we are coming to this moment. Although it is a resolution, I still  think it is significant without indulging in hyperbole.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Perlmutter), my friend and a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, it is a pleasure to see you up there. And to my  friend from Georgia, in his long, illustrious public career, I want to  thank him for his comity here today.   I can't help but think so many Americans now and people who are  filled with adrenaline and hyperbole talk about what a difficult time  this is, and I wouldn't underestimate the challenges ahead of us; but,  arguably, a more difficult time, I was thinking of Mr. Lincoln's  comments about appealing to the better angels of our nature, and  perhaps this is a turning point.   Certainly we will be tested, and we will fail on occasion, but to my  friend, for whatever time both of us have left here, I would like to  personally say to the degree we can find things that are of interest to  your district and my district, they are of interest to the United  States, and I would love to work with the gentleman to find those  things.   Lastly, I just can't help but comment on my observation about  providential Americans in history. I was reading about Mr. Mueller and  his comments when he was FBI Director in the context of his amazing  life and career as a combat veteran, a Bronze Star winner in the Marine  Corps in Vietnam. I think of my own father who was a devoted Marine  Corps combat veteran who is buried in Arlington. My dad and all  marines, although I was not one, liked to always recite ``Semper  Fidelis.''   The special counsel, in his comments when he was FBI Director,  assures me that the work he does in ways that I find profound, talked  about fidelity as he talked to his agents, that the fidelity to this  Constitution, to this country, and to the truth will find us true to  the path that we want to take and to success as we look for the better  angels of our nature.   Mr. Speaker, this is a simple vote but an important vote. We need to  get to the bottom of what happened and put faith in the special  counsel's findings and put faith in the American public and the people  that they can devise their own truth when we give them this  investigation's report.  [[Page H2697]]    Mr. Speaker, you either believe the public and Congress should see  the report or you don't. Fortunately, it looks like we are agreed that  they should. We owe it to our constituents, the American people, and  future generations to do the right thing always, but today, I think, in  particular, to support the release of this report.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on  the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
