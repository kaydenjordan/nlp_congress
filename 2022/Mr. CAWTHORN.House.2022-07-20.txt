 Mr. Speaker, 40 yards, 10 rounds, one man, countless  lives saved. I speak today to acknowledge a new American hero.   Just 2 weeks after Indiana passed a constitutional carry provision,  one man stood tall in the face of imminent death, protecting his loved  ones and his community from evil. Elisjsha Dicken's incredibly quick  and heroic actions are not just to be applauded in the media. They  ought to be used as a blueprint for American citizens who legally carry  nationwide.   There is strong evidence that the best defense an American can  possess is a sidearm and the know-how to use it. Mr. Speaker, law- abiding citizens use firearms to defend themselves against criminals as  many as 2.5 million times a year, or about 6,850 times a day. This  means that, each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often  to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. Moreover,  citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do  every year, as was the case in Greenwood.   The analysis is clear. Law-abiding, gun-toting Americans are the best  line of defense against random acts of mass violence. Make no mistake,  Congress' gun control lobby would have rather taken the handgun from  Elisjsha's hand and replaced it with blood-soaked corpses of many  innocents in Indiana.   Mr. Speaker, I speak for many Americans when I say we will carry; we  will protect ourselves; we will neutralize threats to our safety and  security. We don't need you to defend us. Stop coming for our security.  Stop coming for our constitutionally protected rights. Retire to a nice  seaside estate protected by armed guards and let red-blooded, freedom- loving Americans conceal carry and, when necessary, kill those who  threaten our lives. Remember, you are your own first responder.
