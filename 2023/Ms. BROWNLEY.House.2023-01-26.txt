 Mr. Speaker, how are House Republicans working for  America's working families struggling to make ends meet?   By pursuing an economic scheme that raises their taxes and increases  their everyday costs.  [[Page H350]]    The very first bill that House Republicans passed was a break for tax  cheats that also benefited large corporations and billionaires while  adding $114 billion to the deficit.   Last time Republicans controlled the House, they enacted a $2  trillion tax cut for the 1 percent and big corporations. All the while,  House Democrats continue to work to hold large corporations accountable  and ensure they are paying their fair share.   We are working to strengthen the middle class by creating good-paying  jobs, lowering middle-class taxes, and protecting Social Security and  Medicare because we understand that a strong middle class is essential  to a strong economy, to a strong democracy, and to a strong America.                            ____________________
