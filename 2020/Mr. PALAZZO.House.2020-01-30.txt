 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. McCaul,  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the amendment before us today is another example of  the Democrats' most recent campaign to undermine our military, our  national security, and, as always, President Trump.   Repealing the AUMF of 2002 without a replacement is dangerous, and  the House majority must understand that. If the Democrats choose to  adopt this amendment, it shows our military men and women stationed in  the Middle East that the United States Congress does not have their  backs.   By adopting this amendment, it tells our enemies that they can  continue attacking the United States completely unchecked. It projects  uncertainty and weakness to those who are actively working against us.   The United States must maintain the ability to counter terrorist  attacks, and an active AUMF accomplishes that. This amendment, if  adopted, will only weaken America's defense strategy in the Middle  East.   The AUMF is important and helped lead our military to the defeat of  al-Qaida in Iraq. It continues helping us identify other international  terrorist organizations that want to harm Americans and spread terror  throughout the world.   No one wants endless wars in the Middle East, but we must have the  tools necessary to react in this highly volatile region. We should not  prevent the President from defending Americans from imminent threats.  To do this is reckless and dangerous. Not only will it put our military  at risk, but it will also endanger American civilians.   Keep in mind, we need to fight the global war on terrorism over  there; otherwise, it will end up in our backyards. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on this dangerous resolution.
