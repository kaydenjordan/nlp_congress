 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the majority  is working to pass a tax scam that will raise taxes on my constituents.   For nearly a year, Republicans have promised tax reform that benefits  middle class families. Once again, there is a big difference between  what the majority says and what the majority does.   Instead of being a tax break for middle class Americans, it is a tax  scam that will force hardworking Illinois moms and dads to pay the bill  for tax giveaways to the rich and well connected. That is just wrong.   Mr. Speaker, the American people know it is a scam. A new poll from  Monmouth University found that half of all Americans believe this GOP  tax scam will raise their taxes. These folks are right. It will raise  their taxes, especially for families in Illinois and in the Second  District.   Mr. Speaker, I will never vote to raise my constituents' taxes just  to pay for massive tax giveaways to major corporations and a handful of  superwealthy families.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and stand with America's middle  class and working families, the backbone of our Nation.                            ____________________
