 Mr. Speaker, with John Robert Lewis'  passing, we lose and deeply mourn a great friend and mentor, and the  world loses the most respected ``good trouble'' maker of our time.   John's standing will only grow as his legacy endures.   Mr. Speaker, every year since I have been in Congress, I asked John  to speak to entering high school seniors from San Diego who visited our  Capitol as part of an in-depth civics and leadership program; and for  20 years, with each new group of 45 very diverse students, he gave his  time, his energy, and his wisdom, graciously answering their many  spirited questions. They, too, will never forget him and how he changed  them. Here is just a brief example:    Alejandra Cordova, from 2001, said Mr. Lewis taught her ``not to be  afraid to rock the boat every once in a while.''   David Hickman, from 2015, said he ``truly showed us what it meant to  be a change-maker, to live through our actions and speak up against  injustice.''   He taught our children well.   John, you taught and changed me and everyone you touched. Thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Michael Collins and all of John's staff, who had  the hardest task of all to say to visitors captured by John's words:  ``I am sorry, but the Congressman must depart now.''
