 Madam Speaker, the mass shootings across our country  cry out for solutions that work. The good news is we know what works,  and we also know what doesn't work.   We have been passing gun control laws for more than 50 years. The  number of American households with firearms has dropped significantly  in those years.   So let me ask: Are things getting better or worse?   We know this from decades of experience: Gun control laws are  extremely effective at disarming law-abiding citizens. They are  completely ineffective at disarming criminals, madmen, and terrorists.  They create a world where law-abiding citizens are defenseless and the  gunman is king.   The day after the Uvalde massacre, a criminal with an AR-15-style  rifle shot into a crowd that was gathered for a graduation party in  Charleston, West Virginia. A woman with a concealed weapon shot him  dead on the spot. Nobody else was hurt. Had that occurred on a school  property or other so-called gun-free zone, the death toll could easily  have been counted by the dozens.   The left scoffs at the notion that only a good guy with a gun can  stop a bad guy with a gun.   Well, do they know of any other way?   There is none.   The only question is how long it will take for that good guy with a  gun to show up. It has often been said that the police can be there in  minutes when seconds count. And what we found time and again is that  even when the police get there, they don't always act.   Those who are directly threatened by a gunman are those who are in  the best position to stop such an attack because they are there on the  spot and their lives depend on it. And yet the left won't let them.   We think nothing of seeing an armed guard at a bank or a shopping  mall. They are there to protect our money and our merchandise by  killing bad guys with guns. Yet the left goes berserk when anyone  suggests that we do the same thing to protect our children.   What makes the left believe gun laws will be any more effective at  keeping  [[Page H5339]]  guns out of the hands of criminals than our drug laws have been at  keeping drugs out of the hands of addicts?   The difference is that drug laws don't disarm law-abiding citizens  from defending themselves, their children, and their fellow citizens.  Gun laws do.   The President tells us that hardening our schools isn't the answer.  Well, if he actually meant that, he ought to dismiss the Secret Service  and open the front door of the White House and be sure to declare it a  gun-free zone.   Of course, hardening vulnerable venues like schools works. There is a  reason why 98 percent of mass shootings occur in so-called gun-free  zones: There is nobody there to shoot back, and the criminals know  that. The Buffalo shooter noted precisely that in his manifesto.   The good news is we know what works. Prosecuting gun criminals and  putting them in prison until they are old and gray works. Yet woke  district attorneys across the country refuse to do so. Executing  murderers works. Yet the left has largely succeeded in all but  abolishing the death penalty.                                time  1015    And protecting the right of responsible citizens to return fire  works. It stops an estimated half million to 2 million crimes in this  country every year.   The father of modern policing, Sir Robert Peale, often observed that  the police are simply an extension of community; that, in reality, the  community is the police and the police are the community. Every  citizen, he said, has a right and duty to defend themselves and to  uphold the law. The police are there, not to replace private citizens,  but to support them.   So let me ask, is the surest path out of this violent chapter of our  history the quixotic quest to get 400 million guns off the streets, or  is it to get the criminals who use them off the streets? That is what  we once did, before social justice replaced criminal justice.   We prosecuted gun criminals to the fullest measure of the law. We  executed murderers. We identified the dangerously mentally ill and  confined them so we could treat them. These measures worked until the  left seized control of our cities and reversed them.   I think it is long past time to take those streets back, get the  criminals and dangerously mentally ill off of them, and protect our  children with the same resolve and force as we use to protect our  money.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this is called the Protecting Our Kids  Act, but sadly it does no such thing. The one thing that we could do  immediately to protect our kids is the one thing that the Democrats  refuse even to consider.   We think nothing of it when we see an armed guard at a bank. Well,  they are there for one purpose--to stop anyone who is trying to steal  our money. And, yet, when we suggest that we should use the same force  and resolve to stop someone from killing our children, the left goes  berserk. I simply do not understand such a screwed-up value system as  that.   President Biden's press secretary says that hardening our schools is  not something he supports. Think about that. The most heavily guarded  person in the world in the most hardened fortress in the country is  telling us that we cannot protect our children and our schools as  seriously as we protect our money in our banks. Of course, hardening  the schools works.   Listen to the sick mind that produced the massacre in Buffalo. He  wrote, ``Attacking in a weapon-restricted area may decrease the chance  of civilian backlash. Schools, courts, or areas where CCW are outlawed  or prohibited may be good areas of attack. Areas where CCW permits are  low may also fit in this category. Areas with strict gun laws are also  great places of attack.'' That is the Buffalo shooter. Criminals  understand that even if the Democrats in this House do not.   In committee, I offered an amendment to require schools receiving  Federal security funds to have at least one armed guard on every campus  and to allow school officials who have met the requirements of their  State to carry a concealed weapon to have it on campus to protect their  students if they want to. This is something that can be implemented  immediately and that could well have stopped the massacre at Uvalde.    It doesn't depend on criminals obeying the law, as this bill does. It  doesn't depend on someday, maybe, reducing possibly the 400 million  firearms in this country. It doesn't make self-defense harder for  honest and decent people. In fact, it makes self-defense easier for  honest and decent people. It would make future attacks on our schools  much less likely to succeed and infinitely more dangerous to those  contemplating such an act. Yet, the Democrats refuse to even consider  it.   We know how to reduce gun violence. Harden our schools and protect  our  [[Page H5378]]  children with the same seriousness as we protect our money. Prosecute  gun criminals. Send them to prison for the rest of their lives. Execute  murderers. Confine the dangerously mentally ill so that we can treat  them. Stop letting terrorists into the country across our southern  border.   Yet, woke district attorneys often refuse to prosecute gun criminals  or they quickly drop gun charges to reduce their sentences. The  Democrats have all but abolished the death penalty. They have released  dangerous criminals from our prisons, released dangerous criminal,  illegal aliens into our communities, flooded our streets with the  dangerously mentally ill, and turned a blind eye as terrorists come  across the border that they have left wide open. And then they wonder  why we are plagued with violent criminals.   Maybe it is time to get serious about removing criminals from our  streets and fortifying our schools. That is something we could do today  that will have an immediate effect today.   Protecting Our Kids Act. It does no such thing. It is a tale told by  an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing.
