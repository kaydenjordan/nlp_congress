 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the  Military SAVE Act.   Last year, the Department of Defense reported there were an estimated  20,300 military members who indicated they had experienced a sexual  assault the year prior. Many of these military sexual trauma survivors  expressed concerns that services available within the VA healthcare  system did not meet their post-trauma needs.   This bill will now require the Department of Veterans Affairs to  establish a 3-year pilot program to allow these survivors treatment  related to their injuries from the provider of their choice. Then the  VA will compare the care received from outside providers with the VA so  that they can find ways to provide better care for MST survivors.   Mr. Speaker, anyone who is sexually assaulted should be able to  receive the care that they need, and that stands true for the men and  women protecting our Nation. Members of the military should be  confident in the quality of care they receive from the VA, and this new  bill, when it becomes law, would help the VA to improve the services  that they offer.                            ____________________
