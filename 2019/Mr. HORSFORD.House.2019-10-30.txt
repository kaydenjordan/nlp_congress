 Madam Speaker, across America, seniors and families are  struggling to afford the prescription drugs they need to stay healthy.   One of my constituents, Janet, a senior from Las Vegas, shared with  me her challenges in obtaining her medications. The blood thinners and  cholesterol medications she is prescribed are so expensive that, if it  weren't for samples from her cardiologist, she wouldn't be able to  obtain them at all.   Madam Speaker, seniors like Janet should not have to beg for free  samples for access to the medicine they need. That is why I introduced  the SPIKE Act, to increase transparency; the Capping Drug Costs for  Seniors Act, to cap at $2,000 prescription drug expenses for seniors  under Medicare part D; and why I support H.R. 3, the Elijah Cummings  Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues in this body to come  together, and let's pass H.R. 3 together.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act.   This bill ensures that uranium mining will not irreversibly  contaminate the sensitive habitats and clean water of the Colorado  River watershed, which provides drinking water to nearly 30 million  Americans, including some of my constituents in Nevada.   While uranium and other hard rock mining can help foster economic  activity, as it has done in my home State of Nevada, it can also  threaten community health. In my district, I have seen the impacts that  uranium contamination can have on local communities in the town of  Yerington and the Yerington Paiute Tribe.   For decades, uranium contamination has persisted in this area,  endangering the health of my constituents and forcing families to stop  drinking from their taps, literally having to rely on bottled water.  Sadly, cleanup of this site and others like it often takes much longer  than it should, leaving families to choose between leaving their homes  or living amongst health hazards.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to work on this bill to support  this legislation in a bipartisan tradition and to vote to protect the  Grand Canyon region and Colorado River watershed from the damaging  impacts of uranium mining.
