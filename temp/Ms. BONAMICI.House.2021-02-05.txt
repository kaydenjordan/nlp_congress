 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan  National Apprenticeship Act, which I am honored to co-lead with  Chairman Scott.   Last summer, I held a roundtable discussion with apprentices and pre- apprentices from around northwest Oregon. I spoke with Melissa, who  said that joining the Boilermakers Local 242 apprenticeship was a  ``life-changing decision.'' And Lacy, who talked about her  apprenticeship with Laborers Local 737; she said it ``made it possible  to pay my bills and feed my kid.''   By supporting the National Apprenticeship Act, we will help more  workers like Melissa and Lacy gain the skills and support services they  need to provide for themselves and their families.   As our Nation recovers from the economic consequences of the  pandemic, registered apprenticeships provide especially meaningful  upskilling and reskilling opportunities for displaced and dislocated  workers to help them secure good-paying jobs.   I am glad that my bipartisan PARTNERS Act is included to help small  and medium-sized businesses develop registered apprenticeships and  provide workers with support services like tools, work attire,  transportation, childcare, and mentorship.   The legislation we pass today will help more Oregonians and Americans  get the skills they need to succeed.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National Task  Force on Tradeswomen's Issues in support of the National Apprenticeship  Act.   [From the National Task Force on tradeswomen's Issues, Jan. 28, 2021]     Comments of the National Taskforce on Tradeswomen's Issues on the                National Apprenticeship Act Reauthorization         The National Taskforce on Tradeswomen's Issues (TWTF) is a       national coalition of women's organizations and tradeswomen       whose mission is to create access, opportunity and equity in       nontraditional employment and training for women. TWTF very       much appreciates the reauthorizing of the National       Apprenticeship Act (NAA) of 2021 (H.R. 447) in a way that       best protects apprentices and best serves other stakeholders       in the apprenticeship system. In particular, TWTF is deeply       grateful for the careful attention that H.R. 447 pays to       enhancing opportunities for women and people of color--      populations that have historically been too often unfairly       denied such opportunities because of their gender, race, or       ethnicity--to gain access to and retain high-skill, high-wage       jobs through registered apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeships,       and youth apprenticeships. TWTF is also highly appreciative       of the significant investments that H.R. 447 makes to the       national apprenticeship system.        Our organizational members, such as Chicago Women in the       Trades, Oregon Tradeswomen Inc., Tradeswomen, Inc. (in       Northern California), ANEW (in Washington State),       Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) (in New York City),       and Nevada Women in Trades currently operate, and for years       have operated, pre-apprenticeship programs and other programs       for encouraging women's participation in the trades and in       other occupations in which women have not traditionally       worked. Together we have over 152 years of combined       experience in operating such programs.        Our organizational members also provide a wide range of       technical assistance services and resources that support       apprenticeship programs, employers, training providers and       the workforce system in enhancing equity for diverse       apprentices and potential apprentices through the National       Center for Women's Equity in Employment and Apprenticeship.       This technical assistance includes EEO planning guidance,       toolkits, best practice briefs, curriculum, staff training,       replicable program models, and other resources and strategies       that have proven successful in attracting and retaining women       in these fields. (The National Center for Women's Equity in       Employment and Apprenticeship was funded until 2020 in part       by a contract with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Office       of Apprenticeship (OA).)        TWTF's individual members--current and former tradeswomen--      have, in our scores of years of lived experience in all       aspects of apprenticeship and employment in the trades, seen       it all. A number of these individuals also serve in       leadership positions within apprenticeship programs and their       sponsors  [[Page H411]]       and have intimate knowledge of registration, especially as it       relates to EEO/AA. We have known the exhilaration of       acquiring mastery of skills, the sense of accomplishment of       working with the tools, the pride of being part of building       something tangible and important, the comfort of genuine       mentoring and support from our co-workers and colleagues, and       the satisfaction of supporting our families with a living       wage and real benefits. We have also known the financial       struggle of being ``last hired, first fired'' and the sting       and humiliation of hazing, harassment, and discrimination.       Many, many of us have had successful careers in the trades;       many others have been unable to continue in those occupations       due to discrimination or other barriers. Indeed,       historically, tradeswomen have been at the forefront of work       to change conditions that prevent women from being fully       integrated into well-paid, blue-collar jobs.        These comments are informed by the experiences of both our       organizational and individual members.        TWTF is pleased to support H.R. 447 in general. In       particular, we support the bill's incorporation of certain       nondiscrimination and affirmative action standards for       apprenticeship programs currently codified in 29 CFR part 30;       the requirement that funded entities devote a minimum of 5       percent of grant funds to direct financial assistance to       apprentices, pre-apprentices, or youth apprentices for       supportive services; and the significant investments that the       bill makes in registered apprenticeship, preapprenticeship,       and youth apprenticeship programs and technical assistance to       make progress on equity and inclusion for women and people of       color.        However, we do have some critical concerns about some of       the language in the bill. For example--        Unlike current law, the bill does not clearly and       unambiguously require registered apprenticeship programs       (RAPs) to set goals for the proportions of their apprentices       who are women, Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and       other racial categories that reflect those each of those       groups' proportions among the people in the areas they       recruit from who meet the minimum qualifications for the       apprenticeship. Nor does it clearly and unambiguously require       RAPs to take steps to target their recruitment, hiring, and       retention practices to the underrepresented group(s) if they       fail to meet those goal(s).        The bill is subject to the interpretation that it       completely preempts continuation or reinstatement of the       positive requirements that are in 29 CFR 30, the current law       but not clearly included in H.R. 447.        Some of the requirements for pre-apprenticeship programs       contained in H.R. 447 were designed for registered       apprenticeship programs but are not appropriate for pre-      apprenticeship programs.        Some of the conditions on grants to be awarded under the       bill may make it difficult for pre-apprenticeship programs to       receive funding under the bill.        We plan to work provide more detail on these concerns as       the bill moves forward in the Senate, and will ask that       Congress address them before the bill becomes law.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for his leadership.
