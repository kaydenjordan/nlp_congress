 Madam Speaker, consumer prices climbed another 1.3 percent  last month, bringing the Nation's total annual rate of inflation to 9.1  percent. The cost of making goods shot up, too. The producer price  index hit a whopping 11.3 percent. It is costing Tennesseans and all  American families an extra $5,000 a year.   There seems to be a growing consensus that we are heading toward a  recession. I continue to believe that it didn't have to be this way.  The Fed wouldn't have to raise interest rates had President Biden and  Congressional Democrats resisted the urge to borrow and spend trillions  and trillions of dollars we did not have and couldn't afford to spend.   What is their solution for getting us out of this mess? Even more  spending.   But only increasing domestic production of our natural energy  resources can get us back on track. President Biden appears to prefer  the destruction of our country's fossil fuel energy industry rather  than using it to bring the price of gasoline and diesel back down.                            ____________________
