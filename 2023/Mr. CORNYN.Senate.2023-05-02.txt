 Mr. President, as we all have observed in recent years,  we have witnessed a deeply concerning string of attacks, verbal and  otherwise, against Federal judges. I am not talking about fiery  speeches or statements by activists and organizations that happen to  disagree with a particular ruling. That is their right under the First  Amendment to the Constitution. What I am talking about are physical  threats, including those from elected officials who want to control  another branch of government and because they don't like the decisions  that the judiciary is handing down in a given case.   A few years ago, five of our Democratic colleagues filed a friend of  the Court brief in the Supreme Court on a case involving gun rights.  These Senators made a not-so-subtle threat to the Justices that unless  the Court ruled in a certain way, the entire institution could be,  quote, ``restructured.'' Some might call that coercion or intimidation.   Last year, one of our Democratic colleagues took another jab, calling  the Supreme Court's conservative majority ``stolen,'' ``illegitimate,''  and ``far right.''   But without a doubt, one of the most shocking and reckless examples  of what I am talking about occurred 4 years ago with New York's senior  Senator, now the majority leader of the United States Senate. As the  Supreme Court considered an abortion case, the Democratic leader went  to the steps of the Supreme Court and threatened two Supreme Court  Justices by name if they did not rule a certain way. He said:         I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to tell you, Kavanaugh:       You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.       You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these       awful decisions.    Now, it might be more understandable if these words were said by some  person on the street who didn't have the sort of education and  background and responsibilities of the majority leader of the United  States Senate, but coming from the leader of this institution, those  words were shocking and reckless and even dangerous.   I hope it doesn't come as a surprise to the majority leader that when  he talks, people listen. That is true for Senators in this Chamber. I  know sometimes we think nobody is listening to what we say, but when we  say something like that, people do listen. I have no doubt that some  heard Senator Schumer issue unveiled threats against Supreme Court  Justices, and they viewed that as permission to take action on their  part--for example, the individual who was prepared to assassinate  Justice Kavanaugh. No doubt this person of unstable mental mind heard  some of the rhetoric and was moved to action. Thank goodness for the  law enforcement officials who were able to interdict him.   Last summer, as the Supreme Court considered another case involving  abortion rights, an organization released the home addresses of the  Supreme Court Justices, some of whom still have young, school-age  children at home. They encouraged protesters to show up at the  Justices' homes to harass and intimidate them, which just so happens to  be a Federal crime. It was a disgusting breach of privacy and a massive  security risk for these members of the Court and their families.   It was sadly met with nothing more than a shrug by some of our  Democratic colleagues. The Senate majority leader said he is  comfortable with protests happening outside of the Justices' homes,  even though it is a Federal crime.   The White House confirmed that President Biden believes this is a  constitutional right, to protest, even though it is a Federal crime.  President Biden and Attorney General Garland have not seen fit to bring  any charges against these protesters for their attempts to intimidate  members of the Supreme Court at their homes at all times of the day and  night. In fact,  [[Page S1457]]  some sources indicate that the Garland Department of Justice was  discouraging U.S. marshals, who were ostensibly there to protect the  Justices and their families, discouraging them from actually making  arrests.   For the Justices and their families, this was not a peaceful exercise  of these protesters' First Amendment rights; these were moments of  complete fear.   A few weeks ago, Justice Alito--one of those members of the Court-- spoke to the Wall Street Journal about this period of intimidation,  saying that Justices who were believed to be in the majority were what  he called ``targets of assassination,'' no doubt referring to what  happened or what nearly happened to Justice Kavanaugh. He said: ``It  was rational for people to believe that they might be able to stop the  Supreme Court decision in Dobbs--that is the abortion decision  involving the Mississippi law. He said: ``It was rational for people to  believe that they might be able to stop the decision in Dobbs by  killing one of us.'' As we know, there was an incredibly close call.   When the man who said he intended to kill Justice Kavanaugh was  arrested, he had a Glock 17 semiautomatic pistol. He had ammunition. He  had a knife. He had a hammer, crowbar, and zip ties. He told  authorities that his plan was to break into the house, kill Justice  Kavanaugh, and then commit suicide. Thank God he was caught before  anyone was harmed.   This should serve as a clear warning that it is time to lower the  temperature. When angry mobs gather on the Justices' front lawns and  members of the High Court feel like there is a bounty on their heads,  something needs to change. But instead of backing off, some of our  colleagues appear to be doubling down.   Earlier this year, the senior Senator from Oregon delivered an  incredibly dangerous speech here on the floor of the Senate advocating  that the Biden administration actually ignore a potential court order  that he disagreed with. This was a senior Member of the legislature,  the Senate of the United States--the world's greatest deliberative  body--instructing the executive branch to disregard an expected order  from a sitting Federal judge. That is, in effect, ripping the  Constitution into shreds and throwing it out the window. The remedy for  a decision that a judge hands down that you disagree with is to appeal  that decision. That is the remedy.   But now some of our colleagues have escalated their threats beyond  mere rhetoric. Fifteen of our Democratic colleagues recently wrote a  letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations  subcommittee that is responsible for funding the Supreme Court. They  recommended cutting the Supreme Court's budget if it fails to meet  their demands to implement a preferred code of ethics. In short, they  wanted to use the power of the purse to, frankly, coerce a coequal and  separate branch of government. The Founders must have been rolling over  in their graves.   The threat doesn't just raise separation of powers concerns; it also  raises serious security risks. It has been less than a year since  Justices watched mobs of angry protesters assemble on their front lawns  and an assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh was narrowly averted.   In light of those security threats, the Senate unanimously passed a  bill that I introduced, along with Senator Coons of Delaware, to extend  security protection to the Justices' families. We unanimously passed  that.   How quickly some of our colleagues seem to have forgotten the dangers  that Supreme Court Justices face every day. Threatening to defund the  Supreme Court and its police protection in an enhanced threat  environment is incredibly irresponsible.   Sadly, the attacks on America's independent judiciary, our crown  jewels, doesn't end there. Last week, the majority leader sent a letter  to the chief judge for the Northern District of Texas to try to  intimidate him into doing what the majority leader wants. The Senator  from New York, Senator Schumer, is unhappy with the way some of those  judges have ruled in recent cases in the Northern District of Texas, so  he believes he should determine how cases are assigned in the Northern  District of Texas.   This new approach certainly is more nuanced than going to the steps  of the Supreme Court to issue direct threats that ``you won't know what  hit you,'' but his demand is the same: Do what I want or there will be  consequences.   Of course, this was made without any consideration for what is best  for the functioning of the courts, access to justice for private  litigants and indigent defendants, and the importance, again, of  protecting the independence of the judiciary.   Years ago, Justice Scalia wrote that it is one thing to have a  parchment Constitution, one that offers all sorts of protection. He  said that, in fact, the former Soviet Union had one of the best  Constitutions on paper of any country in the world. But the difference  between the Soviet Union and the United States of America is that we  have an independent judiciary, a coequal branch of government.   I am reminded of something Chief Justice John Roberts said a few  years ago about our independent judiciary. He said:         We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or       Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of       dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to       those appearing before them.    I agree with the Chief Justice, but apparently the majority leader  does not agree. He wants the chief judge for the Northern District of  Texas to somehow reassign cases in a way to make sure that Biden judges  or Obama judges get those cases and certainly not Trump judges or Bush  judges. This turns the whole idea of an apolitical judiciary on its  head, and it undercuts the legitimacy, in the eyes of most people, of  what that separate branch of government is doing.   We need an independent branch of government to enforce the  Constitution and to say, as Chief Justice Marshall said in Marbury v.  Madison--I think it was 1804--that it is emphatically the duty of the  Supreme Court to say what the law is, and they do that by interpreting  the Constitution.   The majority leader has even threatened congressional action if the  chief judge fails to meet his demands. But I would encourage the chief  judge of the Northern District to do what Chief Justice Roberts did  when he was invited to attend the circus that was the Senate Judiciary  Committee hearing this morning; that is, respectfully decline.   We are not here to bully any judge into doing what the majority  leader wants or what any of us want, which would ultimately undermine  the legitimacy of the court because they don't like some of the  rulings. Again, the remedy for a ruling and a decision you don't like  is an appeal. It happens every day across the country.   Our Founders deliberately designed the Federal Government with three  separate but coequal branches. Through this system of checks and  balances, they sought to prevent any one branch from forcing another to  bend to its will.   Unfortunately, many in today's Democratic Party are trying to blur  the line between the legislative and judicial branches and act as if  the judges are supposed to be partisan players. It doesn't matter what  case is before a court or what the ruling ultimately is. Elected  officials must lead by example and support the independence of the  judiciary and, certainly, not actively attempt to undermine and subvert  the legitimacy of the courts.   I can't count the number of times I have disagreed with a court  ruling, but I have never suggested that the judge or judges deciding  the cases were illegitimate. I have never threatened judges with  violence if they reach a decision I don't like, and I certainly have  never advocated for defunding the judiciary if a judge fails to deliver  my preferred outcome.   As Justice Scalia said, an independent judiciary is the crown jewel  of our Constitution and is absolutely essential to our democracy.   And, while judges' decisions may not always be popular, they should  be given due respect. The defamation and intimidation of Federal judges  is dangerous both to the judges themselves and to the health of our  constitutional democracy.   It is time to lower the temperature and show respect for our  Constitution, which means to show respect for the independence of the  Federal judiciary.  [[Page S1458]]    I yield the floor.
