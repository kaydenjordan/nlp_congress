 Madam President, economic data continue to confirm  what we have been hearing from American workers and job creators for 2  years now: This is a pro-worker, pro-family, pro-opportunity economic  moment. Hardly a day goes by without new headlines highlighting the new  prosperity in communities that the last administration's policies  overlooked and the red-hot market for American workers.   Since January 2017, Republican policies have focused on letting the  American people control more of their own money and letting American  businesses create jobs more easily.   So what are the results? On our watch, unemployment has fallen to  near 50-year lows and stayed there. Underemployment has fallen too.  Wages are growing. Month after month, we have had more job openings  nationwide than Americans looking for work. Specifically, there are  currently about 1.6 million more job openings than Americans looking  for work, the widest margin ever recorded.   Now, these aren't Washington accomplishments. They are the American  people's accomplishments, but public policy can certainly change the  conditions. Government can either create the conditions that help lead  to success or to stagnation.   For example, bad public policies under the Obama administration help  to explain why the insufficient and unfair economic ``recovery'' left  so many places behind. High taxes, heavy regulation, and a hostile  climate for business--these things all add up. They took a real toll in  many places.   Take my home State of Kentucky, for example. Kentucky is proud of our  diverse economy. We are proud of our great healthcare and aviation  sectors. We are proud that we are a tourist destination. It turns out  that Bourbon and horse races are a winning combination.   We also take huge pride in the kinds of industries that liberal  policies tend to either forget about or actively work against. I am  talking about manufacturing and agriculture and mining and coal-fired  electricity--the things that keep the lights on in America's heartland.  We could not be prouder of the huge role these sectors play in our  Commonwealth.   So it is not surprising that leftwing policies dreamt up in places  like New York and San Francisco, for places like New York and San  Francisco, were not too kind to Kentucky--growth that was too slow,  jobs that were hard to come by. Some so-called experts said it was just  the ``new normal,'' but we knew better. We knew Kentucky could get back  on track if we could only get a fair shot and fewer hurdles from  Washington. We needed the government to stop creating headwinds and  maybe even create a few tailwinds. That is exactly what happened over  the last 2\1/2\ years.   Since January 2017, Republicans in Congress have partnered with the  Trump administration to get our Nation's opportunity economy going and  growing again--for everyone. We passed the first comprehensive overhaul  of the Federal Tax Code in more than a generation. We cut regulations  that had reduced liberty and stifled our competitiveness. We helped  American workers and entrepreneurs hang up a big, bright neon sign  saying ``Open for Business.'' And--no surprise here--working Americans  have taken the ball and they have run with it.  [[Page S4830]]    I have already read the national statistics. I am even prouder about  this. Instead of being left behind, Kentucky is helping to lead the  charge. The State's unemployment rate has hit and sustained its lowest  level on record. Again, that is recordbreaking low unemployment.   Last year, Governor Bevin helped Kentucky to welcome more than $5.3  billion of planned business investment. This new growth isn't just  concentrated in urban areas. Rural communities in the Bluegrass are  seeing more jobs, investment, and expansion as well.   Of course, it takes more than 2 years to unwind the mistakes of the  past. Parts of Kentucky are still struggling from the effects of  liberal policies, and this Republican Senate, the administration, and  leaders in Frankfort are laser-focused on continuing to invest in and  fight for recovery.   In many communities, particularly in rural Kentucky, the lingering  pain has been hard to shake--the damage to the coal industry, the  devastation caused by opioid and substance abuse. So more work is  certainly needed, and I am honored to lead the charge in Washington to  help Kentuckians confront these challenges.   Through programs like the Appalachian Regional Commission and the  abandoned mine land pilot program, we are investing hundreds of  millions of dollars into struggling areas and out-of-work Americans. In  Eastern Kentucky, Congressman Hal Rogers and I have partnered with  local organizations to secure Federal resources for everything from  skills training to water infrastructure improvements.   I have helped to secure tens of millions of dollars to aid the  retraining efforts of the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment  Program and job-creating programs like the Kentucky Highlands Community  Development Corporation. We have also secured grants to bolster good  jobs, support the environment, attract tourism, and promote healthy  lifestyles.   These are just a few examples from just one State. There are stories  like this all over our country. While the previous administration left  these men and women behind, Republicans recognize their skills and  their drive. We are investing in their futures.                            ____________________     Madam President, speaking of economic growth and  development, the Senate will soon turn our attention to a number of  bilateral tax treaties with important U.S. trading partners. We have  these kinds of agreements in place to reduce tax evasion, tax  avoidance, and unfair double taxation of U.S. citizens and businesses  who conduct businesses overseas. The four we will consider this week  are agreements with Spain, Switzerland, Japan, and Luxembourg.   The U.S. Government and each of these foreign governments have  painstakingly negotiated updates to existing agreements about how  certain kinds of commerce would be taxed and which country will tax  them. In short, Senate ratification of these protocols would mean less  confusion, more certainty, and, often, fewer taxes for U.S. job  creators--and, by the way, a simpler rule book for overseas investors  who want to invest their money here. Fairer treatment for our own  American job creators and more enticement for foreign investment to  head to our country--that is what we would call a win-win.   We are talking about a serious economic impact. In addition to the  four countries we are tackling this week, there are three more nations  with tax treaties pending which I know the administration is continuing  to work on with the Foreign Relations and Finance Committees to  finalize work on these remaining agreements.   Combined, these seven foreign countries invest more than $1.2  trillion in the United States. That is more than $1 trillion in foreign  investment and, by some estimates, hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs  are tied up, either directly or indirectly, in trade with these  countries.   These trading relationships touch all 50 States. Every one of my  colleagues is familiar with communities that benefit from the foreign  investment. For my part, that includes thousands of workers in  Kentucky.   One major manufacturer with ties to Spain employs 1,500 people in my  State. It accounts for more than one third of all the stainless steel  produced in the United States every year. Over the three decades it has  operated in Carroll County, the surrounding communities benefited from  more than $60 million in tax revenue.   That is just one of many job creators in my home State, and it is far  from the only one with a serious interest in seeing these measures get  across the finish line. From consumer goods makers to industrial  suppliers, Kentucky continues to welcome job-creating investment from  around the world.   I think practically every American is familiar with Hot Pockets, a  culinary staple of busy families, workers, and college students  everywhere. But not everyone knows that, as of several years ago, every  single Hot Pocket is cooked in Mount Sterling, KY. The facility employs  more than 1,000 Kentuckians. The parent company is Nestle, based in  Switzerland. So there are not only hard-working Kentuckians but also a  lot of hungry consumers across the country who can understand why we  need to keep our international trade in sync.   Passing these agreements will help every State to keep up the  economic momentum. It will reinforce the international trade that is so  essential to our economic success and help stave off further trade  disruptions. I urge all of our colleagues to join me in voting for  these this week.                            ____________________
