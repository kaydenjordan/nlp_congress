 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Affordable Insulin Now Act which would cap  [[Page H4044]]  out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 per month and help fight the scourge  of diabetes.   In 2019, as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I organized  meetings with leading insulin producers to confront them about the  strain their prices are putting on the American people.   In each of those meetings, I said the same thing; that for millions  of Americans, including a disproportionate number of Latinos, access to  affordable insulin is a matter of life and death.   And for me and many of us, those aren't just numbers. Four months  before I graduated from college in 1996, my grandmother died of  complications from diabetes. If we fail to bring down the price of  insulin, more families will suffer just like mine did.   But our responsibility is to all our constituents, not just those  with insurance. So I co-sponsored Representative Doggett's amendment to  extend the benefits of this bill to the uninsured, and I hope we will  make that happen in the days to come.   But this bill is an important step forward, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.
