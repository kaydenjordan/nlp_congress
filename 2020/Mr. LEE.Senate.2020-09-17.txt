 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, tomorrow marks an important day in our  Nation's history--the birth of the U.S. Air Force.   For 73 years, countless brave American women and men have protected  our liberty and our homeland from the skies. They have embarked on air  combat missions, guarded our bases and missile sites, and undertaken  heroic rescues. They have flown, fought, and won in the air on behalf  of our great country. This year also marks another important  anniversary in my home State--the 80th year of Hill Air Force Base's  service to that mission.   In 1939, Congress approved the construction of an air depot in  Northern Utah. The following year, on January 12, the surrounding  community came together and broke ground to create what is now known as  Hill Air Force Base. Ever since then, it has played an invaluable role  in building up our Air Force and supporting our air men and women  throughout World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the conflicts that we  still face today.   Tucked between the beautiful Wasatch Mountains on the east and the  Great Salt Lake on the west, Hill Air Force Base is today home to  22,000 U.S. military personnel. It is the largest single-site employer  in the State of Utah--providing nearly $1.5 billion in jobs each year,  with an overall economic impact of about $3.7 billion annually. Hill  houses and ensures mission readiness for some of our best and brightest  personnel, including the 75th Air Base Wing, the 388th Fighter Wing,  and the 419th Reserve Fighter Wing.   It is also home to the Ogden Air Logistics Complex, which repairs and  maintains some of our most cutting-edge aircraft, including the F-22  Raptor, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the A-10 Thunderbolt II, the T-38  Talon, and, of course, the F-35A Lightening II, the most advanced  fighter jet in the world.   The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center on Hill has since 1959 been  responsible for supporting the Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic  Missile program, the ground-based leg of our nuclear triad.   Just a short distance west of the base, the Utah Test and Training  Range contains the largest block of special-use airspace in the  continental United States. The range provides an ideal location for the  testing and evaluation of weapons and training grounds for combat,  ensuring that our airmen are prepared to win any conflict we enter into  with decisive and conclusive airpower.   There is no question that Hill Air Force Base oversees vital national  security assets for the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force and our country  are better off as a result of its existence. Yet there is something  even more important that makes Hill the exceptional place that it is,  and that is its people. The patriotism, work ethic, and community  support are unmatched anywhere else in the country--or in the world for  that matter.   Every commander who serves a 2-year rotation at Hill always says the  same thing--that the community's support is stronger at Hill Air Force  Base than at any other base where any one of them happens to have  served.   I am proud to say that, in Utah, we go above and beyond to aid our  military and to support their families, as well we should. According to  the 2019 ``Support of Military Families'' report, Utah ranks among the  top destinations for military families transitioning to a new duty  station. Two of the three highest ranking Air Force installations are  in Utah--Hill Air Force Base and the Roland R. Wright Air National  Guard Base in Salt Lake City.   The key reason for this has been Utah's work to improve professional  license reciprocity for military spouses. Among the many challenges  that military families face, one of the greatest is that spouses  working in fields requiring occupational licenses often suffer huge  setbacks as a result of the barriers put in place by these occupational  licensing regimes in the various States.   Faced with a 50-State patchwork quilt of licensing laws, these  spouses are forced to spend thousands of dollars and sometimes  thousands of hours on top of those thousands of dollars just to obtain  licensure every single time they move to a new State, even if they  [[Page S5709]]  have previously acquired years or even decades of experience in  licensure in another State. Oftentimes, by the time the new license in  the new State and in the new duty station has been processed, it is  already time for the family to move, yet again, for the next military  assignment.   This isn't fair. It is not right. It is not how we ought to treat the  families of our brave military men and women.   The Department of Labor estimates that 13 percent of military spouses  are unemployed, and a more recent Department of Defense study put the  rate even higher, at 24 percent. This, needlessly and unjustly, burdens  military members and their families. In some instances, it prevents  servicemembers from reenlisting, and, in others, it prevents spouses  from entering their desired fields in the first place.   Thankfully, some States have already taken steps to move forward in  the right direction. They have already stepped up to the plate to  address this problem in a meaningful way. In fact, thanks to the  diligent work of two prominent Utah lawmakers, Senator Todd Weiler and  State Representative Brian Greene, my home State has been one of the  first to allow licensure reciprocity for military spouses as long as  they meet certain established criteria.   I commend Senator Weiler and Representative Greene for their efforts,  and I am encouraged to see other States following the example set by  Utah.   The Federal Government has a role to play here, too. While  occupational licensing is a field that is generally controlled by the  State, we have a role to play insofar as the activities of the States.  The regulations imposed by the States end up impacting our military  families. Military readiness and talent retention, as well as movement  of our troops across the Nation and throughout the world, fall under  the oversight responsibilities of Congress. We at the national level  should be doing everything in our power to ensure that licensing laws  are friendly and flexible and certainly not hostile to or prohibitive  of the activities of military spouses and their families.   That is why I am introducing the Military Spouse Licensing Relief  Act. This bill will simply ensure that, when servicemembers are  relocated on military orders, their spouses can receive reciprocity for  professional licenses across State lines regardless of where within the  United States they might be reassigned.   In order to receive reciprocity under this bill, a license would have  to be in good standing, according to the requirements of the  jurisdiction that issued the license in the first place, and the spouse  must still comply with the State's standards of practice, of  discipline, and the fulfillment of any continuing education  requirements.   As a State function, protected under principles of federalism and  explicitly by the Tenth Amendment, the bill does nothing to preempt the  State's rightful authority to set licensing standards within each  State.   We owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who give so  much to protect our Nation, whether on the land, the seas, or in the  skies. This bill is a simple, just, constitutionally sound solution  that will lessen some of the burden placed on them. It will not fix all  of the problems, and it will not make easy all of the sacrifices that  are made by our military spouses and their families, but it will make  some of it easier. That is the least we can do.   As we commemorate the birthday of the Air Force and the anniversary  of Hill Air Force Base this week, this bill's passage is the least we  can do for our military and their families. We need to get this passed.  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in securing its immediate  passage                                  ______                                         By Mr. COTTON:   S. 4609. A bill to withdraw normal trade relations treatment from,  and apply certain provisions of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to,  products of the People's Republic of China, and to expand the  eligibility requirements for products of the People's Republic of China  to receive normal trade relations treatment in the future, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
