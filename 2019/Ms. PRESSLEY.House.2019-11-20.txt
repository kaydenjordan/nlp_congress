 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of the Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Rita  Hester, a Black transgender woman killed in the Massachusetts Seventh  District, for whom Transgender Day of Remembrance was established in  1999.   I rise today because, 20 years later, many more lives continue to be  stolen. This year, we have been robbed of at least 22 transgender  people because of hate, fear, and vitriol--22 souls, the majority of  whom are Black transgender women; 22 people whose families, friends,  and partners are forever marred by grief; 22 experiences of secondhand  trauma for transgender people everywhere.   Among them we remember: Dana Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon,  Claire Legato, Muhlaysia Booker, Michelle ``Tamika'' Washington, Paris  Cameron, Chynal Lindsey, Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn Lindsey,  Denali Berries Stuckey, Tracy Single, Bubba Walker, Kiki Fantroy,  Jordan Cofer, Pebbles LaDime ``Dime'' Doe, Bailey Reeves, Bee Love  Slater, Jamagio Jamar Berryman, Itali Marlowe, and Brianna ``BB'' Hill.   May they rest in peace and power.   Today, we remember still others not included on this list because  their missing persons reports remain uninvestigated or because they are  misgendered and deadnamed after their death because the people closest  to them refused to recognize their truths.   We remember those who die from preventable illnesses, poverty, and  violence as a result of discrimination in healthcare, employment,  education, and housing.   We remember transgender women Johana Medina and Layleen Polanco,  victims of an unjust and cruel immigration and criminal legal system.   Mr. Speaker, colleagues, the transgender community deserves to be  seen safe and celebrated. However, due to this administration's  policies that continue to neglect, unfairly target, and commit violence  against them, this is not the case.   However, so as not to define the transgender community only by their  trauma, today, I also rise to lift the talents and strengths of this  community.   I honor you, my transgender friends, for your bravery to honor your  truths, for intentionally creating a beautiful and rich community, and  for being role models as leaders of social change.  [[Page H9111]]    I stand before you committed to listening to your needs, to  recognizing and centering transgender lives, not just today but every  day, and to being your partner in ending this devastating crisis.   Last week, I introduced the People's Justice Guarantee, a resolution  that reaffirms our collective right to live free from injustice. I rise  today resolved in the fight to ensure our rights to dignity,  liberation, and justice--justice for transgender people, justice for  all in America.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from the  great State of California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those powerful  words. Like the gentleman, I agree that we cannot say those names  enough.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from the  great State of Missouri (Mr. Cleaver).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words and  for telling us more about those we were prematurely robbed of all that  they had to contribute to this world. It is important that we continue  to bring their names into this well, into this august institution, so  that we are compelled to continue to do this work, understanding that  this is--behind every number--this is not about statistics. These are  about people, people of flesh and bone who loved and were loved.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of New  Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), my friend and sister in service.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  and for always fighting for those too often ignored, left out, and left  behind. We are grateful for her.   Now, just as I close, as we wrap this Special Order hour, Transgender  Day of Remembrance is about remembering lives we have lost too soon,  but it should also be about remembering the bravery of transgender  people everywhere. I rise again to acknowledge the contributions, often  overlooked, of transgender women of color who have been champions of  social change.   It was transgender advocates in my district who established the first  Transgender Day of Remembrance in 1999 in honor of Rita Hester, a Black  [[Page H9112]]  transgender woman described as vivacious, outgoing, and loved by many  people.   On this day, I rise to remember the transgender women of color who  were catalysts for the LGBT rights movement in the United States and  around the world. We remember the bravery of Miss Major Griffin-Gracy  and the late Sylvia Rivera, and Marsha P. Johnson in the face of the  police who violently raided the Stonewall Inn in New York City in 1969,  detaining and arresting people simply for being themselves.   When faced with compounded transphobia, racism, sexism, and  homophobia, transgender people have marched and resisted. When  confronted with structural barriers, transgender people have organized  and advocated.   I remain committed, along with the dedicated members of my team--and  I want to issue a special thanks to Jenny Curt for her contributions to  today's Special Order hour--committed not only to lifting the stories  of those lives lost, but to working in partnership, legislating boldly.  I see their power; I honor their activism.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
