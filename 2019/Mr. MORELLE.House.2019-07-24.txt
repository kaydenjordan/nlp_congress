 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Paul  Haney, a longtime leader in Rochester and Monroe County, and my very  dear friend, who passed away on Sunday.   As a former county legislator and city councilman, Paul was a fixture  in our community; a man who truly embodied the high ideals of public  service.   Paul was kind, honest, smart as a whip, and deeply passionate about  improving the community he loved. He devoted his life in service to his  neighbors and was always the first to lend a hand to those in need.   Paul Haney's contributions have left a profound and lasting impact on  his beloved city. His legacy will never be forgotten.   I join all of Rochester County and Monroe County in mourning his  loss, and extend my thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathies to the  Haney family                            ____________________
