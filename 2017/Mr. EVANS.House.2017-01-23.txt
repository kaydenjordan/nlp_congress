 Mr. Speaker, I think that the points that the gentlewoman  is raising are very legitimate in terms of the experience that I have  had. And the experience that I have had, always the question is: Is  there enough availability of capital in any startup of any particular  business?   The experience has shown that this idea of microloans hasn't been  sustainable or sufficient in terms of what it would mean. And as a  result, Mr. Speaker, I think that this is like kind of a pig in a poke,  giving people some sense, but really it doesn't give them a sustainable  sense of whether you have the necessary long-term investment that is  necessary. So I think that this is like smoke and mirrors. And the  gentlewoman is correct in what she is saying in terms of this is not  something that will give them a sustainable effort.    Yes. And, Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Plaskett for the  opportunity to offer some comments. The fact that the Congressional  Black Caucus has taken this lead, I applaud our leadership, Chairman  Richmond.   I join with my colleagues this evening to speak to the plan our new  President has penned as the ``new deal for African Americans.'' This  plan, unfortunately, does not meet the needs of our communities and  focuses on the same assumptions that have not worked for our  communities over the years.   In his inaugural address, President Trump stated: ``The establishment  protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories  have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your  triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was  little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.'' That  was stated by President Trump.   Well, while individuals were celebrating last week, actions were  taken for people all over our Nation to lose their healthcare coverage,  and the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance rate was cut  an hour after President Trump took office, which would have reduced  insurance premiums for borrowers each year. This does not help the men,  women, and children of our great Nation.   In the new deal for Black America, President Trump asserts that there  will be tax reform to create jobs and lift up people and communities.  Just in my community alone, Mr. Speaker, at Temple University Hospital,  which has 8,000 jobs, there are jobs that will be lost due to the  repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which President Trump signed an  executive order to dismantle the day he was sworn in as our President.  This is counter to any notion of job creation.   As our chairman so eloquently stated in the letter expressing the  views of  [[Page H604]]  the caucus on January 19, the new administration should target  investment to those communities that need it the most and support  programs that support small- and medium-sized businesses and address  the access to capital crisis in the African American entrepreneur  community.   In President Trump's inaugural address, he stated ``a new national  pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.'' I  assert that we already have a national pride. It is the pride that  those in our communities feel when there is unity when they understand  that individuals here in Congress are fighting for them. It is the  pride that communities feel when they understand that groups such as  the Congressional Black Caucus zealously represented and advocated to  improve their lives over the course of the existence of the caucus,  those in rural and urban communities.   An additional point in the new deal for Black America asserts  financial reform to expand credit to support new job creation and  specifically calls out the Dodd-Frank reforms set forth and protected  through the leadership of Ranking Member Waters. These financial  reforms and protections are absolutely essential to protect our  communities.   With the racial wealth gap reaching an unfortunate and historical  level, with White households maintaining 13 times the wealth of African  American households, we must work to ensure the protections of Dodd- Frank remain in place. Additionally, as Representative Richmond shared,  programs such as the Small Business Administration's Microloan Program,  which provides capital and assistance to minority-owned business, must  be bolstered.   I have spoken directly with my constituents about the need for access  to capital; thus, my statement is not hypocritical or speculative in  nature. There is an actual need in our communities so that our small  businesses can grow and flourish.    Our new President asserts:         We are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving       it back to you, the American people.    I assert that the American people have always had the power. I see  this power as I walk through my district as through my community, as I  walk through Ogontz Avenue in West Oak Lane, part of my district, down  Girard Avenue in North Philadelphia, Lancaster Avenue on the Main Line,  and Baltimore Avenue in West Philadelphia. The faces in my community  let me know that the power has always belonged to the people. It is now  up to all of us to do what is in the best interest of our communities,  to work collectively and address the issues that plague our  communities.
