 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against H.R. 7,  the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full  Disclosure Act.   We are here to represent all of our constituents, even the ones we  don't agree with. It should be the woman alone who makes the decision,  not Republicans, not Democrats, not the Trump administration, no one  but the woman and her doctor.   I support choice so every woman in America could make the decision  that is right for her, her family, her God, her health, and her  reproduction.   Creating access issues and removing coverage does not stop abortions;  it drives them underground. H.R. 7 essentially creates a disparity  between poor women and rich women.   For women, children, foster youth, for the LGBT community, for the  middle class, working class, poor people, people of color, undocumented  residents, and people who see health care as a right and not as a  privilege for those who can afford it, they should have the right and  liberty to make their own health decisions.                            ____________________
