 Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, we have promised to  serve the American people, and this means keeping American families  safe and secure. But for too long, Congress has put fealty to the  special interest of the gun lobby ahead of our safety.   I cannot afford to live in fear of special interests. Why? Because  every single day when I send my three children off to school, I live in  fear for their safety; because I have seen the pain on the faces of  those parents whose children never came home from school, the parents  who hugged their children good-bye in the morning, never knowing it  would be for the last time; because no parent should ever have to mourn  a child lost to preventable gun violence; and because, as your Member  of Congress, I have the power to fight for change.   This is the power that Congress has, and this is why 1 year ago, we  passed landmark legislation to reduce gun violence in this country.   Under current law, only federally licensed vendors must conduct  background checks, but this creates loopholes for private sellers. This  means that there are no background checks on private sales, including  gun shows and online transactions.   The Bipartisan Background Checks Act closes this loophole and will  ensure that nearly all gun sales are run through the National Criminal  Background Check System.   This legislation is common sense. In fact, two former GOP Congressmen  wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in support of the legislation.  They said: ``This bill doesn't take away anyone's guns.'' It represents  ``a critical step in the right direction at a time when more and more  Americans are touched by gun violence.''   This is a clear, commonsense, American solution that is now being  held hostage by Senator Mitch McConnell, the President, and the gun  lobby.   And this is a uniquely American issue. No other country experiences  the same epidemic of gun violence.   In fact, guns are the second-leading cause of death for American  children and teens; nearly 1,700 are killed by guns every year. In my  home State of California, an average of 246 children and teens die from  guns every year.   Since the beginning of 2014 in California, over 14,000 people,  including, heartbreakingly, 120 law enforcement officers, have been  injured or killed due to gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, 47 of those people hurt or killed were in my district in  Orange County, the 45th. We have lost 34 members of our community in  just 4 years to gun violence.  [[Page H1245]]    Orange County families have made their feelings heard, time and  again, that they want us to strengthen gun violence prevention laws. I  am standing here as proof that Orange County wants action on gun  reform. Keeping our families safe is at the heart of our community's  values.   I want to share a story of one Orange County family with my  colleagues here in Congress. This is a story of a family who  experienced loss from gun violence and, yet, found the strength to  dedicate their lives to making sure that others don't experience  similar tragedies.   Mary Leigh and Charlie Blek from Orange County have fought tirelessly  for commonsense gun legislation in California. Their son, Matthew Blek,  was only 21 years old when he was shot and killed while visiting New  York City. He was a victim of armed robbery by teens using a small  handgun, also known as a junk gun.    In memory of their son, the Bleks founded Orange County Citizens for  the Prevention of Gun Violence in 1995. For 5 long, hard-fought years,  they advocated for safety regulations that would rid California of the  type of gun that killed their son, and they succeeded.   California used to produce 80 percent of the junk guns for the  Nation. California no longer produces these junk guns and has enacted  safety standards for handguns.   Still today, the Bleks are vigilant in preventing the gun lobby from  finding a way to sell dangerous handguns in California. The Bleks now  lead the Orange County chapter of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun  Violence. I am personally very grateful for their efforts. No family  should ever have to go through what the Bleks suffered, but too many in  our own communities have. And because the Senate has yet to act,  nothing has changed.   It has been 1 year since we passed H.R. 8. It has been almost 2 years  since the Parkland school shooting, and over 7 years since the Sandy  Hook shooting. And until this Congress, there has not been any change  coming out of Washington.   Time is running out. Congress has the power to stop more people--more  children--from dying from gun violence, and we must act.   Now more than ever, we need the American people to insist that our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle stand up to the gun lobby and  stand up to join in the fight to reduce gun violence. We all have a  duty to be leaders, not shills for the gun lobby, not cowards afraid to  lose an A-rating. Our children deserve our courage.                                time  1530    Our children deserve leaders who will fight to ensure that families  are safe at school, in parks, at the movies, and at concerts.   As your Member of Congress, as a mother, and as a member of the  Orange County community, I will never back down from this fight. I will  not be bought, and I will not be silenced by the gun lobby or by the  President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin, for her powerful words in this time of tragedy in her  district. I thank her for bringing the voice of those we lost to the  United States Congress. I really appreciate her passion and compassion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
