 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jerry  Konter, a builder and developer from Savannah, who on February 2 will  conclude his successful term as the 2022 chairman of the National  Association of Home Builders.   As chairman, Jerry has worked with both the administration and  lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to provide solutions for our  Nation's growing housing affordability crisis. This is an especially  important issue and it is refreshing to have someone as knowledgeable  and passionate as Jerry come to Washington with solutions and the know- how to make them a reality.   Jerry also recognizes the importance of giving back to his community.  He has served on the Board of Directors for the Savannah Humane  Society, as president of the Jewish Educational Alliance, and as a  member of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Planning Commission.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of myself and the First Congressional  District of Georgia, I thank Jerry for all of his hard work.      Recognizing the Ware County High School Football Team for       Winning the Class 5A State Championship    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Ware County High School football team for winning the Class 5A State  championship in the State of Georgia. This is a first and long-overdue  State title for the Gators. They finished the season with a 14-0  record--also a first for the school.   Ware County faced no trouble as they cruised through four playoff  games. They allowed only 27 points to be scored by their opponents. The  Gators entered the championship game having allowed just 90 points all  season. Their defense was one of the best in the State.   In their title matchup, the Gators faced the Warner Robins Demons, a  Georgia powerhouse program known for their historic success. Warner  Robins was a two-time defending State champion coming off of a historic  2021 season.   The Gators held Warner Robins to only 13 points and brought the title  back home to Waycross.   Congratulations to the Ware County Gators, you made the First  Congressional District of Georgia proud.    Recognizing the Benedictine High School Football Team for Winning the                        Class 4A State Championship     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Benedictine High School football team for winning the Class 4A State  championship in the State of Georgia.   This is the second year in a row that the Cadets have won the title.  In fact, over the last 12 years, the Cadets have won the State title  four times.   Benedictine faced no trouble in the playoffs, scoring a combined 155  points. The Cadets, known for their strong defensive teams, only  allowed their opponents to score 51 points during their playoff run.   In their title matchup, Benedictine beat Cedartown 14-13. It was the  Benedictine defense that won the game for the Cadets as the unit made a  goal-line stand in a driving rainstorm in the final seconds of the  game.   Congratulations, Benedictine, you have made the First Congressional  District of Georgia proud.             Recognizing Stetson Bennett of the Georgia Bulldogs     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and  recognize one of the First District of Georgia's finest, quarterback  Stetson Bennett of the Georgia Bulldogs.   Stetson Bennett has now cemented himself as one of the greatest  quarterbacks in the history of the University of Georgia.   Last week, Stetson finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting.  Stetson was the first Georgia quarterback to be named a Heisman  finalist and the first Bulldog to make the final cut for the award  since Garrison Hearst in 1992.   This season, Stetson finished with 3,435 passing yards, 27 total  touchdowns, and a completion rate of 68 percent through 13 games. He  also showed off his speed, tacking on 148 yards rushing.   In the SEC championship game, Stetson threw for 274 yards and four  touchdowns. Bennett will lead the Bulldogs into the college football  playoff as they take on the Ohio State Buckeyes in the Chick-fil-A  Peach Bowl.   Madam Speaker, I wish Stetson and the Bulldogs good luck as they try  to become the first school to win back-to-back titles in college  football playoff history.   Congratulations, Stetson, and Go Dawgs.                            ____________________
