 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Private  Second Class Roger Cordle. This U.S. Army veteran passed away on  January 15, 2023, but not without making a strong impact on our  community.   Mr. Cordle was awarded numerous medals and ribbons during his  military career, including the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for  serving during Operation Just Cause.   Mr. Cordle's dedication to service continued as the commander of VFW  Post 2535 in Lockport, New York, and as commander of New York State VFW  Post in District 7, which oversees Niagara, Orleans, Wyoming,  Livingston, and Genesee Counties. During his time as commander of VFW  Post 2535, the post was recognized as an all-state post for several  years, one of only 24 in the State of New York.   As a leader in our community, Mr. Cordle was active in many of Post  2535's charity events, including providing holiday meals to veterans  and families in need and also assisting homeless veterans.   Please join me in celebrating the life of Private Second Class Roger  Cordle, who is survived by his beloved wife and five children.   His was a life well lived, and his commitment to this great Nation is  an inspiration to us all.                Celebrating the Bicentennial of Hobart College     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the bicentennial  of Hobart College.   2022 marked the 200th anniversary of Hobart's founding in Geneva, New  York, making it one of America's 50 oldest colleges and universities.   When Hobart College, first named Geneva College, was founded in 1822,  the United States was less than 50 years old, Washington, D.C., had  been the Nation's capital for only 21 years, and Abraham Lincoln was  just 13 years old. The college was located on the land of the Seneca  Nation that for generations was the Haudenosaunee Confederacy's  westernmost territory.   Hobart College was named after New York's third Episcopal Bishop,  John Henry Hobart. Given Geneva's vibrant community, he saw the  beautiful city as the perfect place to establish a college with the  mission of educating students with a comprehensive liberal arts  curriculum.   In 1908, Hobart's sister school, William Smith College for Women, was  founded, which eventually merged in 1943 with Hobart to become Hobart  and William Smith Colleges.   Both colleges have an impressive legacy of producing men and women of  leadership and national impact, including graduates like Dr. Elizabeth  Blackwell, who became the first American woman to receive a medical  degree in 1849, and Harry W. Coover, Jr., the inventor of Super Glue.   Countless other Hobart and William Smith graduates have made profound  contributions to public service, business, education, science,  journalism, and spiritual life that endured well beyond their  lifetimes. Indeed, my brother John, my cousin Jeff, and many of my  friends are graduates of Hobart and William Smith Colleges.   Today, Hobart College educates students from around the world who  study on a campus of incomparable beauty. Guided by programs grounded  in exploration and intellectual curiosity, both Hobart and William  Smith Colleges challenge students to engage in critical and creative  thinking. Under the faculty's mentorship, Hobart and William Smith  students have won multiple prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes,  Gates Cambridge, Fulbright, and Goldwater scholarships.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Hobart College on this historic milestone  and wish the Hobart and William Smith Colleges community all the best  as it continues to produce the next generation of leaders and  innovators across the world.                            ____________________
