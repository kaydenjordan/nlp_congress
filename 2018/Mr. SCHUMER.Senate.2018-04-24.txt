 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Rules Committee will mark up  Senator Lankford's resolution tomorrow to change the rules on the  consideration of nominees to benefit the Senate majority. Of course,  the majority in the Senate can already approve of a nomination on a  party-line vote for all nominees up to and including now the Supreme  Court since Leader McConnell elected to change those rules last year.   Why the need for further erosions to minority rights in the Senate?  The Republicans argue it is because they are facing ``historic''  obstruction of the President's nominees.   A few points on that: First and foremost, the truth is the Democrats  have cooperated with the majority on noncontroversial nominees, like  career ambassadorships and civil servants, for a long time now. Before  each recess, there is a long list of names that is approved. Before the  last recess, the Senate had confirmed nearly as many nominations in  2018 as President Obama had confirmed in the analogous year of 2010.  Let me repeat that. Before the last recess, the Senate had confirmed  almost the exact same number of nominees in 2018 as President Obama had  confirmed in 2010, the second year of his Presidency.   So this idea that it is historic--bunk. You can tell it is bunk  because at the same time our Republicans and even the President  himself, on some days, complain about obstruction, on other days, the  President and the Vice President are boasting about how many judges  they have filled on the bench.   This morning, President Trump said:         We put [on] a tremendous amount of [Federal] district       [court] judges. We are setting records.    I say to my Republican friends and the President: You can't have it  both ways--on the one hand, historic obstruction and, on the other, a  record pace of confirmations that you brag to your base about. You  can't have it both ways. It is hypocrisy.   A second point: The Republican majority has already taken brazen  steps during this Congress to limit minority rights on nominations. I  mentioned the leader breaking the rules on Supreme Court nominees.  Let's not forget that he broke the rules after letting Merrick Garland  sit there while not allowing a nomination. It takes a lot of gall to  complain about obstruction when Leader McConnell opened the gates to  obstruction--made obstruction his watchword--when he did what he did to  Merrick Garland. He didn't stop. The Republicans have not stopped this  year. The Republicans have engaged in hardball tactics at the district  and circuit court levels.   Here is what happened. Take the Republican seat that is vacant on the  Seventh Circuit. Because Senator Leahy--then-chairman--and, later,  Senators Hatch and, I believe, Grassley honored the blue slip, a seat  in the Seventh Circuit that belongs to Wisconsin was held open for 6  years by their refusing to approve two nominees by President Obama. Now  the President has nominated a very conservative judge, Michael Brennan,  who has failed to earn the recommendation of the bipartisan commission  that is respected in Wisconsin and was set up by both Senators Baldwin  and Johnson--one a Democrat, one a Republican--to recommend Federal  nominees. Yet this administration has no known concern about the real  qualifications of the judges as long as they meet the hard-right  checklist.   Despite the fact that Senator Baldwin has not returned a blue slip  for Mr. Brennan, Chairman Grassley has moved him out of committee  anyway. This is the second time Chairman Grassley has ignored the blue  slip tradition. The blue slip tradition was faithfully honored by  Senator Leahy when he was chairman. Our Republican colleagues have used  it to an extent that, certainly, would be ``historic'' obstruction. For  6 years, a seat was vacant on the circuit court, and it was not the  only one that had had long-term vacancies. Now, all of a sudden,  because the Democrats want to discuss this, mull this for a few days,  Senator Lankford wants to change the rules. I know he only came to the  Senate in 2014, but he ought to look a bit at the history before he  gets into high dudgeon.   The issue of nominations has been fraught, and it is true there have  been escalations on both sides. I am the first to say that. Despite the  rhetoric from the majority party, the Democrats have worked in good  faith this year to clear noncontroversial nominations expeditiously.  When nominees require vetting, the Senate should have the tools to  consider them thoroughly because, clearly, this administration is not  taking the task of vetting seriously.   This is a final argument--and there are many good ones I would like  to make. The Trump administration has done the worst job of vetting its  nominees of any administration I can remember. It seems a slapdash  process. It has had to withdraw the nominee for the Labor Department  because he was not properly vetted; it has fired the Secretaries of  HHS, State, and the VA; and it has faced a host of other controversies  with staff and turnover. I dare say, if Mr. Pruitt had been properly  vetted, he may not have been nominated given what we have found out.   Now we hear that the new nominee for the VA Secretary--the  President's personal doctor--is on hold because of some troubling  allegations. How did he get through the process with all of these  allegations not even having been made public? My guess--there was not  proper vetting. I was not there, but it is speculative that, maybe, one  day, the President, who we know acts on  [[Page S2362]]  impulse, had this nominee in the room--his doctor--and he said: Hey,  let's put you up without any vetting.   The President is putting forward nominees without appropriate  vetting. It is our job to vet, and we will not be rushed through,  particularly when this administration has had such a poor record of  looking at the qualifications and the problems that each nominee has  brought. More than ever, with this President, it is the Senate's job to  advise and consent, not to be a rubberstamp. The rule change that is  being proposed by Senator Lankford is totally unmerited, inadvisable,  and lacks any knowledge of history of the Senate.   You know, we are trying to return to some comity here. The omnibus  bill was very good work among Speaker Ryan, Leader McConnell, Leader  Pelosi, and me. We are going to meet in a little while to talk about  doing the appropriations process in regular order and going back to the  days when we did that, which I know our majority leader sincerely wants  to do, as do I, as does Senator Shelby, as does Senator Leahy.  Something like this--so partisan, so unfair, and so unacknowledging of  the history that has come before--doesn't help the sense of comity in  the Senate.   I urge Republicans and Democrats alike on the Rules Committee to  reject this terribly ill-advised proposal.
