 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 5016, a bill to  designate the medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs  located in Anchorage, Alaska, as the Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson  Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System.   Mary Louise Rasmuson was born, as was said earlier, in April 1911 in  East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During World War II, she answered the  Nation's call and enlisted in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps as a  private. She became one of the first women to serve in that role.   Having quickly risen through the ranks, President Eisenhower  appointed Colonel Rasmuson as the Director of the Women's Army Corps.   Colonel Rasmuson was instrumental in the integration of Black women  into the Women's Army Corps and was awarded the Legion of Merit for  leadership. At her direction, she also expanded opportunities for women  to serve in assignments previously reserved only for men. She also  advocated for new avenues for women to advance their military careers.   After serving for over 20 years in the Army, she retired in July of  1962 and moved to Alaska, where she continued  [[Page H9961]]  to serve her community as a veteran. Colonel Rasmuson engaged in  several efforts to preserve the veterans' stories in museums and  memorials around the country until she passed away in 2012 at the age  of 101. Now, her story of service will be told for generations.   Colonel Rasmuson not only paved the way for successful integration of  women into what is now our U.S. Army, she also was a role model of  character and outstanding service to our Nation.   Naming the VA facility in Alaska in her honor is a fitting tribute.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, as everyone has spoken about how this needs to be, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7939, as amended, the  Veterans Auto and Education Improvement Act of 2022. I am supportive of  the entire package, but I am especially pleased that five Republican  proposals have been included.   This bill includes Congressman Joyce's language that would extend  [[Page H9967]]  full post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to servicemembers who have been  discharged under DOD's sole survivor rules. This issue directly  impacted Congressman Joyce's constituents, the Weninger family. Their  son, Marine Sergeant Weninger, tragically passed away in 2020. I am  happy to honor Sergeant Weninger for his service and provide this  education benefit to his brother.   I thank his family, Congressman Joyce, and the Tragedy Assistance  Program for Survivors for bringing this important issue to our  attention.   This package also includes the text of Congressman Moore's bill that  would improve the way schools are approved for the GI Bill. Recently,  there has been a rise in schools abusing this benefit. This proposal  would help prevent GI Bill fraud and protect taxpayers' investments in  the benefits. This bill would make it much harder for a bad school to  be approved for GI Bill benefits before they can potentially harm  veterans.   I thank the VA Office of Inspector General for their hard work to  protect veterans and for helping us draft this text.   Another proposal in this bill would amend the Servicemembers Civil  Relief Act to make it easier for military spouses to transfer  employment licenses across State lines. This bipartisan proposal would  allow spouses to transfer their State-based medical and professional  licenses when they move due to their spouse's military orders.    This is an important change, introduced by Congressman  Mike Garcia,  that would help reduce unemployment among military spouses.   This bill includes the text of H.R. 4702, originally introduced by  Congressman Cawthorn, that would help clarify which State a military  spouse can file taxes in when their family is deployed to a new State.   Finally, I am happy to see that H.R. 3304, the AUTO for Veterans Act,  is included in the bill today. This addition would help disabled  veterans purchase and adapt a vehicle 10 years after the purchase of  their first vehicle.   This proposal is very similar to H.R. 1361, the bill sponsored by  Congressman Meuser, who has been working on improving the adaptive auto  purchasing process for several Congresses.   I thank the PVA and the DAV for their continued advocacy for this  proposal.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 7939, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garcia), who has worked so hard on this and other  pieces of legislation, but this one in particular.                                time  1700     Madam Speaker, in closing, I encourage all of my colleagues  to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
