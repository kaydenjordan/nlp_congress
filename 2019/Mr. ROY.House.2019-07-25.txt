 Madam Speaker, I would notice that there is a certain smell  here of jet fumes; that this Chamber is completely empty, here, July  25, my colleagues--well, it is empty for the most part.   My colleagues are headed off to the airport to fly home; fly home for  fundraisers, vacation.   But you know what they are not doing? Nobody in this body is going to  stay here to secure the border of the  [[Page H7446]]  United States. While we have got thousands of people pouring across our  border, while ICE does not have the resources it needs to do its job,  this body is adjourning.   I had 40 of my colleagues, give or take--and it is a growing list-- that have asked the Speaker that we should stay here. We should not  adjourn. How can we possibly adjourn without giving ICE the resources  it needs for the beds to be able to put people, to be able to deal with  the border crisis? Yet, that is what this body is going to do.   It is unconscionable that we are allowing our border to stay open,  and that this body is going to adjourn, go home and, for 6 weeks, not  do our duty as a sovereign Nation to have a secure border, to make sure  migrants can come here safely; but more importantly, that our law  enforcement has the tools that it needs to do the job that we ask them  to do when they are standing on the line every day defending this  country.   With cartels having operational control of our border, endangering  this country, it is our duty to do it. We should stay here.                            ____________________
