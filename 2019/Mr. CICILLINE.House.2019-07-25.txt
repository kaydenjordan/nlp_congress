 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2336) to amend title 11, United States Code, with respect to  the definition of ``family farmer'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2336         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Family Farmer Relief Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF FAMILY FARMER.         Section 101(18) of title 11, United States Code, is amended       by striking ``$3,237,000'' each place that term appears and       inserting ``$10,000,000''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2336, the Family Farmer Relief Act of 2019, would  increase the current debt limit used to determine whether a family  farmer is eligible for relief under chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code,  a specialized form of bankruptcy relief specifically intended for  family farmers, from approximately $4.4 million to $10 million.   Chapter 12 permits a family farmer who satisfies certain eligibility  criteria to reorganize his or her debts pursuant to a repayment plan  under the supervision of a bankruptcy trustee. The special attributes  of chapter 12 make it better suited to meet the particularized needs of  family farmers in financial distress than other forms of bankruptcy  relief.   Under chapter 7, for example, the family farm and its assets would  have to be liquidated to pay the claims of creditors, thus depriving  the family farmer of his or her livelihood, which is completely  unacceptable.   The chapter 11 process for reorganization, which is typically used by  large corporations in economic distress to reorganize complex financial  transactions, is also inappropriate due to its costly and time- consuming process that does not work for our Nation's small farming  operations.   In light of these concerns with other avenues for reorganization  under the Bankruptcy Code, Congress created chapter 12 during the farm  crisis of the mid-1980s in response to a series of economic  catastrophes facing small farms, from grain embargoes, to high interest  rates, to consolidation, and mega-farms.   Unfortunately, many similar economic pressures are impacting family  farmers today, who are also facing the devastating effects of climate  change, including unprecedented weather events and catastrophic  flooding, as well as stagnant or falling returns on investment.   H.R. 2336 takes into consideration the fact that modern farming  operations entail greater costs and resulting debt than when chapter 12  was first enacted by raising the debt threshold to qualify for this  type of bankruptcy relief to a level more consistent with today's  operations.   Accordingly, I support H.R. 2336, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Delgado), the author of the bill, a relentless advocate  for this legislation, and a distinguished member of the freshman class.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2336 is a commonsense, bipartisan  solution. I applaud the gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado) for his  leadership on this bill to help our Nation's family-owned farms.   This legislation is supported by the nonpartisan American Bankruptcy  Institute, as well the American College of Bankruptcy. It currently has  more than 27 bipartisan cosponsors, including our distinguished  colleague, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass H.R.  2336.   I yield back the balance of my time.
