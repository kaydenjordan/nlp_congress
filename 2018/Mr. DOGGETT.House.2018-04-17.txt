 Madam Speaker, the Social Security number really is a  key to identity theft, and thieves have had a field day with these  Social Security numbers and the identity theft and the invasion of  privacy that occurs.   A full 10 years ago, I authored a measure here in the House to remove  this information from the Medicare card. The next session, finally in  2010, we were able to pass that through the House with the help of  Representative Johnson. It was a bipartisan initiative.   Then the Senate didn't pass it.   When Republicans took over control of the House, Mr. Johnson  appropriately took the lead on that legislation, and he worked at it  for a while, and, finally, in 2015, he got it passed to remove the  Social Security number from the Medicare card.   As Representative Johnson knows, finally, now, 10 years from when we  started in June of this year, it looks like seniors will begin getting  their Medicare cards without the Social Security number on it, to  protect their privacy and to avoid the exploitation that has occurred.   To his credit, Mr. Marchant has identified another group of very  vulnerable individuals: children. Carnegie Mellon did a study that  reported that nearly 10 percent of America's children have had their  identity already stolen, and the Social Security number is a factor in  that. That is significantly higher than it is for adults, some 51 times  higher, according to the Carnegie Mellon study.   Children are particularly vulnerable in this regard because they  don't have a driver's license. They are really kind of a blank canvas.  They don't work, and they don't establish credit. This allows theft and  fraud to go undetected for many years in some cases.   By the time that they are young adults, they could unknowingly be  buried in debt and face delays in very important steps in their  education, in their work, in getting their first job, in getting that  driver's license or applying for a student loan.   I salute Mr. Marchant for seeing that this is a problem. I am pleased  to join him and my colleague, Mr. Davis, from Chicago in supporting  this measure.   Children and their parents or their guardians acting on their behalf  deserve a streamlined process that will allow for a child to be issued  a new Social Security number long before any misuse occurs.                                time  1630    No child should have to wait for the inevitable harm to come along  and have their identity stolen before action occurs. Building on the  success that we have had with seniors, and I hope in a much more prompt  fashion than we were able to do it for seniors, we now, through Mr.  Marchant's efforts, are working to ensure, once again on a bipartisan  basis, that we provide the same kind of protection for infants and  children from baseless identity thieves.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation.    I thank Mr. Tonko so much for organizing this Special  Order. I do know how special that Louise was to you and to so many of  us. She was a dear friend for many years, an outspoken advocate for  social and economic justice, and she put together a great team, a  series of teams through her years here, some of whom are on the floor  today. We salute them, also.   Louise was funny, she was sometimes a bit conspiratorial, and she was  a person who just refused to act her age in the best ways possible. I  was amazed myself, knowing that Louise had been here a few years more  than I had, to learn what her age was at the time of her passing,  because she was out powerfully speaking truth to power right up until  the week before she passed.   She had the enthusiastic support of her late husband and tremendous  partner, Bob. Both of them understood the challenges of public service,  and they withstood repeated Republican assaults with wit and grit. Her  fierce passion was matched with sincere compassion and kindness.   Over the years, time and time again, she reached out and helped me  and helped other Members. I admired her unwavering commitment to speak  truth and to honor values of acceptance, equality, and justice. She put  the health and well-being of people first, and she fought tirelessly to  improve the lives of the people in her community and across this  country.                                time  1845    Louise showed just how much one determined woman can do for our  country. As chair of the Rules Committee, she was involved in every  major piece of legislation and many minor ones that came before this  House. And in her service on Rules, it can certainly be said that she  worked day and night, sometimes all night, on behalf of the people of  this country.   She overcame significant resistance to secure passage of the Violence  Against Women Act, achieving some historic increases in funding for  women's health. She was a real trailblazer when it came to so many  issues and inspired so many women to get involved and make a difference  for our country.   She authored the STOCK Act to ensure more complete and timely  disclosure of financial dealings by the Members of this House so that  no one was trading off the public trust for private gain.   I think of Louise and look over to this microphone each time a rule  is brought up in the House setting forth the terms of debate for  legislation. There is a vacancy in the House, and there is a vacancy in  our hearts for a tough but generous woman.   We salute her daughters, Megan, Amy, and Emily; her grandchildren;  her great-grandchild, all of whom she often referred to and showed such  great affection for. May it be a source of comfort for each of them  that their mother was a loyal and loving friend, a fierce and genuine  public servant, a force to be reckoned with, a champion for so many  vital causes; and may her very fiery spirit live on with all of us.
