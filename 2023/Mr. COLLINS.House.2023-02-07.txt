 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an incredible man  from the great State of Georgia. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas,  a native son of Pin Point, near Savannah, was nominated to the Supreme  Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991.   At that time, he was just the second Black American ever appointed to  the Supreme Court, where he is now its longest serving member.   Since taking the Bench, Justice Thomas has ruled on some of the most  consequential cases in American history. He has safeguarded our rights  by defending the principles of natural law that are central to  America's founding.   Justice Thomas exemplifies the American Dream, rising from humble  beginnings to a seat on our Nation's highest court through hard work  and dedication.   There would be nothing more fitting than the Georgia State  legislature finishing the job it started last year and putting a statue  of Justice Thomas under the gold dome of the State capitol.   Justice Thomas' legacy of service and footprint on American  jurisprudence is worthy of honor and commemoration.                            ____________________
