 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life  of Doris Ivy of Illinois. In 1991, Doris Ivy received a second chance  at life after receiving a new kidney from a generous donor.   The way her family sees it, Doris was able to live an extra 27 years,  thanks to that kidney transplant. She made the most out of those years.  She was an active volunteer, an election judge, a talented cook, a  choir singer, and a mother to nine children. On June 29, 2018, Doris  passed away at the age of 85.   Her family members, which include Illinois' Secretary of State Jesse  White, are thankful for those extra years. Due to Doris's successful  transplant, they all became strong advocates for organ and tissue  donations.   Doris is survived by her sister Cora, 6 of her 9 children, 12 of her  17 grandchildren, 39 of her 40 great-grandchildren, and 12 of her  great-great- grandchildren. Her service to her community is remarkable,  and her story inspiring. I stand here today to remember her life and  applaud the generosity of all organ donors across America.                            ____________________
