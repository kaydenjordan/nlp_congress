 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts and the gentleman from California for their leadership on  this matter. They have discussed this over the months, and I have been  pleased to join them in this effort.   Madam Speaker, U.S. bombs are bombing school buses of 40 children.  U.S. bombs are bombing those in Yemen who are innocent citizens. The  violence through bombing has been facilitated with U.S. resources. This  is a demand that is without parallel of its necessity.   The question is whether we are engaged without the authorization of  the United States Congress, whether we have declared war against Yemen.  If the answer is no, then this resolution is appropriate.   Yemen is the poorest or one of the poorest countries in the world.  This resolution clearly says that we should stop the hostilities  against the Houthi forces. More importantly, we should stop being used  by the Saudi forces.   By the way, having gone to Yemen, I know that at least a decade ago,  Saudi closed its doors to the Yemen young men, who could find no work  in Yemen because of its poverty, to go into Saudi to work there.  Without that opportunity, all we ceded was poverty and violence. Now,  because of the conflict, we have been bombing Yemen citizens for many  years.   This is a constructive resolution. It does not violate the 2001  Authorization for Use of Military Force. It is one that says that we  must take our forces and impact out of Yemen.   Let me also say that I know that we will discuss this further, but I  do want to add that it is crucial to take note that we have an  agreement on border security and funding the different agencies, so  that we do not hold our Federal employees hostage and we don't shut the  government.   This resolution, coming back to this resolution dealing with  directing the removal of Armed Forces from Yemen, is constructive work  of the Democratic Caucus and Democratic Members. We hope our Republican  Members will join us in doing the right thing in removing the impact of  the United States forces in Yemen.   Stop bombing children.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 37, which directs the removal of United States Armed Forces from  hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by  Congress.   The passage of H.J. Res. 37 would mark the first time in the 45 years  since the enactment of the War Powers Act that the House of  Representatives successfully invoked the statute's removal mechanism to  compel the Executive Branch to remove American troops from harm's way.   I support this resolution because, Congress has the sole power to  declare war under Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the United States  Constitution.   Mr. Chair, Congress has not declared war with respect to, or provided  a specific statutory authorization for, the conflict between military  forces led by Saudi Arabia, including forces from the United Arab  Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, and Sudan  (the Saudi-led coalition), against the Houthis, also known as Ansar  Allah, in the Republic of Yemen.   Since March 2015, members of the United States Armed Forces have been  introduced into hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the  Houthis, including providing to the Saudi-led coalition aerial  targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and mid-flight aerial  refueling.   The United States has established a Joint Combined Planning Cell with  Saudi Arabia, in which members of the United States Armed Forces assist  in aerial targeting and help to coordinate military and intelligence  activities.   Mr. Chair, the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the  Houthis constitutes, within the meaning of Section 4(a) of the War  Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hostilities or a  situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly  indicated by the circumstances into which United States Armed Forces  have been introduced.   Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states  that, ``at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in  hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions  and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory  authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the  Congress so directs''.   Most importantly, no specific statutory authorization for the use of  United States Armed Forces with respect to the conflict between the  Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis in Yemen has been enacted.   Also, no provision of law explicitly authorizes the provision of  targeting assistance or of midair refueling services to warplanes of  Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates that are engaged in such  conflict.   For this reason, the resolution directs that the President remove  United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the  Republic of Yemen, except United States Armed Forces engaged in  operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces, by not later than  the date that is 30 days after the date of the enactment.   The resolution makes clear that the term ``hostilities'' includes in- flight refueling, non-United States aircraft conducting missions as  part of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.   Mr. Chair, Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world  right now.   The Yemen crisis began in the Arab Spring of 2011, when an uprising  forced the country's long-time authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah  [[Page H1552]]  Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.   Since 2015, Saudis Arabia has launched an estimated 18,000 air  strikes on Yemen, attacking hospitals, schools, water treatment plants,  funerals, markets and even farms.   The Saudis also imposed a blockade on food, fuel and medicine from  freely entering the country in what can only be described as a  deliberate effort to starve the civilian population into submission.   More than 14 million Yemenis are steps away from starvation and at  least 85,000 children under the age of five have perished from war- related hunger and disease.   The United States has supported the Saudi-led air campaign with mid- air refueling support, intelligence and targeting assistance, and other  support.   Yemen is experiencing the world's worst famine in 100 years, with 12  million to 13 million innocent civilians at risk of dying from the lack  of food within months.   Mr. Chair, too many lives hang in the balance to allow American  involvement in Yemen war to continue.   I ask all members to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 37.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, we have spent a very long day in the  Judiciary Committee working on legislation to respond to the American  people's cry for universal background checks, but I rise as well, in  the backdrop of that legislation, to stand for the victims of gun  violence.   I think it is important to note that America has 329 million people- plus here in the United States, and it is growing every day. But we  have 393 million guns here in this country. We have lost, in this past  year, almost 40,000 people to gun violence.   I believe it is important, in a bipartisan way, that, when we are  here in the people's House, we act on behalf of the American people.  They want fair, simple universal background checks, which I hope will  be on this floor very soon.   Let me close by giving my deepest sympathy to the family, friends,  and staff of Walter Jones. I viewed him as a great American, a great  public servant, and one of great principle. I know that Walter, in his  life and now in his passing, will wish for this Nation peace and  dignity for all of those men and women who serve in the United States  military.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
