 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 79,  which removes the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights  amendment. A woman's rights must be guaranteed by our government.   This bill is about the Members of Congress ensuring that the rights  and equality for women are a part of our Constitution.   It is sad to watch those who lose their way because they will find  any way to distract from the issue of equality. The Members on the  other side are trying to interject abortion into this, but I want to  say that even though we have come so far as women--there are a record  number of women lawmakers here in this House--we have so far to go, and  this corrects that injustice and recognizes equality for women under  the law.   As the great Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman in  Congress, stated: ``The time is clearly now to put this House on record  for the fullest expression of that equality of opportunity which our  Founding Fathers professed. They professed it, but they did not assure  it to their daughters, as they tried to do for their sons.''   The time is clearly now to put this House on record for the fullest  expression of that equality of opportunity which our Founding Fathers  possessed. They possessed it, but they did not assure it. We try as  they tried to do for their sons.   Madam Speaker, I encourage support of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, today, I stand here proud to say that I  was one who cast my vote for the passage of ERA in America.   I also rise today to recognize a woman who was so very instrumental  to the State of Michigan and its fight for civil rights, Miss Daisy  Elliott.   Miss Elliott was only 1 of 11 women elected to the Michigan  Constitutional Convention in 1961. She was key in ensuring that our  State's constitution established the Michigan Civil Rights Commission,  with the authority to investigate charges of discrimination based on  race, religion, color, or national origin.   Daisy served in the Michigan Legislature for nearly 20 years as an  effective and influential voice of equality and introduced more than 80  bills that were enacted, including the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.  Daisy Elliott was a fierce advocate for workers, senior citizens, and  people of color.   Today, in honor of Black History Month, I salute and honor Miss Daisy  Elliott. Madam Speaker, I honor her legacy.                            ____________________
