 Madam Speaker, on August 26, remarks  regarding the terrorist attack at the Kabul, Afghanistan, airport, with  the murder of 13 American servicemembers, the Commander in Chief stated  that military leaders have contacted him, `` . . . usually by letter,  saying they subscribe to the mission as designed. . . . ''   That evening, I sent the first of four letters to the White House  asking for all letters referenced, with no reply. The decision to  withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan abandoning Americans has been  correctly identified by President Donald Trump as the worst foreign  policy disaster ever for American families. This leads to murderous  attacks over open borders into America.   Where is the American media on this crucial issue of the claimed  Afghanistan letters?   Sadly, no response from the White House reveals admission of no  letters.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism moves from the  safe haven in Afghanistan to America.                            ____________________
