 Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the  previous question so we can amend the rule and immediately consider  H.R. 7809, the Communities Deserve Cops Act, which allows for the use  of COPS grants to provide officers with signing and retention bonuses  up to $5,000.   Predictably, Madam Speaker, we have seen shocking increases in  violent crime following the calls from my friends across the aisle to  defund the police.   This week is National Police Week, a time when we should be honoring  those who put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities  safe. Sadly, we are not taking the opportunity to vote on legislation  to bolster law enforcement and decrease violent crime.   Despite House leadership having numerous bipartisan bills to vote on,  only two bills have been added to the suspension calendar. The Senate  Judiciary Committee is taking up five bills tomorrow.   Representative Rutherford's legislation provides much-needed  assistance for agencies to hire and retain officers. The COPS grant  program is vital to law enforcement agencies of all sizes, but while it  has continued to receive funds, it has not been authorized since 2009.   I have also introduced a bill with Representative Spanberger that  would reauthorize the COPS grant program and help low-income, rural  agencies compete for these grants. It has 53 cosponsors on both sides  of the aisle. More of my Democratic colleagues have cosponsored it than  Republicans. If Speaker Pelosi would allow a vote on the floor, it  would pass.   There are many more bipartisan law enforcement bills that deserve to  see the light of day. I hope that, moving forward, we can work together  to support the many bipartisan law enforcement bills that deliver  targeted solutions to the Nation.   I ask my colleagues to oppose the previous question so that we can  provide the needed support for law enforcement agencies.
