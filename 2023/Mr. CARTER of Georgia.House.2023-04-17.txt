 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Ruth Stuenckel, a loving wife, mother, and social worker.   A native of Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, Ruth held positions with  Children's Seashore House and the New Jersey Division of Youth and  Family Services.   In 1989, Ruth and her husband, Elton, moved to Savannah. Shortly  after, Ruth became an active member of the choir at Wesley Monumental  United Methodist Church.   She traveled internationally with the choir, singing in cathedrals  across Europe. Ruth also traveled to Israel and Jordan with the Cape  May United Methodist Church.   As an artist and avid gardener, she painted much of the beauty she  saw in nature. Ruth was also a member of the Savannah Art Association  and the Garden Club of Savannah.   Another passion of Ruth's was reading. More than being an avid  reader, Ruth was a proponent of learning for learning's sake. Every  week for more than 20 years, Ruth read to children at Royce Learning  Center at Chatham Academy.   She will be dearly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her and  her family.                            ____________________
