 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as our Nation faces major  foreign and domestic challenges brought on by the weakness of the Biden  administration.   The border crisis, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the  failure to hold China accountable, the green-lighting of the Nord  Stream 2 pipeline, and ``minor incursion'' remarks have sent signals of  weakness to our global adversaries. That weakness is now being tested  as Russian aggression threatens the sovereignty of our strategic  partners in Ukraine.   This threat to Ukraine is also a threat to democracy. Ukraine needs  our support to defend itself. That means sending a strong signal by  supporting more military and security equipment, as well as immediate  financial, economic, and energy sanctions against the Russians.   At this time, our national sovereignty has been betrayed by the  administration. Illegal immigrants and drugs are flowing across the  southern border at a record pace.   We must act to secure our borders and support Ukraine. Failure to do  so will weaken our national security for years to come.                            ____________________
