 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the  President's decision to end the war in Afghanistan.   Now Congress must ensure that future Commanders in Chief can never  [[Page H2003]]  again wage failed forever wars. This is also a critical moment to show  we can defend America and protect the global commons without a $740  billion defense budget.   We must repeal the Authorization for the Use of Military Force;  reassert congressional oversight of war powers; and cut the Pentagon's  budget by at least 10 percent as we invest instead in diplomacy,  humanitarian assistance, and solving global challenges like climate  change and pandemic preparedness.   The war in Afghanistan cost our country more than $2 trillion, the  lives of 2,400 American servicemembers, and credibility at home and  abroad. The generation that fought in this war must now govern in light  of its mistakes. Let us resolve to learn from them.                            ____________________
