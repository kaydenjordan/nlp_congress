 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about an  issue that will affect families all across Michigan, which is the  nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He has a long record  of siding with special interests and institutions instead of hard- working Americans, and this is of great concern to me. That matters.   I am concerned with his rulings that fail to protect children and  students with disabilities in schools, and I am worried that he will  limit access to critical healthcare for women and that he is not a  mainstream candidate. I can't support a nominee whom I believe is  disconnected from the challenges faced by families in Michigan and  across America every day.    There is one important example which relates directly to someone from  Michigan that Judge Gorsuch has ruled on. People from Michigan have  been hurt by Judge Gorsuch's narrow judicial philosophy.   In 2009, a Michigan truckdriver named Alphonse Maddin was trying to  complete a shipment driving all night, and his brakes froze in subzero  temperatures--which we have. The heater in his cab broke as well. He  called his company to report the issue and waited for help to arrive.   While he was waiting for hours in the freezing subzero temperatures,  he realized he was having trouble breathing and his body was going  numb. He called his company to report that he needed to get somewhere  warm, but they told him he needed to either wait for the repair person,  or drag his trailer even though the brakes were frozen. Worried he  might freeze to death, he finally unhitched the trailer from his truck.  Mr. Maddin drove off to seek help, returning in just 15 minutes with  assistance. He did what any of us faced with a life-threatening  situation would do.   A week later, Mr. Maddin was fired from his job, even though he was  transparent in his actions and completed his delivery. He completed his  delivery, despite the issues caused by his frozen brakes and the broken  heater.   Two different entities within the Department of Labor ruled that what  the trucking company did was illegal, and that Mr. Maddin was protected  under Federal law because his life was in danger. Thankfully, a  majority of the Tenth Circuit judges agreed. Judge Gorsuch, however,  disagreed, arguing the law did not protect workers who drove away to  avoid freezing to death.   According to Judge Gorsuch's interpretation, Mr. Maddin would have  had to choose between his job and his life. What is deeply concerning  to me is that when he was asked at his nomination hearing what he would  have done, he said he really hadn't thought about it. Judges should  think about what is happening to people in situations as they are  ruling in a fair and impartial way. This does not look like the ruling  of a mainstream nominee.   His rulings don't only affect Michigan workers. I am very concerned  about Judge Gorsuch's rulings on legal protections for individuals with  disabilities. We passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  to make sure that children with disabilities got the education they  deserved, and that the education would be free and available to all  children.   Luke, a young boy from Colorado with autism, was not able to receive  the education he needed from his public school. His parents were able  to enroll him in a private residential program specializing in children  with autism that was more suitable for his needs so he could get what  he needed for his development.   His parents applied to the school district for reimbursement, as was  appropriate, but the school district refused. His parents went to  court, and an administrative judge and a district judge both ruled that  the school did not provide Luke with the necessary education to meet  the needs that IDEA required. However, Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of  the school district, saying that all the school district had to do was  provide an education that was more than just the bare minimum--just the  bare minimum. He set a very low bar for Luke and for students like  Luke, like my nephew Barry.   Just to show how disconnected Judge Gorsuch is from the lives of  everyday Americans, look at the Supreme Court ruling which occurred at  the same time as Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearings. In a different  case on the very same issue, the Supreme Court challenged and rejected  the standard and interpretation that Judge Gorsuch believed should be  provided for children and students with disabilities. They unanimously  rejected the standard that he approved. This is not the view of a  mainstream nominee. This is not the view of a mainstream nominee.   I am also deeply concerned about Judge Gorsuch's opinions and how  they could affect women's access to healthcare. In the Tenth Circuit's  Hobby Lobby decision, Judge Gorsuch endorsed the idea that corporations  can deny their employees access to essential healthcare services,  including birth control. His concurring opinion suggested that he  supported the notion that for-profit corporations have the right to  deny women insurance coverage or any form of contraception an employer  disagrees with. This is both alarming and unacceptable. It once again  shows how disconnected Judge Gorsuch is from what women in Michigan and  around the country experience.   Judge Gorsuch did not recognize the impact of denying coverage to  women employees and their families, and putting those decisions in the  hands of their employers. Women in Michigan should not have to pay  higher costs for healthcare than men, and they should not be denied  essential healthcare services. These dangerous interpretations will  continue to take us down a path of permitting and protecting  discrimination by corporations and institutions over the rights of  workers and consumers. Again, that is not a mainstream nominee.   When it comes to supporting women--not just in healthcare, but in the  workplace--Judge Gorsuch has had some extremely troubling rulings. In  2003, a woman named Betty Pinkerton experienced several instances of  disgusting sexual harassment from a male supervisor at the Colorado  Department of Transportation. Every time she made it clear his comments  were not acceptable in any way, they continued over the course of  months.   She went to her office's civil rights staff and submitted a written  complaint, and he was removed as her supervisor. She was fired about a  week  [[Page S2354]]  later. She sued. But Judge Gorsuch upheld a ruling that claimed she  waited too long--she waited too long to report harassment--and believed  that Pinkerton's firing was performance based--How often do we hear  that in these situations?--despite not being able to produce any real  evidence that this was the case. He ruled that she couldn't go to trial  and present her case in front of a jury.   So when it comes to protecting women in the workplace, we know that  Judge Gorsuch has come up short. This is not a mainstream position and  not acceptable, in my judgment, for any Supreme Court nominee, and not  acceptable for what I want to see happen for the people in Michigan.   I wish to end my speech on the importance of consensus because that  is what we should do here. That is how we get things done.   For decades, we have confirmed our Supreme Court nominees with  consultation and consensus. We have said--and I think it is the right  thing--that we should have to have more than just a simple majority to  confirm judges to the highest Court in the land for a lifetime  appointment. So it makes sense that we come together to do that. In  fact, seven of the eight current U.S. Supreme Courts Justices on the  bench today received 60 votes or more somewhere in their process--both  President Bush's and President Obama's nominees, as well, those now on  the Court.   President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama talked to  Senators from both parties about their picks to get input as to whom  would likely be supported and not supported. This did not happen with  Judge Gorsuch. President Trump had a list chosen by very narrow special  interests and did not ask opinions of key people on our side of the  aisle as to what would make sense to get the consensus to get 60 votes.   I do not believe Judge Gorsuch will be fair and impartial, giving a  fair shot to the workers and families in Michigan as well as around the  country. My test is very much about what is best for the people I  represent in Michigan. Who will be fair and impartial and give them a  fair shot?   Because I do not believe he can do that, I cannot support his  nomination. He is not the right choice for this vacancy. We can come  together. I urge my colleagues to go back to the drawing board and  bring in a consensus mainstream nominee.   In the past, we have basically had a practical rule of saying if the  nominee cannot get 60 votes, we change the nominee. We don't change the  rules. It is extremely concerning that this would not be the approach  at this time.   I urge that we come together, get a mainstream nominee, and be able  to work together to get this done.
