 I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am reading a book called ``These  Truths''  [[Page S1821]]  by Jill Lepore. It is a history of the United States. She is a really  gifted historian and writes quite a few things. She has an article in  the New Yorker magazine about Eugene V. Debs, an early Socialist in the  20th century who ran for President. She is a skillful historian, and  she tells a story in ``These Truths'' about how this Nation came to be.   Of course, we emerged from a colony--a colony of England, Great  Britain--and then fought for our independence. One of the reasons we  fought for independence was to take the role of Kings out of the lives  of the people who lived in what we call America and to say we aren't  going to have Kings making decisions for us here. We will make our own  decisions. Thank you. We will call it a democracy, and the people will  rule.    At that point, we sat down and tried to put it in writing. The first  time we put it in writing, it didn't work out too well. The Articles of  Confederation really didn't unite our country and move it in the  direction that most people wanted. So the constitutional convention  followed. The constitutional convention in Philadelphia sat down and  wrote this document, the Constitution of the United States, and here we  are, over 200 years later, still living by those words that were  written over 200 years ago.   There were efforts to change and amend it to reflect changes in  America. The end of slavery, for example, was one of the most  significant, but, by and large, the principles of this document have  guided us for a long time.   Article I, section 8 gives the Congress--the Senate and the House-- the power to declare war. You think to yourself: Well, it is certainly  better for the Congress to make that decision than for a President to  do it alone. Letting a President do it without the people being  involved, or Congress, really would be much like a King deciding  whether we would go forward as a nation to be involved in a war.   This week, on the floor of the Senate, we will test that provision in  the Constitution and see if the current Members of the Senate believe  that the Constitution was right and that the Congress should be  declaring war.   My colleagues, Bernie Sanders, well-known to most across America,  Mike Lee, a conservative Republican from Utah, and Chris Murphy, a  Democrat from Connecticut, have decided that we should have a test vote  as to the United States' involvement in Saudi Arabia's bloody war in  Yemen. I am glad to be a cosponsor of that legislation.   Regardless of who has been in the White House during the time that I  have served in the House and the Senate, I have tried to consistently  argue that the American people, through their elected Congress, must  play a constitutional role in declaring a war--whether it was President  Bush on the Iraq war or President Obama on the U.S. military  intervention in Syria or Libya.   I think the Constitution is very clear and very wise in saying that  the American people, before we ask their sons and daughters to give up  their lives in a war, should have a say in these decisions through  their elected Members of Congress.   What we are doing today is deeply important. It occurs in the 18th  year of a war in Afghanistan that hardly anyone could have imagined  would be the case. Did anyone here who voted, as I did, 18 years ago-- 18 years ago, voting in this Chamber--for the authorization of the use  of force in Afghanistan to go after the perpetrators of 9/11 believe  that we were authorizing the longest war in the history of the United  States, in Afghanistan--I am sure not a one--or that this authorization  would be stretched by Presidents of both political parties to approve  U.S. military action in other countries around the world? It became a  blanket authorization that has been used time and again.   This brings me to the question before us in the Senate today--the  disastrous, bloody war, led by the Saudi Arabians in Yemen, which the  United States is supporting.   Has there been a vote in the Senate for that? No. In the House? No.  Does anyone here remember authorizing any U.S. military involvement in  the war in Yemen? Well, they certainly couldn't find a recorded vote to  prove it.   Did anyone who voted in 2001, as I did, to go after the terrorists  responsible for 9/11, believe that this would somehow include a Saudi- led quagmire in Yemen?   This war in Yemen is being led by a reckless young Saudi Crown  Prince, whom I believe had direct involvement in the brutal murder of a  journalist and resident of the United States, Jamal Khashoggi. It is  highly unlikely that anybody would have argued that we gave permission  for the U.S. Military and taxpayers' dollars to be spent in support of  this Saudi Arabian cause.   Not only was this war never authorized by elected representatives or  the American people, but it is a humanitarian disaster. An estimated  85,000 children have already died of malnutrition. We have created a  famine with this war in Yemen. In a country of 28 million people,  nearly half face death through famine.   I have a photo here, which I have displayed once on the floor, but I  can't bring myself to do it again. It is a photo of a 7-year-old Yemeni  girl, Amal Hussain. It is a heartbreaking photo. It appeared in the New  York Times last November. This little girl died shortly thereafter. She  starved to death. I just can't bring myself to display this photo  again.   Do you know what her mother said after she died? It is what any  mother would say: ``My heart is broken.''   This is a reality of the war that the United States supports in  Yemen. We have not debated it. We have not approved it. Yet taxpayers'  dollars make certain that it continues day after day, week after week,  month after month, and year after year.   Now, let's take a look at Saudi Arabia, which has asked us to join in  this effort in Yemen that is causing such a humanitarian disaster. This  is the same Saudi Arabia--the nation that conducted the cold-blooded  murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a nation that is detaining and torturing  women's rights activists, including Loujain al-Hathoul and Samar  Badawi. This is a nation that is detaining and torturing U.S. citizen  Dr. Walid Fitaihi. It is jailing Saudi blogger Raif Badawi and his  lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, on charges that are ridiculous on their  face.   Saudi Arabia is accused of recruiting and using Sudanese children as  soldiers in the war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia continues to turn a blind  eye to the export of extremist teachings that have shown up and caused  great harm around the world, most recently in Bosnia and Kosovo.   There may be some who think this war is justified. I am not one of  them. There may be some who think that because Iran is the enemy, we  should be engaged in this war. But, ultimately, this war, this debate,  and this vote are not about the merits of any of the things that I have  raised. It is not about a vindication of the Houthis, whom the Iranians  have sided with, and their troubling role in this horrific civil war.  It is about whether we in the Senate, who took an oath to uphold and  defend the Constitution, believe it. If we don't believe it, we will  just ignore it, let our military wage the war, let the President look  the other way, and let this administration come up with another excuse  for Saudi Arabia killing that journalist, and we will keep sending our  tax dollars in, which prolong this terrible war.   I think the Constitution requires more of us. If you truly believe in  what the President is asking us to do in Yemen, if you truly want to  stand with Saudi Arabia at this moment in history, show the courage by  voting that way. That is all I am asking for.   Our Founding Fathers showed great wisdom. They knew that the decision  to send someone's son or daughter into a war was not to be made by a  King or a supreme executive but by the people--the people of the United  States. So our Constitution wisely rests that responsibility with us-- the Senators and Members of the House of Representatives.   Today, there will be a recorded vote--a historic vote--as to whether  we go forward with this involvement in the war in Yemen. I will be  voting against any more involvement by the United States in this war.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  is necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 44, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 46 Ex.]                                  YEAS--55       Alexander      Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Manchin      McConnell      McSally      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sinema      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--44       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Jones      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               Murray           The nomination was confirmed.
