 Mr. Speaker, what is happening in Washington? With the  holidays coming up, I would like to know why the Republican majority  seems so intent on putting coal in the stockings of everyday Americans.   Last week, the House passed a continuing resolution that did little  but move the threat of a government shutdown to just a few days before  Christmas.   The Republican tax bill is a brazen attempt to put money in the  pockets of the superwealthy and well-connected at the expense of  seniors, our students, middle class families, and hardworking  Americans.   The American people don't deserve this tax hike. It is a  billionaires-first Republican tax scam, and they don't deserve a  government that reels from shutdown crisis to crisis doing nothing but  creating uncertainty in our country.   What we should be doing is fixing CHIP. The Children's Health  Insurance Program provides real, permanent tax relief to those who need  it most: our 9 million children, 250,000 in my district.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. They deserve better  jobs, better wages, and a better future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Congresswoman Esty, for leading this Special Order hour and for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I will never forget the Sandy Hook tragedy that happened  5 years ago tomorrow. It was like yesterday.   I was at Harvard University. I was seated next to Congresswoman Esty  when the news broke about the shooting in the district she had just  been elected to serve.   The more we learned that day, the more devastating and heartbreaking  the news became. Innocent children were taken away from their parents,  from their brothers and sisters, and from their community.   I hoped and prayed that day that we would never see a tragedy like  Sandy Hook. But, of course, our country continues to be unique in the  number of people we have lost to mass shootings and gun violence.   As a Member of Congress, I cannot stand by and allow our communities  to continue to be upturned by the loss of innocent lives. There are too  many things we can do to address this epidemic.   We should allow Federal agencies to study gun violence as a public  health crisis, because it is. We should keep guns out of the hands of  individuals on the terrorist watch list and those convicted of hate  crimes. We should close the gun show loopholes, Mr. Speaker, and  reinstate the assault weapons ban.   You will note that none of the proposals I just mentioned would in  any way infringe on the Second Amendment or limit the ability of  Americans to protect themselves or their families. So there should be  no reason why our Republican colleagues can't join us and pass sensible  reforms that will save lives, like the lives we could have saved at  Sandy Hook.   I hope and pray that this Congress has the courage to curb this  epidemic of gun violence, because I don't want to continue to see the  Sandy Hooks, the Charleston Nines, the Orlandos, or what we saw this  year in cities like Las Vegas or small towns like Sutherland Springs.   One of the things we can do to honor the memory of the victims of  those tragedies and all victims of gun violence is to make sure that no  more families have to experience the same senseless loss.   Again, I thank my colleague and friend for being courageous and for  standing up and fighting for better gun laws so that we can save lives.  I thank her for being a champion and leading tonight's effort.
