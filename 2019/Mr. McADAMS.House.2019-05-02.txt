 Madam Speaker, I rise to address what, for my  constituents, is an urgent concern: the rising cost of healthcare. I  hear about it everywhere I go.   Healthcare is personal. Having access to quality, affordable care is  central to our quality of life and our ability to decide where we live  and where we work.   At a healthcare townhall I held last week, I heard from people such  as a small business owner who worried that, while the very poor and  wealthy have coverage options, she struggles to find an affordable  policy for her family. She said: Please don't forget about people like  me.   Another woman talked about how complicated her copays were for the  drug treatment prescribed by her doctor, and another asked about the  confusion surrounding billing codes and invoices.   Healthcare is probably the most complex issue we will address in  Congress. My top goals include to ensure that Federal law continues to  protect people with preexisting conditions, to promote coverage and  enrollment, and to find solutions to bring down costs.   I believe that a good first step will be passing three bipartisan  bills to make the drug market more competitive and prices more  transparent:   The CREATES Act, which address an outrageous action by some name- brand companies to unfairly stop generics;   The BLOCKING Act, to stop ``first'' generic drug ``parking''; and   The drug price STAR Act, to improve transparency.   With the cost of prescription drugs increasing dramatically, we need  to take steps now.                            ____________________
