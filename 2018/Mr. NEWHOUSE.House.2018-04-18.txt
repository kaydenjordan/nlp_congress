 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 831 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 831         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House any bill specified in       section 2 of this resolution. All points of order against       consideration of each such bill are waived. The respective       amendments in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Ways and Means now printed in each such bill       shall be considered as adopted. Each such bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in each such bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on each such       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to       final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means;       and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  The bills referred to in the first section of this       resolution are as follows:         (a) The bill (H.R. 5444) to amend the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986 to modernize and improve the Internal Revenue       Service, and for other purposes.        (b) The bill (H.R. 5445) to amend the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986 to improve cybersecurity and taxpayer identity       protection, and modernize the information technology of the       Internal Revenue Service, and for other purposes.        Sec. 3. (a) In the engrossment of H.R. 5444, the Clerk       shall--        (1) await the disposition of H.R. 2901, H.R. 5437, H.R.       5438, H.R. 5439, H.R. 5440, H.R. 5443, H.R. 5445, and H.R.       5446;        (2) add the respective texts of all the bills specified in       paragraph (1), as passed by the House, as new matter at the       end of H.R. 5444;        (3) conform the title of H.R. 5444 to reflect the addition       to the engrossment of the text of all the bills specified in       paragraph (1) that have passed the House;        (4) assign appropriate designations to provisions within       the engrossment; and        (5) conform cross-references and provisions for short       titles within the engrossment.        (b) Upon the addition to the engrossment of H.R. 5444 of       the text of the bills specified in subsection (a)(1) that       have passed the House, such bills shall be laid on the table.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 831, providing for consideration of  two important pieces of legislation: H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act;  and H.R. 5445, the 21st Century IRS Act.   The rule provides for consideration of these measures under a closed  rule. Both of these pieces of legislation were introduced with  bipartisan cosponsors, and both were passed out of the Ways and Means  Committee with unanimous support on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday was not only tax day, but it was also the last  time the American people had to file their taxes under an outdated and  antiquated system. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law  by President Trump, Americans have much to look forward to: a  simplified tax system, lower rates, a doubled child tax credit to help  everyday families, a doubling of the standard deduction, and the  freedom to buy the healthcare plan that is right for their families  rather than be forced to buy government-mandated health insurance.   As these reforms continue to be implemented, and Americans across the  country have begun to see their paychecks grow and small businesses  begin to move forward with less regulatory burden, a bipartisan effort  in the U.S. House of Representatives to modernize and reform the  Internal Revenue Service has arisen. The goal is to redesign the IRS  into a modern, 21st century agency focused on the ``taxpayers first''  service--reining in IRS abuses, protecting American taxpayers from  fraud, and fairly and efficiently resolving disputes within the agency.   H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act, demonstrates a bipartisan,  comprehensive effort to modernize and improve the Internal Revenue  Service. This legislation makes numerous changes to reorganize the  agency in an attempt to focus its efforts on customer service. It  creates an independent appeals process to improve dispute resolutions  and requires the IRS to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan to  improve its customer service strategy. It requires the  [[Page H3406]]  agency to maintain the IRS Free File Program, equipping low- and  middle-income Americans with free individual tax preparation and  electronic filing services.   This legislation also requires the IRS to improve efficiency, enhance  cybersecurity, and better meet the needs of taxpayers. By ensuring the  agency sends notice to the actual taxpayer before contacting friends,  neighbors, or clients when conducting an audit, we can ensure Americans  receive fair notice and treatment.   Mr. Speaker, the mission statement of the IRS is to provide America's  taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their  tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and fairness to  all. Unfortunately, in far too many cases, the IRS fails to provide the  quality customer service they claim to strive for.   The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office reported in 2015  that the IRS had no strategy in place to define what quality and  customer service should look like, nor did the agency have any plans to  develop one. This is unacceptable, so I am pleased that the Taxpayer  First Act requires the IRS to work to fulfill their mission statement.   The 21st Century IRS Act similarly seeks to modernize the IRS by  specifically focusing on improving cybersecurity and taxpayer identity  protection as well as reforming the information technology systems  within the agency. The IRS relies heavily on an aging, antiquated IT  infrastructure to administer the tax system. This infrastructure, some  of which dates back to the 1960s, is unreliable and is not keeping up.   As we just saw yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the web page for paying tax  bills using personal bank accounts crashed, leading to Treasury  Secretary Mnuchin having to provide Americans with an extra day to file  their returns. We must bring the IRS's infrastructure into the 21st  century in order to prevent negative impacts on taxpayers seeking to  comply with their tax responsibilities as we witnessed yesterday.                                time  1230    Unfortunately, these potential threats can include much more serious  threats as well, including potential cyber attacks and fraud schemes  that seek to exploit stolen taxpayer information.   The 21st Century IRS Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to  work collaboratively with the public and private sectors to protect  taxpayers from identity theft tax refund fraud. This legislation also  requires the Secretary to submit a written report to Congress  describing how the IRS can utilize new payment platforms to increase  the number of tax refunds paid by electronic funds transfers, thereby  streamlining the final leg of the filing process for taxpayers.   It provides for further recommendations regarding methods to prevent  identity theft and refund fraud and requires that State, local, or  Federal agencies conduct on-site reviews every 3 years of all  contractors or other agents receiving Federal returns and return  information.   These reforms are common sense and will prevent frustrating,  prolonged interactions with the IRS that could be much more easily and  seamlessly resolved online.   Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward and bipartisan rule, allowing  for consideration of two bills that will require the Internal Revenue  Service to put customer service needs of the American taxpayer first,  and to reform, modernize, and improve the agency's infrastructure.   The IRS must prioritize cybersecurity and taxpayer identity theft  protections. The underlying bills in this rule will do just that, and I  encourage my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  legislation to continue our historic efforts to reform our Nation's tax  system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, sit on the Rules Committee, and  what we witnessed Monday was an amazing thing, coming together in a  bipartisan fashion on some very important bills to bring reform to the  Internal Revenue Service.   And I might respond to the gentleman's comments.   It was a very open process through the Ways and Means Committee. It  was, as far as I recall, at least a 3-year process, working  bipartisanly, very cooperatively, in a comprehensive fashion in order  to get the work done that was brought together and culminated with the  work that we see here today.   So, as far as an open process, I don't know what could have been more  open. It was one that we can be proud of, one that we should see more  of in this institution, frankly, and I am very proud that we are able  to be here today, following a long history of using the closed rule  process when we are considering these kinds of bills as it pertains to  revenue.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Ways and Means Committee put out a discussion draft on March 26  entitled, ``The Taxpayer First Act.'' The committee provided 2 weeks to  collect input from Members, stakeholder groups, and the public. I would  say to my good friends across the aisle that there were a number of  substantive comments received, and my understanding is the committee  considered them prior to introducing this bill that we have today.   So I would say let's honor that work. Let's move forward with this  important piece of legislation, and I urge support of the rule.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Reclaiming my time, the bipartisan effort in this bill  is reflected in a very, very good way, and I urge respecting that  process, respecting the comprehensive, collaborative work that was done  on this bill, and I urge support of the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the many groups that are  supporting H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act, as well as the group  supporting H.R. 5445, the 21st Century IRS Act.   For the Taxpayer First Act, the Americans for Tax Reform, the  Coalition for Effective and Efficient Tax Administration, the National  Foreign Trade Council, and the App Association support the Taxpayer  First Act.   As far as the 21st Century Act, H.R. 5445, Citizens Against  Government Waste, the Electronic Transactions Association, the  MarketPlace Lending Association, the National Taxpayers Union, the  Taxpayers Protection Alliance, FreedomWorks, the Institute for Policy  Innovation, 60 Plus Association, the Institute for Liberty, the Council  for Citizens Against Government Waste, Less Government, and the Small  Business & Entrepreneurship Council all join us in supporting not only  the underlying rule, but the underlying legislation, as I would urge my  colleagues to do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Yes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  have come together to work on the important issues covered in both of  these underlying bills. This rule provides for consideration of H.R.  5444, the Taxpayer First Act, as well as H.R. 5445, the 21st Century  IRS Act.   The IRS currently lacks a comprehensive customer service strategy,  nor does it have any system in place to measure metrics and benchmarks  for success within customer service. Additionally, the IRS has not  undergone organizational restructuring in the last 20 years.   H.R. 5444 requires the agency to develop a comprehensive strategy for  customer service and to submit such plan to Congress no later than 1  year after the enactment of this legislation. It provides for the  equitable treatment of every American taxpayer, including ensuring  proper notice when the IRS seeks further information from an  individual.   Mr. Speaker, the IRS spends $2.4 billion, annually, on information  technology, technology that, in some cases, dates back, I understand,  to the 1960s. The agency struggles with undertaking and completing  large IT modernization efforts to update its legacy systems, which,  therefore, can put American taxpayers in a frustrating or even  dangerous position.   With the rise of tax refund fraud, a modern IT system must be enacted  to ensure taxpayers can successfully comply with their tax  requirements. H.R. 5445 modernizes and improves the ease and efficiency  of the taxpayer experience when filing taxes, retrieving information,  resolving issues, and making payments.   This legislation includes a number of provisions to strengthen the  IRS' ability to proactively combat identity theft, tax refund fraud,  and ensures IRS accountability for secure online taxpayer processes.   In light of the historic tax reform legislation initiated by this  representative body, the people's House, and signed into law by the  President, President Trump, just last year, it is vital the Internal  Revenue Service undertake its own important reforms.                                time  1300    No one enjoys receiving an envelope stamped ``Internal Revenue  Service.'' Far too often, taxpayers find the IRS to be inaccessible,  intimidating, and unaccountable. American taxpayers deserve a robust  and efficient agency with important oversight protections and  modernized systems to keep their private information protected.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak in favor of this bipartisan rule,  and I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 831, and both of  the underlying bipartisan bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 831 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.  [[Page H3410]]
