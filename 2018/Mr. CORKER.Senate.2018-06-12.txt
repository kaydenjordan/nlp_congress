 Mr. President, I rise to speak on the NDAA bill that is  before us today.   I think most people know that we have been engaged in some tariff  discussions with other countries through the administration. We have a  trade act of 1974 and one of 1962 that have laid out provisions as to  how we would go about dealing with tariffs. In section 232 there is a  place which states that the President of the United States can declare  something a national security issue. When he does that, it keeps him  from having to go through the normal process that one goes through in  dealing with tariffs.   Typically, when the President chooses a section of the trade act, he  has to go through a process. When he decides that he wants to put a  tariff in place on another country, he has to go to the ITC or some  other entity to show that, somehow or another, the United States has  been harmed as the reason that he would be putting tariffs in place.   What our President has chosen to do in recent times is to declare  that almost everything that he is dealing with relative to tariffs is a  national security issue. When he does that, it means that he does not  have to lay down grounds for having done that. He can just determine  that it is in our national security interests to put in place tariffs  on other countries, whether it is automobiles, whether it is steel,  whether it is aluminum, or whether it is some other issue. He can just  wake up one morning, without going through  [[Page S3741]]  any of those processes, and decide that, on national security grounds,  he is going to put tariffs in place.   Article I of the Constitution declares that Congress is the  determiner on tariffs. Congress, per the Constitution, has been charged  with the ability--actually, the responsibility--to deal with tariffs  and to deal with revenues. It is the responsibility of the Congress.   Because I have been somewhat concerned that we are using this  national security issue just as an ordinary course of business, I have  offered an amendment to deal with that, since this is a national  security bill, which says that the President can continue to deal with  these other countries and he can continue to try to work through trade  agreements, but, at the end of the day, if he actually decides to put  tariffs in place, he would have to come to Congress to get an up-or- down vote.   Because we don't want to slow the administration's ability down too  much in this regard, we have actually put in this amendment an  expedited process so the President would know that we are not going to  drag this out forever, so that when he comes to a conclusion, we will  have acted on it in a timely fashion.   I have done this for another reason; that is, if we as a country  begin claiming that every single item is a national security issue,  other countries will do the same. What they can then do is to avoid the  processes that take place generally in international organizations to  have to prove that, somehow or another, their country has been damaged.  If we use the national security issue to put tariffs on automobiles,  for instance, then, all of a sudden, another country can do the same.   My amendment, by the way, is supported by 17 Senators. It is  supported by Senators on both sides of the aisle. Taking myself out of  it, these are Senators who are very well respected, with a wide range  of ideologies. As a matter of fact, this probably is the most  cosponsored amendment that has been put forward.   I have been really proud to be able to work with Senators who care  deeply about the Nation. They care about us economically. They just  want to make sure that we as a Congress perform our appropriate roles,  making sure that if a tariff is going to be put in place under this  very unusual waiver--which has never in the history of our country been  used as it is now being used by this current President--then we have  the ability to at least have a say in this.    It is not unlike the President going to Singapore and meeting with  Kim Jong Un. What they have told us is that they are going to negotiate  through a process that, hopefully, will cause them to be denuclearized.  But when they complete that process, they plan to bring that to the  U.S. Senate to have us ratify a treaty. They have been very clear about  it. So it is exactly that same kind of process, except in this case it  is even more our responsibility to make sure that if we are going to  tariff people under this unusual section, we vote up or down.   So I am going to call up this amendment. I appreciate the way the  chairman of the committee has worked with me. I know there has been a  lot of resistance to our having a vote on this amendment. I don't know  why that is the case.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2372    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 301, H.R. 2372; that the text  of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019, be offered as an amendment, considered, and agreed to; that H.R.  2372, as amended, be considered original text for the purpose of  further amendment; that the text of Inhofe-McCain No. 2282, as  modified, be made pending as a substitute to the text of H.R. 2372, as  amended; that McConnell-Toomey No. 2700 be made pending to Inhofe- McCain No. 2282, as modified; that Reed-Warren No. 2756 be made pending  as an amendment to Toomey No. 2700 and that Toomey No. 2700 be set  aside; that Corker amendment No. 2381, as modified with changes at the  desk, be made pending to amendment No. 2282; that Lee No. 2366 be made  pending as an amendment to the language proposed to be stricken by  Inhofe-McCain No. 2282; and that the Senate vote on the Corker  amendment at 4 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I am going to make a few comments here.   I thank Senator Inhofe through the Presiding Officer for working with  me. I realize there is a lot happening here, and I know he is  conducting to the best of his ability the progression of this bill. I  will just leave it at that.   Mr. President, I was asked to find a solution to this blue-slip  issue, and I found one that is used as customarily as waking up in the  morning and drinking a cup of coffee. It happens all the time. This in  no way has any effect on our ability to pass the NDAA in a timely  fashion, but I am in no way countering the person who just spoke. I am  not, and he knows I am not.   I am going to speak to a larger issue, but before I do, I want to  point out that the NDAA usually passes each year in November or  December. It usually doesn't pass in June. So even if there were  something that needed to be worked out, we would be way ahead of  schedule in dealing with this as we are between now and August.   But if I could, the germaneness of these bills has nothing whatsoever  to do with our ability to offer amendments--nothing. That is something  that happens postcloture.   For the last year and a half, under Leader McConnell, we have had one  amendment vote--one amendment vote--and that amendment wasn't even  really an amendment. It was a chairman who was controlling his own bill  and asking if he could substitute his own amendment. So it really  wasn't even a real amendment vote.   We have been here a year and a half, and because Senators--U.S.  Senators who are elected by the people in their States--don't want to  cast a tough vote, they block everybody from voting. I have no idea why  Rand Paul cannot get a vote on his amendment. It is ridiculous. He has  been trying to get a vote on it for years--years--and we have blocked  it. Why is that?   For the record, I want to say that I have held amendments this  morning until we could work out the solution. I am not holding any  amendments--none, zero. I am holding no one's amendment. But we, as  Senators, are worried somehow that, gosh almighty--I heard the senior  Senator from Texas saying the other day: Gosh, we might upset the  President. We might upset the President of the United States before the  midterms. Gosh, we can't vote on the Corker amendment because we are  taking--rightly so--the responsibilities that we have to deal with  tariffs and revenues; we can't do that because we would be upsetting  the President of the United States. I can't believe it.   I would bet that 95 percent of the people on this side of the aisle  intellectually support this amendment. I would bet that. I would bet it  is higher than 95 percent, and a lot of them would vote for it if it  came to a vote. But, no, no, no, gosh, we might poke the bear. That is  the language I have been hearing in the hallways. We might poke the  bear. The President might get upset with us, as U.S. Senators, if we  vote on the Corker amendment, so we are going to do everything we can  to block it.   If people don't like it, they can vote up or down. But, no, the U.S.  Senate right now, on June 12, is becoming a body that says: Well, we  will do what we can do, but, my gosh, if the President gets upset with  us, then we might not be in the majority. So let's not do anything that  might upset the President.   Look, I am in no way upset with my friend from Oklahoma. I am not. I  understand he is doing his job, and he is actually filling in, in a  wonderful way, for Senator McCain, who happens to be ill at home-- someone we all love.   Look, I know there is not going to be a vote on this amendment. I  know it. I am not about to hold up somebody else's amendment from being  voted on. I know every ounce of power possible is going to be used to  keep from voting on this amendment because, well, my gosh, the  President might not like it; therefore, we as Senators might be  offending someone, by the way, just by voting on an amendment--voting  on an amendment, up or down, and deciding whether we, in fact, want to  assert some responsibility over a process of tariffing, where we wake  up, ready, fire, aim. Well, let's change this. Ready, fire, aim--that  is the process that is under way on these tariffs.   I haven't heard of a single Senator on our side who hasn't expressed  concern to the President directly about what is happening with tariffs.  Our farm folks are worried about NAFTA. Our auto manufacturers are  worried about Canada and Mexico and what is happening in Europe. Our  steel and aluminum folks are concerned. I haven't heard of a person who  hasn't had some degree of concern. All my amendment would do is say:  Look, Mr. President, you go negotiate, but when you are finished, come  back, and as Senators and as House Members, let us vote up or down.    I understand what is happening. If I came up with another solution,  there would be some objection, and my friend knows that. There is going  to be an objection. Hell, if we named this--no matter what, there is  going to be an objection to this vote because people are concerned on  this side of the aisle--some people, not everybody. We have some great  cosponsors who want to assume our responsibilities. We have a lot of  great cosponsors who understand that we are abdicating our  responsibilities if we let the President of the United States use a  national security section 232 on every single tariff he is putting in  place and not have to think about why he is doing it and not have to  justify why he is doing it. They know that is a problem, and some of  the most respected Senators we have on both sides of the aisle have  signed on, but I know there is a minority of people here who do not  want us to take up issues of debate and responsibility in the U.S.  Senate.   I know that no matter what I do, this is going to be objected to. I  am not going to object to Rand Paul having an amendment, Mike Lee  having an amendment, Toomey having an amendment, or people on the other  side of the aisle.   I am disappointed at where we are in the U.S. Senate today. We have  had one amendment vote in a year and a half because this same cycle  occurs every time someone wants to bring something up. I in no way take  this out on my friend from Oklahoma. I realize he is doing a job; I  realize he has been asked to block this.   With that, I yield the floor.
