 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fair  Adjudications for Immigrants Act.   This legislation would ensure that immigrants with criminal  convictions do not face barriers to naturalization and experience  unfair removals after their convictions have been dismissed, expunged,  or pardoned by a Federal or State locality.   The Fair Adjudications for Immigrants Act is important in ensuring  immigrants are not unjustly treated after receiving a criminal charge  that never resulted in a conviction or after a previous conviction no  longer stands.   Specifically, this bill would ensure that immigrants whose  convictions have been overturned are not penalized when they are no  longer considered valid in the court of conviction or for sentences  that have been fully suspended by the sentencing court.   By redefining the term ``conviction'' in the Immigration and  Nationality Act, this legislation also clarifies that any adjudication  that is appealable or in which the court has issued a judicial  recommendation against removal or probation without judgment will not  count as a conviction.   The bill would apply retroactively to any conviction, adjudication,  or judgement entered before, on, or after the enactment of this bill.  Finally, it establishes that an immigrant cannot be removed on the  basis of a conviction if the sentencing court issues a recommendation  against removal to the Secretary of Homeland Security.   Under current law, rather than having access to many rehabilitative  measures that are afforded in the criminal justice system, immigrants  with dismissed criminal charges, suspended sentences, or criminal  convictions that are no longer considered valid in the court of  conviction still face severe consequences in the immigration court  system.   Some of the immigration consequences that immigrants can face include  unjust removals, mandatory detention, and barriers to naturalization.   It is imperative that we resolve this disparity between immigration  and criminal law to prevent those immigrants with dismissed criminal  charges or with convictions that are no longer considered valid in the  court of conviction from continuing to face punitive immigration  consequences.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Wyden, Mr.          Whitehouse, and Mr. Booker):   S. 1353. A bill to amend section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act  of 1965 in order to allow adjunct faculty members to qualify for public  service loan forgiveness; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions.
