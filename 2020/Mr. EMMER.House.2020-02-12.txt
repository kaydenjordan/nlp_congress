 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Liberty Clark in  Elk River, Minnesota, for receiving an award from Enterprise Minnesota  for attaining their ISO 9001:2015 certification.   Liberty Clark specializes in precision pad printing for medical  device and industrial manufacturers, and this certification verifies to  their clients that they are a reliable producer of high-quality  products.   The medical device industry in Minnesota employs over 30,000  Minnesotans, driving our State's economy by producing devices that save  lives. Recently, I was able to tour Liberty Clark and see firsthand how  remarkable this company is and how it is contributing to the  marketplace.   Liberty Clark's ISO certification, paired with the end-of-the-year  repeal  [[Page H1052]]  of the medical device tax, are two important indicators that our best  days of medical innovation are ahead for our manufacturers, as well as  the millions of Americas who rely on lifesaving medical devices.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate everyone at Liberty Clark on achieving  this certification, and I thank them for being one of the best  manufacturers in Minnesota.                        Honoring Reverend Gordon Grimm     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Reverend  Gordon ``Gordy'' Grimm, who passed away last month at the age of 86.   Reverend Grimm was an ordained Lutheran minister and a leader in the  field of addiction recovery in Minnesota. Through his work with the  Hazelden Foundation, he pioneered the Minnesota model of treatment,  which revolutionized addiction treatment and brought dignity to  recovering alcoholics and addicts.   Reverend Grimm's work was recognized on the national stage. President  Ronald Reagan selected him as a part of the White House Conference for  a Drug Free America. He also served as a goodwill ambassador in  Minnesota and alongside First Ladies Betty Ford and Rosalynn Carter at  the United States Capitol.   Reverend Grimm was known not only for his work but for his kindness.  A colleague described him as a man with ``no sharp elbows, only open  arms.'' His life's work touched so many in need.   We offer our condolences to his wife, Esther; his three children,  John, Mary, and Jim; and the many who knew and were impacted by  Reverend Gordon.   Mr. Speaker, Reverend Gordon's legacy lives on through his family and  all the people he helped. I thank him for a life well-lived.             Recognizing Braxton Battaglia, a True Minnesota Hero     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Braxton Battaglia  of Blaine, Minnesota.   Braxton is a 10-year-old gymnast who is currently fighting B-cell  acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite the overwhelming nature of a  diagnosis like this, Braxton has shown a drive to overcome by focusing  on others and starting the TeamBrax1 Fund, an effort designed to help  other kids and families at the University of Minnesota Masonic  Children's Hospital.   Not surprisingly, Braxton has been recognized for her strength and  heart for service. The University of Minnesota's gymnastics program  presented her with the Abby Szott Courage Award, which recognizes an  individual's incorporation of gymnastics to overcome major life  obstacles. She also recently received her very own spot in the  University of Minnesota Gymnastics Hall of Fame.   Braxton is an inspiration to everyone. While she is currently in  remission, her will to fight will remain as strong as ever. Her  chemotherapy continues until 2021.   We will all continue to pray for Braxton and her family.   Mr. Speaker, Braxton inspires us all to help others, even in the  midst of our own challenges. I thank Braxton, and may God continue to  bless her and her family in the months and years ahead.                 Congratulating Scandia Internet Focus Group     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Scandia  Internet Focus Group for receiving the Good Neighbor Award for their  efforts to secure additional funding for broadband expansion in  Scandia, Minnesota.   Because of the focus group's efforts, more than half a million  dollars will go toward building out internet service for more than 200  homes through the State's Border-to-Border Broadband Development Grant  Program.   Building out broadband to the last mile will give unserved and  underserved communities access to the digital world, allowing access to  vital educational resources, telehealth services, and an increasing  amount of commerce done online.   Thanks to the Scandia Internet Focus Group, this service will meet  and exceed the State's goals for 2022 and 2026.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Steve Kronmiller, Patti Ray, Beth Mohr,  Eric Mohr, Aron Larson, Christopher Johnson, Chris Frymire, Jesse  Pereboom, Travis Waite, Kristen Novaak, John Carney, and Andy Brogan.                            ____________________
