 Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Volunteer  Responder Incentive Protection Act with my friend and colleague from  Maryland, Senator Cardin, which will benefit the brave women and men  who volunteer at our local firehouses.   Across our Nation, volunteer firefighters play a critical role in  helping to ensure the safety of our communities and the well-being of  our neighbors. The State of Maine, for example, has approximately 9,785  firefighters who serve the State's 1.3 million citizens. Maine is  largely a rural State, and more than 90 percent of firefighters are  volunteers. Without these public-spirited citizens, many smaller  communities would be unable to provide firefighting and other emergency  services at all.   Often, communities seek to recruit and retain volunteers by offering  modest benefits. The legislation we are introducing today would support  these efforts by helping to ensure that these nominal benefits to  volunteers are not treated as regular employee compensation.   The Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Act would allow  communities to provide volunteer firefighters and Emergency Medical  Service, or EMS workers, with up to $600 per year of property tax  reductions or other incentives, without those benefits being subject to  Federal income tax and withholding. This would ease the administrative  burden that local departments sometimes face when they reward their  volunteers.   We should take care to protect our volunteer firefighters who serve  this country with such bravery. Our legislation would help us achieve  that goal, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.                            ____________________
