 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4182, the  EQUALS Act.   My Republican colleagues have offered a legislative solution to a  problem that does not exist.   The Oversight Committee has not held a single hearing to examine the  existing one-year probationary period.   Yet, this legislation would double the probationary period. In the  process, it would degrade the due process rights of these employees.   These due process protections are critical to protecting  whistleblowers who report waste, fraud, and abuse.   For example, the Oversight Committee has examined retaliation against  whistleblowers at the Transportation Security Administration.   In one case, a career official and disabled veteran testified before  the Oversight Committee that he was removed from consideration for a  Senior Executive Service position during his probationary period  because he reported misconduct by top leaders at TSA including sexual  harassment.   During his interview with Committee staff, this senior career  official explained that extending the probationary period would make it  easier for agencies to retaliate against other whistleblowers in the  future.   The House of Representatives should not approve legislation that  would allow more retaliation against whistleblowers at federal  agencies.   Apart from the negative effects, we have seen no reason to adopt this  bill. We have seen no problem that needs to be addressed.   As I said, the Oversight Committee never held a hearing on this bill.   We have not determined whether doubling the probationary period would  help agencies deal with poor performers or further their missions.   We have not seen any evidence that federal agencies need a blanket  one-year extension of the probationary period for every single federal  job.   Instead, a recent GAO report recommended that the Office of Personnel  Management actually study whether expanding the probationary period  makes sense. GAO found that OPM should, and I quote:         Determine whether there are occupations in which . . . the       probationary period should extend beyond 1-year to provide       supervisors with sufficient time to assess an individual's       performance.    I agree with GAO that a study needs to be conducted first.   But our Republican colleagues want to skip this step. They want to  skip any real examination of the issue and just add another year of  probation during which employees have limited rights.   Some of my colleagues cite the fact that Congress passed a two-year  probationary period for Department of Defense civilian employees in the  National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2016.   However, I would like to note two important facts.   First, the Defense Department did not request this change in the  probationary period or indicate any need for it.   Second, the Department is not even using this new authority.   The Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness,  Peter Levine, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in  March. He stated, and I quote, ``the Department has done little to take  advantage of that legislation.''   Mr. Levin warned that changing the law to address a small number of  problem employees could hurt recruitment and retention and worker  productivity. He stated, and I quote:         ``If legislation that is intended to address a problem with       one percent of the workforce is perceived as threatening and       hostile by the other 99 percent, it may undermine morale and       reduce the Department's ability to attract and retain the       capable employees that it needs.''    Before damaging protections for whistleblowers, we should first  determine whether an extension of the probationary period is needed at  all.   We should also determine whether it is appropriate for all federal  service occupations or only certain occupations.
