 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California. I  rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 57. This is a resolution to disapprove  of the CFPB auto lending rules. I oppose this, Mr. Speaker, because I  believe U.S. markets should be free from fraud and from schemes like  the auto lending scheme to which we have been subjected as Americans. I  oppose because I don't think Americans should be discriminated against;  and then, when they are discriminated against, the guilty parties have  no consequences. I think they need to be caught, punished, and the  victims made whole.   The gentleman from Texas talked about the research that went into  cross-matching ZIP Codes and surnames as if these technologies don't  benefit all of us. We know down to the block where our voters are, who  they are, what race they are, what gender they are, and who they are  likely to vote for. So it is no great technological feat that these  auto dealers could figure out who to discriminate against.   I oppose this because I, too, was one of those Black people who lived  in one of those ZIP Codes, and I was discriminated against in my car  loan. The CFPB thankfully pursued justice and got my money back, which  I needed.   This resolution is everything wrong with the GOP agenda: rewarding  fraudsters, hooksters, charlatans, and donors while ignoring the needs  and the will of Americans.   We are seeing a buildup of subprime auto loans. Haven't we learned  our lesson? Why would an entrepreneur go into inventing something or  innovating something when they can just make their money with these  predatory lending practices. Why invest in infrastructure and  transportation when you can use opaque financial markets and dirty  practices to turn people's desperation into misery-fueled profits.   They say history rhymes, Mr. Speaker. And it will be like the housing  crisis but with cars. Voting for this resolution is a vote against good  financial market practices, fairness, and against Americans.                                time  1530
