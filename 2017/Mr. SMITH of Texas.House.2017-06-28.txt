 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  gentleman from Georgia, a member of the Rules Committee, for yielding  me time.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the underlying bill, H.R. 3003, No  Sanctuary for Criminals Act; and I thank the chairman, Bob Goodlatte,  and Representatives Steve King and Andy Biggs for introducing it.   This legislation keeps dangerous criminal immigrants off our streets  and out of our neighborhoods, and it holds sanctuary cities accountable  for breaking Federal immigration laws. I have a special interest in  this legislation because it enforces a bill I sponsored in 1969, which  was enacted into law and made sanctuary cities illegal.   The American people sent a clear message to Congress last November  when they elected a President who promised to enforce our immigration  laws. A recent poll shows that 80 percent--80 percent--of voters want  cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes to be required to turn  them over to immigration authorities. Eighty percent. That is a  Harvard-Harris poll.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is a down payment on our pledge to  protect innocent Americans from criminal immigrants who deserve to be  jailed or sent back to their home countries. We need to enact this  legislation. There is simply no excuse for local governments to ignore  immigration laws at the expense of American's safety and well-being.
