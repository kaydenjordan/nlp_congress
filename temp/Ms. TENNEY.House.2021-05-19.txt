 Madam Speaker, it is my great honor to recognize my  constituent services director, Jason Phelps, of New Hartford, New York,  for 20 years of outstanding service to the people of upstate New York.   Jason began his service as an intern for former Congressman Sherry  Boehlert in Washington, D.C., and, after a short time working for a  nonprofit, became a member of Boehlert's Utica staff, where he  dedicated himself to veterans' case work. Jason has worked for five  different Members of Congress in the Mohawk Valley and has served  countless veterans across the region.   No matter how complex the case, Jason is always ready to jump in to  assist our veterans. From cutting through VA red tape, to making sure a  veteran and their family receives the Purple Heart they earned through  their service, Jason approaches each case with determination and  compassion.   Not only is Jason an amazing veterans' advocate, he is also a role  model and an inspiration to the many staff and interns he has worked  with in all these offices throughout the years.    Jason, thank you for your many years of service to our brave veterans  and for also being the guiding light for our staff and our community.  We all look forward to working with you for many more years to come.                            ____________________
