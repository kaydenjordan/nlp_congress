 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Nebraska's  daughters for Native American Heritage Month, Judi Gaiashkibos, a  descendant of Chief Smoke Maker of the Ponca Nation, who was a  signatory to an early treaty between the United States and the Ponca  people in 1825.   Judi has served as the Executive Director for the Nebraska Commission  on Indian Affairs since 1995, where she focuses on creating  partnerships and coalitions with elected representatives, Tribal  leaders, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions. She has  been the principal liaison to the Nebraska legislature in developing  policy for the State's four federally recognized Tribes and all its  native citizens. In 2006, she was elected as the president of the  Governor's Interstate Indian Council. In fact, Nebraska Governor Pete  Ricketts praised Judi as ``an advocate for Nebraska's first people and  a loyal spokeswoman for their priorities.''   Judi earned a bachelor of arts degree in Human Relations and  completed her master's in Management, both from Doane College in  Nebraska. In 2009, Judy was a lecturer and advisor for the first Native  Daughters Project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of  Journalism and Mass Communications, and is currently an adjunct  professor for the second Native Daughters project, focusing on the  Indian women of Oklahoma.   In her long and distinguished career, Judi has served on many  advisory councils across the State, including the Nebraska Minority  Justice Committee, the P-16 Leadership Council, and the Nebraska  Partners in Prevention Coalition. In 2008, she was appointed to the  University of Nebraska President's Advisory Council.   Additionally, Judi is a member of the Racial Profiling Advisory  Committee, the U.S. Census Advisory Board, the Interchurch Ministries'  Grants to American Indians in Nebraska, the Nebraska Rural Development  Commission, and recently completed a 3-year term on the Board of the  United Way. She is a member of the Sheldon Museum of Art's Advisory  Council and, in 2012, was appointed to the Doane University Board of  Trustees.   Judi is a leader. Because of her courageous leadership, she has  garnered many prestigious awards, including the Douglas County  Historical Society 2009 Door Keeper Award for opening new doorways in  the spirit of unity, equality, and understanding. She was the 2012  recipient of the prestigious Nebraska Humanities Sower Award. She  received the distinguished NEBRASKAlander Award at the 2017 annual  Statehood Dinner.    An enrolled member of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, Judi descends from  a family of great leaders and role models, and credits much of her  success to their love and support. Her mother was born in 1913, and as  a young girl attended the Genoa Indian School. Following this, her  mother returned to the Ponca homelands and served on the Ponca Tribal  Council in her thirties, at a time when non-Indian women were not  serving in these elected positions.   Later, Judi's mother and grandparents moved with her and her 10  brothers and sisters to Norfolk, Nebraska. Her mother and grandmother  took turns working and caring for the family at a time when most women  were not working outside the home. As other Ponca followed them off the  reservation, Judi's mother continued to serve as a leader to many of  them, helping them get settled and find opportunities. Her mother was a  liaison between the two worlds, much like Judi is today.   Eager to share the history of the Ponca, Judi will eagerly tell you  about two key historic moments. The first is the trial of Chief  Standing Bear. After the forced removal of Ponca to Oklahoma and the  ``warm lands,'' Standing Bear began the return journey home to bury his  16-year-old son, keeping a deathbed promise he made. The Ponca were  arrested in Nebraska by General George Crook's soldiers.   On May 12, 1879, Standing Bear won an important victory for himself  and for all Native Americans, stating that he was a person under United  States law. The second significant event in Ponca history was their  Tribal termination in 1966, and the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska's historic  restoration on October 31, 1990.   Judi believes we are all ambassadors for our people, and it is  important that we show up each and every day for duty and live by our  traditional principles. She is motivated each day by a famous quote by  Wilma Mankiller from the Native Daughters publication and the women of  Oklahoma that states, ``The secret of our success is that we never,  never give up.''   We are inspired by the life and example of Judi Gaiashkibos. I can  think of no one more fitting to honor for Native American Heritage  Month.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Les Johnson, who  served as the police chief of the town of Bennington in my district  from 2004 until his untimely death this past August at the age of 51.  He died from head injuries related to an off-duty incident.   People who knew Chief Les Johnson said he had a steady hand and was a  big man with a big heart, and that he was an extremely kind and  thoughtful person. Former Mayor Gordon Mueller recalled how Johnson  worked to bring upgrades to the police department, including finding a  good deal on a car, as the two squad cars were continuously breaking  down. The superintendent of Bennington schools said Johnson would help  with traffic at the beginning of the school year.   These are just a couple of stories representing his faithful service  and work ethic.   Johnson joined the Bennington Police Department as a part-time  officer in 1992. While it is a small department, a big man with a big  heart led it.   Chief Johnson is survived by his wife, Alice Ann of Waterloo, and  daughters, Paxton and Hannah. We send them our prayers and thoughts. We  will miss Chief Johnson.                            ____________________
