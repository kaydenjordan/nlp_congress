 Mr. Speaker, as a police officer and a street cop in  L.A., I have seen the problems that the opioid epidemic has done to our  communities. It has literally destroyed families and hurt our  communities to no end. H.R. 6 is a much-needed display of  bipartisanship to address the ongoing opioid crisis and epidemic.   Many of the issues that have come out of this bill spur development  of national best practices for substance abuse recovery housing and  incorporates my bill, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act, to  establish meaningful penalties for profiteering off other people's pain  and addiction through illicit referrals.
