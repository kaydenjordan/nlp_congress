 Mr. Chairman, I am proud to have helped craft this  year's National Defense Authorization Act. This fiscal year 2020 bill  incorporates ideas from both sides of the aisle to deliver essential  support and a pay raise to our deserving men and women in uniform.   Our bill authorizes $733 billion to provide for a smart and robust  national defense, enhances housing and financial support for military  families, and addresses operational and budgetary threats posed by  climate change.   I was pleased to share with my Armed Services Committee colleagues  the innovative work happening in districts like mine which are home to  some of the military's core training installations. This includes Fort  Bliss' leadership on net-zero energy and ongoing partnership with the  VA that improves soldiers' medical expertise, while also serving our  local veterans.   I was proud to support our vibrant El Paso community by advancing a  community infrastructure support program and ensuring promising  technologies like additive manufacturing, and the unique contributions  of our small businesses that always have a place in building our  national defense.   Finally, our bill enhances diversity and inclusion efforts in our  armed services, improves oversight and accountability of DOD support to  DHS and, yes, blocks the President from robbing finite military  resources for a wall that our military never requested.   This is a bill we can all be proud of. I look forward to casting my  vote in support.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his leadership, and I urge my  colleagues to support it as well.
