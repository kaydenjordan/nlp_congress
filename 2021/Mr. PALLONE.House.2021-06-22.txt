State energy security plans.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1374.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1374, the  Enhancing State Energy Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act  of 2021.   This is a bipartisan bill introduced by my colleagues on the Energy  and Commerce Committee. I thank the bill's sponsors, Energy  Subcommittee Chairman   Bobby Rush and Subcommittee Ranking Member Fred  Upton for their work and leadership on this legislation.   This is an urgent and necessary bipartisan bill. In the wake of the  Colonial Pipeline cyberattack and other recent cyber threats to our  infrastructure, we are reminded of the consequences of physical and  cyber attacks.   H.R. 1374 provides Federal guidance and resources to the States that  are most vulnerable to critical energy infrastructure threats. The  State Energy Program is a popular, bipartisan program designed to  support State energy offices. Funding for the State Energy Program is  used for several energy initiatives, including developing energy  security plans to help prevent disasters from happening and to mitigate  and recover from any damage that does occur.   This bill will help allocate additional resources to further develop  and enhance State energy security plans. The funding provided in this  bill will facilitate the implementation, review, and revision of State  energy security plans while also laying out the criteria for the  contents of those plans.   Mr. Speaker, recent events like the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack  have highlighted the importance of investing in the physical and cyber  security of our energy systems. This legislation passed our committee  and the House with overwhelming support from both Republicans and  Democrats in the last Congress. It also enjoys strong support from the  nonpartisan National Association of State Energy Organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge bipartisan support for this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 482) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  certain programs under part A of title XI of such Act relating to  genetic diseases, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 482         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated $2,000,000 for the period of fiscal years       2022 and 2023 to carry out this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 482.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 482, the Newborn  Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2021.   Newborn screening is a well-established and proven public health  program that identifies certain genetic and functional conditions in  newborns. Each year, almost all of the 3.8 million babies born in the  U.S. are screened for medical conditions that can cause serious  disability or death if not detected and treated early.   Newborn screening includes blood, hearing, and heart screening. While  most families may likely forget this routine testing ever took place,  more than 12,000 families each year will be notified of a positive  screening result and referred for immediate diagnosis and treatment.  Many of these families might not have considered or had access to these  tests without newborn screening. Newborns can appear healthy but,  without warning, can quickly deteriorate due to these undetected  conditions, and that is why these tests are so critical. If diagnosed  early, many of these conditions can be treated and managed  successfully.   In 2008, the original Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act was signed  into law. It established national newborn screening guidelines and  supported the facilitation of newborn screening at the State level.  Before 2008, only 10 States and the District of Columbia required  newborn screening for recommended disorders. Today, all 50 States and  D.C. screen for most or all of these recommended diseases.   This bipartisan program was reauthorized in 2014 and 2019. Those  reauthorizations renewed Federal support to help States to expand and  improve their newborn screening programs.   H.R. 482, before us today, once again renews Federal funds and  activities to assist States in continuing and improving their newborn  screening programs. This bill also supports parent and provider  education and laboratory quality and surveillance.   Newborn screening, Mr. Speaker, is a simple set of tests that can  improve and save the lives of thousands of babies so that they and  their families can grow to live healthy and happy lives. Through the  national expansion of these life-saving health screenings, no baby  should receive inadequate care because of the State that they live in.  With the continuous reauthorization of the Newborn Screening Saves  Lives Act, every baby in the U.S. can have access to equitable  healthcare from the day they are born.   I commend the steadfast champions of this bipartisan legislation-- foremost, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, who has been working on  this for such a long time, and this is something that she and I have  talked about quite a bit, and Congressman Simpson, Congresswoman  Herrera Beutler, and Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark for their  ongoing commitment and leadership toward eliminating preventable  newborn deaths. No newborn should suffer or die from a condition that  can be detected and treated by newborn screening.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the prime sponsor of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I would also ask Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3752) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on injuries and deaths  associated with consumer products and to direct the Secretary of  Commerce to study and report on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on  the travel and tourism industry in the United States.

TITLE II--PROTECTING TOURISM IN THE UNITED STATES       SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.         This title may be cited as the ``Protecting Tourism in the       United States Act''.  [[Page H2943]]            SEC. 202. STUDY AND REPORT ON EFFECTS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON                     TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY IN UNITED STATES.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with       the United States Travel and Tourism Advisory Board and the       head of any other Federal agency the Secretary considers       appropriate, shall complete a study on the effects of the       COVID-19 pandemic on the travel and tourism industry,       including various segments of the travel and tourism       industry, such as domestic, international, leisure, business,       conventions, meetings, and events.        (b) Matters for Consideration.--In conducting the study       required by subsection (a) and the interim study required by       subsection (e)(1), the Secretary shall consider--        (1) changes in employment rates in the travel and tourism       industry during the pandemic period;        (2) changes in revenues of businesses in the travel and       tourism industry during the pandemic period;        (3) changes in employment and sales in industries related       to the travel and tourism industry, and changes in       contributions of the travel and tourism industry to such       related industries, during the pandemic period;        (4) the effects attributable to the changes described in       paragraphs (1) through (3) in the travel and tourism industry       and such related industries on the overall economy of the       United States during the pandemic period and the projected       effects of such changes on the overall economy of the United       States following the pandemic period; and        (5) any additional matters the Secretary considers       appropriate.        (c) Consultation and Public Comment.--In conducting the       study required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall--        (1) consult with representatives of--        (A) the small business sector;        (B) the restaurant or food service sector;        (C) the hotel and alternative accommodations sector;        (D) the attractions or recreations sector;        (E) the travel distribution services sector;        (F) destination marketing organizations;        (G) State tourism offices; and        (H) the passenger air, railroad, and rental car sectors;       and        (2) provide an opportunity for public comment and advice       relevant to conducting the study.

(e) Interim Study and Report.--Not later than 3 months       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, after       consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the United       States Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, shall--        (1) complete an interim study, which shall be based on data       available at the time when the study is conducted and provide       a framework for the study required by subsection (a), on the       effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (as of such time) on the       travel and tourism industry, including various segments of       the travel and tourism industry, such as domestic,       international, leisure, business, conventions, meetings, and       events; and        (2) submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce,       Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and make publicly       available on the website of the Department of Commerce, an       interim report that contains the results of the interim study       required by paragraph (1).        (f) Definitions.--In this section--        (1) the term ``pandemic period'' has the meaning given the       term ``emergency period'' in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5(g)(1)(B)), excluding       any portion of such period after the date that is 1 year       after the date of the enactment of this Act;        (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Commerce;       and        (3) the term ``travel and tourism industry'' means the       travel and tourism industry in the United States.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3752.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3752.   I begin by thanking Representatives Cardenas, Castor, Davis, and  Upton for their leadership on this bill, the Pandemic Effects on Home  Safety and Tourism Act.   While there is now light at the end of the tunnel for many Americans,  the past 15 months have been unlike any other time in modern history.  The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to spend more time at home and find  new indoor and outdoor activities suitable for social distancing, which  has resulted in new injury patterns. Keeping track of any new trends in  injuries and deaths that might be occurring can help us learn how to  keep consumers safer at home now as well as in the future.   This bill will require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  provide quarterly updates to the American public regarding the effects  of COVID-19 on home safety, including any emerging threats from either  new products or new habits from working and playing at home. This  report will assemble data from a variety of sources, including media  reports and poison control centers, in addition to the CPSC's  traditional data sources.   Initial reports from the CPSC about injuries related to consumer  products during COVID-19 are already concerning. For example,  hospitalizations related to the ingestion of dangerous button cell  batteries rose by 93 percent among young children during the period  from March to September 2020, and injuries related to cleaning agents  also rose 84 percent.   Continued regular reporting required by this legislation can help  parents better identify how to keep their children safe when they need  to stay at home. And this bill will also identify communities or groups  that may be disproportionately affected so that the CPSC can better  target efforts to protect these communities.   Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that this bill will also help rebuild  the tourism and travel industry, which has certainly struggled under  the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this legislation  requires the Department of Commerce to conduct a detailed study and  report to Congress on the pandemic's effects on the travel industry,  including on jobs and revenue. And this information will be helpful in  determining how we can best direct assistance to the 16 million  American workers and families who rely on the jobs the travel industry  supports.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our Ranking Member Rodgers, and our Consumer  Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Ranking Member Bilirakis, for  working with us to build bipartisan support. And, of course, I also  thank the chairwoman of this subcommittee, the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairwoman of the  subcommittee.   I also want to say that she is really our superhero when it comes to  these consumer issues, always looking out for things, because as the  world changes, we have to constantly be vigilant. And that, she  certainly is.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge bipartisan support for this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3723.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3723, the Consumer  Safety Technology Act, and I want to begin by thanking Representatives  McNerney and Burgess for their leadership on this bill, which they  reintroduced this Congress.   This legislation will help modernize our consumer protection agencies  and encourage the use of advanced technologies, like artificial  intelligence and blockchain in support of product safety and consumer  protection.   These technologies can help the Consumer Product Safety Commission  and the Federal Trade Commission improve their operations and more  effectively carry out their mission.   Technological advances and globalization have greatly expanded the  range of consumer products on the market. And as consumers shop online,  more and more of these products are being shipped directly to homes.  Artificial intelligence could help the CPSC oversee the increasingly  complex range of products under its jurisdiction by helping to identify  new injury trends and emerging hazards.   AI can also help the CPSC monitor online marketplaces for the illegal  sale of recalled products. The persistence of recalled products on  online third-party marketplaces is a particularly pernicious problem  that puts Americans needlessly at risk.   For example, months after the dangerous Fisher-Price Rock `n Play and  other infant inclined sleepers were recalled, a Consumer Reports  investigation found that these products were still being sold on sites  like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist, even though they had been  linked to dozens of infant fatalities. I am hopeful that artificial  intelligence can be harnessed here to help eradicate the illegal sale  of recalled products on online marketplaces.   The CPSC could also use AI to assess the risks of the growing number  of imported consumer products entering our country and being sent  directly to consumers.   This bill incorporates a bill originally introduced by Representative  Soto and Guthrie, the Blockchain Innovation Act, and a bill originally  introduced by Representatives Davidson and Soto, the Digital Taxonomy  Act.   As incorporated in this legislation, these bills will help identify  ways blockchain technology can be used to further support consumer  protection. It will also make sure that scammers and fraudsters don't  get ahead of consumers and law enforcement in the realm of blockchain  and digital tokens.   Mr. Speaker, finally, I thank Ranking Member Rodgers and Consumer  Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Ranking Member Bilirakis for  working with us to move this bill; and as always, to the chairwoman of  the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney), who is the prime sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto), another sponsor of the bill from the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairwoman of the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3182) to provide that inclined sleepers for infants and crib  bumpers shall be considered banned hazardous products under section 8  of the Consumer Product Safety Act, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3182         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Sleep for Babies Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. BANNING OF INCLINED SLEEPERS FOR INFANTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, inclined sleepers for infants,       regardless of the date of manufacture, shall be considered a       banned hazardous product under section 8 of the Consumer       Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2057).        (b) Inclined Sleeper for Infants Defined.--In this section,       the term ``inclined sleeper for infants'' means a product       with an inclined sleep surface greater than ten degrees that       is intended, marketed, or designed to provide sleeping       accommodations for an infant up to 1 year old.       SEC. 3. BANNING OF CRIB BUMPERS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, crib bumpers, regardless of the date       of manufacture, shall be considered a banned hazardous       product under section 8 of the Consumer Product Safety Act       (15 U.S.C. 2057).        (b) Crib Bumper Defined.--In this section, the term ``crib       bumper''--        (1) means any material that is intended to cover the sides       of a crib to prevent injury to any crib occupant from impacts       against the side of a crib or to prevent partial or complete       access to any openings in the sides of a crib to prevent a       crib occupant from getting any part of the body entrapped in       any opening;        (2) includes a padded crib bumper, a supported and       unsupported vinyl bumper guard, and vertical crib slat       covers; and        (3) does not include a non-padded mesh crib liner.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3182.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3182, the Safe Sleep  for Babies Act.   This important piece of legislation was reintroduced this Congress by  Vice Chair Cardenas and Chair Schakowsky of our Consumer Protection and  Commerce Subcommittee.   Parents and caregivers deserve the peace of mind that any infant  sleep product they buy is consistent with longstanding safe sleep  recommendations that babies should only sleep on their backs on a firm,  flat surface free of extra bedding.   This legislation would ban two very dangerous products for babies  that defy safe sleep best practices and have tragically taken far too  many infant lives: inclined sleepers and crib bumpers. To date,  inclined sleepers have been linked to at least 94 infant fatalities,  and crib bumpers have contributed to at least 107 deaths.   Inclined sleepers position babies on a dangerous incline that can  lead to the baby's airway becoming obstructed, among other hazard  patterns. Crib bumpers create unnecessary suffocation, entrapment, and  strangulation risks for babies.   There is simply no reason either of these products should still be on  the market. Yet, incline sleepers and crib bumpers are heavily marketed  and remain widely available online and on store shelves. Many parents,  grandparents, and caregivers continue to purchase these products,  wholly unaware of the grave risks they pose to babies.   Since April 2019, when Consumer Reports first reported on the deadly  toll of infant inclined products, an independent expert hired by the  CPSC has confirmed that all sleep products with inclines greater than  10 degrees pose serious dangers to infants.  [[Page H2948]]    Earlier this month, CPSC approved a strong, new Federal safety  standard on infant sleep products that will effectively prohibit infant  inclined sleepers. However, the new safety standard will not take  effect for some time, and there is still no Federal standard to  eliminate the hazard posed by crib bumpers.   That is why this bill is necessary. H.R. 3182 bans crib bumpers along  with inclined sleepers, and it will take effect 6 months after the date  of enactment, making sure strong protections for babies are not  needlessly delayed.   We must take action on this bill today, Mr. Speaker, to protect  babies across the Nation. I call on my colleagues to support this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who is the chair of the  subcommittee and one of the major sponsors of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I also ask for support of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1314) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  promulgate a consumer product safety rule for free-standing clothing  storage units to protect children from tip-over related death or  injury, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1314         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Tip-overs of Unstable,       Risky Dressers on Youth Act'' or the ``STURDY Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD TO PROTECT AGAINST                     TIP-OVER OF CLOTHING STORAGE UNITS.         (a) Clothing Storage Unit Defined.--In this section, the       term ``clothing storage unit'' means any free-standing       furniture item manufactured in the United States or imported       for use in the United States that is intended for the storage       of clothing, typical of bedroom furniture.        (b) Consumer Product Safety Standard Required.--        (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (c)(1),       not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall--        (A) in consultation with representatives of consumer       groups, clothing storage unit manufacturers, craft or       handmade furniture manufacturers, and independent child       product engineers and experts, examine and assess the       effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety       standards for clothing storage units; and        (B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United       States Code, promulgate a final consumer product safety       standard for clothing storage units to protect children from       tip-over-related death or injury that includes--        (i) tests that simulate the weight of children up to 60       pounds;        (ii) objective, repeatable, and measurable tests that       simulate real world use and account for any impact on       clothing storage unit stability that may result from       placement on carpeted surfaces, drawers with items in them,       multiple open drawers, or dynamic force;        (iii) testing of all clothing storage units, including       those under 30 inches in height; and        (iv) warning requirements based on ASTM F2057-17, or its       successor at the time of enactment, provided that the       Consumer Product Safety Commission shall strengthen the       requirements of ASTM F2057-17, or its successor, if       reasonably necessary to protect children from tip-over-      related death or injury.        (2) Treatment of standard.--A consumer product safety       standard promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be treated as       a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9 of       the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).  [[Page H2949]]         (c) Subsequent Rulemaking.--        (1) In general.--At any time subsequent to the publication       of a consumer product safety standard under subsection       (b)(1), the Commission may initiate a rulemaking, in       accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code,       to modify the requirements of the consumer product safety       standard described in subsection (b)(1) if reasonably       necessary to protect children from tip-over-related death or       injury.        (2) Revision of rule.--If, after the date of the enactment       of this Act, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       revises its Clinical Growth Charts, the consumer product       safety standard described in subsection (b)(1) shall, on the       date that is 180 days after such revision, be revised to       include tests that simulate the weight of children up to the       95th percentile weight of children 72 months in age, as       depicted in the revised Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention Clinical Growth Charts, unless the Commission       determines the modification is not reasonably necessary to       protect children from tip-over-related death or injury.        (3) Treatment of rules.--Any rule promulgated under       paragraph (1) or revision made pursuant to paragraph (2)       shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule       promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety       Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1314.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1314, the STURDY Act.  I want to begin by thanking Consumer Protection and Commerce  Subcommittee Chair Schakowsky for championing and reintroducing this  critical piece of legislation, which will help protect children from  deadly furniture tip-overs.   Tip-overs remain one of the top five hidden hazards in the home.  According to new data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission,  between 2000 and 2019, tip-over incidents have been linked to more than  450 child fatalities and tens of thousands more injuries.   Every 46 minutes a child is injured in a tip-over incident. The  victims tend to be young children who are curious and creative, eager  to climb and play make-believe with the world around them. But dressers  pose a deadly danger, and their crushing weight can lead to tragedy in  just minutes.   These incidents often happen silently, too. Parents who have lost  children from furniture tip-overs report never hearing the dresser  falling because the child's body had absorbed the brunt of the impact  or a child was pinned in such a way that he or she couldn't even scream  or cry out.   The current voluntary furniture stability standards are woefully  inadequate and have not stopped children from dying from unstable  dressers. In March, Consumer Reports reported on two tip-over  incidents, including one death that happened within 1 week of each  other, highlighting the ongoing and urgent need for this lifesaving  legislation.                                time  1515    Our children deserve a strong, mandatory standard that keeps them  safe from such a common household danger. Right now, the current  voluntary standard only applies to dressers 30 inches or taller,  despite multiple fatalities and injuries involving shorter dressers.   Also, the voluntary testing doesn't incorporate the upper weight  range for children affected by tip-overs. It also ignores real-world  dynamics, such as the movement of drawers and different flooring  surfaces that a dresser might be resting on.   The STURDY Act would finally establish a strong mandatory furniture  stability safety standard and protect children from being crushed under  the weight of their bedroom furniture. This legislation will save  lives, and that is why I call on my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairwoman of the  subcommittee and sponsor of this bill. I am sure many have noticed  today that many of these bills that protect consumers, particularly  children, have been championed by Ms. Schakowsky.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3841) to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to  the collection and availability of health data with respect to Indian  Tribes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3841         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Health Data       Improvement Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. COLLECTION AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH DATA WITH                     RESPECT TO INDIAN TRIBES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on H.R. 3841.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, American Indian and Alaska Native communities experience  disproportionately worse health outcomes than other groups in the  United States. The root causes of these poor health outcomes are  complex, but, unfortunately, not surprising. For centuries, American  Indian and Alaska Native communities have been displaced and damaged by  violence, poverty, disease, and adverse social conditions. As a result,  Tribal members live shorter lives than any other demographic group.   Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has also devastated Tribal  communities. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, American Indians and Alaska Natives are at greater risk of  COVID-19 infection and more than three times more likely to be  hospitalized.   Moreover, there are significant gaps in data collection and the full  picture of the disease burden is really unknown. So it is important for  us to improve Tribal health data collection efforts so that we can  improve health outcomes. Tribal Epidemiology Centers manage regional  public health information systems and disease prevention and control  services. These centers also collaborate with other public health  authorities to study, collect, and analyze epidemiological data.   Clear communication and coordination by Federal, State, and local  public health departments is necessary to the success and security of  these efforts. So the bill before us, H.R. 3841, the Tribal Health Data  Improvement Act, equips Tribal communities with enhanced resources to  collect public health data and adapt public health programs to improve  health outcomes.   The bill clarifies the Federal Government's role in the collection  and distribution of public health and disease surveillance data. It  does this by creating a strategy to share information with the Indian  Health Service, Indian Tribes and organizations, and Tribal  Epidemiology Centers.   The legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to release all applicable public health data to Tribal entities within  180 days of enactment.   It also requires the CDC to encourage and enhance collaborative  efforts between States and Tribal organizations to synergize data  collection.   Finally, the bill reauthorizes the National Center for Health  Statistics with an additional $185 million in funding to implement the  programs established by the legislation.   I thank Representatives Mullin and O'Halleran for their bipartisan  efforts to bringing this bill forward. They are always champions for  the Tribes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
