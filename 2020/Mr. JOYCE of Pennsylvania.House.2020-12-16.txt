 Madam Speaker, this week, Americans  witnessed a remarkable achievement. Less than a year after the novel  coronavirus reached the shores of America, the first doses of a safe  and effective vaccine were administered to frontline healthcare workers  in Pennsylvania and around the country.   This amazing accomplishment is not only a testament to America's  unparalleled healthcare heroes, researchers and scientists, but it is  also a testament to the promise of American innovation.   In just a matter of months, Operation Warp Speed has harnessed the  full power of the Federal Government, the private sector, and the  scientific community to deliver results for the American people, all in  record time.   I am sincerely grateful to the leaders at the helm of this historic  public/private partnership, including President Donald Trump and  Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, who was born in my  district, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Truly, all of those who have  served in Operation Warp Speed have done an incredible job.   As our Nation continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize  that a safe and effective vaccine is key to restoring our communities,  rebuilding our economy and, ultimately, saving lives. While the first  COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer already has been granted emergency  authorization from the FDA, we expect more to follow in the coming days  and weeks.   Now, it is imperative for the American people to know the facts about  these vaccines so that they can make informed consent.   Number one: As part of Operation Warp Speed, multiple COVID-19  vaccines are being developed by private companies and simultaneously  produced, accelerating the typical production process so that, as soon  as a safe and effective option is cleared, it is ready to go.   Number two: Each COVID-19 vaccine is undergoing the same rigorous  safety, quality, and efficacy screenings as any other modern vaccine.   Number three: The FDA will only grant emergency use authorization to  a vaccine following the recommendation of an independent advisory  board.   Number four: The American people can be confident in the safety and  the efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine.   Madam Speaker, like many Americans, I recognize that this vaccine has  lifesaving potential, and I plan to take the vaccine as soon as I am  eligible.   As part of Operation Warp Speed, our Nation is equipped to facilitate  this vaccine distribution more efficiently than any other country in  the world. At the same time, we know that it will take time before  everyone can receive it.   As we wait, this is not the time to grow complacent. COVID-19 cases  are rising in Pennsylvania and around the country, and it is up to all  of us to do our part to protect our family, our friends, and our  neighbors.   This year, I have been amazed by Americans' commitment to one another  and to their communities. Together, we can defeat this virus. As we  wait for the widespread immunization, we must continue to stand strong  against this invisible enemy.   Yes, the coronavirus remains an ever-present threat to America and to  our economy. Yes, we are in a shared fight to save lives and to save  livelihoods. And, yes, there is hope on the horizon. It is arriving in  communities every day in the coolers on UPS and FedEx trucks.   As we near the end of this incredibly challenging year, Americans  have much to be grateful for. Thanks to our scientific community, to  Operation Warp Speed, and especially to our healthcare heroes, there  are brighter days ahead.                            ____________________
