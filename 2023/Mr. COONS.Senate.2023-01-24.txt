 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an excerpt of  this article by George Black, honoring the legacies of Senator Patrick  Leahy and Tim Rieser, that was originally published in the New Republic  on December 19, 2022.   I ask unanimous consent that the following excerpt honoring Senator  Patrick Leahy and Tim Rieser be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the New Republic, Dec. 19, 2022]            For Patrick Leahy, The Vietnam War Is Finally Ending                             (By George Black)         For 33 years, the retiring Vermont senator and a top aide       have quietly but doggedly been working to bind the many       wounds of a war that touched the lives of nearly every       Vietnamese family. This is what public service is.        It was a late afternoon in mid-November, with the nip of       early winter in the air, when I visited the Russell Senate       Office Building to meet with Vermont Senator Pat Leahy in his       spacious yet surprisingly intimate office, with a sofa and       chairs arranged near the fireplace. An aide squatted down       beside us to add another log to the fire. Leahy's wife of 60       years, Marcelle, joined us, carrying a large bouquet of       flowers. The couple still convey a strong sense of the people       they were in the early years of their marriage--he a small-      town lawyer, she a nurse at a local hospital. Leahy showed       off photos of their three children and five grandchildren.       ``I'm not someone who wants to hang the walls with photos of       50 great and famous people I've known,'' he said. ``I'd much       rather be surrounded by pictures of family.''        Leahy, who entered the Senate in 1975 and leaves it after       48 years in January 2023, is the body's longest-serving       sitting member. To most Americans, he is probably best known       for his decades on the Senate Judiciary Committee and his       opposition to the drive by conservative activists to       transform the federal courts into an instrument of their       ideological agenda. But I'd come to talk to him about       something different, something that rarely if ever makes the       cable news circuit: the war in Vietnam, the wounds it had       left, and the part he had played in healing them. He's never       seen this as a partisan issue, just a matter of simple human       decency, being one of those, like Joe Biden, who mourn a lost       era of comity in the Senate, in which political adversaries       could still reach with respect across the gulf of their       disagreements. His work in Vietnam has always been       underpinned by that vision, and I wanted to ask him whether,       in our current divided state, he could imagine it continuing       after his retirement from the Senate at the age of 82.        Vision alone doesn't get you far in Washington. It has to       be turned into legislation, and legislation into dollars and       cents. In addition to his role on the Judiciary Committee,       Leahy also chairs the Appropriations Committee, which is       where the purse strings are untied, and, as he wrote in his       recently published memoir, The Road Taken, ``few people       really ever sifted through the line items to understand what       we were doing was actually making American foreign policy.''       It's also why you can't talk about his work in Vietnam       without also talking about his senior aide, Tim Rieser, who       has been with him since 1985, and who will retire from his       current role in January. Despite his bland-sounding job       title--Democratic clerk for the Appropriations Subcommittee       on State and Foreign Operations--Rieser has been the master       of its arcane mechanics. ``A dog with a bone,'' Leahy calls       him. Given a problem to solve, ``He would not stop until       every last drop of marrow and morsel of sinew had been licked       clean.''        Since 1989, as the United States and Vietnam were taking       their first baby steps toward reconciliation, Leahy and       Rieser have channeled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid       to Vietnam, forcing the United States to take responsibility       for what former Senate leader Mike Mansfield once called the       ``great outflow of devastation'' from the war: the bodies       broken by unexploded bombs; the lives blighted by exposure to       Agent Orange; the ongoing threat from ``hot spots''       contaminated by dioxin, its toxic by-product; and now, at       last, some long-overdue aid to help Vietnam recover and       identify the remains of its war dead. In the process, they       have built the scaffolding of a new relationship, in which       bitter enemies, in one of the stranger twists of geopolitics,       have been transformed into close working partners and       military allies.        Leahy and Rieser have faced no small number of obstacles       along the way. For many years, embittered American veterans       and recalcitrant anti-Communists in Congress opposed any hint       of reconciliation with Vietnam. Progress was often slowed by       suspicions on the Vietnamese side and by cumbersome       bureaucracies in both governments, and State Department and       Pentagon lawyers remain wary to this day of any humanitarian       effort that implies an admission of liability. But as Rieser       often says, when you run into an obstacle, you redefine it as       a problem to be solved, and that process starts with all       parties identifying their common interest in finding a       solution. There are always common interests; you just have to       look for them.
