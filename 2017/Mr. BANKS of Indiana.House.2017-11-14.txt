 Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor of my time in  Congress to serve on the House Armed Services Committee with Chairman  Thornberry, and I am grateful for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the fiscal year 2018 National  Defense Authorization Act conference report.   As the most recently deployed veteran serving in Congress, I have  seen the national security challenges facing our country, firsthand.  While these challenges are not easily solved, this legislation  represents a significant step forward.   Whether it is giving our troops a well-deserved raise, significantly  increasing end strength numbers for each of the services, allowing for  the continued transfer of excess defense articles to allies abroad who  are in need, or funding our vital missile defense programs, this  legislation begins the long process of rebuilding and reforming our  military so we are ready for whatever comes next.   Mr. Speaker, my gratitude goes out to those serving both here at home  and abroad, and I urge my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan legislation.
