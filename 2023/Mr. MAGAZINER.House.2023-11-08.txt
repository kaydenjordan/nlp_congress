 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroic actions  of Deputy Chief Mike Mernick of the Warwick Fire Department.   Mike and his wife, Tara, were enjoying a night out in Providence, not  long ago, when they noticed a fire had broken out at a nearby home on  Goddard Street.   When he saw the smoke coming out of the triple-decker and realized  there were people trapped inside the building, the off-duty, 28-year- old firefighter sprang into action.   He ran into the burning building with two Providence police officers  at his side, covered in no protective gear or equipment. He just knew  there was no time to waste.   They headed up two flights of smoke-filled stairs where they found a  mother with her two children and rushed them out to safety. Mernick  remained in the building, clearing each floor, as the fire raged around  him.   Thanks to the quick actions of Deputy Chief Mernick and the two  officers, all eight people in the building were rescued safely.   Deputy Chief Mernick's actions are a reminder that firefighters are  heroes in every sense of the word.                            ____________________
