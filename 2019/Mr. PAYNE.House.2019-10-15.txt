 Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment to discuss  mesothelioma.   Mesothelioma is generally a cancer of the lungs. Most cases come from  exposure to asbestos, a popular fireproofing material used in homes and  buildings in the mid-20th century. It is a deadly disease. Ninety  percent of patients die within 5 years.   My home State of New Jersey ranks fifth nationally in mesothelioma  deaths.   Yet, it is one of the only cancers without a patient registry. A  registry would allow researchers to study patients, look for common  conditions, and create new cures to help them live longer lives.   Our bill, the Mary Jo Lawyer Spano Mesothelioma Patient Registry Act,  would provide funding to do just that. We need to pass this bill so we  can truly research this deadly disease and provide more hope for these  patients.                            ____________________
