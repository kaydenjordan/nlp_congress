 Madam Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to what has  become the new normal here in Washington, D.C.   Despite talks of bipartisanship and unity, Democrats have turned to a  partisan, top-down, rampant spending style of governing with President  Biden's infrastructure vision as the latest example.   The fact is that the President's $2.3 trillion infrastructure vision  really isn't about infrastructure at all. Only 5 percent is proposed  for roads and bridges, and only 2 percent for airways, waterways, and  ports. Instead, Democrats have proposed spending over half a trillion  dollars on Green New Deal-style programs to fulfill a far left wish  list.   What is their solution for paying for all of this?   Increasing your taxes.   The tax hikes to fund this spending spree will only hurt workers and  result in lower wages and suppressed economic growth.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle  to stop posturing and work with us on this side of the aisle. Madam  Speaker, we are ready to work with you across the aisle on a package  that will truly make a difference to my constituents in Arkansas and  people across our great Nation.                            ____________________
