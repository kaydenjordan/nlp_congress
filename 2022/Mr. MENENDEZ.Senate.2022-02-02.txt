 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my  strong support for four highly qualified nominees whom we are soon to  vote on: Dr. Amy Gutmann to be the U.S. Ambassador to Germany; Mr.  Scott Nathan to be the Chief Executive Officer of the U.S.  International Development Finance Corporation; Ms. Lisa Carty to be the  U.S. Representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council;  and Ms. Chantale Wong to be the U.S. Director of the Asian Development  Bank.   They are all highly qualified. I will speak for a minute or two on  Dr. Gutmann and Mr. Nathan, in particular.   Our partnership with European allies is evermore critical as we  attempt to deter further Russian escalation and aggressive behavior  toward Ukraine. Germany is key to this effort--absolutely critical to  the work we need to do to prevent Vladimir Putin from furthering his  aims to reclaim a sphere of influence and destabilize Europe.   So while it was beyond irresponsible for some of our Republican  colleagues to bottle up Dr. Gutmann's nomination for months, I am  pleased that we are close to getting a confirmed ambassador in Berlin;  an ambassador who will help coordinate our joint efforts to  [[Page S486]]  stop a Russian invasion of Ukraine; an ambassador who will help repair  the previous administration's damage to the U.S.-German relationship;  and an ambassador who will represent the United States with great skill  and determination.   I would also note that Dr. Gutmann's personal and professional  background are a compelling fit for this position and for this moment.  As the daughter of a German Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis and as an  academic who has devoted her career to advancing freedom and democracy,  she is the right person for the job in a moment where anti-Semitism is  on the rise and dictators and autocrats around the world are  emboldened.   I urge all of my colleagues to support Dr. Gutmann's nomination, and  I look forward to her arrival in Berlin in short order.   President Biden also made an excellent decision in nominating Scott  Nathan to be the next Chief Executive Officer of the Development  Finance Corporation.   The DFC, as that entity is known, is a critical tool for improving  economic development outcomes in developing countries, advancing U.S.  economic competitiveness, and creating new opportunities in underserved  countries and communities.   And while the DFC is only 2 years old, its importance to the  advancement of U.S. foreign policy and international development  priorities cannot be overstated.   Mr. Nathan will be able to draw on his leadership experience in both  the private sector and in public service to ensure the DFC effectively  leverages public-private partnerships and maximizes strategic  development opportunities around the globe. He has the skills necessary  to lead the Agency to be competitive with China's Belt and Road  Initiative, to promote renewable energy development, and to support  COVID-19 recovery, and, at the same time, to recognize and grapple with  the complexity of these challenges.   I strongly support confirming Mr. Nathan, and I am eager to work with  him once confirmed.   So all of these nominees deserve a positive, strong vote.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
