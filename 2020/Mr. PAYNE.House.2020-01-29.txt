 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the kindness and  generosity of a rising star in my district, Donari Joy Mosby. Ms. Mosby  is a senior at County Prep High School in Jersey City, New Jersey.   Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, she made it her goal to select socks to  help the homeless residents stay warm during the winter. She started  with a modest goal of 250 pairs of socks. When she exceeded that, she  raised the number every single year.   This year, she donated more than 5,700 pairs of socks to a local  community center on Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in Jersey City.  [[Page H645]]    In 7 years, Ms. Mosby has donated 21,883 pairs of socks to help the  homeless of my district. She called her campaign the Joy of Sox and  wrote that socks are a simple and powerful way to show love to someone  going through difficult times.   I agree, and I think her efforts and commitment to charity deserve to  be praised.                            ____________________
