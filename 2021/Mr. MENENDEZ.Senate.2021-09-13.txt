 Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent that I  be permitted to complete my remarks before the scheduled 5:30 p.m.  vote.    Madam President, prior to the August recess, I, along  with Senator Murphy, asked unanimous consent to confirm almost 30--30-- highly qualified Foreign Affairs and Development nominees who were  languishing on the Senate floor. I noted then the danger of leaving  these posts unfilled at a time that we were facing such a confluence of  global challenges. Two Republican Senators blocked each one of our  requests. Days later, Haiti was hit with a devastating earthquake, and  Afghanistan imploded.   While I continue to believe it is essential that this body swiftly  confirm every single foreign affairs and development professional whose  nomination is pending on the Senate floor, I rise again today to seek  unanimous consent to confirm four nominees who are critical to  addressing the crisis in Afghanistan and Haiti.   Ambassador Donald Lu, a career Foreign Service Officer, is the  President's nominee to serve as Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of  South and Central Asian Affairs.   The last Assistant Secretary for this Bureau was confirmed during the  Obama administration. To say that this nomination is long overdue is an  understatement, particularly now, given the incredibly dangerous  situation in Afghanistan.   Post-withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, the State Department  is the main implementer of U.S. policy in the country. And given the  regional implications of Afghanistan policy, it is essential that this  role be filled with a seasoned and experienced diplomat like Ambassador  Lu.   The region is also home to several other countries critical to U.S.  interests. From Pakistan to India, to the countries of central Asia,  the United States must be present in order to advance those interests  and counter the malign influence of both Russia and China.  [[Page S6449]]    So I hope that my colleagues will not continue to play games and will  support Ambassador Lu's confirmation this evening.   Similarly, it is unthinkable that the State Department's intelligence  office, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, or as we know it as  INR, remains without senior leadership.   INR is an invaluable resource for the Secretary of State's senior  officials and, indeed, all of the dedicated foreign policy  professionals who serve our Nation so well and so tirelessly. It needs  a confirmed leader in place that can help the Department understand the  intelligence information that is out there that helps us instruct, in  terms of foreign policy choices. So I am asking my Republican  colleagues to permit confirming Brett Holmgren today.   Shifting to Haiti, last month I came to the floor to highlight the  challenges that we face in our own hemisphere and the impact of  regional instability on U.S. national security and our citizens'  safety.   Already, the situation is more urgent than when I raised it. In  August, a massive earthquake in Haiti killed more than 2,200 people,  injured 12,000 more, destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. A  coordinated international response is urgently needed.   This new emergency follows the assassination of Haiti's President and  mounting crises in the region, unprecedented protests, and widespread  repression in Cuba, a brutal regime crackdown in Nicaragua, and an  expansive political and humanitarian refugee crisis in Venezuela.   COVID-19 continues to inflict severe social and economic consequences  on countries across the region, and there are the enduring security and  governance challenges in Central America that fuel irregular migration.   We need urgently qualified nominees in leadership positions to  address these crises.   With an extensive experience in the Americas, Ambassador Brian  Nichols, a career Foreign Service Officer, will skillfully advance U.S.  national interests as the Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere  Affairs.   Similarly, Marcela Escobari, who served as Assistant Administrator  for Latin America's USAID in the Obama administration, will bring  unique expertise to the position if confirmed again today. In 2016, the  Senate confirmed her by voice vote--voice vote. We need her in place  and should move her again today.   It is scandalous that these nominees and many others are being held  up for reasons completely unrelated to them and the positions they will  hold. Such irresponsible behavior jeopardizes our national security,  and we must act today.   So let me start by asking, first, unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration--Madam President, I will reserve the  opportunities to ask for these consents and wait for one of our  colleagues to appear on the floor.   At this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, pursuant to the comments I was just  making a few minutes ago, let me move directly to my request. I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Calendar No. 335, Donald Lu to be Assistant Secretary of State for  South Asian Affairs, and that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all  without any intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I clearly do not share the views of my  colleague from Texas, but for the sake of the Senate's work, I will  reserve responding to it for another time.                            ____________________     I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Calendar No. 150, Brett M. Holmgren to be an Assistant  Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, and that the Senate  vote on the nomination without any intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all  without any intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 322, Brian A.  Nichols to be an Assistant Secretary of State for the Western  Hemisphere, and that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all  without any intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 323, Marcela  Escobari to be Assistant Administrator of the United States Agency for  International Development, and that the Senate vote on the nomination  without any intervening action or debate.    Madam President, it is unfortunate that this last  nominee is objected to. This particular position--we are talking about  Haiti. We are talking about having an Assistant Administrator that can  help us restore the tragic situation in Haiti to a place in which  people can live and won't seek migration to the United States.   When we are talking about what is happening in the Western  Hemisphere, in Venezuela, where there is a huge humanitarian set of  refugees leaving; when we talk about what is happening  [[Page S6451]]  in Cuba with reference to the movements for democracy, this particular  position would be dealing with all of that.   I must say, I know that my colleague wants to say none of this would  have changed anything. That is not the case. I am not saying that the  ultimate result in Afghanistan would have changed, but certainly, when  we do not have people in key positions advocating for U.S. national  security and policy, it exacerbates the set of circumstances because we  don't have the wherewithal to do what is necessary. There are many  other key positions I will be coming to the Senate floor and  highlighting how that has a risk to national security.   Finally, I would just simply say CAATSA was violated by President  Trump when he exercised no sanctions on the same issue that my  colleague is concerned about. I happen to agree with him on the issue;  I disagree with him in the process in which he is pursuing it. But that  started with President Trump.   By the way, President Trump started with a surrender agreement to the  Taliban. He gave them everything, got nothing in return. He let them  have 5,000 prisoners, Taliban prisoners, who were returned to the  Taliban--that added to the fighting force--and got none of the  commitments that were necessary to deal with a negotiation or a peace  deal with the Afghan Government. He got nothing at all except a total  surrender and then dramatically reduced the troop levels at that time.   So there is a lot to talk about about Afghanistan, not only in the  immediate context but over what has happened over the last 20 years.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee intends to do that extensive  review through a series of hearings.   Let's put history exactly where it belongs--in the right context.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
