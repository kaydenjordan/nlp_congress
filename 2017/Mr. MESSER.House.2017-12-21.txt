 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend, Kevin  Lynch, who passed away following a 5-year battle with cancer just this  week.   Kevin was a great Hoosier, a public servant, a tremendous leader, and  a tireless advocate in advancing southeastern Indiana. He served as a  Dearborn County commissioner and as the president of the Ohio-Kentucky- Indiana Regional Council of Governments.   Kevin was a giant Reds fan and a loyal friend, with a positive  spirit, quick with a smile, and an encouraging word.   Kevin served Lawrenceburg and Dearborn County with pride, but his  most important priority was his family. He was the loving husband to  Mary Jo--``Joey''--for 27 years and the proud father of Michael. Mr.  Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Lynch family and  all those who knew Kevin well.   Congratulations to my good friend Kevin on a tremendous life well  done. Godspeed my friend.                            ____________________
