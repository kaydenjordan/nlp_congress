 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, many State legislatures across the country  have taken action recently to protect unborn babies from the violence  of abortion. My home State, for instance, Arkansas, has just passed a  law to protect unborn babies after 18 weeks of development. This reform  is not just supported by Arkansans; it is supported by a large majority  of all Americans, more than 70 percent of whom believe unborn babies  ought to be protected at or before that stage of pregnancy.   These reforms are the work of the pro-life movement, which fights for  the most vulnerable among us every day. The pro-life movement seeks  change in the noblest tradition of our country and works within our  democratic system so that our laws ultimately live up to our highest  principle in the words of our Declaration of Independence--that all men  are created equal and that all have a basic right to life.   Of course, this is a democracy. So not everyone agrees when or even  if we ought to protect the unborn. I understand that. I know there are  decent people on both sides of this sensitive issue. We resolve our  differences and reach compromise through democratic debate. What should  never happen, though, is a billion-dollar corporation's trying to  dictate these moral questions to us. Politically correct CEOs shouldn't  be in the business of threatening normal Americans, but that is exactly  what we have seen lately.   The loudest objections to these pro-life laws haven't come from the  bottom up, from normal citizens who happen to disagree with one  another, but from the top down, from cultural elites and, increasingly,  from giant corporations that wield their economic power as a weapon to  punish the American people for daring to challenge their pro-abortion  extremism.   Giant media companies, like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia, have  threatened to cripple Georgia's film industry if its residents don't  bend the knee and betray their pro-life convictions.   Just last Monday, the New York Times ran a full-page advertisement  that was organized by the pro-abortion lobby and was signed by the CEOs  of hundreds of companies that read that legal protections for unborn  babies are ``bad for business.'' How disgusting is that? Caring for a  little baby is ``bad for business.''   Now, I get why outfits like Planned Parenthood and NARAL would say  babies are bad for business. Abortion is their business, after all, and  they are just protecting market share. Yet what about all of those  other CEOs? Why do they think babies are ``bad for business''? It is,  perhaps, because they want their workers to focus single-mindedly on  working, not on building families and raising children.   All these politically correct CEOs want company men and women, not  family men and women. They will support your individuality and self- expression just as long as you stay unattached and on the clock.   You couldn't find a more perfect example of this mindset than that of  &pizza, one of those companies whose CEO signed the pro-abortion ad.  This company, &pizza, doesn't even offer paid maternity leave to its  employees, but it does celebrate their oneness and individuality. It  will even pay employees to get a tattoo of the company logo. So if you  want to be a walking billboard for your employer, &pizza will foot the  bill, but if you are pregnant with a child, tough luck.   In the spirit of some of these CEOs, I might call for a boycott of  &pizza for their political correctness, but you could just skip them  because their pizza is lousy anyway.   There is a troubling trend among giant corporations using their  wealth and power to force liberal dogma on an unwilling people. As  liberal activists have lost control of the judiciary, they have turned  to a different hub of power to impose their views on the rest of the  country. This time it is private power located in a few megacities on  the coasts.   That is not an exaggeration. The overwhelming majority of companies  that lashed out against the pro-life movement in that New York Times ad  are headquartered on the coasts, hoping to rule the rest of us like  colonies in the hinterlands. More than three-quarters are headquartered  in New York or California alone. More than a dozen are foreign  companies. Yet those same companies presume to tell all of America what  we should think.   For some reason, this outrage only seems to go in one direction. As  States like Arkansas have passed pro-life laws, other States have sadly  gone down a different path, stripping unborn children of recognition  and protection under the law. States like New York, Illinois, and  Vermont recently passed laws declaring abortion a fundamental right,  accessible until moments before birth for practically any reason as  long as you have a doctor's note.   We have already begun to see the consequences of these laws which  strain so mightily to defy and deny the humanity of the unborn. In New  York City, prosecutors recently dropped a charge of abortion against a  man who brutally stabbed to death his girlfriend and her unborn child.  They dropped that charge because the pro-abortion law that had just  passed the legislature in Albany removed all criminal penalties for  killing an unborn child. According to the laws of New York State, that  woman's child never existed.   The pro-abortion laws passed in New York, Illinois, Vermont, and  elsewhere truly deserve the label ``radical.'' So why isn't the  national media covering these radical laws with the same intensity they  have reserved for States like Georgia? Where are the indignant CEOs who  profess to care so much for their female employees? They are nowhere to  be found because their outrage is very selective. They don't speak for  the majority of Americans, much less for women. Instead, they are  actively trying to force a pro-abortion agenda on an unwilling public.   These companies want to wield a veto power over the democratic debate  and decisions of Arkansans and citizens across our country. They want  to force the latest social fashions of the coasts on small towns they  would never visit in a million years. They want us to betray our deeply  held beliefs about life and death in favor of a specious account of  equality. If there is one thing the New York Times ad got right, it is  that ``the future of equality hangs in the balance'' when it comes to  abortion, but their idea of equality doesn't include everyone. It  omits, it degrades unborn babies as expendable, lesser than even bad  for business. That is a strange kind of equality, if you ask me.   This trend of intolerance ought to alarm everyone, no matter your  views on this sensitive question. It threatens democratic debate on  this question and ultimately on all questions.   Despite the pressure campaign waged against us, I am heartened  because I know the pro-life movement will carry on, as it always has,  speaking to the inherent dignity of every human life. Not everything  can be measured on a corporate balance sheet. Some things are bigger  and more important than the bottom line or what wealthy, politically  correct corporations consider bad for business. The cause of life is  one of those issues worth fighting for.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
