 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the lunch recess.    Madam President, I rise today to focus on a serious issue  that has plagued our society and impacted the lives of so many people  across our great Nation: sexual assault.   During my time at Iowa State University, I served as a volunteer  counselor at a crisis center that provided shelter and support to  survivors of abuse and sexual assault. I heard so many gut-wrenching  stories of women and of men fleeing domestic abusers, suffering not  just physically but emotionally and spiritually. Taking calls on our  hotline from people who had been raped and sexually abused was  absolutely heartbreaking.   Abuse is not something you can just simply forget; it stays with you  forever. And I know this personally. As a survivor and as a Senator, I  feel it is important to be a voice for the thousands of victims across  Iowa and so many more across our Nation who have fallen prey to sexual  assault, to rape, to harassment, and other forms of abuse. Our country  is facing a mental health crisis, and one cannot help but feel that  these issues are all too often interwoven into the stories of so many  Americans.   April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. As lawmakers, it is a stark  reminder that we must take a long, hard look at how we combat this  problem and take real steps to confront sexual assault in our society.   Just last week, with my colleagues Senator Grassley, Senator  Gillibrand, and others, we reintroduced a bipartisan bill to combat  sexual assault on our college and university campuses. Our bipartisan  measure will make campuses in Iowa safer and ensure victims are fairly  heard by changing the way our universities handle sexual assault cases.   But it is not just these young men and women at these institutions  who have been victimized. Like so many of you, I was horrified-- absolutely horrified--to hear of the crimes committed by Larry Nassar,  the USA Gymnastics doctor who abused hundreds of young athletes. The  actions of Nassar and the individuals and institutions that facilitated  and then protected his behavior are inexcusable.   The cases were also symptomatic of broader problems our society faces  on sexual assault, rape, harassment, and abuse, leaving women and men,  young and old, vulnerable. These types of failures are the reasons I  have worked with my colleagues in Congress on reforms to ensure sexual  misconduct is reported, responded to, taken seriously, and ideally  prevented. For instance, we introduced a bill to require the governing  bodies of U.S. amateur athletic organizations to immediately report sex  abuse allegations to local or Federal law enforcement or a child  welfare agency.   But the work doesn't end with our educational and athletic  institutions; we must challenge people to do better  [[Page S2306]]  to protect people from these horrendous actions. In the case of the  military, the Department of Defense should take a stronger posture in  terms of preventing sexual assault within its ranks. I say this as a  former company commander and a retired lieutenant colonel. While there  have been concrete steps taken to improve the safety of our  servicemembers, there is more that we can and should do to protect our  men and women in uniform and change the overall culture.   The message I hear all too often is that victims in our armed  services have a fear of retaliation. Folks, this is absolutely  unacceptable. Those who report sexual assault should not fear coming  forward, and those who retaliate against individuals should be punished  to the full extent of the law. I helped author a bill to make  retaliation its own unique offense under the Uniform Code of Military  Justice, and fortunately for our servicemembers, this bill is now law.   It is my hope that Congress can continue to work on legislation that  addresses these issues.   While my personal story certainly does play a role in my passion for  change, so also do the stories and faces of men and women back home in  Iowa, every single one of them, with that face, with that name, with  that heart, and with that soul. It is their stories that push me to  want to make real and lasting change. Whether it is working with  Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, to  reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act or fighting to reduce the  abuse of females in custody through legislation with Senators Booker  and Blumenthal, combating sexual assault should be bipartisan and  something we all can agree on.   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues toward ending  sexual assault once and for all. This issue will continue to plague us  until we come together and take concrete steps to address it. We all  can and must do better.   This month, as we raise awareness of sexual assault, I hope to see  this body taking real and lasting action.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
