 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in response to the limited set of  relevant witnesses I proposed for a potential Senate trial earlier this  week, the Republican leader gave a lengthy speech on the floor  yesterday and another speech today. In neither of those speeches could  the Republican leader offer one salient argument as to why the  witnesses I proposed--all senior Trump administration officials-- shouldn't be allowed to testify. Instead, he made what are, in my view,  irrelevant and incomplete comparisons to the 1999 Clinton trial.   When faced with the fact that it is only fair to have these  witnesses, who were eyewitnesses to the major, major allegations  against the President and who had not testified before, the leader  can't talk about 2019. He has to go back to 1999 because he has no good  argument as to why they shouldn't testify.   We are not asking to be dilatory. We are not asking for a list of  4,000 witnesses. We are simply asking that those who know the truth  best come and talk to us here in the Senate and to the American people.   There is one fact that is impossible for the Senate to ignore. In the  two Presidential impeachment trials in the history of this body, the  Senate heard from witnesses, but Leader McConnell continues to push for  no witnesses in the Senate trial. I have yet to hear an explanation as  to why less evidence is better than more evidence, particularly when it  comes to something as somber, as serious, and as important as  impeachment of the President of the United States of America.   Leader McConnell keeps talking about 1999 because he doesn't want to  talk about 2019. The two situations are not analogous. Rather than  focus on the past, the Republican leader should focus on the present  and offer one good reason why relevant witnesses shouldn't testify in  an impeachment trial of President Trump, particularly in light of the  fact that we have not  [[Page S7127]]  heard from them. They probably have better evidence than anybody, even  though the evidence the House has prepared, in the eyes of so many, is  overwhelming.   I was disappointed to hear yesterday that Leader McConnell declared  that he would not be an impartial juror when it comes to the serious  charges against President Trump. He said it proudly. What kind of  example does that set for the country, which is looking for fairness  and impartiality?   In the event of a trial, every Senator will swear an oath--different  from our standard oath of office--to do impartial justice, but  yesterday McConnell told reporters: ``I'm not an impartial juror. This  is a political process. I'm not impartial about this at all.'' Let me  repeat that. Let the American people hear it loud and clear. The  Republican leader said proudly: ``I'm not an impartial juror. . . . I'm  not impartial about this at all.'' This is an astonishing admission of  partisanship. The President may demand these public displays of fealty,  but they are troubling for the leader of an independent branch of our  government. I hope all Senators will take seriously the oath to do  impartial justice that we seem likely to take in the near future.   The House of Representatives, of course, will take a historic vote  today on the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump. If the articles  of impeachment are passed, the focus will quickly move to the Senate,  where our Chamber will serve as a court of impeachment. We must, very  soon, figure out the rules and procedures that will allow the Senate to  rise to this occasion.   Despite our disagreements, I do expect to sit down with Leader  McConnell in the near future to discuss these matters. I have proposed  a very reasonable structure for a trial based on the grand American  tradition of a fair and speedy trial. We propose four witnesses--only  those with direct knowledge of the charges made by the House; only  those who could provide new, relevant, and potentially illuminating  testimony--and place strict time limits on each stage of the process to  prevent the trial from dragging out too long. No one is interested in  delaying.   The Senate's goal, above all, should be to conduct a trial with  dignity, fairness to both sides, and one that examines all the relevant  facts. There are large partisan divisions these days, but I suspect  most Senate Republicans would agree with these goals. I suspect that  even President Trump would agree with these goals--or at least say that  he did. The President has repeatedly complained about a lack of due  process and said that he ``would love''--his words--``would love'' for  aides like Mr. Mulvaney to testify in the Senate.   Setting aside for the moment that the President has refused to  participate in the House process despite multiple invitations; setting  aside for the moment that he has blocked witnesses from appearing and  documents from being produced--Mr. President, we are offering you the  due process you sought in your letter last night. Allow your current  and former aides--Mulvaney, Blair, Duffey, Bolton--to testify on your  behalf. Turn over all the requested documents and show that you and  your aides didn't try to use taxpayer money to force a foreign  government to announce an investigation against your political  opponent. Let the truth come out.   Mr. President, we are offering you due process. Due process means the  right to be heard. Please take it. Don't ask for it and then refuse to  take advantage of it.   President Trump, you have a habit of accusing others of the offenses  that you have, in fact, committed. You accuse the House of affording no  due process while obstructing the process every step of the way. If you  truly want due process to present your side of the case, President  Trump, let your aides testify and turn over the documents we requested.   We want to conduct a fair trial--fair to both sides. We don't know  whether the witnesses we propose will incriminate the President or  exonerate him. They are the appointees of President Donald J. Trump;  they are hardly biased. We don't know what their testimony will be, but  we do know one thing: We should hear from them. We just want the  facts--``Just the facts, ma'am,'' as Detective Friday says--facts that  will allow Senators to make fully informed decisions about something as  serious--so serious--as the conviction or acquittal of an impeached  President.   Each individual Senator will have the power and will have the  responsibility to help shape what an impeachment trial looks like. Do  my Republican colleagues want a fair and honest trial that examines all  the facts, or do they want to participate in a coverup?    Mr. President, I just want to let our side know that  this will be strictly enforced, so we have to be here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3102         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Measuring Real Income Growth       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Economic inequality in the United States has increased       dramatically during the 4 decades preceding the date of       enactment of this Act, with fewer households taking home a       larger share of the national income.        (2) While growth was once distributed relatively evenly       across all individuals in the United States, research shows       that economic gains are increasingly enjoyed by the most       affluent. By contrast, the majority of individuals in the       United States have seen income and wage growth significantly       below what is suggested by national measures of output and       income.        (3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of       Commerce (referred to in this section as ``BEA'') reports       annual and quarterly estimates of gross domestic product       (referred to in this section as ``GDP'') in the United       States. These estimates are important measures of the overall       size and health of the economy of the United States but do       not describe how economic gains are distributed across the       population of the United States.        (4) In a country of 325,000,000 individuals, top-line GDP       numbers do not capture the full range of household economic       experiences and may be misleading. For example, the real GDP       grew more than 3 percent annually between 2003 and 2005, but       the average income for \1/2\ of all individuals in the United       States fell during that period.        (5) Disaggregating economic growth by income groups will       provide a more complete picture of how families in the United       States are faring across all rungs of the economic ladder and       whether economic growth is benefitting all individuals in the       United States.        (6) Recent academic estimates of distributional growth show       how much of the economic gains during the 40 years preceding       the date of enactment of this Act have accrued to the top of       the income distribution. Between 1980 and 2014, the average       income of the top 1 percent of the income distribution grew 5       times as much as the average income of the bottom 90 percent       of the income distribution and more than 9 times as much as       the average income of the bottom \1/2\.        (7) Official and timely estimates of distributional growth       from BEA, reported alongside top-line GDP numbers, would       enable Congress to better evaluate economic  [[Page S7161]]       policies that impact every individual in the United States.        (8) Efforts to address slow wage growth, stagnant incomes,       and growing economic inequality require broadening the focus       beyond GDP and obtaining metrics that better correspond to       the experiences of all families in the United States.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3102         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Measuring Real Income Growth       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Economic inequality in the United States has increased       dramatically during the 4 decades preceding the date of       enactment of this Act, with fewer households taking home a       larger share of the national income.        (2) While growth was once distributed relatively evenly       across all individuals in the United States, research shows       that economic gains are increasingly enjoyed by the most       affluent. By contrast, the majority of individuals in the       United States have seen income and wage growth significantly       below what is suggested by national measures of output and       income.        (3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of       Commerce (referred to in this section as ``BEA'') reports       annual and quarterly estimates of gross domestic product       (referred to in this section as ``GDP'') in the United       States. These estimates are important measures of the overall       size and health of the economy of the United States but do       not describe how economic gains are distributed across the       population of the United States.        (4) In a country of 325,000,000 individuals, top-line GDP       numbers do not capture the full range of household economic       experiences and may be misleading. For example, the real GDP       grew more than 3 percent annually between 2003 and 2005, but       the average income for \1/2\ of all individuals in the United       States fell during that period.        (5) Disaggregating economic growth by income groups will       provide a more complete picture of how families in the United       States are faring across all rungs of the economic ladder and       whether economic growth is benefitting all individuals in the       United States.        (6) Recent academic estimates of distributional growth show       how much of the economic gains during the 40 years preceding       the date of enactment of this Act have accrued to the top of       the income distribution. Between 1980 and 2014, the average       income of the top 1 percent of the income distribution grew 5       times as much as the average income of the bottom 90 percent       of the income distribution and more than 9 times as much as       the average income of the bottom \1/2\.        (7) Official and timely estimates of distributional growth       from BEA, reported alongside top-line GDP numbers, would       enable Congress to better evaluate economic  [[Page S7161]]       policies that impact every individual in the United States.        (8) Efforts to address slow wage growth, stagnant incomes,       and growing economic inequality require broadening the focus       beyond GDP and obtaining metrics that better correspond to       the experiences of all families in the United States.
