 Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order  against consideration of the resolution because the resolution waives  all points of order against consideration of H.R. 5376.   The resolution is therefore in violation of section 426 of the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 prohibiting the consideration of a  rule waiving the application of section 425 of the Unfunded Mandates  Reform Act of 1995.    Madam Speaker, we have seen a circus here for  the last 7 hours. We saw history: The longest vote held in this body in  modern history, a motion to adjourn, just so some backroom agreement  could be made.   This point of order, the whole purpose of it, is to make sure that  this budget bill that is before us--before there is a vote--that we  know the true cost of this agreement from the Congressional Budget  Office. That is what the rules are.   We know that there are more than 150 different programs being created  in this legislation, and we know that there are a lot of many--numerous  different possibilities of unfunded mandates that would go to the  States, that would go to individuals. And before there is a vote on  this bill, a vote on this rule, we need to make sure that there is a  Congressional Budget Office score. We do not need to violate the House  rules and Federal statute by forcing through this piece of legislation  without knowing exactly the cost.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that was sent to the  Speaker of the House from five different Democrats of this body,  following our lead, what we just said here, that there should not be a  vote on this bill until the Congressional Budget Office does a score.                                   Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, November 2, 2021.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Speaker: As we work to put the COVID-19 crisis       behind us and build back better than ever before, we applaud       your focus on infrastructure and on measures that help       children and working families across America.        We continue to ask that you please schedule a floor vote on       the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework as soon as possible,       and we are pleased by the progress we are making on the Build       Back Better (BBB) Act. As we enter the home stretch of these       negotiations, we ask that you please provide additional       information so that we may make more informed decisions that       better serve our constituents.        First, we applaud the commitment from both you and the       President that the BBB Act will be fully paid for. In order       to ensure the final bill is indeed fiscally responsible, we       must first have the proper CBO/JCT scoring information before       any floor consideration. Therefore, we cannot lend our       support to advancing the BBB Act until we have had a chance       to review these scores which provide the true cost of the       legislation. Moreover, the U.S. Senate cannot even consider       the BBB Act under reconciliation rules until it has received       an official CBO score.        Secondly, we appreciate your public statements committing       to properly pre-conferencing the BBB Act with the U.S.       Senate. We continue to urge you to only bring a bill to the       floor for which we have a strong level of confidence that the       provisions in the bill will be ruled in order by the Senate       Parliamentarian and earn passage in the U.S. Senate.        Finally, consistent with House rules and considering the       magnitude and complexity of the BBB Act, we ask that the       final text of the bill be posted at least 72 hours before its       consideration so that we--and, more importantly our       constituents--have time to review the bill before any vote.        While we understand the needs of the nation are great, we       believe our job as legislators is to provide the due       diligence required to properly serve our constituents. It is       better to get this done right than to needlessly rush its       consideration only for our constituents to discover the       negative impacts of our unintended consequences.            Sincerely,      Ed Case.      Josh Gottheimer.      Kurt Schrader.      Jared Golden.      Stephanie Murphy.     Madam Speaker, I hope that the five Members  that are on this letter to the Speaker will follow through with the  same commitment that they allowed on November 2, and to make sure that  the American people get a valid, transparent score so that they know  what exactly is in this piece of legislation.   We know it is the largest spending bill in the history of the United  States. We just don't know exactly how much. It is at least $4.5  trillion, but we don't have the Congressional scorecards of doing it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, it has been quite a groundhog day when you watch what  has been going on with this legislation over and over. It started out  with a 2,400 page bill; last Thursday a new 1,700 page bill was  dropped; this week on Wednesday an additional 2,135 page bill was  dropped, and none of the bills have been completely scored.   What we do know, after 11 p.m. last night they made additional  changes to the 2,135 page bill that was dropped on Wednesday. And you  know what their priorities were in those changes? It was to give  millionaires larger tax breaks. That was their priority, to give  already millionaires larger tax breaks.   They try to tell you that this legislation was about the kids and the  babies and it is all about the children. That is a bunch of hogwash,  Madam Speaker. This bill is all about giving tax breaks to the  millionaires. The largest portion in this bill, over $300 billion, goes  toward their tax breaks for millionaires.   They don't want a score because they don't want the American people  to see the giveaways that they are giving to the most wealthy at the  expense of the working class. That is unacceptable. We need to make  sure that the only thing that is bipartisan in this legislation is  bipartisan opposition.   There is bipartisan support to make sure that this bill is scored  before a vote, to make sure that the American people know what is in  this bill. Don't you dare try to sneak this through. Don't you dare.   The people of the United States deserve the huge tax break you are  giving your millionaires in this legislation. Madam Speaker, I hope the  five Democrats that sent this letter to the Speaker join with us and  makes sure that we know how much the price tag is in this legislation,  in this proposal, so we can tell everyday working-class Americans how  much their cost of goods are going to be going up because of the  reckless, irresponsible spending of the people on that side of the  aisle.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
