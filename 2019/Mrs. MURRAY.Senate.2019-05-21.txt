 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I want to start today by expressing my  appreciation to all of my colleagues who will be out here today  speaking out and to the women and men nationwide who are doing the same  today in their own communities.   In the last few weeks, we have seen some of the most blatant and  cruel efforts yet to deny women access to a safe, legal abortion. We  have seen legislation so extreme, it would even block a 12-year-old  survivor of rape from getting an abortion and sentence healthcare  providers to prison for providing safe, medically sound care to their  patients, which is their responsibility.   The extreme politicians behind these cruel abortion bans are not  stopping in Alabama or Missouri or anywhere else; they want to take  these bans all the way to the Supreme Court. They want to allow Brett  Kavanaugh to do what President Trump and Republicans chose him to do-- roll back the decision in Roe v. Wade that established a woman's  constitutionally protected right to make her own decisions about her  own body and her own healthcare.   They are pushing for this even though they know as well as we do that  without the ability to exercise that right, women lose their lives;  even though they know just as well as we do that without this right,  doctors will be blocked from providing medically appropriate care. Let  me be frank. Extreme conservatives will push these abortion bans all  the way to the Supreme Court even though they know--or maybe even  because they do know--that in a world where women cannot control what  happens to their own bodies, they are less able to plan their family  and stay financially secure and independent. That means they are less  free and less equal.   I am not going to stand for that, and Senate Democrats are not going  to stand for that either. I am proud to be on the floor today with a  number of my colleagues who will be here standing for what our  Constitution confirms is true: Women have the right to access safe,  legal abortion, and this makes our country stronger because women are  absolutely critical to our country's strength. I am proud to be making  clear that even in the face of relentless attacks on women's health and  rights, we are not going to back down one bit.   The truth is, there are certain extreme politicians around the  country who want to take us backward to the ``Mad Men'' era or,  honestly, quite a bit before that. But they aren't speaking for our  country--quite the opposite. In fact, the vast majority of women and  men nationwide, including those from all different backgrounds, agree  that abortion should be safe and it should be legal, just as our  Constitution says. Those people are watching now. They are speaking up,  and they are absolutely going to remember who stood up to protect  women's health and rights and who pushed to take those rights away.   We have a number of Senators who will be speaking about this today,  and I want to thank them for being here today.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I am honored to pay tribute to  Joel Courreges, a Washingtonian, a marine, and commander of the  Disabled American Veterans, Chapter 5, upon his passing.   Joel Courreges was a man who never stopped serving his community, his  State, and his country. Joel served our Nation as a marine in the  Vietnam war, returning with disabilities both visible and invisible.  Having seen firsthand how difficult the transition home can be, he made  it his mission to smooth the path for his fellow veterans as they  returned from service. Joel became the commander of the Disabled  American Veterans, Chapter 5, in Bremerton, WA. In this role, he not  only dedicated countless hours to helping veterans file claims with the  VA and making sure they could make their appointments, he even drove  them himself if they couldn't get there on their own.   But that wasn't all. As Joel saw what more and more veterans were  going through, he realized the system wasn't working. Too many  veterans, especially those with PTSD and other wounds of war beneath  the surface, were getting caught up in courts that didn't understand  their unique needs and weren't prepared or designed to help them get  back on their feet. Because of Joel's drive and vision, the Kitsap  County Veterans Court was created, with the goal of helping the men and  women who sacrificed to defend our freedoms get a hand up when they  were most in need.   Having seen Joel's efforts firsthand, I know without a doubt that his  dedication to public service lifted countless others, especially  veterans who have given our country so much, and helped them lead the  fulfilling lives they deserve. I will always be grateful to Joel for  his kindness, his generosity of spirit, and his determination to make a  difference. My thoughts are with his family and all those who loved  him.                            ____________________
