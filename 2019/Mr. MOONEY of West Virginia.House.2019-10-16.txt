 Madam Speaker, during the impeachment  inquiries of Presidents Nixon and Clinton, the House of  Representatives, led, respectively, by Speakers Carl Albert and Newt  Gingrich, established the following procedures that are currently not  being followed in this rushed process to impeach President Trump. Let  me lay them out for you, because I think the American people need to  understand this.   First, there should be coequal powers to both the chair and ranking  member of the committee;   All subpoenas are subject to a vote of the full committee;   The President's counsel would have the right to attend the hearings  and depositions;   The President's counsel has the right to present evidence;   The President's counsel has the right to object to the admittance of  evidence;  [[Page H8178]]    The President's counsel has the right to cross-examine witnesses; and   The President's counsel has the right to recommend a witness list.   These are being denied to the President of the United States. If this  could be denied to the President, it could be denied to you or your  child.   This is so wrong. This so-called impeachment inquiry is an  abomination.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman  Grothman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I spoke a little earlier in a 1 minute on this topic,  but I was a little pressed for time, and I saw my good friend from  Arkansas, Mr. Hill, speaking on this and other important issues, and my  friend from Wisconsin, and I thought I would expand a little bit upon  my remarks earlier.   As the previous speaker just talked about, we have important trade  issues and other issues the President of the United States is working  on with other countries, and I couldn't agree more that those are  important issues to be working on. That is exactly what the President  and Congress should be focused on. In fact, it should be focused on  that in a bipartisan way, Republicans and Democrats working together.   Instead, what we are faced with is this pretty bizarre impeachment  inquiry process. I think it is important for the American people to  know and understand how this is supposed to work and how it is working.   An impeachment inquiry sounds, first, like it is a fair discussion  process, but in the past, during impeachment inquiries of President  Nixon and President Clinton, the House of Representatives right here,  led respectfully at the time by Speakers Carl Albert and Newt Gingrich,  established the following procedures that are currently not being  provided in this rushed process to attempt to impeach President Trump.   This is an important precedent when you are dealing with the  President of the United States, who is duly elected by the people of  this country. The people of the West Virginia Second Congressional  District that I represent voted for Donald Trump for President.   This country, in the fair process of the electoral college, put  Donald Trump in as President of the United States, and my district  voted for Donald Trump for President of the United States. So that is  how we choose the leader of our country.   I stood there on the steps of the Capitol just a few years ago and  watched Donald Trump be inaugurated as President, with the support of  all the former living Presidents who attended at the time.   Our country has a process that is emulated in this world, admired by  the world, that we have a free election and we respect the results of  that election.   Instead, what we are seeing here, announced by the Speaker of the  House, is this so-called impeachment inquiry. However, she is denying  this President the same rights that other Presidents were given under  this so-called impeachment inquiry.   And what exactly are those? I think it is important to understand how  this has happened in the past and how it should be happening right now  but is not.   I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats  in Congress here, would like the American people not to understand what  they are doing. But first and foremost, in the past when this was done,  the two times it was done in the past, I am going to list the seven  things, the seven rights that have always been given to the accused  party. In this case, that is Donald Trump, the President of the United  States.   First, in the committee hearings, there should be given coequal  subpoena power to both the chairman of the committee and the ranking  member of the committee, which is the minority party. At that committee  level, they are given coequal power to subpoena witnesses. Right now it  is one-sided. Those who want to impeach Donald Trump are subpoenaing  witness after witness after witness, and the other side does not have  the power to subpoena witnesses to maybe offer counterinformation. That  is how a fair process is supposed to work.   Secondly, all subpoenas have been subject to a vote of the full  committee at the request of either the chairman or the ranking member.  So to avoid a one-person witch hunt, when you want to subpoena  somebody, the head of either party here in Congress can request a  committee vote, and the committee can vote ``yes'' to subpoena or  ``no'' to subpoena. So rather than one person making all the decisions,  which seems to be how it is occurring right now, you have at least the  committee input. That is how it has been done in the past. That is not  happening right now.   Third, the President's counsel had the right to attend all hearings  and depositions. Can you imagine that? We have hearings and depositions  going on right now in the committees, and the President and his counsel  who represent him are not even allowed to hear what is being said about  him. This is, again, a denial of the basic right in America in a legal  process of any kind.   The President's counsel has had the right to present evidence,  because when you had evidence being presented on one side, unless it is  a kangaroo court, you had evidence presented on the other side. That is  being denied to the President of the United States.   The President's counsel has always had the right to object to the  admittance of evidence. Again, another basic legal procedure, a legal  right. The evidence being presented, it may have some objections to it,  it may not be accurate for a variety of reasons. The President is not  there, his counsel is not there. He can't even object to the evidence  being presented.   In the past, the President's counsel had the right to cross-examine  witnesses. This should be familiar. In this country, we have a right to  face those who accuse us, the right to face our accuser and the right  to cross-examine witnesses. Basic legal precepts in this country.   Last, the President's counsel would have the right to recommend a  witness list.    So, Mr. Speaker, it is important to understand that our President is  being denied these seven basic legal rights to defend himself right  now. This is not a fair and just system in any way.   My mother fled a communist country. When she was 20 years old, she  was in Cuba. Fidel Castro came down from the mountains with guns and  locked her and her family up. My mother was in prison for 7 weeks.   In communist countries, you have to prove your innocence. You are  accused first, and then you are stuck with the burden of somehow trying  to prove you didn't do something, trying to prove that you are not  guilty.   In this country, they have to prove you are guilty. You have the  right to be presumed innocent. Innocent until proven guilty.  [[Page H8190]]    Mr. Speaker, it is a disgrace what is happening here. The President  is somehow in this court of public opinion with one-sided evidence  trying to prove his innocence to people who are assuming he is guilty  and haven't presented any real evidence to that fact.   Even if a person is not a supporter of President Trump, they still  should object to this process. Only imagine if they were falsely  accused of something or God forbid their son or daughter was falsely  accused of something. They would expect their child to have these same  basic rights of legal process to defend themselves.   If they can deny these rights to the President of the United States  of America, rest assured, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  will deny that right to other citizens one day. We should be alarmed at  this no matter where we stand on the issue of liking President Trump or  not.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I again thank my colleague from Wisconsin,  Congressman Grothman, for yielding me this time.
