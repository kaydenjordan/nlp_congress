 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of important funding  included in this year's NDAA that will benefit an important initiative  with respect to industrial control systems.   Specifically, this funding will advance a key concept in the Army's  Smart Installations Strategy and begin to address critical research  required to advance our capabilities in the area of testing the  cybersecurity and our embedded industrial control systems.   The University of Tulsa in my district has significant capabilities  in the area of cybersecurity research and has been engaged in  attempting to address many of the issues associated with industrial  control systems.  [[Page H5138]]    TU's research efforts in the area of cybersecurity protection are  unmatched in the Nation. They play an important role in our national  security and deserve this essential funding.   I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma City (Mrs. Bice) for her  work on the House Armed Services Committee to ensure this funding was  included in this year's NDAA.                            ____________________
