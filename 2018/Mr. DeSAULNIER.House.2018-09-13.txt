 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 606, a  bill to designate the United States Post Office at 1025 Nevin Avenue in  Richmond, California as the ``Harold D. McCraw, Sr., Post Office  Building.''   Harold D. McCraw, Sr. began working for the Richmond Post Office in  1956 as a Career Substitute Carrier, and worked in various supervisory  positions during his tenure of more than 45 years.   From the time of his appointment as Officer-in-Charge of Richmond in  August of 1973, Harold was active in the National Association of  Postmasters of the United States (NAPUS). He began with the East Bay  Chapter and served in the state chapter as Area Director, Chapter  Secretary Chapter President, and Chairman of the 1989 National  Convention held in San Francisco.   Harold served NAPUS at the national level as Western Region Liaison  Officer, EEO Committee Chairman, Advisory Board Member, and Postmasters  Representative. In January 1988, assumed the office of National Vice  President for Area 22. Harold also served as the Editor of the state  publication, The California Postmaster, and of the national  publication, Postmasters Gazette.   In addition to serving the community in his job as Richmond  Postmaster, Mr. McCraw also served on various boards and commissions.  He served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Greater Richmond  Community Social Services Corp., where he facilitated the development  of a childcare facility that has expanded to five locations and cares  for hundreds of children.   Harold also helped bring about great change in the Richmond area  through his service a member of the Richmond Management Service Corp  and the Greater Richmond Housing Corp., which established housing  projects and expanded retail space for small businesses in the area.   The post office on Nevin Avenue has operated as Richmond's main post  office since 1938. The building is located in the heart of downtown and  is a driver of the city's economy. During World War II it served as an  air raid shelter, and to this day remains a landmark and meeting point  for community residents. It is also a classic example of Art Deco  architecture that is an essential piece of Richmond history and  culture.   I am honored to name the post office in Richmond, California after  Harold, a man who dedicated his life to the United States Post Office  and the Richmond Committee.   I would like to thank Chairman Gowdy and Ranking Member Cummings for  their support of this legislation.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read  the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the  table.                            ____________________
