 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4894) to amend the Federal Funding  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, to require the budget  justifications and appropriation requests of agencies be made publicly  available, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   The bill before us, the Congressional Budget Justification  Transparency Act, is a commonsense, good government measure every  Member should support.   It would require the congressional budget justification documents  that agencies prepare for congressional committees to be posted online  in a centralized, searchable database.   This would make these detailed plain-language explanations of how  agencies plan to spend taxpayer dollars more accessible to the public.   I thank Representatives   Mike Quigley and Doug Collins for their  work on this bill.   Representative Quigley, in particular, has a long history as a strong  advocate of transparency in the operations of the Federal Government.   Representative Quigley is the founder and chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Transparency Caucus, which shines a light on the  importance of government transparency and accountability.   This legacy of championing good government stems from his time  serving as Cook County Commissioner where government reform was one of  his major legislative priorities.   H.R. 4894 builds on the work of the committee to improve government  transparency by allowing the public to more easily learn how Federal  agencies spend their taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  from Pennsylvania has no further speakers, I am prepared to close. I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I likewise, urge  passage of H.R. 4894, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand  the yeas and nays.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 2193) to require the Administrator of  General Services to issue guidance to clarify that Federal agencies may  pay by charge card for the charging of Federal electric motor vehicles,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2193         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Charging Helps Agencies       Realize General Efficiencies Act'' or the ``CHARGE Act''.       SEC. 2. PAYMENT BY CHARGE CARD FOR CHARGING FEDERAL ELECTRIC                     MOTOR VEHICLES.         (a) Definitions.--In this Act--        (1) the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of       General Services;        (2) the term ``charge card''--        (A) means a card, plate, coupon book, or other means       existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor,       or services; and        (B) includes--        (i) a card issued under the GSA SmartPay program; and        (ii) a Fleet Services card;        (3) the term ``covered electric motor vehicle'' means a       passenger carrier that is--        (A) a passenger motor vehicle; and        (B) an electric motor vehicle;        (4) the term ``electric motor vehicle'' has the meaning       given the term in section 601 of the Energy Policy Act of       1992 (42 U.S.C. 13271);        (5) the term ``electric motor vehicle charging station''       means a battery-charging station that permits the transfer of       electric energy (by conductive or inductive means) to a       battery or other storage device in an electric motor vehicle;       and        (6) the terms ``Federal agency'' and ``passenger carrier''       have the meanings given those terms in section 1344(h) of       title 31, United States Code.        (b) Guidance.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall issue guidance       to clarify that each Federal agency may, in accordance with       section 1344 of title 31, United States Code--        (1) charge a covered electric motor vehicle at a commercial       electric motor vehicle charging station; and        (2) pay for a transaction described in paragraph (1) with a       charge card.        (c) Issuance of Charge Cards.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator       shall issue to each Federal agency a charge card for each       covered electric motor vehicle of the Federal agency that may       be used by an officer or employee of the Federal agency to       pay for charging the covered motor vehicle in accordance with       the guidance issued under subsection (b).     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the  measure before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senators Gary Peters and Rob Portman for  their bipartisan work on this commonsense, forward-thinking measure, as  well as Congressman Ro Khanna and Anthony Gonzalez for championing a  companion bill in the House.   The SmartPay Program operated by the General Services Administration  is the world's largest commercial payment program, serving over 560  Federal entities. It also is used for the fuel, maintenance, and repair  of the government-wide commercial fleet.                                time  1500    With that size and reach comes impact and opportunity. SmartPay  actively supports the goal of incorporating electric, hybrid, and  hydrogen fuel cell vehicles into this fleet, yet it is not clear that  it can be used to pay for charging electric vehicles.   S. 2193 would reinforce this goal by requiring GSA to issue guidance  clarifying that authorized Federal employees can pay for charging  electric vehicles using SmartPay, just as they can for refueling  conventional motor vehicles.   The Federal Government must lead the way in embracing technology and  innovations that address society's gravest threats. Climate change is  at the top of that list, challenging us all to do better.   If we can rise to this challenge by investing in strategic  industries, workforce training, and solutions, we can rise from this  crisis as a safer, stronger, more prosperous Nation.   I am firmly committed to cutting-edge, solutions-oriented policies  that support our progress toward a Federal fleet of the future that is  clean, green, and efficient.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud S. 2193 for its important contribution toward  this goal, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  S. 2193, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand  the yeas and nays.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1668) to leverage Federal Government  procurement power to encourage increased cybersecurity for Internet of  Things devices, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1668         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as  much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Kelly and Hurd for introducing  the bill before us, which has garnered strong support from both sides  of the aisle.   As technology evolves rapidly, this bill will help safeguard our  Federal  [[Page H4353]]  workforce, systems, and data from the very real cyber threats posed by  the commonplace, everyday devices and items that make up the Internet  of Things.   Since 2014, there have been more devices connected to our networks  and in use than there are people on this planet.   Our committee has conducted extensive work this Congress to address  the silent war of cyberattacks that American governments, companies,  and citizens face on a daily basis. Reports indicate that 25 percent of  those attacks target these types of devices.   Without adequate standards and protections in place, these devices  can be compromised, hijacked, and utilized for surveillance,  disruption, denial-of-service, or ransomware attacks.   Currently, there are no national standards to ensure the security of  these connected devices. H.R. 1668 would establish minimum  cybersecurity standards for such devices that are owned by the Federal  Government, based on guidelines set by the National Institute of  Standards and Technology.   This bill will also require contractors or vendors to notify the  Federal Government if devices in Federal use have a known or suspected  security vulnerability.   H.R. 1668 recognizes that protecting our Nation from cyber threats is  an ongoing interactive process that requires established baseline  standards and constant vigilance.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly). Representative Kelly from  Illinois is an outstanding member of our Committee on Oversight and  Reform.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  has no further speakers, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance  of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 1668, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2575) to authorize an AI Center of  Excellence within the General Services Administration, and for other  purposes, as amended.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I thank Representative McNerney and former Ranking Member Meadows for  introducing the Artificial Intelligence in Government Act.   As the Federal Government faces historic challenges and resource  constraints due to the coronavirus pandemic, artificial intelligence  can provide innovative solutions to help agencies fulfill their  missions and is critical to broader IT modernization efforts.   H.R. 2575 would codify the Artificial Intelligence Center of  Excellence at the General Services Administration, advancing the  acquisition and implementation of AI technologies throughout the  Federal Government by providing expertise, best practices, and support.   The bill would improve cohesion and competency around Federal use and  adoption of AI by requiring agencies that use or plan to use such  technologies to submit a memorandum to the Director of OMB  demonstrating compliance with relevant guidelines. It also would  require the Office of Personnel Management to evaluate AI skills needed  in the Federal workforce and to provide an up-to-date occupational  series for these skills.   If we are to maintain our leadership and competitive edge globally,  America must prioritize these mission-critical capabilities and their  strategic implementation across Federal agencies.   We also must ensure that AI is deployed with an unwavering commitment  to cybersecurity, data security and integrity, ethics, privacy, and the  protection of the constitutional rights of our citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 2575, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5317) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 315 Addicks Howell Road in  Houston, Texas, as the ``Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5317         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DEPUTY SANDEEP SINGH DHALIWAL POST OFFICE                     BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston, Texas,       shall be known and designated as the ``Deputy Sandeep Singh       Dhaliwal Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post       Office Building''.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 5317, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston, Texas, as the  Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building.   Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal was born in Punjab, India, before his parents  decided to emigrate to Houston, Texas.   Before joining the Harris County Sheriff's Office, Deputy Dhaliwal  owned a successful trucking business.   It was his sense of duty and a desire to build a bridge between the  department and the Houston area Sikh community that compelled him to  join the Sheriff's office.   He joined the force as a detention officer in 2009 and was later  deputized and graduated to the rank of patrol deputy. He was assigned  to northwest Harris County where he would stay for the rest of his  career.   Deputy Dhaliwal was the first observant Sikh to serve in the Harris  County Sheriff's Office and was one of the first observant Sikhs in  Texas to receive an accommodation to observe his religion while serving  as a police officer.   He served with distinction and was a shining example of the important  contributions that religious minorities make to our country.   Deputy Dhaliwal also spent countless hours volunteering for Sikh  communities across the Nation.   Tragically, he was shot and killed while conducting a routine traffic  stop. He was only 42 years old and is survived by his wife and three  children.   Naming a post office in his honor is a fitting tribute to a man who  served selflessly, made the ultimate sacrifice for his community, and  left this country a better place.   I would like to thank the honorable Member from Texas, Representative  [[Page H4357]]  Fletcher, for this legislation to honor a dedicated public servant and  trailblazer for the rights of religious minorities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as she may consume to the distinguished gentlewoman from the great  State of Texas (Mrs. Fletcher). I congratulate my friend on this bill.    MALONEY of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4672) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 21701 Stevens Creek  Boulevard in Cupertino, California, as the ``Petty Officer 2nd Class  (SEAL) Matthew G. Axelson Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4672         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PETTY OFFICER 2ND CLASS (SEAL) MATTHEW G. AXELSON                     POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 21701 Stevens Creek Boulevard in       Cupertino, California, shall be known and designated as the       ``Petty Officer 2nd Class (SEAL) Matthew G. Axelson Post       Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Petty Officer 2nd Class (SEAL) Matthew       G. Axelson Post Office Building''.     MALONEY of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 4672 to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located  at 21701 Stevens Creek Boulevard in Cupertino, California, as the Petty  Officer 2nd Class (SEAL) Matthew G. Axelson Post Office Building.   Petty Officer Axelson was born June 25, 1976, in Cupertino,  California. He was raised locally and graduated from Monta Vista High  School in 1994.   Petty Officer Axelson attended California State University at Chico  and graduated with a degree in political science. He joined the Navy in  2000 and went on to earn a position as a member of its elite special  warfare team, the SEALs.   Only a few short months after he was deployed to Afghanistan, Petty  Officer Axelson and two other members of his unit were ambushed and  killed by enemy forces in June of 2005. The surviving member of his  team would go on to write the book ``Lone Survivor'' that depicts the  courageous actions of the four SEALs on that day.   Petty Officer Axelson was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, the  [[Page H4358]]  second highest military award for valor in the United States. Naming a  post office in his honor will serve as a tribute to a true American  hero taken from us far too soon.   I would like to thank Representative Khanna, a distinguished member  of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, for this legislation to honor  this American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I now close urging passage of H.R. 4672.   I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 5597 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 305 Northwest 5th Street, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as the  Clara Luper Post Office Building.   Clara Luper made her mark in a time when people of color could not  even walk through the front door of Oklahoma City businesses. She had a  vision for equality, a heart for service, and a commitment to justice.  She knew that Oklahoma and this country could be a place where everyone  is treated with respect, dignity, and humanity.   In August of 1958, Ms. Luper and 14 of her NAACP youth council  students organized one of America's first sit-ins when they entered  Katz Drug Store in Oklahoma City to order a hamburger and a Coke. They  were denied service but refused to leave. Though they were verbally and  physically assaulted, they persisted.   Within days of the sit-in, Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch  counters not just in Oklahoma City, but in three other States as well.   Her initiative helped inspire the 1961 Greensboro, North Carolina,  sit-in at the Woolworth's lunch counter, which fueled momentum within  the civil rights movement.   Ms. Luper continued her fight for freedom. She was arrested 26 times,  integrated the history department at the University of Oklahoma by  becoming its first African-American graduate of the master's program  and worked tirelessly across the State in pursuit of her vision for  justice. We should commemorate this heroine of the civil rights  movement by naming a post office in her honor.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable gentlewoman and my very good  friend from Oklahoma, Representative Horn, for this legislation to  honor a heroine of the civil rights movement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much  time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the great State of  Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 5597, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3847) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 117 West Poythress Street  in Hopewell, Virginia, as the ``Reverend Curtis West Harris Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3847         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

MALONEY of New York. I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3847, to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located  at 117 West Poythress Street in Hopewell, Virginia, as the ``Reverend  Curtis West Harris Post Office Building''.   Mr. Speaker, Reverend Curtis West Harris was born in Dendron,  Virginia, on July 1, 1924. After graduating from high school and the  Virginia Union University in Richmond, he worked at Allied Chemical.   After an executive order was issued to prohibit discrimination at  companies that received contracts from the Federal Government, Reverend  Harris successfully sued Allied Chemical for violating the order.   Reverend Harris continued the fight for social justice and would be  arrested more than a dozen times for acts of peaceful protest and civil  disobedience.   In 1960, he joined the national board of the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference. He would eventually head its Virginia chapter  for more than 30 years.   Reverend Harris was one of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King's top  lieutenants, joining Dr. King's 54-mile march in 1965 from Selma to  Montgomery. Reverend Harris continued to lead marches and engage in  other forms of action for decades despite repeated threats against his  life and his family.   He later would be elected to the Hopewell City Council and became  Hopewell's first Black mayor in 1998.   Reverend Harris died on December 10, 2017, at the age of 93. He was  buried in Appomattox Cemetery, the same cemetery he fought to integrate  in 1960.   Naming a post office after Reverend Curtis West Harris would  celebrate the memory of a civil rights icon who fought throughout his  life for social justice.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Member from Virginia,  Representative McEachin, for this legislation to honor a civil rights  leader and hero.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 3847, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3870) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 511 West 165th Street in  New York, New York, as the ``Normandia Maldonado Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3870         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

When Normandia Maldonado came to the United States in 1960, she  brought her love for the arts and her passion for serving the  community. She began her career as a dancer and teacher while also  becoming actively involved in the Washington Heights community as an  activist and a leader.   Ms. Maldonado promoted Dominican culture in New York City and was a  pioneer in the development of Dominican history in the United States.  She cofounded the second oldest Dominican cultural institution in New  York, the Instituto Duartiano of the United States.   Ms. Maldonado also founded a ballet company, Casandra Damiron Hall of  Fame, and was a founding member of the Dominican Day Parade.   Ms. Maldonado was an artist, activist, leader, and legend who made  pivotal contributions to the Washington Heights community, Dominican  culture in America, and all New Yorkers.   I would like to thank my colleague and friend, Representative  Espaillat, a distinguished member of the New York delegation, for  introducing this measure to honor a great artistic and community  leader.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 5062, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 9930 Conroy Windermere Road in Windermere, Florida,  as the Officer Robert German Post Office Building.   Robert German was born in Burlington, Ontario, on March 4, 1983. He  moved with his family to central Florida at the age of 5.   After high school and college at South Georgia College, he moved back  to central Florida to work in airport operations. There, he regularly  worked with security and local police departments, which inspired him  to serve his community by pursuing a career in law enforcement.   After graduating in 2007 from Seminole State College Law Enforcement  Academy, Officer German decided to serve the town of Windermere, where  he hoped the tight-knit community would allow him to build personal  relationships with fellow officers and residents.   On the night of March 22, 2014, Officer German was shot and killed.  His untimely death marks the first time in the history of the  Windermere Police Department that an officer was slain in the line of  duty.   Officer German exemplified the best of Windermere's police  department. Dedicating a post office after Officer Robert German would  honor his courage and dedication to his community.   I would like to thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Demings) for this legislation to honor a dedicated public servant  taken far too soon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I likewise urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 5062, and I yield back the balance of my  time.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 4975, to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located  at 1201 Sycamore Square Drive in Midlothian, Virginia, as the Dorothy  Braden Bruce Post Office Building.   Dorothy Bruce served as a cryptanalyst with the U.S. Army Signal  Corps' Signal Intelligence Service during World War II. Dorothy Bruce  served with thousands of other women as code breakers who were vital to  the war effort in the Pacific.   Dorothy's unit was critical in discovering the locations of Japanese  ships in the Pacific, identifying and intercepting enemy supply convoys  and protecting the lives of countless American servicemembers.   She passed away at the age of 99 last year.   Naming a post office after Dorothy Bruce will serve as a bright  example for women and girls pursuing careers in science and math and  will honor her remarkable service to the country in one of its darkest  hours.   I want to thank the honorable Member from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger)  for this legislation to honor one of our Nation's quiet, unsung heroes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Althea Mills began her education in Pughsville, which was Winter  Haven's first Black community. When she moved at the age of 13 to  Pennsylvania to live with her aunt, Ms. Mills was able to attend  integrated schools before returning to Winter Haven, which was not  integrated.   In 1963, Ms. Mills filed a lawsuit against the Polk County Board of  Education. The result of the lawsuit allowed her son to attend Winter  Haven High School, which was all White at that time. Ms. Mills'  successful lawsuit would later be credited with the integration of all  Polk County public schools.   Ms. Mills was also the first Black employee of the United States  Postal Service in Winter Haven. She later would manage the Florence  Villa Post Office.   Althea Mills passed away in 2008. Naming a post office after her  would commemorate an unsung hero in the fight for desegregation in  Florida and a trailblazer for civil rights who improved the lives of  countless students.

John Henry ``Dick'' Turpin was a U.S. Navy sailor born in 1876. Over  his distinguished and accomplished career, Turpin likely became the  first African American qualified as a master class diver, in 1915, and  one of the first African-American Navy chief petty officers.   Mr. Turpin's three-decade career in the Navy included service during  the Spanish-American War, the Boxer Rebellion, and World War I. During  World War II, Mr. Turpin volunteered to make inspirational visits to  Navy training centers and defense plants. He survived two Navy  disasters: the sinking of both the USS Maine in 1898 and the USS  Bennington in 1905.   Naming a post office after John Henry ``Dick'' Turpin would honor his  distinguished service and unwavering commitment to our country.

Donald William Durr, 39, died in the line of duty on May 27, 2017.  William was a deputy with the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department,  where he had been employed for 2 years. In the weeks just prior to his  passing, he had completed training to become the department's DARE  officer and educator.   Prior to joining the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department, he was a  police officer with the Brookhaven Police Department for 4 years.  William enjoyed spending time doing youth and children ministries,  where he would often use his talents on the guitar.   James White, 35, died in the line of duty on September 29, 2018, by  gunfire. James was employed by the Brookhaven Police Department for 3  months and was previously employed with the Lawrence County Sheriff's  Department, where he worked for many years.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration  of H.R. 4734 to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 171 South Maple Street in Dana, Indiana, as the  Ernest Taylor Pyle Post Office Building.   Ernest or ``Ernie'' Pyle began his career in media writing for  Indiana University's campus student newspaper, the Indiana Daily  Student.   Mr. Pyle took a job as a reporter for the La Porte Herald in Indiana,  moving through a variety of publications, before working with the  Scripps-Howard News Service where he covered aviation and travel  throughout the 1930s.   But it was during World War II that Mr. Pyle made his greatest  contributions to American journalism and the American war effort.   Beginning in 1942, Mr. Pyle began reporting from the front lines of  both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of war, bringing the experiences  and stories of soldiers back home to America.   His simple storytelling style of writing and first-person  perspectives endeared him to Americans back home and abroad alike.   His reporting led directly to congressional legislation that provided  combat infantry with an additional $5 to $10 a month to compensate them  for more dangerous positions. This benefit would eventually lead to the  creation of combat pay as we know it today.   Through the course of the war, Mr. Pyle wrote and reported from the  front lines in battles ranging from Anzio in Italy, to the beaches of  Normandy on D-Day, to Okinawa in the Pacific.   Near the end of the war on April 18, 1945, Mr. Pyle was reporting on  the U.S. Army's 305th Infantry Regiment in the South Pacific when he  was killed by enemy fire.   Following his death, President Harry Truman stated, ``No man in this  war has so well told the story of the American fighting man as American  fighting men wanted it told.''   Ernie Pyle was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for journalism for his  correspondence in the war, as well as the Medal for Merit and the  Purple Heart posthumously. Today his legacy lives on through his  depictions of soldiers in World War II.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3275 to designate the facility of the U.S. Post Office located at  340 Wetmore Avenue, Grand River, Ohio, as the Lance Corporal Andy `Ace'  Nowacki Post Office Building.   Andrew, known as Andy or Ace to those who knew him, learned the  importance of duty, country, commitment and community at a young age,  as his parents had many friends who were police officers and veterans.   Andy graduated from Brush High School in 1998 and joined the Marine  Corps.   Andy also attended the Cleveland Heights Police Academy becoming a  patrolman for Grand River in 2001. He was a dedicated member of the  Ready Response Team, the Honor Guard, and the Bike Patrol, always  looking to protect and serve his community.                                time  1645    On February 26, 2005, he was killed by a roadside bomb on his second  tour of duty in Iraq. He was serving as a gunner on a Humvee that was  protecting a truck convoy south of Baghdad.   Andy bravely served his country and community, and his memory in both  of these roles should be commended.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Member from Ohio,  Representative Joyce, for his legislation to honor this American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 5384 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 100 Crosby Street in Mansfield, Louisiana, as the Dr. C.O.  Simpkins, Sr., Post Office.   Born and raised in Mansfield, Louisiana, Dr. Simpkins attended Wiley  College and Tennessee State University for his undergraduate studies  before earning a degree in dentistry from Meharry Medical College.   Following his undergraduate education, he joined the U.S. Air Force,  obtaining the rank of captain before being honorably discharged.   After his military service, he returned to Shreveport, Louisiana, to  open a dental practice. During this time, he became very involved with  the civil rights movement and was a close friend of Dr. Martin Luther  King.   This drew the attention of racist organizations like the Ku Klux  Klan, and his home and office were firebombed. Fearing for his safety,  Dr. Simpkins moved to New York, where he continued to advocate for  civil rights.   After living in New York for 26 years, Dr. Simpkins returned to  Shreveport, reopened his dental practice, and pursued a career in  politics. He won a seat in the Louisiana State House of  Representatives, where he served for one term before returning to his  dental practice full time.   He retired from his practice in 2011. Dr. Simpkins passed away on  December 4, 2019, at the age of 94. We are pleased to honor his legacy  and memory by naming a post office in his honor.

Rhonald Dain Rairdan was born on April 22, 1984, at Eglin Air Force  Base, Florida. He was a 2003 graduate of Medina Valley High School,  where he was a member of the ROTC drill team.   Dain was raised in an Air Force family and lived in many different  places, but he wanted to be a U.S. marine his entire life.   Four months after joining the Marine Corps, Lance Corporal Rairdan  was deployed to the Middle East to join the Marine-led offensive to  take control of Fallujah.   Lance Corporal Rairdan's unit was tasked with hunting for weapon  stockpiles and policing the damaged city as residents tried to regain a  sense of normalcy.   On January 26, 2005, the helicopter he was onboard crashed near  Rutbah, Iraq, killing 30.   Dain died doing what he loved, protecting the United States.   Castroville, Texas, was his adopted home, and naming this post office  for him will allow the residents there to remember and honor his  dedicated service.

Throughout his childhood, he  attended public schools in Montrose and eventually graduated, in 1986,  from Montrose High School.   After graduation, he attended Mesa State College and Delta Montrose  Technical College, where he trained and completed his education to  achieve his lifelong dream of becoming a police officer.   He worked for several different departments, starting with the  Telluride Marshal's Office, the San Miguel County Sheriff's Office, and  the Montrose County Sheriff's Office.   In the last 10 years of his career, he worked for the Montrose Police  Department, and he was also a volunteer for the Montrose Fire  Protection District.

Lugar Post Office.   Richard Lugar was born in Indianapolis in 1932. After attending high  school, he studied at Denison University and Oxford as a Rhodes  Scholar. He then served in the U.S. Navy as an intelligence officer and  returned to Indianapolis soon after. He first served in local  government on the school board and then became city mayor.   In 1976, Richard Lugar was elected to the United States Senate. While  in office, he made significant bipartisan reforms to the farm program,  started the biofuels research program, and preserved the Federal school  lunch program.   Senator Lugar also left a mark on United States foreign policy. He  served  [[Page H4369]]  34 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he was a  leader in reducing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.   With Senator Sam Nunn, Senator Lugar helped pass and implement the  Nunn-Lugar program, which dismantled the weapons of mass destruction  and their associated infrastructure in former Soviet Union states.   Senator Lugar was also instrumental in the expansion of the NATO  alliance, the creation of a program to end the global AIDS epidemic,  and the ratification of various antiterrorist treaties.   For his lifetime of service, Senator Lugar was awarded the  Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013, and he held 47 honorary degrees.   Senator Lugar passed away shortly after his 87th birthday on April  28, 2019. Naming a post office after Senator Lugar would help honor his  lifetime of public service.   I would like to thank Senator Braun and Representative Andre Carson,  who introduced the House companion for this bill to honor Senator  Lugar's lifetime of work to save our Nation.
