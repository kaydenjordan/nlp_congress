 Mr. Speaker, Philadelphians have been asking for help even  before the pandemic, help with things like childcare, the cost of  prescription drugs, housing, and jobs.   Philadelphia, I have heard you. I am proud to vote for the Build Back  Better Act and the infrastructure bill this week.   Most of all, today, we make history. We make history because we are  doing something for the American public. And it is important to  remember, Build Back Better sends a message to every single American  that we are on their side.
