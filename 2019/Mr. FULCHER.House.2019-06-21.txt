 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  although I do not oppose it.    Mr. Chair, this amendment will invest $5 million into  those much-needed beds at long-term care VA facilities. It is offset by  a reduction for that same amount from the VA IT systems account budget.   Most of Idaho's veterans served in Vietnam, and they are between 65  and 74 years old. While people are living longer today, they also need  more care. And in this case, there are mental healthcare concerns.   Passage of this amendment helps in that regard, giving more bed space  to veterans in need of long-term healthcare. These funds will also  provide options to help Idaho's heroes to remain closer to their  communities. Many studies have found that people tend to respond better  to treatment when they can be closer to their families.   Please note that this does not add to our growing deficit.   I thank my colleague from Maine, Congressman Jared Golden, for  working with me on this bipartisan amendment and for his service to our  country in the United States Marine Corps.   Improving care for our veterans should always be an issue that we can  agree on. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  supporting this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
