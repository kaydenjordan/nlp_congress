 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The recurring theme that I have heard today is that we should be  doing more to fix FISA. That is not unlike what James Madison described  in the Federalist Papers when he described parchment barriers between  the various departments of government, meaning the three branches of  government, afraid that all of it could be sucked into the vortex of  power--those are his words--of the legislative branch.   And here we are discussing parchment barriers for those who have  basically abused the FISA process so far. We are putting more parchment  barriers in place, but they don't mean anything. They don't mean  anything if you never see someone prosecuted.   So let's talk about one of the things that has been touted, a  lengthening of the time of sentencing from 5 years to 8 years if you  are found to commit abuse. How about contempt proceedings that are  being put in here?   But do you know what? We know FISA was abused. We know that people  lied to the court, and we know something else. The Inspector General  recommended criminal charges be filed on people.   These parchment barriers make no sense, have no strength and no  efficacy when we don't see someone indicted, charged, or convicted. To  say something is criminal in nature doesn't matter when you don't  prosecute them.   If you want to deter somebody, you must see prosecution so, that way,  you get specific deterrence for that individual or general deterrence  to the rest of the people who are inclined to commit bad acts.   The flaws in this bill are that we don't see application of any of  these reforms. So we can tout them all we wish--a whole litany of  them--but until you actually hold people accountable, this bill has no  efficacy. For that reason, I will be opposing.
