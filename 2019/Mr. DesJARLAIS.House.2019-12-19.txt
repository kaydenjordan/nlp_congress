 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that will replace the outdated North  American Free Trade Agreement.   USMCA opens new markets for American agriculture in Canada, returns  manufacturing jobs outsourced to Mexico to our own country, and is the  first U.S. trade deal to focus on cross-border commerce for small  businesses, easing rules and regulations to level the playing field for  startups and entrepreneurs.   Our economy is already strong. Jobs and income are growing,  especially for working and middle-class Americans. My home State of  Tennessee is a manufacturing and transportation hub, and small business  jobs and wage growth there lead the Nation. The USMCA will further  strengthen our economy.   However, the President's opposition, who just yesterday voted to  impeach him, have for years obstructed the agenda my constituents, as  well as Democrats and Republicans around the country, supported in  2016.   We have succeeded, despite unrelenting resistance. Donald Trump has  shown courage and determination that has resulted in a pending trade  deal with China. Combined with tax cuts, reduced regulations, and  American energy independence, these trade deals and others the  President has produced will continue our remarkable economic progress,  as well as strengthen national security.   I am proud to support the USMCA for Tennessee farmers, manufacturers,  and small businesses.
