 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have a short update on today's vote for  the information of all Senators.   Later this afternoon, the Senate is scheduled to hold a cloture vote  on a motion to proceed to a vehicle for the CR.   Now, Senate Republicans have made very clear they will block  legislation to fund the government if it includes bipartisan permitting  reform because they have chosen to obstruct instead of work in a  bipartisan way to achieve something they have long claimed they wanted  to do.   Because American families should not be subjected to a Republican- manufactured government shutdown, Senator Manchin has requested, and I  have agreed, to move forward and pass the recently filed continuing  resolution legislation without the Energy Independence and Security Act  of 2022.   Senator Manchin, myself, and others will continue to have  conversations about the best way to ensure responsible permitting  reform is passed before the end of the year.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 798, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 799, submitted  earlier today.    I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 468, which was received  from House and is at the desk.    Mr. President, I further ask that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. 4673 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  on Wednesday, September 28; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to Calendar No. 389, H.R. 6833, postcloture; further, that the  Senate recess between 12:30 and 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  caucus meetings; finally, that all time during adjournment, recess,  morning business, and leader remarks count postcloture.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:56 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, September 28, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
