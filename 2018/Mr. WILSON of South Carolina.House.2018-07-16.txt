 Mr. Speaker, The Post and Courier of  Charleston, South Carolina, has provided a thoughtful editorial  supporting the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.   The editorial reinforces that ``Brett Kavanaugh is a highly qualified  `originalist' who will help return the Supreme Court to its proper  function in American society. The Senate should quickly confirm him.''   ``Judge Kavanaugh . . . fits President Donald Trump's promise to  appoint judges known to adhere to the original language of the  Constitution and its amendments, and to closely follow the law as laid  down by Congress.''   ``As a Federal judge, Mr. Kavanaugh appears to have taken the . . .  view that Congress is the preeminent policymaking body of the Federal  government except where the Constitution gives policymaking powers to  the executive; that Congress, the executive branch and the judiciary  are all bound by the Constitution . . . and that judges and the  President are further bound by the permissible decisions of Congress.''   ``It would be a welcome change to see the court allow the political  branches of government to decide most political questions rather than  the court.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
