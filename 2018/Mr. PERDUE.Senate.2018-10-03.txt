 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this has the potential of being a historic  week in America. The last 10 days have been very troubling to me as a  U.S. Senator, as an individual citizen, husband, father, son.   I am very troubled today by the extreme measures we see being made  right now about a case my colleagues across the aisle are trying to  make. I am outraged, actually. After a personal incident that involved  my wife and me this week, we have seen firsthand the length to which  Members of the other side of the aisle will go to distract us away from  the truth.   This body, the U.S. Senate, has become nothing more than a bully  pulpit for someone's special cause, when it should be a deliberative  body. We should be finding the truth.   My Democratic colleagues claim they want to work together with  Republicans. They talk all the time about working in a bipartisan way.  Yet, when we get into the heat of the battle, nothing could be further  from the truth.   This is bigger than confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme  Court. This is about civility in our country. People have died  supporting our Constitution and fighting for the freedoms we have in  this country: innocent until proven guilty, for goodness' sake. When  that is not convenient with an argument you are trying to make, it gets  trashed. That is what we have seen this week in this body.   This is about the common discourse in America. Whoever said we always  have to agree? We don't. But whoever  [[Page S6477]]  said you have to hate someone if you disagree with them?   Senate Democrats have made it clear, they are willing to say or do  anything to stop the President's agenda which, by the way, is working.  We are growing this economy at twice the rate we achieved under  President Obama. We have over 331 nominees today waiting to be  confirmed--the first time in history this has ever been done to this  degree.   One of my Democratic colleagues called Judge Kavanaugh ``your worst  nightmare.'' Another called him ``a nominee who wants to pave the path  of tyranny.'' Yet another said: This Supreme Court confirmation would  mean ``the destruction of the Constitution.'' Seriously? That is  irresponsible for somebody in this body. She said that before Judge  Kavanaugh was even announced as a nominee. Worst of all, another one of  my Democratic colleagues said anyone who supports Judge Kavanaugh's  confirmation is ``complicit in the evil.'' I just don't understand  that.   Really? Senate Democrats want to be reasonable and work together?  Seriously? This rhetoric sounds anything but reasonable to me. In fact,  I believe my Democratic colleagues have gone one tick too far this  time. When paid activists who support you attack my wife, you have gone  too far. The American people will know that on both sides. That didn't  start outside this body; it actually started in here. You are inciting  this disrespect of our law.   One of my Democratic colleagues in this body has encouraged people to  ``get in the face of some Congresspeople.'' Really? How does that move  the cause of justice forward? The House minority leader wants to see  ``uprisings all over the country.'' Seriously?   Another Member of the House said--and I am quoting the entire quote  here.         They're not going to be able to go to a restaurant--    Talking about Republicans--         they're not going to be able to stop at a gas station,       they're not going to be able to shop at a department store.       The people are going to turn on them. They're going to       protest. They're going to absolutely harass them until they       decide that they're going to tell the president, no I can't       hang with you.    The same Member of the House also said:         If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a       department store, at a gasoline station . . . you get out and       create a crowd, and you push back on them and you tell them       they're not welcome.    This is America, but these are the tactics of the Brown Shirts in  Germany in the 1930s--unacceptable, totally irresponsible. This is  outrageous and unacceptable behavior for anyone but much less a Member  of this body, a Member of Congress, and a Member of the U.S. Senate.  You have crossed a line. Inciting dangerous behavior is not something  we should be about in this body.   Now, when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh, America was built on a bedrock  principle that we were trying to instill in America as opposed to what  we lived with under different rule in Europe, and that is this: The  presumption of innocence is sacred. An individual here is innocent  until proven guilty. That is part of what makes our country so  exceptional.   Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have become so far removed from  getting to the truth that they will stop at nothing to delay this  Supreme Court confirmation. That is all this week is about. It is  another delay.   Any objective observer would agree that Chairman Grassley afforded  both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh an equal opportunity to speak before  the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and to the American people. As a  matter of fact, any war on women this week and in this sad story here  has been perpetrated on Dr. Ford by Senate Democrats. She wanted this  to be confidential, and this body could have done that. They could have  done all the investigation confidentially without dragging her name  through the media--or Judge Kavanaugh's.   Some people on the Democratic side of the Senate want America to  believe this is just a simple case of he said, she said, and it comes  down to whom do you believe. It is a lot more than that. It is not only  he said, she said, but it is ``they said.''   The accuser in this case named three people who she said would  corroborate her story. Not only did they not corroborate her story,  they actually corroborated his story.   Senate Democrats were not satisfied even with that. They weren't  satisfied that when the letter was leaked to the press--it wasn't given  to the committee--but when it was leaked to the press some 6 weeks  after it was received by Senate Democrats--6 weeks--an investigation  was started immediately by the Judiciary Committee. Oh, but wait.  Senate Democrats chose not to participate. How is that for looking for  the truth? Instead, what they did is they waited until we had a hearing  and then said: Oh, we need another FBI investigation that we knew would  be totally redundant with what had just been done by Federal  investigators employed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but we went  ahead and agreed as a committee to do just what you wanted; that is, to  allow a full and open FBI investigation into this, which is nothing  more than redundant with what had just been done in the prior couple of  weeks.   Judge Kavanaugh has had six--six--FBI investigations. This is the  seventh formal FBI investigation. Not only that, the minute the  committee saw Dr. Ford's letter, it immediately, as I said, went into  detail with these outside Federal investigators, without the help of  Senate Democrats who are members of that committee. As a matter of  fact, when the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee met  with Judge Kavanaugh a few weeks ago, she had been in possession of  this letter from Dr. Ford for several weeks, and her staff had already  recommended an attorney to Dr. Ford, but in that meeting with Judge  Kavanaugh--the first meeting between the ranking member and Judge  Kavanaugh--she didn't mention the letter one time. That is in the  testimony. She held on to Dr. Ford's letter for 6 weeks before it was  leaked to the press.   Again, it is clear this is all a well-orchestrated effort to cause  delay and push this decision, hopefully--in their minds--past the  election. Shame on any Member of this body, Republican or Democratic,  that puts self-interests and political interests before their  constitutional responsibility.   The committee has voted favorably to move Judge Brett Kavanaugh's  nomination forward. That means it comes to this floor. It is time to  take a full vote before this body, before the U.S. Senate.   We hope in the next few hours, the next day, to have this FBI report  and to put this sad saga to bed. It is time to put partisan politics  and delays behind us. It is time to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to  the U.S. Supreme Court.   I want to say one more thing. It is time for this body to reread  their oath of office, to uphold and defend the Constitution of the  United States, to make sure that what we say in this body is the best  and the very best America has to offer, to move our concerns forward.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
