 Mr. Speaker, the GOP tax scam has been nothing but a  giveaway to millionaires and corporations. This Republican majority is  adding trillions--trillions--of dollars to our  [[Page H9108]]  national debt, debt that our children and grandchildren will have to  pay for for years to come, trillions in debt that will put Medicare and  Social Security at risk.   Already, we can't provide the minimum funding to the ACA, making it  harder for our constituents to get health insurance and access to care.   Now, how are the Republicans trying to pay for this debt? By  attacking--by attacking--the hardworking taxpayers like those that I  represent in the great State of California. That is right, so  millionaires and corporations can have a tax break. I call that welfare  for the most affluent people and corporations in America at the cost of  the hardworking taxpayers in California.   And let me say that again. Millions of Californians will see their  taxes increase with this GOP tax scam.   Now, today, as if we haven't already done enough, the Republican  majority is voting to make this tax increase permanent, a permanent tax  increase to our hardworking taxpayers.   California is the fifth largest global economy.    Mr. Speaker, California is the fifth largest global  economy and a donor State. We should be trying to make every other  State more like the great State of California.
