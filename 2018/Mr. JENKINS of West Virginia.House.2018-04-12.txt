 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.J. Res. 2 and to thank Chairman Goodlatte for his leadership on  this really critically important issue.   Washington is broken. After years of excessive spending and wasteful  stimulus projects, our national debt now tops $21 trillion. That is  more than $60,000 for each and every American. This is unsustainable.  But we are here to pass a resolution, the balanced budget amendment.  This is a solution to this $21 trillion debt.   Simply put, this amendment means Washington can't spend more than it  takes in. It means Congress has to live within a budget, just like  families in West Virginia. Families every day have to make careful  choices about how to best spend their money. It is time for the Federal  Government to do the same.   I am a proud cosponsor of this resolution and urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' later today for a balanced budget amendment. It is time to  get our fiscal house in order.   Pass this resolution. Pass the balanced budget amendment. Let's get  our fiscal house in order. The American people are depending on us.
