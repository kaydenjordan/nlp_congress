 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I was just over in the Russell Senate  Office Building, and a group of freshmen from the House intercepted me  and handed me this piece of paper, this document, and asked that it be  made part of the Record of the Senate, and I have come to do that.   Let me explain that these freshmen House Members want to see the  Senate engaged in debate on how to end this shutdown of our government.  They see in their home districts across this country tremendous damage  occurring in all kinds of fashions--damage to security; damage to the  economy; damage to families trying to get a home mortgage, and they  can't get their FHA approval; damage to farmers who are seeking that  loan that is necessary to prepare for the next farming season; damage  in the preparation for next summer's forest fires.   I have been hearing about this from my home State. In Oregon, we just  had a training for fighting fires canceled. We have prescribed burns  that need to be done during the winter that are being canceled. We have  thinning, which makes the forest more fire-resilient, that is being  canceled. We have the reduction of fuels on the forest floor that add  to the intensity of fires--the removal of those--being canceled. These  just add more to the list of so many ways that folks are being affected  across the country.   I am going to share this letter with the Presiding Officer and our  colleagues. It says:         Dear Senator McConnell:        We write as Members of the Freshman Class of the 116th       Congress, an historic group that has the distinction of being       the first Congress to be seated in the midst of a partial       government shutdown.        We as a legislative branch have the power to end this       shutdown now. In December, the Senate unanimously passed       legislation that would have kept the government open. In       January, the House then passed those same bipartisan bills       and sent them to the Senate. If the Senate were to pass these       bills, we would be able to reopen the government and then       proceed to debate about immigration reform and border       security.        However, it is impossible to have a meaningful policy       discussion while the executive holds public servants hostage.       We respectfully request that you allow the Congress to work       its will and allow a vote on this bipartisan legislation to       end this shutdown so that we can end this manufactured crisis       and allow our devoted federal workers to get back to work for       the American people.        Sincerely Susie Lee, Member of Congress; Abby Finkenauer,       Member of Congress; Mikie Sherrill, Member of Congress; Mike       Levin; Jahana Hayes; Lori Trahan; Katie Hill; Ayanna       Pressley; David Trone; Ed Case; Gill Cisneros; Rashida Tlaib;       Kendra Horn; Angie Craig; Joe Cunningham; Chris Pappas; Andy       Levin; Susan Wild; Sylvia Garcia; Katie Porter; Debbie       Mucarsel-Powell; Ilhan Omar; Madeline Dean; Haley Stevens;       Greg Stanton; Josh Harder; Lucy McBath; Abigail Spanberger;       Chrissy Houlahan; Donna Shalala; Lauren Underwood; Alexandria       Ocasio-Cortez; Veronica Escobar; TJ Cox, Dean Phillips;       Jahana Hayes; and then a few more people who have added their       names in script that I may not be able to read accurately.    In total, there are an estimated 46 signatures on this letter  addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, January 16, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator McConnell: We write as Members of the Freshman       Class of the 116th Congress, an historic group that has the       distinction of being the first Congress to be seated in the       midst of a partial government shutdown.        We as the legislative branch have the power to end this       shutdown now. In December, the Senate unanimously passed       legislation that would have kept the government open. In       January, the House then passed  [[Page S254]]       those same bipartisan bills and sent them to the Senate. If       the Senate were to pass these bills, we would be able to re-      open the government and then proceed to a debate about       immigration reform and border security.        However, it is impossible to have a meaningful policy       discussion while the executive holds public servants hostage.       We respectfully request that you allow the Congress to work       its will and allow a vote on this bipartisan legislation to       end the shutdown so that we can end this manufactured crisis       and allow our devoted federal workers to get back to work for       the American people.            Sincerely,          Susie Lee, Abby Finkenauer, Mikie Sherrill, Mike Levin,             Jahana Hayes, Lori Trahan, Katie Hill, Ed Case, Gil             Cisneros, Rashida Tlaib, Kendra Horn, Angie Craig,             Chris Pappas, Andy Levin, Susan Wild, Sylvia Garcia,             Katie Porter, Ilhan Omar, Madeleine Dean, Josh Harder,             Debra A. Haaland, Lucy McBath, Abigail Spanberger,             Chrissy Houlahan, Donna Shalala, Lauren Underwood,             Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Veronica Escobar, TJ Cox,             Dean Phillips, Elaine G. Luria, Tom Malinowski, Steven             Horsford, Sharice Davids, Joe Neguse, Cynthia Axne.     Mr. President, the freshmen of the House are speaking a  lot of common sense in this letter. They are saying: Here we are,  looking at bills that the Senate passed under Republican leadership and  that the House has passed under Democratic leadership. That is the  foundation for going forward. Let not the Senate leadership be the  obstruction to common sense. Let not this Chamber sit empty, sit quiet,  and sit without votes on these bills to put our government back to  work.   They want to see the Senate have the courage to take positions, to be  here and argue, to say yes or no, but we don't say yes or no if there  is no bill before us, and that must confound these 46 freshmen, who  kind of expected that after more than 200 years of organizing, we would  have a Senate that could actually operate as a legislative body, not  sit here vacant and quiet in the midst of a national catastrophe--a  catastrophe of the Trump shutdown affecting so many families.   There are 800,000 families of Federal workers, hundreds of thousands  more families of contractors, millions of Americans who simply want a  core government service so that they can proceed with their lives--a  business permit, a home mortgage, an agricultural loan, work being done  to prevent forest fires, and a compromise to our national security in  terms of our Coast Guard and our TSA agents. It makes no common sense  for us to sit here without action.   I praise the House freshmen for bringing a fresh, intense,  commonsense view to the conversation on Capitol Hill. Let their words  be heard in this Chamber.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Celine Wolff, have privileges of the floor for the remainder of the  day.    Mr. President, the most important words of our  Constitution are the first three: ``We the People.'' Those three words,  written in big, bold, beautiful script, convey the mission of our  Constitution. We are a nation, as Abraham Lincoln opined, ``of the  people, by the people, and for the people.'' That was the mission.   Our Constitution also lays out how our Founding Fathers intended to  be a nation of, by, and for the people to be governed by coequal  branches, with the branch carrying the weight of policy development  being Congress: the House, and the Senate. The Executive is to have  quite a different role in executing the laws. Judiciary has yet another  role in weighing whether the laws are in accordance with the parameters  of the Constitution--the principles of the Constitution.   So there we are, the branch of government--the Senate and the House-- with the power of the purse, with the responsibility for laying out the  governing vision and rules for our Nation.   Yet, one-quarter of our government goes unfunded for a fourth week.  Why is this Chamber not full of Senators? Why are we not debating  funding bills? Why is there not a bill before the Senate right now? It  is because the rhythm of the floor in this Chamber is guided by the  majority leader. The majority leader refuses to put the bill on the  floor so we can go about our work, putting the government back in  business and ending this shutdown.   The majority leader has refused to have the Senate fulfill its  responsibility and, indeed, has said: `` . . . will not take up any  proposal that does not have a real chance of . . . getting a  Presidential signature.''   In the Constitution, we have the ability to set law without a  Presidential signature. It is certainly not a waste of time to be here  debating proposals for funding the government. In fact, this is a  complete abdication of our responsibility. It is an abdication at a  time when 800,000 American families have a mother or father who is not  getting paid, when many more thousands of contractors are not getting  paid. Millions of Americans are seeking government services and finding  there is no one to answer their phone call or their letter or process  their online application, whether for an FAA mortgage, whether for an  agricultural grant or loan for the next farming season, whether it is  any of a host of hundreds of roles the government plays in facilitating  the commerce and life of this Nation.   President Trump and the Senate majority are holding seven funding  bills hostage. Hostage-taking is not the wisest move. Only one of these  hostages has anything to do with the battle over the border. So why not  release six of these hostages? Why not end the Trump-McConnell shutdown  and release six of the seven hostages and on the seventh do a  continuing resolution so we can continue debating the issues at stake  while putting people back to work. That is a pretty good idea.   Here is the genius of the idea, which is, these are bills that  already have support in the Senate. If we were to look at that support,  we would find it was substantial when these bills came through in a  bipartisan fashion under a Republican-led Senate. You have the  Republican endorsement from here and you have the Democratic  endorsement from the House. That is the making of a path forward.   Yet we need to remind the Members how our Constitution is  constructed. Article I section 7 says in an abbreviated format: ``If he  approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his  Objections.'' Then it goes back to the House and Senate, whichever body  first initiated it. `` . . . and if approved by two-thirds . . . it  shall become a Law.''   Let's recognize that the vision of our Constitution was not for us to  sit on some chair or bench somewhere waiting for someone far down  Pennsylvania Avenue to tell us what to do. That is not fulfilling our  job. The President is supposed to implement the laws we pass--the  vision we adopt--not for us to sit here doing nothing, waiting for the  man in the Oval Office to tell us he has some message from on high on  what we are supposed to do. No, that is not the vision of our  Constitution.   It is disturbing that a responsibility we all signed on to--we took  our oath of office--is being neglected in this Chamber at this moment,  when so many Americans are suffering as a result.   Those funding bills that I was speaking of and that partisan support,  how strong it was--the Agriculture bill, Interior, Financial Services,  General Government, Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development.  Those passed this floor just a few weeks ago on a 92-to-6 vote. How  much more bipartisan does it get?   The State and Foreign Operations bill passed out of the Republican- led Appropriations Committee 31 to 0. The Commerce, Justice, and  Science spending bill passed 30 to 1 in our spending committee.  Homeland Security passed out 26 to 5.   So these have a powerful imprint of overwhelming bipartisan support  in this Chamber, and yet we sit here afraid to take action and lay out  the vision we have a responsibility to lay out.   I hope every Member will say back home that they invite the feedback  of their constituents; that they will hold townhalls because then they  will hear what I hear, which is that is an absurdity. It is an  irresponsibility. It is a failure of leadership. It is a neglect of  duty, and that is not what this Chamber should be about. It is not a  proud moment to have such dysfunction in the heart of the Senate.   I am reminded of the historical reference: ``While Nero fiddles, Rome  burns.'' It is a reference to the year A.D. 64, when Rome burned to the  ground. The historian Suetonius records that Nero was responsible for  the fire, and he watched it from a tower while playing an instrument  and singing about the destruction of a different place--the destruction  of Troy.   Here we sit today with our leadership's fiddling while our Nation  suffers, while our leadership watches from afar from the tower, playing  some fiddle for its amusement, instead of taking action here on the  floor of the Senate.   While the Republican Senate leadership fiddles, our farmers aren't  getting the funds or assistance they need to get through the winter to  prepare for the next season because the Department of Agriculture is  closed for business.   While the Republican leadership of this Chamber fiddles, firefighters  whom we ask to risk their lives in fighting massive infernos in our  Nation's forests are missing out on critical training and preparation  time for the next fire season. In addition, the work being done to thin  the forests, to make the forests more fire resistant, is suspended. The  work getting the fuel off the forest floors to make them more fire  resistant is suspended. The prescription burns being done to make the  forests more fire resistant are canceled. Yet this is the time they  have to happen. While the leadership fiddles, it is setting the stage  for more savage forest fires to wreak havoc on the Western States in  the United States in the summer to come.   While the Republican leadership of this Chamber fiddles, 100,000 low- income tenants are at risk because there is no staffer in place at  Housing and Urban Development to renew the 1,100 affordable housing  contracts that expired last month.   While the leadership fiddles, small, rural economies, like that of  Lakeview, OR, are stuck in limbo and are unable to move forward on  critical projects. According to the South Central Oregon Economic  Development District's director, they are working at trying to give a  loan to a small business in Lakeview, but they need EPA staff approval  to be able to use the grant funding for an environmental assessment  before they can borrow funds to buy a building. So they are up the  creek while the Republican leadership fiddles.   The real victims in this misguided standoff are the hundreds of  thousands of Federal workers who aren't being paid and the contractors  who might never be paid. Let's listen to them. What do they have to say  about this? Are they writing and saying: ``Love this dysfunction in the  Senate. Love  [[Page S281]]  the failure of leadership. Love the incompetence. Love the fact that  nobody is working here to solve the problem''?   No, that is not what they are saying.   Erin, a furloughed Forest Service employee of Sandy, OR, writes that  both she and her husband are Forest Service employees who have been  furloughed in the Mt. Hood National Forest, and they are terrified  about their personal finances.   Erin writes:         I have two boys that I will still have to continue to pay       daycare for so I do not lose their spot. That's $1,400 a       month alone.    She went on to write:         We have to be smart on how we balance our finances because       the cost of living is going up, but our salaries have not       been increased besides a minor cost-of-living adjustment last       year. So I am very worried what a long shutdown means for my       family and my coworkers.    Erin and her husband have every right to be worried about what is in  the future for her family. They are suffering the effects of this  shutdown through no fault of their own.   Steven, of southeast Portland, writes:         I am writing as a constituent, residing in southeast       Portland, and as a furloughed Federal employee. I do not in       any way support President Trump's efforts to build a wall       along our southern border. The proposed wall is unneeded. It       would be a wantonly wasteful use of taxpayer money. It would       be environmentally destructive, and it would further the       inhumane disregard of the rights of those seeking asylum.    Steven is a Federal worker who is not being paid, and he doesn't  support this shutdown.   Julie, the wife of a firefighter in Redmond, OR, wrote last week that  her husband ``isn't able to work because of the government shutdown.''  In just over a week, they are supposed to hire all of their seasonal  firefighters for the summer. If they can't work, the hiring will get  delayed or not happen, which will put communities at serious risk this  summer from wilderness fires. This risk for this coming summer is very  real in our State of Oregon.   Julie writes:         In no way is it OK to let the government shut down. . . .       Don't participate in holding our own country hostage.    Dr. Genevieve Grady, of Sheridan, OR, wrote:         I am a licensed clinical psychologist who is working at the       Federal Bureau of Prisons in Sheridan, OR. I am also a single       mom with two children under the age of 5. As an essential       Federal employee, I am required to continue to work without       being paid. As a licensed psychologist, I could cultivate       outside work with Agency permission to supplement my income.       However, I am unable to do this due to having to continue       working full time. Given that I am a single mother of two       small children, I must provide care for my children during       all other hours of the day. In order to maintain a roof over       my and my children's heads, I have had to contact my Federal       student loan company to seek relief. Unfortunately, they       cannot alter my student loan status any earlier than February       6. My daycare provider, who watched my children so that I may       continue going to work without pay, is an in-home provider       with three teenaged children of her own. I cannot ask her to       go without pay as she too needs to continue keeping her       family financially stable.    She writes:         There are very few expenses in my life that can go without       money: food, daycare, gas to get to work, car insurance to       drive legally, a phone required for my job to contact me in       an emergency, medical expenses. Both of my kids have been       sick during this furlough and have had to see the doctor to       get medication. After 26 days without pay, these bills       continue to require cash to pay, and I continue to wonder       how much longer I should keep coming to work or when I       should look for another job.    Linnea from Roseburg, OR, writes:         The unrepentant hostage holding of people's wages is cruel       and shows just how removed the Trump administration is from       the American people. I live in a single-income household in       which the only breadwinner is a government employee, my       mother. This means that we went through the holidays not       knowing when the next paycheck was going to come. We still       don't know.    Britt, a furloughed IRS worker who was proud of his government  service and called it his small way of participating in our democracy,  writes:         My savings is small and will not last through an extended       shutdown. I have already applied for unemployment insurance       compensation, but that process takes several weeks before I       actually receive any money. I have never had to file for       unemployment before, and it's quite unsettling that I am       forced to resort to government aid.    Like so many other Oregonians in a State that is 20-percent National  Forest, Brien, of Pendleton, OR, writes:         As a United States Forest Service employee, I am waiting       for relocation reimbursement on a current move. I used most       of my savings to move duty stations 2 months ago, and with       the current furlough, I cannot afford to miss a pay period       even if I will get it in the end. I am currently paying       interest on my move that was to be covered by the Forest       Service. If the furlough lasts longer than January 13, it       will be extremely difficult to avoid late payment charges on       utilities, mortgage, and other bills. Don't hold me and my       middle-class family hostage to rich men's antics.    That is exactly what is happening with a President who is so far  removed from the reality of ordinary people, with a President who  worked with the leadership of this body in the Senate to approve a  series of spending bills that we passed by a vast bipartisan majority  but who then changed his mind and withdrew his support after they were  passed. The President switched his position after the bills went  through the Senate. The President bragged about owning this shutdown.  He didn't have 1 second of worry about the plight of an ordinary  American who was struggling to pay his bills.   From his ivory tower, his skyscraper in Florida, and his club--and,  oh, he is still happy with his golf courses--he has no idea of the pain  this is inflicting on people. If someone explains it to him, he doesn't  care. That says a lot about the failure of leadership. As this writer  said, ``Don't hold me and my middle-class family hostage to rich men's  antics.''   Air traffic controllers are essential to the safety of our air  traffic across this country. I received a stack of handwritten letters  last week--old-fashioned, ink on paper, all kinds of paper, all colors  of pens. They were handwritten by Oregon air traffic controllers who  have been absolutely incensed with what is going on. Being an air  traffic controller is an unbelievably tough job. Air traffic  controllers are responsible for thousands of lives at any given moment.  They have to be on their game 100 percent of the time. It can't be 99.5  or a plane is going to crash on you that day. These folks are working  without pay. It is inflicting stress and anxiety on people who should  have their absolute, full attention solely on the job of making sure no  plane hits another.   James Ferguson, of Forest Grove, writes:         If the shutdown lasts any longer, I will lose my health       insurance and will no longer be able to pay for my 1-year-old       son's physical therapy, potentially adding additional months       to correct his spine and neck muscle problems.    This is another example of the pain. Here is a parent who feels the  medical affliction of his child is going to be accentuated by the  actions of the Republican leadership in the Senate and President Trump  in the Oval Office. James isn't complaining that he needs to go  shopping for new clothes or that he wants to check out a new car. He is  worried about getting medical care for his infant child. He is worried  about his infant child's recovery and of his improvement being stalled  or damaged by this callous, inhumane shutdown.   Trevor Stokes, of Hillsboro, OR, and his wife are veterans of the  U.S. Navy. They certainly are no strangers to sacrificing for their  country.   In fact, in his letter, Trevor writes:         Over the past few weeks, during the shutdown, I have worked       both Christmas and New Year's as well as their eves. I was       not able to spend time with my family, which is a necessary       sacrifice.    Then he writes:         Now our financial future is uncertain due to a potentially       long unpaid period. I've had to withdraw from mutual funds       just to cover monthly financial obligations. My family and       the families of my air traffic colleagues have suffered from       the sudden loss of income. Please end the shutdown.    We ask so much of these people. We ask long hours and missed holidays  in the name of protecting us as travelers. Shouldn't we also be looking  out for them in their time of need?   Why don't we reopen the Department of Transportation and make sure  our air traffic controllers start getting paid? All of these  individuals are saying: Do your job. Do your job. Do your job. Senate  leadership, do your job.   Put the bills that have passed the Senate already back on the floor  so that we can send them to the Oval Office. Let us do our job.   This Trump-McConnell shutdown, this inaction of the Senate,  abdicating  [[Page S282]]  its responsibility--isn't that exactly parallel to Nero fiddling while  Rome burned? That fire here in America is touching the lives of so  many. There are 800,000 workers without pay. Thousands more are  contractors. Millions of Americans are caught in limbo in the midst of  an important transaction--applying for an agricultural loan, trying to  get a mortgage, signing up for help from the Small Business  Administration to launch their business, getting their paperwork  processed in one of 1,000 different ways, and here, the leadership  fiddles while the American public suffers. It is wrong.   It may not be comfortable to have a debate on the spending bills. It  may not be comfortable to vote on these bills. It may not be sweet to  support or oppose a particular amendment, but do you know what is  worse? What is worse is doing nothing.   That is what this Chamber is doing right now. It is doing nothing,  despite our responsibility to millions of Americans to act. Let's  change that. Let's change it now.   I understand that the majority is going on a retreat. Instead of  going on a retreat to play the fiddle, how about you be here on the  floor and put these bills on the floor? Let's get all 100 Senators on  the floor to actually talk to each other, to actually wrestle with the  issues, to actually make our arguments, and to actually take the votes  instead of going off somewhere to party. That is just wrong.   I encourage the majority leader to read the letter that was sent to  him today from the freshmen from the House of Representatives down the  hall. The freshmen haven't been here long enough to become cynical.  They haven't become trapped in the partisan boundaries and warfare that  seem to ensnare so much of this Chamber and the Chamber across the way.  No, they are here, fresh from other occupations and other  responsibilities, still full of common sense and the passion to do what  is right for the American people. So let's listen to them.   Today they sent a letter to Majority Leader McConnell, which I read  on the floor earlier today, and they said: Put the bills on the floor,  put the spending bills on the floor--the bills that have already passed  here in the Republican-led Senate or that passed overwhelmingly by the  Republican-led Appropriations Committee, endorsed by the Democratic  House. Put them on the floor and act.   Let's listen to the freshmen down the hall. They are reminding us  that we have a responsibility to act, and let's do so immediately.   Thank you.                            ____________________
