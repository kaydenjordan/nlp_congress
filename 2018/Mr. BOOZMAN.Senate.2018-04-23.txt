 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize 32  Arkansans who have taken an interest in playing a positive, productive  role in their communities, the State of Arkansas, and our country.   In September, this group of high school students convened as part of  my  [[Page S2340]]  inaugural Congressional Youth Cabinet, a nonpartisan initiative that  has allowed these young people firsthand experience engaging in the  democratic process. Students from each of Arkansas' four congressional  districts participated in the program, which provided them with  exposure to the legislative process and opportunities to seek out  advocacy and civic engagement.   The goal of the Congressional Youth Cabinet is to foster a lifetime  commitment to civic engagement and public service. I have been  impressed with these young Arkansans as they have grown in their  knowledge of how our government works and the role that public policy  plays in their everyday lives.   One project in particular that demonstrates this process involved  having the participants, grouped together by their congressional  districts, develop a legislative proposal of their choice between three  issues: driverless cars, an internet sales tax, or rural broadband. The  students worked together to craft their proposals on these topics,  drawing on their own research and background knowledge.   I was able to help them refine their ideas and offer my advice as to  how they could make adjustments to their product so as to have the best  chance of garnering bipartisan support. We also discussed why similar  legislation had not successfully attracted enough backing to pass  Congress and become law.   This program has given these students the chance to think critically  and carefully about how public policy can have an impact on them, their  families, friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens. I am proud of these  Arkansans for taking a proactive step to learn more about how they can  make a difference and be a force for good. Their participation in the  Congressional Youth Cabinet is something we all can take great pride  in.   I congratulate them on their hard work and efforts and offer my best  wishes for the future. I know these students will continue to be  leaders and doers who give back to their communities. I hope their  participation in the Congressional Youth Cabinet is something they can  point to as having made a distinct and significant contribution to  their development as students and informed, engaged citizens.                            ____________________
