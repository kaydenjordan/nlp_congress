 Madam President, I continue reading the letter from the  Birmingham jail by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:         I had hoped the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps       I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose       I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race       can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of       the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see       that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and       determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our       white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this       social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are       still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality.       Some--such as Ralph McGill, Lillian  [[Page S3003]]       Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and       Sarah Patton Boyle--have written about our struggle in       eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us       down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in       filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and       brutality of policemen who view them as ``dirty       niggerlovers.'' Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and       sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and       sensed the need for powerful ``action'' antidotes to combat       the disease of segregation. Let me take note of my other       major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed       with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there       are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact       that each of you has taken some significant stands on this       issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian       stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your       worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the       Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill       College several years ago.        But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly       reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do       not say this as one of those negative critics who can always       find something wrong with the church. I say this as a       minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was       nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its       spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as       the cord of life shall lengthen.        When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the       bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt       we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the       white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be       among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright       opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and       misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been       more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind       the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows. In spite       of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope       that the white religious leadership of this community would       see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern,       would serve as the channel through which our just grievances       could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you       would understand. But again I have been disappointed.        I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish       their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision       because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white       ministers declare: ``Follow this decree because integration       is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.'' In       the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I       have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth       pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the       midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and       economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: ``Those       are social issues, with which the gospel has no real       concern.'' And I have watched many churches commit themselves       to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange,       un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the       sacred and the secular.        I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama,       Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering       summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the       South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing       heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her       massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have       found myself asking: ``What kind of people worship here? Who       is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of       Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and       nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a       clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices       of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided       to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright       hills of creative protest?''        Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep       disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But       be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There       can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep       love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do otherwise? I       am in the rather unique position of being the son, the       grandson and the great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see       the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have       blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and       through fear of being nonconformists.        There was a time when the church was very powerful--in the       time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed       worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the       church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas       and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that       transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early       Christians entered a town, the people in power became       disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians       for being ``disturbers of the peace'' and ``outside       agitators.'' But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction       that they were ``a colony of heaven,'' called to obey God       rather than man. Small in number, they were big in       commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be       ``astronomically intimidated.'' By their effort and example       they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and       gladiatorial contests. Things are different now. So often the       contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an       uncertain sound. So often it is an arch defender of the       status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the       church, the power structure of the average community is       consoled by the church's silent--and often even vocal--      sanction of things as they are.        But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before.       If today's church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit       of the early church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit       the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant       social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every       day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church       has turned into outright disgust.        Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized       religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our       nation and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the       inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the       true ekklesia and the hope of the world. But again I am       thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of       organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing       chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the       struggle for freedom. They have left their secure       congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with       us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous       rides for freedom.    I yield the floor.
