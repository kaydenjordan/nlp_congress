 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, history warns us that nations which either cannot or  will not secure their borders simply aren't around very long. And if we  will not enforce our immigration laws, our borders mean nothing.  America ceases to become a unique nation and simply becomes a vast  international territory between Canada and Mexico.   Now, I understand agriculture's need for labor, especially in so  tight a labor market as our blossoming Trump economy has created. Years  ago, the Bracero program provided a means for seasonal laborers to come  to America, be protected under our laws, and provided with a powerful  incentive to return in the form of a significant financial deposit when  the season ended, but that program can only work when our immigration  laws are being uniformly enforced.   Instead, this bill ignores enforcement and rewards anyone who has  illegally crossed our borders, both with amnesty and a special path to  citizenship, as long as they claim to have worked part-time in the  agriculture sector for the last 2 years.                                time  1500    It then rewards them with a pathway to citizenship, allowing them to  cut in line in front of every legal immigrant who has obeyed our laws,  waited patiently in line, and done everything our country has asked.   As a practical matter, we can expect claimants will have very little  or even no scrutiny to the veracity of their claims. We can expect  that, once achieving amnesty, they will then leave the fields for  higher-paid employment in direct competition with American workers. And  we can expect a new wave of illegal immigrants coming here to take  their places with the full expectation that they too will ultimately be  rewarded with amnesty and citizenship.   There is a much better way to resolve this issue. Secure our borders,  uniformly enforce our immigration laws, and provide foreign seasonal  labor with the opportunity to work and the incentive to return to their  countries when that work is done. And if they wish to become American  citizens, we ask that they follow the law, as millions of legal  immigrants have done throughout our history.
