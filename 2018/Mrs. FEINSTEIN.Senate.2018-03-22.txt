 Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Women's  History Month to reflect on the remarkable contributions women have  made to the United States and the challenges we must still face today  to ensure women are able to realize their full potential as equal  partners in American society.   For over 30 years, we have set aside this month to pay tribute to the  amazing women who have fought tirelessly for themselves, their  families, and all Americans.   I look back on their courage with great admiration and continue to be  inspired by those who blazed the trail for women like me. When I first  came to Washington in 1992, they called it the ``Year of the Woman,''  with four women being elected to the Senate. Today, we have a record 22  women serving in the United States Senate and 89 women serving in the  House of Representatives.   Even at record levels, women only account for about 20 percent of the  115th Congress, which falls far short of the 51 percent of our nation's  population that are women.   Still, women have proven themselves as true political forces and I  have great hope for the next generations of women who will also lead  the way in building a better California and United States.   Women have been and continue to step up as leaders in the forefront  of social change efforts, business, science, government, math, art,  literature, music, film, athletics, and more.   Today, half of our workforce is made up of women and more than 10  million American businesses are women owned.   Where women were once turned away from attending medical and law  schools, enrollment numbers are now almost evenly split between men and  women.   Women have risen to the top of Fortune 500 companies and fill the  domes of capitols and the halls of universities.   Women now also have a larger role in the U.S. Armed Forces, with more  than 200,000 active-duty servicewomen proudly serving and 2 million  veterans representing every branch of service.  [[Page S1955]]    My utmost respect goes out to these women warriors who selflessly  answered the call to duty and served with honor, courage, and  distinction.   As a United States Senator proudly representing California, I have  seen first-hand some of the millions of outstanding women who achieve  greatness.   As we celebrate the stories of American women who defied all odds to  accomplish the unprecedented, we must also honor their legacies by  continuing to defend the rights they worked so hard to achieve.   We have fought together on so many issues that affect women,  families, and all Americans. During this month, I invite all women to  pledge to continue this fight together and never relent on these  important issues.   Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.                            ____________________
