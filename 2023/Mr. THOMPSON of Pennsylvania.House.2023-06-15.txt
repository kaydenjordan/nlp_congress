 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  dedication and determination of the Pennsylvania Grange as they  celebrate 150 years of service.   Their story began in 1871 with the organization of the Eagle Grange  No. 1 near Williamsport in Lycoming County. It eventually became  statewide in 1873. The PA Grange was founded with the intent to heal a  wounded Nation following the Civil War.   Today, the PA Grange has members of all ages and represents more than  5,440 Pennsylvanians.   The PA Grange is honoring their 150 years with 150 acts of service.  Each chapter is tasked with completing a service project, and as of  Wednesday, June 13, they have completed 194 projects.   It is with full confidence I stand here honored to represent a State  with people dedicated to helping members grow as individuals, unifying  their communities, and fostering opportunities through legislation and  community service.   Mr. Speaker, every year I have the privilege of attending the Grange  Fair in Centre County, my home county. While attending the fair, I am  able to witness their mission firsthand. The  [[Page H2950]]  mission of this organization continues to withstand the test of time.   I congratulate the Pennsylvania Grange on 150 years of service,  education, legislation, and fellowship.                            ____________________
