 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an event  that many Americans look forward to every 4 years: The Winter Olympics.   In a few days, millions around the world will tune in to watch their  country compete in the 24th Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, China. The  spirit of the Olympics is one of sportsmanship, friendship,  competition, and national pride for viewers and athletes around the  world.   Unfortunately, several years ago the International Olympic Committee  selected a host country that is one of the last Communist nations in  the world, enslaves workers in sweatshops, forces sterilization upon  minority women, punishes those who speak out against the dictatorship,  imprisons and murders ethnic minorities, and lied to the world about a  global pandemic that has killed millions and changed our lives forever.   Almost every freedom that Americans take for granted is nonexistent  under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The government has  created countless human rights abuses against its people, including the  genocide of the Uyghur Muslim population. To this day, they have  blocked the rest of the world from learning more about the origins of  COVID-19, something that is important for our national security and our  public health.   Meanwhile, the majority has thrown away months of bipartisan work and  has decided to push another partisan bill that will not pass the Senate  or become law in its current form. Included in the so-called America  COMPETES Act are several provisions that have nothing to do with China.  This bill gives billions to the United Nations Green Climate Fund. It  mentions the word ``coral'' more than the word ``China.'' This bill  gives no sanctions, punishment, or funding for an investigation into  the Chinese Communist Party's cover-up of the origins of COVID-19.   And hidden on page 1519, this legislation also allows the President  to use emergency powers until the President declares the COVID-19  national emergency is over, or September of 2025; coincidentally, after  the next Presidential election. The vast majority of the American  people believe that COVID is unfortunately going to be with us for a  long time and desire transparent information so that we can learn to  live with it and treat it rather than living in perpetual fear. The  national emergency should end no later than this year, and Congress  should work in a bipartisan way to end unending emergency powers. We  should also act to hold China accountable for lying to the world about  a global pandemic and for the human rights atrocities they have  committed.   The Chinese Government is known to arbitrarily arrest and hold  Americans against their will to blackmail our government. The  government has a long track record of spying on Americans, placing  microphones and cameras wherever they can. They have no concept of  privacy and will gladly find a way to collect DNA samples and as much  information as possible on our world-class athletes. I believe the  overwhelming majority of the Chinese people are just like us, but the  actions of their government have given us no reason to trust them.   Going forward, I do not believe that a country with a human rights  track record like that of the People's Republic of China should be  given the honor of hosting the Olympic Games.   I pray for the safety, health, and success of American athletes,  coaches, and support staff during their time abroad and wish them all  the best of luck. I know they will make all of us back home proud.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the fine  gentleman from Louisiana, for organizing this Special Order on such an  important topic.   It is no secret that our country has been ravaged by the opioid  epidemic for years. Families and communities across the country have  been destroyed by opioid abuse and addiction and, unfortunately, Iowans  are no exception.   I, and other healthcare providers, correctly predicted in the spring  of 2020 that our actions by locking down, social isolation, and  shuttering jobs, would lead to increased drug use, drug addiction, and  drug overdoses.   The Iowa Department of Public Health recently estimated that fentanyl  deaths rose from 31 percent of all overdoses in 2016 to 87 percent in  2021. The CDC reported that from April 2020 to April 2021, more than  100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, and that nearly 64,000 were  related to fentanyl. This is up from 2,000 overdose deaths in 2011.   These numbers are shocking and saddening, and truly underscore the  impact the opioid epidemic has had on this country. U.S. Customs and  Border Protection seized over twice as much fentanyl in fiscal year  2021 than in fiscal year 2020, and nearly four times as much fentanyl,  compared to 2019.   Madam Speaker, 11,201 pounds of fentanyl were seized in fiscal year  2021 alone, enough to kill 2.5 billion people, or the entire U.S.  population over seven times.   While it is great we are apprehending so many drugs before they reach  our communities, and Border Patrol is doing amazing work, we know so  much more is coming across our borders undetected and impacting our  communities.   I have visited the border twice and have spoken to law enforcement  about what we can do to help them. The administration needs to address  the border crisis as it is and take it seriously.   I have been proud to see this Congress work in a bipartisan manner to  pass commonsense and simple bills, like my DUMP Opioids Act, to help  curb this epidemic. But we can all agree that there is more work to be  done.   I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to help make this  country safer for the American people.
