 Mr. President, no one should normalize what is happening  on this Senate floor right now. We are all waiting for the white smoke  to come out of Republican leadership offices so that the millions and  millions of very scared people in my State will be able to see what is  about to happen to their lives.   This isn't a game. People's lives are at stake. People's health is at  stake. Yet, because this debate is now devoid of policy and substance  and seemingly just about delivering a political victory to Republicans,  we wait and we wait and we wait.   People are scared. All over the Capitol today there are parents of  children with disabilities, many of whom rely on Medicaid in order to  keep their children alive. I have spent a lot of time with them over  the course of the last 6 months because, to them, the measure of a  civilization is how it treats the most vulnerable, and their kids, with  these deep disabilities, are among the most vulnerable. For much of the  last 6 months I have seen anger in their eyes--anger that Congress  would choose to hurt their kids or to force their family to go  bankrupt.   Yesterday, I saw something new in their eyes. I saw fear. I saw deep,  debilitating fear because they sense that we are on the precipice of  doing something that they didn't think was possible--a piece of  legislation passing the Senate and the House that would deliberately  and intentionally hurt their children.   There is no way around it. It is not hyperbole. The House bill that  we are debating right now guts Medicaid to the point where 15 million  people--the most vulnerable Americans--would lose access to healthcare.   I know it is very hard for people in this Chamber to understand  because we all have really good healthcare. But when you have an  expensive disease or your child has an expensive disease and you lose  insurance, you can't pay for it. You can sell your house, you can sell  your car, and you can exhaust your savings. For some families, that  will cover 6 months' worth of expenses for their sick child. At some  point, the patient dies if they don't have access to healthcare.   So people are scared. They are really scared. They are scared not  just at the consequences of the House bill eventually passing, but they  are also scared at the casualness with which this debate seems to treat  their plight.   There are rumors now that, at the end of this process, we are going  to vote on what has been described as a stripped-down, gutted version  of the original Republican healthcare bill. It might have one or two  provisions in it--maybe the elimination of the individual mandate,  maybe the elimination of a few taxes. The intent would be to  essentially punt the more comprehensive debate about what our  healthcare system is going to look like to a conference committee.   I want to talk about that for a few moments and what the consequences  of that are. First, I want to talk about what the consequences are, if  that end result is achieved, for the Senate. Why do my colleagues  choose to run for the Senate if they are prepared to surrender the  biggest policy decision they will likely face to the House of  Representatives? Why go through all the trouble of running, of raising  all the money, of getting all the votes to become a Senator if you  aren't prepared to actually render an opinion and pass a bill on the  biggest priority issue facing this country right now--the future of the  American healthcare system?   Republicans have been unable to come up with a bill that can get 50  votes. Why? Because they refuse to engage with Democrats. Now the  solution  [[Page S4234]]  is to punt by passing a stripped-down version of the bill, handing all  power to the House of Representatives, surrendering to the House of  Representatives. What is the point of being a U.S. Senator if you  aren't actually going to make policy, if you are just going to hand  over the keys of policymaking to the House of Representatives? This is  the U.S. Senate.   I disagreed with Senator McCain's vote yesterday, but I heard the  speech he gave to us that this should be the place in which we make the  big, tough decisions about the future of the American economy. The  Senate will put an ``out of business'' sign on the outside of this  Chamber if we pass a scaled-down version of this bill that admits we  can't come to a conclusion.   What is the point of being a Senator if you just hand this debate  over to the House of Representatives? By the way, that is what will  happen. If the Senate goes to conference with the House of  Representatives and there is only one bill in that conference--and that  is what will happen if a stripped-down version of this bill goes into  conference and the House has a comprehensive reform bill--the House  bill will be the only one in the conference committee, and the House  bill will become law. The House bill will survive. It may have some  small cosmetic amendments to it, but all of the power will be given to  the House of Representatives in those negotiations because there is  only one idea that will be present.   Let's go back for a moment and remember what was in that House bill  that so many of my Republican colleagues told me was deeply  objectionable to them and would never get a vote on the Senate floor.  Twenty-three million people will lose insurance. Rates will go up by 15  to 20 percent. People with preexisting conditions in most States likely  will lose all protections available to them. Insurance plans will not  have to cover maternity care, mental illness, or addiction any longer.  Medicaid will be gone as we know it. My small State, with an $8 billion  Medicaid Program, will have a $3 billion cut. Children will lose their  ability to stay alive because they lose their healthcare insurance.  Seniors in nursing homes will be put out on the street. That is not  hyperbole. That is real. That is what happens when you kick 23 million  people off of insurance.   That bill or some version of it would emerge from the conference  committee because the Senate would have defaulted to it by going to  conference with nothing. But that is just the long-term consequence.  The short-term consequence is that this scaled-down bill reportedly  will include an elimination of the individual mandate. Insurance  markets will fall apart.   Everybody here knows, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat,  that the only way you guarantee that people get priced the same if they  are sick or not sick is to require people to buy insurance when they  are not sick. In fact, the Republicans know that because in their bill  that they wrote behind closed doors, they included an individual  mandate. They did. It was designed in a different way. They said that  if you don't buy insurance, you will be penalized by being locked out  of the insurance market for 6 months. But they had a penalty for people  who don't buy insurance, just like the Affordable Care Act has a  penalty. Republicans and Democrats understand that in order for the  insurance markets to work as they are regulated today, you need to  encourage people to buy insurance when they are healthy and penalize  them if they don't. The Republican bill does that, just like the  Affordable Care Act does that.   If you pass a bill that removes that mandate, then every insurance  adjuster, every actuary who works for a major healthcare insurance  company, will tell you that the markets will crater because individuals  won't buy insurance until they get sick, knowing that they can't be  charged any more. Healthy people will not buy insurance. Rates will go  up. Insurers will flee the markets. The entire thing collapses.   That is the short-term consequence of telegraphing to the insurance  companies that you are getting rid of the individual mandate. Even if  that is not the final result, that telegraph signal, at a point where  insurers are already rethinking the markets because of the sabotage  campaign that President Trump has undertaken, would be catastrophic.   This is not a game. These stakes are big. The casualness with which  people are approaching this debate is scaring the life out of people in  my State, out of parents of kids with disabilities and folks who are  dealing with sickness and illness all across this country.   It is not too late. We don't have a communicable disease. We aren't  going to physically harm Republicans if they come talk to us. It is  time to abandon this Republican-only approach and come work with  Democrats. Let's jointly own the problems that still exist in the  healthcare system and jointly own the solution. People are scared of  what is happening in the Senate today, and there is a different way.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
