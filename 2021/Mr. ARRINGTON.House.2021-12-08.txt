 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate my friend, Mayor Anthony Williams, on 20 years of  excellence in public service to the Key City, Abilene, Texas.   Mayor Williams has grown up, received his education, and raised his  family in the Key City community his entire life. Anthony has dedicated  his life to public service and has had a tremendous impact on the  community that he dearly loves.   Mayor Williams' record reflects that he believes that a thriving  community stems from a free and responsible citizenry, strong faith and  families, and a growing economy.   A big country, west Texas thank you, Mr. Speaker, to his wife,  Lynette, and their four children for their sacrifice for giving him the  leeway to spend time in the community and make Abilene a better place  to live for all of us.   I thank Mayor Williams for being a great friend, brother in Christ,  and partner in our public service venture for liberty and prosperity  for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Anthony. God bless him and his family.  And go West Texas.                            ____________________
