 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  Pastor Kevin McKee, who opened with the prayer this morning in this  Chamber.   Kevin and his wife, Mary, have been amazing pillars in our community  as we have been through extraordinary challenges associated with  Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, and Isaac; a thousand-year flood  last year; the worst oil spill in the Nation's history; the incredible  shootings of five of our police officers last year; and racial  divisiveness.   Kevin and Mary have been incredible at propping up our community and  sharing the Word in eastern Europe, China, and around the United  States. I want to thank both of them for their incredible service to  our State, our Nation, and our community as we have been through these  times of challenge.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, when folks think of innovation  and new technology, Louisiana often comes to mind.   We have been able to pioneer cell phone technology and have been  involved in genetics and DNA. We have incredible naval technologies,  with offshore oil and gas at depths never before even contemplated. We  have been able to power this Nation's economy.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery  of and measurement of gravitational waves, Louisiana is recognized once  again.   I want to give a shout-out to LIGO and Livingston Parish for their  amazing discovery in 2015 and for being recognized with the Nobel Prize  in Physics                            ____________________
