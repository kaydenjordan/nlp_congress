 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Alpha Fire Company in State College and the Logan Fire Company in  Bellefonte as well as their volunteers who collected community  donations for the YMCA of Centre County's Anti-Hunger Program.   Mr. Speaker, these volunteers collected community donations of shelf- stable food totaling more than 24,000 pounds during a 4-hour ``Canuary  Food Drive'' on Saturday at four Centre County Weis Markets locations.   Neighbors helping neighbors strengthens our community. As we continue  to see rising food costs and record inflation, more and more families  are turning to local food banks for food assistance.   The idea of ``Canuary'' started at the Port Matilda Elementary School  but quickly became a large-scale community effort as volunteers from  all over the area started offering to help.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who served for decades as a volunteer  firefighter, I am happy to see the support they continue to provide to  the community.    The ``Canuary'' Food Drive will aid in the effort and continues  through the remainder of the month, with many churches, businesses,  schools, offices, and student groups participating.   Congratulations on a successful weekend food drive.                            ____________________
