 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 12 years ago this Tuesday, Russian tax  lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in Moscow at the hands of prison guards  who, instead of treating him for the acute illness that his torturous,  yearlong detention provoked, beat him for over an hour. He was found  dead in his cell shortly thereafter. His ``crime'' was exposing the  largest tax fraud in Russian history, perpetrated by government  officials. He was 37 years old and left a loving family and many  friends.   At the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, we had heard of Sergei's  plight months earlier, and we were saddened and outraged that such a  promising life had been cut short and that so few expected his  murderers to be held to any account.   Impunity for the murder of journalists, activists, opposition  politicians, and now simply an honest citizen was and remains a  depressing cliche in Russia under Vladimir Putin's rule, while his  regime often ruthlessly punishes people for minor infractions of the  law. For those on the wrong side of the Kremlin, the message is clear  and chilling. Even the most damning evidence will not suffice to  convict the guilty, nor will the most exculpatory evidence spare the  innocent.   The need for justice in Russia in this specific case has not  diminished with the passage of time. Moreover, the doubling down on the  coverup of Sergei's murder and the massive tax heist he exposed  implicates a wider swath of Russian officials with the guilt of this  heinous crime. It does not need to be this way, nor is it ever too late  for a reckoning in this case in the very courtrooms that hosted the  show trials that ultimately led to Sergei's death.   As sober as this occasion is, there is reason for hope. Vladimir  Putin will not rule Russia forever, and every passing day brings us  closer to that moment when someone new will occupy his post. Who that  person will be and whether this transition will usher in a Government  in Russia that respects the rights of its citizens and abides by its  international commitments remain unclear. I hope it does. A Russian  Government that returns to the fold of responsible, constructive  European powers would increase global security, enhance the prosperity  of its own citizens and trading partners, and bring new vigor to  tackling complex international challenges such as climate change.   Sergei's work lives on in his many colleagues and friends who are  gathering in London this week to celebrate his life and to recognize  others like him who seek justice and peace in their countries, often  facing and surmounting seemingly impossible obstacles. All too often,  they pay a heavy price for their courageous integrity.   Sergei's heroic legacy is exemplified in the global movement for  justice sparked by his death and in the raft of Magnitsky laws that  began in this Chamber and have now spread to over a dozen countries,  including allies like Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European  Union. Even as these laws help protect our countries from the  corrupting taint of blood money and deny abusers the privilege of  traveling to our shores, they also remind those who suffer human rights  abuses at the hands of their own governments that we have not forgotten  them.   Sergei Magnitsky is a reminder to all of us that one person can make  a difference. In choosing the truth over lies and sacrifice over  comfort, Sergei made a difference that will never be forgotten.   Fifty-five years ago, Senator Robert F. Kennedy addressed the  National Union of South African Students and spoke about human liberty.  He spoke about freedom of speech and the right to ``affirm one's  membership and allegiance to the body politic--to society.'' He also  spoke about the commensurate  [[Page S8430]]  freedom to be heard, ``to share in the decisions of government which  shape men's lives.'' He stated that government ``must be limited in its  power to act against its people so there may be no . . . arbitrary  imposition of pains or penalties on an ordinary citizen by officials  high or low.''   Senator Kennedy went on to say:         Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve       the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends       forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a       million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples       build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of       oppression and resistance.    Sergei Magnitsky stood up for an ideal. He acted to improve the lot  of others. He struck at injustice. He was and remains a ripple of hope.   On this sad anniversary of Sergei Magnitsky's murder, let us all  recommit ourselves to helping those in Russia and around the world who  seek their rightful share in the governance of their own countries and  who deserve the confidence of doing so without fear of harm. If we do  this, Sergei will not have died in vain.   I am confident that one day there will be a monument in stone and  bronze to Sergei in his native Russia. Until that day, the law that  bears his name will serve as his memorial.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
