 Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  The total amount of appropriations made available       by title II of this Act is hereby reduced by $1,869,087,000.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Norman) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today to seek support for amendment 77 to H.R.  3354, the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, which  is supported by the Taxpayers Protection Alliance and key voted by the  National Taxpayers Union, Club for Growth, Heritage Action for America,  and FreedomWorks.   Mick Mulvaney, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,  has been guided by the idea that every dollar spent by the Federal  Government must be scrutinized. I took this principle to heart as I  examined the President's budget request, which stated: ``Everyone  believes in and supports safe food supplies and clean air and water.  But the agencies of the Federal Government have gone way beyond what  was intended by the Congress.''   Madam Chair, while traveling around my district this August, I heard  the same sentiment put more plainly: ``Washington is off the rails.''   As our national debt grows in excess of $20 trillion, each of my 15  grandchildren is being saddled with a $61,000 share of the debt. Now,  Madam Chair, my 16th grandchild is on the way. I would really like to  start tackling Washington's spending problems now before grandchild 16  joins us in early December.   I am encouraged by the leadership of President Trump's administration  with its budget request, but I strongly believe Congress must do its  part to stop this debt from crushing our Nation. That is why I have  submitted an amendment that would reduce EPA appropriations by $1.869  billion to the administration's requested level of $5.655 billion.   In his testimony to the House Appropriations Subcommittee, EPA  Administrator Scott Pruitt emphasized the need for the EPA to get back  to the basics of statutory authority of ensuring access to clean water,  clean air, and land.   Madam Chair, the amount of overreach and wasteful spending the EPA is  responsible for is endless. Allow me to share with you a few recent  examples.   For overreach: first, look to Sackett v. EPA, where the EPA imposed  $75,000 cost per day on a couple for placing gravel on dry land to  build a home within the existing subdivision.   And then there is Andy Johnson, the Wyoming rancher who was facing  $20 million in fines for his stock pond, which the EPA alleged violated  the Clean Water Act. This is despite the fact that stock ponds were  exempt from Federal law, and that he had obtained the necessary  permits. It took Mr. Johnson 5 months in court to reach a winning  settlement which freed him from any obligation to pay the EPA.   The waters of the United States rule, which I am happy to see this  administration working to roll back, embodied the overreach perfectly,  as the Obama EPA pushed the limits of its power under the Clean Water  Act to even regulate some ponds and manmade ditches.   Now, for wasteful spending: there is an Environmental Justice  Program, a program that is supposed to support business development in  disadvantaged communities, which funded an effort to increase knowledge  of environmentally-friendly nail salon practices in California nail  salons.                                time  1145    The estimated price tag was $73 million over the course of 2016-2025.   There was an EPA environmental education program which funded  ``educational projects'' that have included learning how to build rain  gardens, the significance of urban forests, poster contests on sun  protection, asthma awareness and radon and schoolyard habitat  restoration.   There was even $300,000 in grant money going to fund the Chesapeake  Bay Journal, an environmental newspaper in Maryland.   Madam Chair, these are just a handful of recent instances of the  EPA's bureaucratic waste at the expense of the American taxpayer.   The Presidential budget request for the EPA provides the roadmap for  trimming the Agency back to focus on its core mission. Funding for the  Agency is focused on infrastructure, elimination of duplicative  programs and programs that extend past the EPA's statutory authority,  and ensuring that funds are not lost to bureaucratic waste.   Madam Chair, Congress has an incredible opportunity to practice what  we preach in tackling an out-of-control Federal Government.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South  Carolina will be postponed.   The Chair understands that amendment Nos. 78 and 80 will not be  offered.
