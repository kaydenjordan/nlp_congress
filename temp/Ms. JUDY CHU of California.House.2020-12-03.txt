 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of my bill, H.R. 7903, which would authorize the Community  Advantage Loan Program for 5 years. To help our struggling economy, we  need a bipartisan bill that gets money to those who need it.   This bill, which I am proud to have introduced with my colleague,  Congressman Ross Spano, does just that by providing statutory  authorization to the Community Advantage program, already a proven and  successful pilot program.   Thanks to Community Advantage, underserved small businesses, which  typically have the hardest time accessing loans, can gain access to  affordable financing and technical assistance from mission-based,  primarily nonprofit lenders through SBA's 7(a) loan guarantee. That  means more money in more communities to keep our businesses operating.  This is something we need now more than ever.   The Community Advantage program was first established almost 10 years  ago as a pilot at the Small Business Administration with the goal of  delivering capital to the hard-to-reach businesses that need under  $250,000 in financing to grow. Since 2011, the program has facilitated  over $850 million in loans averaging $140,000 each. Compare that to the  average 7(a) loan of $530,000, and it is clear Community Advantage is  meeting a small business need that is unfilled by the traditional 7(a)  program.   It has also made a big impact in my district, where businesses have  received nearly $10 million in Community Advantage loans. That includes  businesses like Unincorporated Coffee Roasters in Altadena, California,  which received a Community Advantage loan last summer. This business  had been in operation for under 2 years, but their Community Advantage  loan allowed them to expand into the space next door and open a second  company to roast their own coffee beans for the wholesale market.                                time  1515    They have even added jobs and continued to grow during the pandemic.  That is what can happen when we make small business loans just a little  less difficult to access. And it is an experience shared by businesses  across the country.   Last year, I chaired a hearing in the Subcommittee on Investigations,  Oversight and Regulations to examine the Community Advantage program.  We heard from borrowers and lenders about the ways that Community  Advantage has closed the credit gap for underserved businesses.   Because of their focus on economic and community development, the  mission-based lenders that facilitate Community Advantage loans can  leverage their strong relationships within the community to provide  accessibility, guidance, and assistance to the businesses that too  often find themselves on the margins without the ability to access  capital from traditional banks. As a result, Community Advantage is  able to reach far more businesses owned by people of color, women, and  veterans than traditional 7(a) loans.   This is a proven model, and we can see further evidence in the  response to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the Paycheck Protection  Program, or PPP, first launched at the start of April, traditional  lenders prioritized their largest and longstanding clients, making it  difficult for underserved businesses to even submit an application for  assistance.   To address this problem, Congress established a set-aside lending  authority for community financial institutions like certified  development companies, microloan intermediaries, and community  development financial institutions, many of which are already certified  Community Advantage lenders. The result was a success, as these  nontraditional lenders were able to reach the underserved businesses  and, together, deliver over 141,000 PPP loans totaling more than $8.5  billion.   Now it is time to build on that success. This legislation before us  today includes measures, with bipartisan agreement, to make the program  even stronger. It will expand the definition of ``underserved  businesses'' to explicitly include those owned by people of color and  those located in declared disaster areas, and it will increase the  percentage of loans that lenders must make in underserved markets from  60 to 75 percent of their portfolios. It will also allow SBA to make  loans up to $350,000 on a case-by-case basis.   With these improvements and the long-term certainty afforded by  statutory authorization, this bill will make the Community Advantage  program an even more powerful tool for closing the credit gap and  delivering affordable capital to more small businesses.   With a long and arduous economic recovery before us, this bill will  help countless small businesses rebuild, and it will help them to start  anew as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Spano for his partnership and  Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Chabot for their strong  support. I also thank the Community Advantage lenders and borrowers  whose success and testimony over the years have powerfully made the  case for Congress to pass this legislation to authorize the program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7903.
