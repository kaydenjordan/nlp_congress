 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Warren  and Jane Allen of Spofford, NH. The couple served our country with  distinction during World War II, and the life they built together is  emblematic of the many who came home from war, raised a family, and  helped to build the America we know today.   Warren, or ``Bill'' as he is known to close friends, was born on  March 14, 1923, in Calhoun, GA. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps in  1942. When asked years later why he decided to enlist, he replied that  he saw a movie about the Marines and liked the look of their dress  blues. His service brought him across the country, from boot camp at  Parris Island in South Carolina to ``tower school'' in Fort Worth, TX,  and eventually to a posting at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in  Havelock, NC. An air traffic controller, Bill remembers having to stand  on orange crates to direct aircraft traffic at MCAS Cherry Point. The  control tower had not been built yet.   Jane Post was born on April 26, 1923, in Spofford, NH. She enlisted  in the recently formed U.S. Marine Corps Women Reserves in June of  1943. She trained at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and attended  control tower school in Atlanta, GA. Following her training, she  arrived at MCAS Cherry Point and was assigned to the air station's  clearance center. It was her responsibility to keep track of all  arriving and departing aircraft at the station. It was at Cherry Point  that Jane's path crossed Bill's in 1943.   By November of that year, Bill had risen to a supervisor position at  air station. One day, a plane carrying a U.S. Marine Corps general was  descending and given clearance to land. Suddenly, a fighter pilot  radioed that his plane was losing air pressure and requested permission  for an emergency landing. The control tower instructed the fighter  pilot to circle the air station and allow the general's plane to land  first. Upon hearing this, Bill sprinted up the stairs of the control  tower and demanded to know who gave those instructions. It was Jane  Post.   Though he disagreed with her judgement on which plane should have  landed first that day, Bill struck up a relationship with that control  tower operator. They were married 5 months later on April 20, 1944, and  have been inseparable ever since.   Bill continued to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps until 1946. He  reenlisted in 1947 and kept his rank of technical sergeant. In 1952, he  was honorably discharged from the Reserves. Jane served in the Women  Reserves until January 12, 1945. She was honorably discharged upon the  news that she and Bill were expecting their first child.   The Allens eventually settled in Spofford, NH, a small community in  the western part of the State. Bill went on to work at a number of  local banks after a short stint as the owner of the local Tuttle's  Store. He retired as president of the Savings Bank of Walpole in 1993.  As their children grew up, Jane returned to school and obtained a  bachelor's degree in home economics from nearby Keene State College.   They also applied the leadership qualities that they refined in the  Marine Corps to a variety of community endeavors. Bill served as town  moderator and a longtime member of the local budget committee. He was  also a captain at the Spofford Volunteer Fire Department. Jane worked  to establish the Chesterfield Historical Society and was a driving  force in raising funds for a new library in town. Bill and Jane were  both fixtures at Keene State College basketball games, Bill as an  official scorekeeper and Jane as a dedicated fan.   Last year, they celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary among  family and the many friends they have made in their journey from Cherry  Point to the Granite State.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in thanking Bill and Jane Allen for their service  in World War II and the many contributions they have made to their  community in the years since. We wish them all the best in the years  ahead.                            ____________________
