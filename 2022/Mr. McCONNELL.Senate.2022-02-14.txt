 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    About 2 weeks ago, I spoke on this floor about the  [[Page S655]]  state of the pandemic 2 years in, about letting American families get  back to normal. The current science clearly supports the 70 percent of  Americans who believe we must accept this virus is here to stay, trust  the science, and proceed with normal life.   At the time, this was not a universal sentiment. The next day, across  the river, liberals tried to shame Virginia's new Governor for forgoing  a mask in an incredibly vaccinated area where cases had been falling  for weeks.   The top Democrat in the Virginia State Senate criticized the Governor  and backed ongoing school mask mandates as ``common sense.'' But, my  goodness, how quickly things can change.   A few days ago, I understand the same State senate leader did a 180- degree turn and voted for an amendment to end school mask mandates. A  dam had begun to break nationwide. A week ago, leaders in Democrat-run  New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, and Oregon announced they would ax  or relax their mask and/or vaccine mandates in the near future. By the  end of the week, States, including California, Illinois, Nevada, New  York, and Rhode Island had followed suit to varying degrees.   Now, obviously, the scientific facts have not changed in the last few  weeks. We have known for many weeks that this variant is significantly  milder, and we have known for many months that the universally  available vaccines reduce the odds of hospitalization or death down to  the level of many routine risks that we all face constantly in our  daily lives. The only science that has changed in the last 2 weeks is  the political science. The only data that has changed in the last 2  weeks is the Democrats' polling data.   The Washington Post put it like this: The ``abrupt end to mask  mandates reflects a shifting political landscape.''   Ah, but there is a problem.   While Democratic leaders are stampeding to finally follow the science  and end burdensome mandates on adults in many places, America's  children are still being left behind. States like New York and  California are rolling back restrictions on adults but have yet to  provide any end date or off-ramp for mask mandates in K-12 schools.  This is completely backward since we have known for well over a year  that COVID poses far lower risks to children than to adults.   Officials in Illinois and the District of Columbia have embraced the  same double standard, winding back general public mandates while  leaving the schools with no end date in sight. In other words, here in  Washington, the Mayor's office will be lifting mandates next week in  all kinds of adult establishments, from bars to fitness studios, while  keeping kids in classrooms, masked up for at least--at least--another  month.   Even as Democrats permit grownups to get back to normal, they are  clinging onto their emergency powers over K-12 classrooms. The  ultrarich, ultrapowerful teachers unions that have been antagonists of  normal childhoods at each step of the pandemic are continuing to drag  their heels.   For 2 years now, Democrats at the local, State, and Federal levels  have let a labor executive named Randi Weingarten become something of  an unelected national classroom czar, holding millions of kids' fates  in her hand. Science has proven over and over again that in-person  schooling is safe for kids, but Big Labor has sought to move the  goalposts every time, and Democrats have mostly gone along with it.   Last year, Ms. Weingarten bragged publicly that the Biden  administration had invited her own hyperpolitical teachers union to  basically author the scientific guidelines for school reopenings. The  Biden administration took the pen away from doctors and experts and  handed it to Big Labor. She boasted:         They asked us for language and we gave them language.    Reporters found multiple instances where the union's words were  copied and pasted directly--directly--into the final CDC document.   Now the same Ms. Weingarten is trying to move the goalposts again on  America's kids to an even more extreme and unscientific place. She  asserted last week that little kids should have to keep covering their  faces in schools until there is ``no dissemination and transmission in  schools.''   With respect, that is completely bonkers, absolutely bonkers. There  is no credible scientist or doctor in America who believes that we are  headed toward zero COVID. We are not going to magically eradicate this  virus; it is heading endemic. So Ms. Weingarten's latest made-up  standard would have K-12 kids covering their faces literally forever.  Little kids in masks forever? That is the upshot of this top Biden  administration's ally's public demands. This is utter madness.   Two years ago, the American people accepted temporary disruptions to  their daily lives in order to prevent our hospitals from collapsing and  to buy scientists time to invent vaccines and therapeutics. Check,  check, and check. Our healthcare system endured. We have remarkable,  safe, and effective vaccines; we have therapeutics; and we know that,  thank God, none of these variants have posed a medical emergency for  the vast majority of children--period.   Americans who watched the Super Bowl saw rich celebrities having a  grand time with hardly a mask in sight, but under the Democrats'  policies, first graders who watched that big, maskless party last night  had to wake up this morning and cover their own faces in order to go to  school. America's classrooms seem to be the last places where local,  State, and Federal Democrats will accept that cost-benefit calculations  exist, and zero transmission is simply not possible.    For 2 years now, the Democratic Party has allowed some of the most  powerful special interests in our country to profoundly--profoundly-- disrupt children's lives. The political left has put kids last. That is  simply not acceptable. American families deserve normalcy; they deserve  it right now; and this side of the aisle, the party of parents, has  their back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
