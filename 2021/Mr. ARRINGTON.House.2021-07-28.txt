 Mr. Speaker, to comment on my Democrat colleague's  comments that they are just trying to build America back better, nobody  in the United States of America in their right mind believes that what  is happening in this country--the disastrous economic policies, the  spike in crime in the neighborhoods from sea to shining sea, the chaos  that burns out of control at the border--believes that you are trying  to make America better.   I associate myself with the comments of Representative Roy from the  Lone Star State. It is absurd for us to be mandating and restricting  the American people when we have hundreds of thousands of people  pouring into this country, and in the last 2 weeks we had a 900 percent  increase in COVID-positive people illegally crossing our sovereign  border into the United States.   We can't take anybody seriously, not the President, and with all due  respect, not our colleagues who think they are trying to make our  country better, stronger, and safer. That is just absurd. It is  ridiculous.   I can hardly get through my comments about the appropriations on  account of some of this rhetoric that is empty. It is absolutely hollow  in the ears of those who hear it who live on the border and who are  experiencing the devastating effects; not the least of which are the  poor, vulnerable people who are coming over here and paying a high  price by the cartels who we, because of the policies of this  administration, are enriching and empowering every day.   I rise in strong opposition and great concern as a result of the  proposed massive and irresponsible spending bills that reflect, Mr.  Speaker, the  [[Page H4104]]  Democrats' insatiable desire to expand the Federal Government beyond  recognition, beyond the recognition not only of our Founders, but of  our citizens here today, and to, once again, jam through their partisan  priorities.   These spending levels are beyond fiscally unsustainable. They are  going to push us to the brink of bankruptcy, into a place where we can  see the sovereign debt crisis from the precipice upon which we stand.  We won't be able to print money or borrow to bail out of that crisis,  Mr. Speaker.   American families have worked hard. They have made sacrifices,  tightening up their belts. And by the way, dealing with the every-man  tax of inflation while our Democrat colleagues continue to push these  massive spending bills. It is completely irresponsible.   It is unbelievable that my Democrat colleagues would ask the American  people for a 21 percent pay raise, $100 billion. The White House wants  a 40 percent pay raise for the crimes fight, for the chaos at the  border, for the inflation, for the fact that their policies have locked  people into unemployment, and the policies they are proposing will trap  them in poverty for the rest of their lives, and generations to follow.    Mr. Speaker, aside from the insulting disregard for  our national debt for our children and grandchildren, this is the  greatest threat. It is not the existential threats. It is our  insatiable appetite to expand the government, government's power, and  the costs associated.   If these bills, these supposed funding bills are enacted, here are  the policies that will follow:   Abortion providers will be funded and abortion, and the abortion  manufacturers that abort, terminate unborn children at a rate of almost  1,000 a day.   Allow illegal immigrants to receive our tax dollar financial aid and  Federal employment. What a disrespect to the law-abiding American  citizens.   Choke out our ag and energy producers with extreme environmental  policies, disrupt the supply chain, undermine our ag and energy  independence.   The list is too long, Mr. Speaker.   Give contraceptives to students without parental knowledge.   Fund sex changes at the VA.   These are the priorities, these are the values reflected in the  budget of my colleagues?   Mr. Speaker, this is a radical reimagination of government's role in  the life of its citizens and a drastic departure from America's values  and interests, and I oppose it. I pray to God I can get a Democrat to  oppose it. I doubt it.                            ____________________
