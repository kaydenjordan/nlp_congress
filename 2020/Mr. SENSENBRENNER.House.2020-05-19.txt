 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Wisconsin, the Honorable Thomas P. Tiffany, be permitted  to take the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Madam Speaker, one of the few things that deans do  around here, aside from using our institutional memory, is to ask  unanimous consent that people who are elected in special elections from  their State be permitted to take the oath of office.   Today it is my great honor and, indeed, a privilege, to ask that Tom  Tiffany be able to take the oath of office, and to join the list of  fewer than 11,000 people that have been honored by their constituents  to serve in this House.   Tom spent a lot of his life being a successful small businessman. He  was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 2008, and 2 years later was  elected to the first of two terms in the Wisconsin Senate. He has been  a very strong and vocal proponent of the interests of people in  northern and western Wisconsin, and he will continue to do so on the  national stage.   Madam Speaker, it is now my honor to yield to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).
