 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the Comprehensive  Opioid Recovery Centers Act, a bipartisan bill that will establish  treatment centers that offer a full range of treatment for people  suffering from opioid use disorder.   Over the past several months, I have been holding public events in  each of the 21 counties in my district. In every county I continue to  hear about the awful effects of our Nation's opioid crisis. Each story  is a little different, but they are all heart-wrenching due to the  deadly effects of opioid use disorder and addiction.   Right now, most patients are going to the center that is most  convenient to them, but those centers might offer only one type of  treatment. What if that treatment doesn't work for that person?   That is why I introduced the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers  Act, so that people can show up at one facility and have full  wraparound treatment services and succeed in beating addiction.   I want to especially thank my friends, Congressman Gene Green,  Congressman Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, and Larry Bucshon of Indiana  for introducing this bill with me. This is a bipartisan bill. It will  make a difference in people's lives, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
