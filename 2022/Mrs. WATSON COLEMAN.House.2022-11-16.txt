 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of  the unsung civic heroes of our time.   Last month, I attended a dedication ceremony of Laura Wooten Hall at  Princeton University. Wooten Hall houses Princeton's Center for Human  Values, and it is only fitting that it was named for a woman who  devoted her life to something greater than herself.   For nearly 80 years, Laura Wooten served as a poll worker, ensuring  that the people of New Jersey could exercise their sacred right to  vote. Her service earned her the honor of being the longest  continuously serving poll worker in United States history.   Despite living from the Jim Crow era through present-day attacks on  voting rights, Laura Wooten's dedication to our democracy never  wavered. May her life of selfless civil service be an inspiration to  all of us.                            ____________________
