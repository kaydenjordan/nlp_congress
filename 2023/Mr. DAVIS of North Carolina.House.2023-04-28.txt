 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the  Haliwa-Saponi Tribe. The Tribe has over 4,000 members living in the  First Congressional District of North Carolina.   The Tribe, led by their fearless Chief Richardson, welcomed people  near and far as they celebrated 58 years of State recognition.   Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of attending the Haliwa-Saponi Pow-Wow  in Hollister, one of the largest pow-wows in the State. The Pow-Wow,  the first in 3 years because of COVID, celebrates a rich history and  strong cultural heritage filled with traditions passed down from  generation to generation.   Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to announce that I will soon introduce  legislation calling for their Federal recognition.                            ____________________
