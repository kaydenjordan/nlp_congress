 Mr. Speaker, I rise to explain why there is a  government shutdown.   There is a government shutdown because the self-proclaimed great  dealmaker breaks more deals than he makes. Just ask the Americans who  are going to pay for the wall he said Mexico would pay for. Just ask  the Senators who took him the deal that he asked for.   Mr. Speaker, when you break more deals than you make, you are not a  great dealmaker; you are a great deal breaker. We have a great deal  breaker in the White House. That is why we have a shutdown.
