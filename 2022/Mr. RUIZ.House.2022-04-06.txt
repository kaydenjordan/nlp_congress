 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of an  inspiring leader, a great visionary, and my friend, Dr. Tom Rivera.   Dr. Tom was born on September 22, 1939, in Colton, California. After  graduating from Colton High School, he attended San Bernardino Valley  College; California State University, Los Angeles; the University of  California, Riverside; and eventually UCLA, where he earned his  doctorate in education.   It was at Cal State LA that he met the love of his life, Dr. Lily  Rivera, who shared his passion for service. Together, they served in  the Peace Corps in Colombia, South America, before marrying in 1965.   In all that he did, Dr. Tom strived to inspire his students to  achieve their dreams. As associate dean for undergraduate studies at  CSU San Bernardino, he was a pillar of the community. He devoted  himself to the empowerment of local youth and maintained leadership  roles in organizations including the Kiwanis Club of Greater San  Bernardino, LULAC, the Pure Land Foundation, and more.   Dr. Tom was relentless in his advocacy. Even in the face of his own  health challenges, he continued his pursuit of a better future where  Hispanic youth could achieve their dreams.   In 1984, just 3 years after contracting a virus that left him  paralyzed, he helped found the Inland Empire Future Leaders Program,  joining forces with fellow educators, Susan Castro, Frank Acosta, Henry  Vasquez, and Bill Allison.   Dr. Tom founded the organization to address dropout rates among  Hispanic students. His vision was to encourage youth to be proud of  their roots and to make a difference in their communities.   All these years later, that vision is fulfilled in the Inland Empire  Future Leaders Program's tremendous success. It is fulfilled in the  educators, lawyers, doctors, and countless other Inland Empire Future  Leaders Program graduates who have gone on to achieve so many great  things.   It is fulfilled right here in the Halls of Congress with the  gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar), my good friend, as Democratic  Caucus vice chair, and with me as chair of the Congressional Hispanic  Caucus.   I stand here because of Dr. Tom. Back in the early years, in 1986, I  attended one of IEFLP's leadership trainings at Camp Seeley. That  summer left a lasting mark on me and changed the course of my future.   I learned the tools of leadership and returned home, motivated to  serve the community. I became the first in Coachella Valley High School  to be class president and ASB president all 4 years, and I learned to  identify problems that needed to be addressed and to become a part of  the solution.   The experience strengthened my dream and my resolve to become a  doctor and serve the community. You see, Dr. Tom's guidance fueled in  me a passion for social justice, a passion I lived as a pre-med student  organizer at UCLA.   It is with Dr. Tom's encouragement that I applied to Harvard Medical  School to earn my medical degree and graduate with my master's in  public health and my master's in public policy from Harvard University.   I am forever indebted to Dr. Tom for his unyielding devotion to my  growth and the success of my peers. He was always there for us. He was  always there to motivate us, to celebrate us, and to give us a smile  when we needed it most.   He gave us a family, a familia, in which we found reassurance and  strength. All IEFLP graduates share a common bond because of him. To  this day, when I meet a fellow Inland Empire Future Leaders Program  graduate, we reminisce about his kindness and grace.    We said good-bye to Dr. Tom just last month, in March 2022. However,  we know that his legacy will live on in each and every one of us. We  know that his memory will survive in the hearts of his beloved wife,  Dr. Lily; his brother, Ray; his children, Evelyn, Patricia, and Tom;  and all of his wonderful grandchildren.   Together, we mourn his passing and celebrate his full life, knowing  that he was a good man and an extraordinary public servant whose impact  will be felt for generations to come.                            ____________________
