 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to defeat the previous question so the House can immediately  bring up meaningful disaster relief.   I want to thank my friends and colleagues from across the aisle,  Representative Woodall, obviously, Chairman McGovern, Ranking Member  Cole, and others on the Rules Committee, for allowing me to speak last  night on behalf of the amendment. I also want to thank them for their  help in previously passing very similar legislation.   My amendment is quite simple. The text contained the same dollar-for- dollar amounts from H.R. 268, the House-passed disaster assistance  bill.   This bill was a work of compromise and work that many of us  representing districts that have been hit by disasters in 2018 worked  on. It includes a bipartisan amendment that I and many others  sponsored, which raised the crop and livestock loss assistance to $3  billion, from approximately $1 billion. That is included in the final  text.   Unfortunately, my amendment was not made in order; but, if we defeat  the previous question, it will be included in an amendment, along with  other important provisions, to help those affected by the natural  disasters of 2018.   Disaster relief has never been a partisan issue in the United States  of America, and it should not be a partisan issue today. I urge my  colleagues and I ask every Member in this body to defeat the previous  question so that we can immediately bring up legislation to deliver on  our promise of passing disaster assistance prior to leaving for the  Easter break.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I want to thank my  colleague, Mr. Dunn, for leading this effort. I know his district was  hit probably harder than any other district in the United States.   Madam Speaker, I rise today alongside many of my fellow colleagues to  again stress the hardships many of our fellow Americans faced following  these devastating natural disasters of 2018.   On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael entered my home State of  Georgia as a Category 3 storm. With it, we saw widespread damage from  dangerous winds, flooding, and torrential rains. Hurricane Michael  traced a path of destruction through south and middle Georgia,  straddling both mine and Congressman Sanford Bishop's districts.   Our districts are largely rural areas that have also been hit hard by  tornadoes and flooding in recent years. These areas are key to the  State's agriculture sector, which is Georgia's number one industry.   Madam Speaker, the American farmer is the backbone of agriculture,  and agriculture is Georgia's number one industry.   Fearing the worst of this storm, many farmers began harvesting what  they could as Hurricane Michael crept closer and closer to Georgia. It  was the best yield we had seen in years for what was gathered before  the storm hit. After years of low commodity prices, unfair trade  practices, labor shortages, and consecutive years of devastating  storms, we needed it. Once Hurricane Michael hit, it was all gone. Not  only did we lose billions of dollars in commodity crops, like cotton  and peanuts, but we also lost orchards and forests that will take  decades to regrow.   Since the day after the storm, I have worked side by side with my  friend and colleague, Congressman Bishop, in an effort to bring our  communities impacted by Hurricane Michael tools they need to recover  and rebuild. At every turn, we have worked together to bring attention  to the crisis and to bring relief to these farmers alongside our other  colleagues who have been impacted.   The President and Vice President personally came down and promised  help. I was there. For months, we have stressed the magnitude of the  damage to our colleagues, and for months we were promised this was a  priority for the White House and congressional leadership from both  sides of the aisle.   ``Any bill to fund the Government has disaster relief.'' I don't know  how many times I have heard it. I can't name all the people I have  heard it from. As we stand here today 6 months later, these can only be  called empty promises.   Never before have we seen American communities that were wrecked with  catastrophes neglected like this. To this day, OMB has not even  submitted a request for disaster assistance, calls to White House staff  have gone unheeded, and but for one tweet on April 1, it seems the  President has moved on.   For months I have received calls from farmers and the lenders they  rely on that the financial impacts from Hurricane Michael were becoming  increasingly more difficult to bear. Then last week, the Senate showed  how truly ugly and partisan politics have become, voting down a measure  that would have brought billions in Federal relief that communities in  my home State of Georgia and around the country desperately need to get  back on their feet again, money to restore infrastructure and restore  services, as well as farm aid.   Certainly, no one would have stood in the way of disaster relief for  States like Vermont or New York. Rural Americans, we have been  forgotten. We were forgotten again last week in the Senate's failure to  pass disaster assistance.   Rural Americans are Americans, too, whether the press likes it or  not, and whether certain Members of the Senate like it or not. They  need our help to rebuild. If the Senate cannot pass a bill to provide  this Federal disaster assistance, the bottom line is farm bankruptcies  will continue, and I fear that the community banks and businesses that  support the farm sector will too.   The truth is if Hurricane Michael had hit Americans who aren't  farmers or farmers who aren't Americans, the stories of Washington's  apathy to get things done would be the front page of every paper.  [[Page H3188]]    Mr. Speaker, the American farmers work day in and day out to feed and  clothe America and the world. I urge the White House and the Congress  to reverse their course of abandoning our farmers and keep the promises  that were made to them.
