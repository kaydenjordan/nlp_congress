 Mr. President, this afternoon we voted on cloture  to proceed to a budget resolution written by my Republican colleague  Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky.   This is a budget that would lead to devastating cuts to Medicare,  Medicaid, nutrition assistance, and education, while paving the way for  even more tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large, profitable  corporations.   Make no mistake about it: Senator Paul's budget is an immoral budget.  It is bad economic policy. While I am confident that this resolution  will be defeated in the Senate, let me be very clear.   Nearly half of the Republican Caucus in the Senate voted to advance  Senator Paul's budget, including some of the most senior members of  this body. The vision of America this budget puts forward--balancing  the budget on the backs of working families, the elderly, the sick, the  children, and the poor in order to make the richest people in America  even richer--is the vision of the Republican Party as a whole.   So let me commend Senator Paul for being honest with the American  people in terms of what he believes and for putting down on paper what  the Republican Party and billionaire campaign contributors like the  Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson believe.  [[Page S3155]]    And this is what they want.   At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, Senator Paul and  the Republicans who voted to advance this budget do not believe that it  was good enough to provide nearly $2 trillion in tax breaks to the  wealthiest people and most profitable corporations. The budget that we  are debating would extend those tax breaks for the wealthy and the  powerful.   Two years ago, the Congressional Republicans came very close to  passing a bill that would have thrown 32 million Americans off of  health insurance. Senator Paul and those who voted to advance this  budget believe that earlier effort did not go far enough. The budget we  are debating would throw up to 40 million Americans off of Medicaid.   A few months ago, President Trump proposed a budget calling for  Medicare to be cut by nearly $845 billion. Senator Paul and the  Republicans who support this budget do not believe those cuts went far  enough. The budget we are debating would cut Medicare by up to $3.4  trillion over the next decade.   At a time when 40 million Americans struggle with hunger, Senator  Paul and the Republicans who vote for this budget want to cut the SNAP  program by $223 billion, cutting 16 million people off of the program  by 2029.   Overall, Senator Paul's resolution calls for slashing the budget by  more than 51 percent by the end of the decade.   Not too long ago, if someone proposed cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and  nutrition assistance in half so that billionaires could get a huge tax  break, that would have been considered a radical and extreme agenda.  Today, it is the mainstream position of the Republican Party in  Washington.   The reality is that Republicans in Washington have never believed in  Medicare, Medicaid, Federal assistance in education, or providing any  direct government assistance to those in need. They have always  believed that tax breaks for the wealthy and the powerful would somehow  miraculously trickle down to every American, despite all history and  evidence to the contrary.   Needless to say, and I am only speaking for myself, I have a very  different vision of America.   In my view, we need to create a government and an economy that works  for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.   What does that mean?   It means that, instead of giving trillions of dollars in tax breaks  to the top 1 percent and large profitable corporations, we must demand  that Wall Street, the billionaire class, and large, profitable  corporations start paying their fair share in taxes.   Instead of trying to abolish the estate tax, which impacts less than  one-tenth of 1 percent, we must substantially increase the inheritance  tax not only to bring in needed revenue, but to dismantle the oligarchs  that now control so much of our economic and political lives.   Instead of making it easier for corporations to avoid paying U.S.  taxes by stashing their cash in the Cayman Islands, we need to crack  down on offshore tax haven abuse and use this revenue to create 15  million good paying American jobs rebuilding our crumbling  infrastructure.   Instead of cutting Social Security, we need to expand Social Security  so that every American can retire with the dignity and the respect they  deserve, and we pay for that by making sure everyone who makes over  $250,000 a year pays the same percentage of their income into Social  Security as the middle class.   Instead of cutting Medicare, we need to guarantee healthcare as a  right to every man, woman, and child in America through a Medicare for  all, single-payer healthcare program.   Instead of slashing Federal aid to education, we must make every  public college and university in America tuition free, and we pay for  that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation. If we could bail out  Wall Street 10 years ago, we can tax Wall Street so that every American  who has the desire and the ability can get a higher education  regardless of their income.   Instead of listening to the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and other  multibillionaire campaign contributors, it is time to start listening  to the overwhelming majority of Americans who want a government and an  economy that works for the many, not just the few.   Let us not only defeat the Paul budget, but let us have the guts to  take on the greed of Wall Street, the greed of the pharmaceutical and  health care industry, the greed of big oil, and the greed of corporate  America and break up the oligarchy that is destroying the social fabric  of our society.                            ____________________
