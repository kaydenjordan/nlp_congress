 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Before I begin the remarks that brought me here  today, I want to say a word about Richard Trumka, a hero to all of us  who care about working people and a good friend to many of us.   I am proud to call him a friend and proud to have been with him as an  ally in causes and principles that are so important to the present of  America and the future of America. I am proud to have been with him on  picket line and platform, to have stood with him and behind him in  supporting the rights of working men and women to decent pay, fair  treatment, and safety on the job.   He came from America, and he never forgot where he came from. His  life is  [[Page S5909]]  a lesson to so many of us who seek to emulate his devotion to the  public interest.   As a leader of the labor movement, his life also reminds us that  unions count; that collective bargaining means something; that the  rights of working men and women succeed because they come together in  unions, and we ought to respect those unions and listen to them and  champion their right to represent fairly and freely and to organize men  and women on their jobs.   So we will miss Richard Trumka, but his legacy is going to be an  inspiration to all of us--certainly to me--in fighting even harder for  the great convictions, sense of conscience, the wonderful heart and  spirit that embraced people who disagreed with him. A life's lesson for  all of us.   (The remarks of Mr. Blumenthal pertaining to the introduction of S.  2654 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.''    Mr. President, today, I was very proud to introduce  with my colleague Senator Menendez, who is leading this effort, and  Senator Cornyn, Senator Grassley the September 11 Transparency Act.   Members of this body have heard me talk about this issue before. It  has been a repeated issue for me but for this body as well.   We passed JASTA because we wanted the 9/11 families to have access to  the courts and have their fair day in court. We passed the resolution  in 2018 to require that the government declassify, to the maximum  extent possible, all of the information surrounding 9/11. JASTA was  passed over President Obama's veto. His veto was overridden on a  bipartisan basis. The resolution demanding more declassification was  passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and signed by the  President.   The letters that we have written, the questions that I posed in  hearings, the press conferences held, the constant effort to provide  documents and information to those families so they can have their fair  day in court has been a continuing and constant one and, so far,  completely unavailable.   Administration after administration--Obama, Trump, and hopefully not  but apparently Biden--have resisted these calls for declassifying and  disclosure.   That information is evidence that those families need to seek justice  in their effort to hold accountable the Government of Saudi Arabia for  its alleged complicity, its aiding and abetting, its support for the 9/ 11 attack. They want to hold them liable in an American court, which  JASTA enables them to do. They want to pinpoint responsibility and  liability so that we will know, as Americans, whether the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia was, in fact, complicit and supportive of those attackers.   The truth they seek is not just for themselves; it is for the  American people, and the concealment by successive administrations  denies the American people the truth they deserve and need.   Today, I was proud to stand with Senator Menendez and some of those  families led by Terry Strada and Brett Eagleson in front of this  Capitol as we announced our introduction of the act, the September 11  Transparency Act, that would very simply require the Director of  National Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Director of the  CIA to conduct declassification reviews of certain investigative  documents in their 9/11 file. It is a baby step toward full disclosure  and truthtelling.   But I was so proud to stand with these families, represented by Terry  Strada, among others, when she said:         Yes, we know the Kingdom played a major role in supporting,       and financing al Qaeda and evidence demonstrates that Saudi       agents who the Kingdom sent here aided and abetted some if       not all the 19 hijackers leading into the attack.        It is an indisputable fact the hijackers were living in our       country 12-18 months prior to 9/11 planning and plotting the       murder of thousands and that the FBI and the CIA knew of at       least two of them, Nawaf Al-Hamzi and Khalid Al-Midhar.    She further said:         By keeping evidence hidden that will shed light on the       brutal murder of our loved ones, our own government is not       only perpetuating our continued pain and suffering, but it is       also leaving the facilitators of the attacks unaccountable       and our nation vulnerable to terrorist attacks.    Her remarks were so powerful, I hope that every one of my colleagues  will read them.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the remarks from Terry Strada  be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         September 11th will mark the 20th anniversary of the murder       of my husband Tom and nearly 3,000 people; all brutally slain       on orders given by the known Saudi terrorist, Usama bin Laden       and his 19 mostly Saudi Islamist al Qaeda terrorists when       they infiltrated our country and carried out the deadliest       terrorist attack in our nation's history.        For reasons I do not know and cannot fathom, a select group       of FBI and CIA operatives knew some of the 19 hijackers were       known terrorists traveling freely on American soil using       their real names. How much of their planning and plotting       were they privy to--I do not know, but clearly, the agencies       did absolutely nothing to stop them and failed at the most       important job they had; they failed to protect America and       her populace.        Along with the entire world, I watched in horror our       country under a violent attack. I witnessed on live       television the toxic black smoke billowing from the north       tower. I spoke with my husband and heard first-hand the fear       and panic he and my dear friends were experiencing in the       hell-fire they were engulfed in. I watched the North Tower       collapse, knowing the father of my three children and my       husband's life was being extinguished right before my eyes.        Now, 20 years later, the DOJ and FBI continue to protect       the very country who produced 15 of the 19 hijackers, the       Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.        Yes, we know the Kingdom played a major role in supporting,       and financing al Qaeda and evidence demonstrates that Saudi       agents who the Kingdom sent here aided and abetted some if       not all the 19 hijackers leading into the attack.        It is an indisputable fact the hijackers were living in our       country 12-18 months prior to 9/11 planning and plotting the       murder of thousands and that the FBI and CIA knew of at least       two of them, Nawaf Al-Hamzi and Khalid Al-Midhar.        Rather than hold the Kingdom accountable, the State       Department, FBI, and the CIA continue to betray the 9/11       community and cower to the Kingdom's desperate pleas of       keeping Saudi Arabia's involvement in murdering our loved       ones a secret, while the Department of Justice ignores our       pleas for the truth; instead, choosing to help keep the       Kingdom's dirty little secret--that they support radical       Islamist terrorism and the hateful ideology that spawned the       largest mass murder in our country's history and death of my       husband and our children's father . . . for what and why I       ask?        Every Administration since 9/11 continues to turn their       backs on us, the victims' family members and survivors. Why       are we standing here today adversaries to the FBI and       Department of Justice instead of allies?--And perversely, why       do they stand as allies to the Kingdom against us?        Critical documents are being held from public view because       the DOJ refuses to release them in any format. In fact, in       many cases they have refused to even look at documents       responsive to the subpoena served on them in April 2018.       Instead, our government argues it would just be too much of a       burden for the most advanced country of the free world to       review documents it is supposed to be vigilant about       retaining from one of the most important investigations the       Country has ever performed. Let me underscore that--we, the       9/11 Community--we the American public--are too burdensome in       the eyes of the bureaucracy. We are asking too much for them       to tell us what they uncovered in looking into the attacks on       all of us.        By keeping evidence hidden that will shed light on the       brutal murder of our loved ones, our own government is not       only perpetuating our continued pain and suffering, but it is       also leaving the facilitators of the attacks unaccountable       and our nation vulnerable to future terrorist attacks.        This travesty of justice must come to an end in order for       this chapter of our lives to close and keep Americans safe       from the endless grief and gruesome carnage terrorist attacks       leave behind.        For two decades, Congress has shown a united front and been       a staunch supporter for transparency regarding 9/11 and our       quest for the truth. Many here today have walked beside us on       our path of grief. They have worked hard for us and the       American people by passing a resolution to release the ``28       pages'' excised from the Joint Inquiry. Those pages offered       us clear facts about the Saudis involvement in 9/11. Congress       also worked for seven years on the Justice Against Sponsors       of Terrorism Act--JASTA; ultimately voting unanimously for       its passage with unfettered enthusiasm and then overriding a       Presidential veto to enact JASTA, cementing our right to our       day in court and we believed--ensuring all evidence would see       the light of day.        No one standing here today anticipated the level of       pushback, lack of respect, or the extent to which our State       Department, the Department of Justice, and the FBI would go       to withhold vital investigative reports from the 9/11       community and the nation at large--all in an effort to       protect the Kingdom from embarrassment and accountability.        Attorney General Garland, Director of National Intelligence       Haines, FBI Director Wray and the State Department--by       ignoring our direct pleas to them--are showing us where their       loyalty lies time and time again--with a foreign nation       capable of murdering their own.        Aside from the occasional disingenuous words to recognize       our loss--by protecting the Saudis they have not shown their       allegiance to us the American public and the victims' family       members and survivors. They have ignored numerous letters,       not only from us, but from several members of  [[Page S5936]]       Congress as well. We have never been met with such disdain.       Not only have they snubbed our invitations to meet in person,       the DOJ has fought vigorously to avoid producing mountains of       documents responsive to subpoenas served on the government       over three years ago.        This legislation in the Congress and I pray this       Administration will right that wrong. While the DOJ claims it       has distributed thousands of pages to our representatives,       that claim falls patently short of what was requested.       Instead of allowing the DOJ to continue cherry picking what       documents it wants to release and tolerating their       indefensible excuse that it would be ``too burdensome'' to       search their files, we now have the full force of the United       States Senate--and we anticipate all of Congress--supporting       a full declassification review process for all relevant       documents related to the Saudis and 9/11.        As a tragic result of 9/11 and the war on terror tomorrow       will sadly mark the 10th anniversary of the deadliest       incident and largest loss of life in the Naval Special       Warfare, when 30 American troops, including 16 commandos from       the Navy's Seal Team 6 Call Sign Extortion 16, helicopter was       shot down killing all on board in the Tangi Valley, Wardak       Province in Afghanistan. They were there fighting for all of       us, rooting out the evil created by the Kingdom that       threatens our freedoms and our way of life.        The truths we seek with ``The 9/11 Transparency Act'' are       not just for us, but for all of our fallen heroes. May every       brave warrior, rescue worker and those who have died from 9/      11 related illnesses rest in peace.        We sincerely thank Senator Menendez and these Senators       introducing 'The 9/11 Transparency Act''; another great       bipartisan effort from our esteemed leaders and ask that the       entire body of Congress act bravely and cohesively in support       of our right to know what the government has uncovered about       who facilitated the attacks on us 20 years ago. Yes, let us       never forget--but let us never let it happen again. Thank       you.     We are fast approaching 9/11, the 20th anniversary of  that horrific, unspeakable murder of thousands of our fellow citizens,  including Terry Strada's husband and Brett Eagleson's father.   Brett Eagleson put it very, very starkly and simply. I am not  quoting, but essentially his warning to us ought to reverberate in  these Halls. Public officials on that anniversary will be making  speeches about how we should never forget, about how we need to  commemorate the memories of all who perished in 9/11. But, as he said,  their words will ring shallow or hollow if their own government  continues to refuse to disclose documents and evidence needed for them  to seek justice. Those families deserve better.   And the cause is bigger than just those families. It is the American  people who deserve better. They deserve and they need to know the truth  about whether the complicity and other kinds of potential criminal  activity can be proved in a court of law, can be used to learn about  future action to be taken. If Agencies of the U.S. Government,  including our intelligence Agencies, knew about those attackers and the  danger they posed and failed to take sufficient action, we should know  those facts as well.   It is incomprehensible why the U.S. Government has failed to provide  this truth to the American people. There has been no explanation for  the failure to declassify. There is no explanation for invoking the  State Secrets Act. The courts have said that that privilege, the state  secrets privilege, cannot be invoked unless it could reasonably be  expected that there would be a harm to our national security. No  Agency, no official of the U.S. Government has ever said what harm  could result, especially 20 years after that attack.   The idea that sources or methods could be endangered seems  farfetched. Certainly, there has been no such contention. The idea that  maybe the Saudis would be embarrassed is a possible explanation, but it  is no excuse--none--for refusing to declassify and disclose this  information. The fact that the Saudis may be embarrassed or they may be  held liable is no valid reason to withhold this truth from those  families and from the American people.   The administration, at the very least, owes us an explanation. We  demanded it again and again at the Attorney General's confirmation  hearing, at the oversight hearings for the Director of the FBI, at  hearings for confirming lower but top-ranking officials of the  Department of Justice, and every one of them has promised to look into  it but nothing back--no explanation, no justification.   So Senator Menendez and I, along with our colleagues Senators Cornyn  and Grassley, have introduced the September 11th Transparency Act. It  wouldn't require the declassification of any document, but it would  require the review, and it is not unprecedented, because this Congress,  7 years ago, passed and President Obama signed the Intelligence  Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2014. It had a similar provision  requiring the Director of National Intelligence to complete a  declassification review of documents collected during the Osama bin  Laden raid in Pakistan in 2011.   This measure should have broad bipartisan support, just as JASTA did  and the resolution calling for declassification in 2018, and I have  been proud to stand with my Republican colleagues in favor of simple  justice.   As Senator Schumer said today at that meeting in front of the  Capitol, ``Justice, justice, justice.'' That is what these families  deserve. That is what the American people should expect of their  government, not concealment or obstruction and obfuscation.   Right now, these families are in a struggle against the Government of  Saudi Arabia but, equally so, against their own government in seeking  fairness and transparency, disclosure, when it counts for them and when  it should count for the American people.   We will continue this fight. I don't expect any single speech will  persuade administration officials--certainly no single speech of mine-- but they are going to be making speeches as we go closer to 9/11. Let  them keep in mind that the voices and faces of those families--Brett  Eagleson and Terry Strada and others who were there that day and many  others in Connecticut, as well as New Jersey and New York and all  around the country--will be there as well, and ultimately, our  government must be held accountable for telling the American people the  truth.   I yield the floor.
