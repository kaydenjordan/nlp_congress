 Madam President, yesterday, Senator Grassley announced  that the Judiciary Committee will continue its hearings for Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court on Monday morning. Dr.  Christine Blasey Ford of California and Judge Kavanaugh have both been  invited to testify under oath.   Dr. Ford will have the opportunity to offer sworn testimony. She  communicated with the ranking Democrat on the committee in writing  nearly 7 weeks ago, but through no fault of hers, Senate Democrats  chose to play politics and keep it secret throughout the entirety of  Judge Kavanaugh's regular confirmation process. They sat on this  information for nearly 7 weeks, until they leaked it to the press on  the eve of the scheduled committee vote.   But as my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, said yesterday,  the blatant malpractice demonstrated by our colleagues across the aisle  will not stop the Senate from moving forward in a responsible manner.   As I said yesterday, I have full confidence in Chairman Grassley to  lead the committee through the sensitive and highly irregular situation  in which the Democrats' tactics have left all of us--all of us--Judge  Kavanaugh, Dr. Ford, and the entire Senate.   Dr. Ford will be heard, and, of course, Judge Kavanaugh will have the  opportunity to defend himself against this accusation--an accusation  that he has unequivocally denied and that stands at odds with every  other piece of the overwhelming positive testimony we have received  about his character from his close friends, colleagues, and law clerks,  from the distant past to the present day, including the high school  years during which this misconduct is alleged to have taken place.   So this alleged incident is completely at variance with his entire  history. He welcomes the opportunity to address the committee about  this claim.   But, colleagues, we should not have gotten to this point in this  manner, at this time. That this process has played out with so little  order and so little sensitivity lies solely at the feet of Senate  Democrats who sought political advantage in leaking this to the press  [[Page S6198]]  instead of vetting it through proper channels.   But this is where we are. So on Monday Chairman Grassley and our  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee will reconvene. They and the  American people will hear testimony under oath.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  yesterday the Senate sent a message to the millions of Americans who  have personally done battle with addiction to opioids and prescription  drugs. We sent a message to the families who have watched our Nation's  drug overdose fatalities double in the last decade alone; to those in  recovery who have struggled to access the housing and work  opportunities they need to get back on their feet; to the Governors,  mayors, and local leaders who have seen communities from rural towns to  inner cities literally hollowed out and threatened by this epidemic; to  the police, firefighters, paramedics, and other first responders whom  our Nation has asked to confront this crisis, often without all of the  specialized training and resources they need; and to every American  affected by the opioid epidemic.   The landmark legislation the Senate passed yesterday says: The Nation  will not stand for this. More help is on the way. Yesterday evening we  voted to build on Congress's prior efforts and deliver more relief to  the communities that need it most.   This landmark legislation addresses the crisis at every step of the  way. It contains provisions to cut down on fentanyl and other illegal  drugs coming across our borders, to reform how painkillers are  prescribed and packaged, to invest in comprehensive opioid recovery  centers, and to provide for more long-term medical research.   It also contains two provisions I was pleased to secure for my fellow  Kentuckians and for the whole country. The CAREER Act will help  individuals in recovery to find housing and the job opportunities they  need to rebuild lives of sobriety, and the Protecting Mothers and  Infants Act will help the Federal Government to do more to support  pregnant women and to protect unborn children from these drugs. This  landmark legislation is like a Swiss Army knife that will help the  Federal Government to fight opioid addiction in many different ways.   I am grateful to Chairman Alexander for assembling this package,  integrating the input of more than 70 Senators and shepherding it  through passage.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, currently before  the Senate is a crucial appropriations measure for the upcoming fiscal  year: the conference report that will fund the Departments of Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Defense. It is the second  minibus conference report we have taken up in what has already been an  important year for regular appropriations.   Thanks to the leadership of Senators Shelby and Leahy, all 12  spending bills were favorably reported from the Appropriations  Committee by the end of June, the fastest pace in 30 years. For the  first time in 15 years, the Senate passed our Labor-HHS-Education bill  before the beginning of the fiscal year.   These milestones may sound like inside baseball, but what they  signify is a Senate that is getting its appropriations process back on  track, a Senate that is attending to vital priorities for our country.  The package we are voting on today will account for over half of the  Federal discretionary spending for next year. Critically, after  subjecting America's All-Volunteer Armed Forces to years of belt- tightening, this legislation will build on our recent progress in  rebuilding the readiness of our military and investing more in the men  and women who wear the uniform. This conference report increases  appropriations in the Department of Defense by $19.8 billion over  fiscal year 2018 levels. Once enacted, our warfighters will have  certainty in their funding--on time, on October 1, for the first time  in 10 years.   First and foremost, this reflects a major investment in personnel-- more resources for recruiting the forces that our military commanders  have called for and the largest servicemember pay increase in nearly a  decade. It fully funds the Pentagon's stated requests for operational  support, including hundreds of billions in base support and maintenance  funding, ensuring that critical ongoing missions continue at Fort Knox,  Fort Campbell, and the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky and at  installations all around the world.   It also supports our National Guard and Reserve components, including  many of the important missions executed by the Kentucky National Guard.  The bill further ensures that combat units are equipped with  overwhelming, cutting-edge capabilities: critical funding for aircraft  and aviation programs, for new battle force ships, and hundreds of  millions for our missile defense capabilities.   In addition to our Armed Forces, this bill will also provide for  communities wounded by drug addiction, for families working hard to  save for college tuition, and for workers who are trying to catch up in  ever-evolving industries.   Under the Labor-HHS-Education title, this package would fund critical  medical research at the National Institutes of Health, ongoing support  for State opioid response grants, and apprenticeship and job training  programs. It sets aside special funds for priorities like combatting  infectious diseases that ride on the coattails of the opioid epidemic  and retaining dislocated rural workers--both key priorities in States  like Kentucky and around the country.   So to sum up, there is more support for the best trained, best  equipped, and strongest military force in the world and more support  for the health and prosperity of American communities and workers--all  the more reasons why I will be proud to vote for this legislation and  why I urge every one of my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the Senate vote on the  motion to invoke cloture on the conference report to accompany H.R.  6157 at 12 noon today; further, that if invoked, all time be considered  expired and the Senate vote on adoption of the conference report.
