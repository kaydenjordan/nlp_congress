 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Walorski) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to mention that I, too, rise today in support of  H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE for Workers Act. This technical correction bill  builds on the progress we made in last year's budget act to provide  reemployment services to help get more people back to work faster and  easier.   While the intent of last year's law was to allow job counselors to  consult with unemployed individuals as soon as possible, oftentimes  implementation of the law led to this happening only in cases where  unemployment benefits were set to expire.   Today's bill realigns reemployment services and eligibility  assessment with the original intent of their mission to assist  unemployed individuals as soon as possible to get people back to work.   I know, in my district, case managers at the Workforce Centers of  South Central Kansas provide a critical service connecting people with  jobs or skills training to further their careers.   At a time when our economy is growing at historic rates and we have  more job openings than ever before, the work these centers provide is  extremely important to help make sure all Americans can participate in  this economic revival.   I want to thank my fellow Ways and Means Committee members for  working to bring this bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Kelly, for  bringing this to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1957, the Taxpayer First  Act. This bipartisan bill redesigns and modernizes the IRS for the  first time in 21 years and focuses on improving the agency's service to  taxpayers.   As the only former State treasurer in the House, I understand the  need for the country's tax administration agency to adopt a mission of  customer service and to help taxpayers retrieve information, resolve  issues, and make payments.   This bill accomplishes these goals in several ways. First, it  establishes an independent appeals process so that taxpayers are  treated fairly. It provides for easier electronic submission of tax  return forms, and it strengthens the IRS ability to combat identity  theft. It also requires the agency to submit to Congress plans to  further improve efficiency and customer service.   Altogether, the Taxpayer First Act provides needed, commonsense, and  overdue reforms to the IRS.   I thank my fellow Ways and Means Committee members for working to  bring this bill to the floor.   Today's vote is a culmination of several years of work and numerous  hearings and discussions, including passing this bill in the House  during last Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.                                time  1415
