 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1030 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, our healthcare system is broken. Eighty- five million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, and we don't even  have enough doctors, nurses, or mental health providers. Unbelievably,  our life expectancy is actually declining. Our childcare system is  dysfunctional. Millions of parents are unable to find affordable sites  for their kids.   We have a major housing crisis, 600,000 Americans are homeless, and-- oh, yes--the planet is on fire, and the world we are leaving future  generations will be increasingly unhealthy. But somehow we never have  enough money to address those crises.   Mr. President, if we have learned anything from the COVID pandemic,  where we have lost over 1 million Americans, and climate change, which  is causing massive destruction throughout the world, it is that  national security is not just about nuclear weapons, submarines, and  fighter planes; it is about making sure that all Americans have decent  healthcare, education, housing, and other necessities of life.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more  seconds.    Year after year, with very little debate, we pour  hundreds of billions of dollars into the military-industrial complex.  This year, it is about $900 billion. While defense contractors make  huge profits, while the Pentagon remains unaudited, with massive waste  and fraud, we now spend more than the next 10 nations combined.   Enough is enough. It is time to change our national priorities, and  cutting military spending by 10 percent is a good way to begin.    Reserving the right to object    Let me begin by thanking Chairman Wyden for his  leadership on the need to fundamentally reform our Nation's organ  transplant program. I share his concerns. A 2020 bipartisan Finance  Committee investigation that Chairman Wyden co-led with respect to the  current system found ``lapses in patient safety, misuse of taxpayer  dollars, and tens of thousands of organs going unrecovered or not  transplanted . . . resulting in fraud, waste, and abuse of our Nation's  Medicare program and American taxpayer dollars.''   That is unacceptable and that has got to change. The legislation  Senator Wyden would like to pass in the Senate today by unanimous  consent, while not perfect, includes important reforms to the current  system that I support. Once it is signed into law, there may need to be  some technical changes to it that I look forward to working with  Chairman Wyden and my other colleagues on.   All of us believe that the administration should have the flexibility  it needs to fix the current system. We also believe that corporations  should not be able to make an outrageous profit from the organ network.   As my good friend from Oregon knows, this bill is within the  jurisdiction of the HELP Committee, a committee that I chair.   Before I withdraw my objections to the organ transplant bill, I want  to raise an issue of enormous importance to the American people, and  that is the need to address the very serious primary care crisis in  America and the massive shortage of doctors, nurses, mental health  professionals, and dentists in America.   As my colleague from Oregon knows very well, tens of millions of  Americans are unable to access the primary medical care, dental care,  and mental health care that they desperately need.   As everyone in America understands, we don't have enough doctors,  nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, dentists, and home healthcare  workers in our country.   As the Senator from Oregon knows very well, on September 30,  mandatory funding for Community Health Centers, the National Health  Service Corps, and Teaching Health Centers will expire unless Congress  acts, and Congress must act.   The HELP Committee is working on bipartisan legislation, not only to  reauthorize these critical programs, but to significantly expand them.  We need a major expansion of Community Health Centers in America to  make sure that tens of millions of underserved Americans not only  receive the primary care they need, but are also able to receive the  high-quality mental health care and dental care they need as well.   We need a major expansion of the National Health Service Corps  Program, the program that provides scholarships and debt forgiveness  for doctors, nurses, dentists, and mental health providers who are  prepared to work in our Nation's most underserved areas.   We need a major expansion of the Teaching Health Center Program, the  Nurse Corps, and the Nurse Faculty Loan Program, among many other  things.   Of particular concern is an issue I heard about from every single  major medical organization in our country, and that is that over the  next decade, our Nation faces a shortage of more than 120,000 doctors,  including a major shortage of primary care doctors. I don't know how we  can grow the number of doctors in America without expanding the  Medicare Graduate Medical Education--GME--Program, a program that is  within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.   Let's be clear. The problem is not so much about the number of  doctors graduating from medical school. No, the problem--the  bottleneck--is that some 6,800 applicants for a residency position  don't match into a program due to a shortage of spots. As my colleague  from Oregon knows, if a doctor graduates from medical school but cannot  get a residency slot, that person cannot practice medicine in the  United States.   In my view, it is critically important that we expand the GME  Program. There is bipartisan legislation that does this: S. 1302. The  Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2023, led by Senators  Menendez, Boozman, Schumer, and Collins, would raise the number of GME  positions by 14,000 over the next 7 years. Consistent with legislation  that passed the House last Congress, I believe that a significant  percentage of these additional slots should be dedicated to primary  care and mental health care.   As you know, the Medicare GME Program is within the jurisdiction of  the Finance Committee, and the other programs I mentioned are within  the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee.   I ask my good friend and colleague from Oregon, will you commit today  that as chairman of the Finance Committee, you will do everything  within your ability to pass bipartisan legislation in the Senate that  includes a major expansion of the Medicare Graduate Medical Education  Program?    Sure.    My remarks will be brief.   I just want to thank the chairman, Senator Wyden, of the Finance  Committee, for his commitment and for his leadership on these issues. I  look forward to working with him to expand access to primary care in  America and address the major shortage of healthcare workers in  America.  [[Page S3733]]    Mr. President, with that commitment, I will not object.    Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life of  Gus Newport, a long-time champion for human rights and advocate for  racial and economic justice, who passed away on June 17, 2023.   Gus will be remembered as a true progressive activist, having worked  as the mayor of Berkeley, CA, as a member on the leadership committee  of the National Council of Elders, the vice president from the U.S. to  the World Peace Council serving on the United Nations Committee against  Apartheid and the Committee on the Question of  [[Page S3750]]  Palestine, as a member of the Unity Reform Commission, and the board  president for the Middle East Children's Alliance, among others.   I first met Gus when I was mayor of Burlington, VT, and I am proud to  have called him my friend for the past 40 years. In addition to his  work, Gus' family was important to him. As he said many times, his mom  was his first role model, and the aspiration for his work came from his  grandmother. At an early age, Gus immersed himself in local, national,  and global politics.   Throughout his life, Gus worked alongside civil rights leaders and  political activists including Malcolm X, Angela Davis, and Danny  Glover. His accomplishments span from groundbreaking political  initiatives and the implementation of critical community economic  development programs, to global solidarity.   As mayor, Gus led the city of Berkeley to divest from apartheid South  Africa, making them the first city in the U.S. to do so. Additionally,  he created a domestic partner benefits program for LGBTQ+ families and  childcare initiatives to aid working women. Gus also worked on  affordable housing programs, rent control, policing reforms,  environmental protections, and community development.   In whatever task he took on, Gus worked with his whole heart and a  deep sense of solidarity for humanity. As Gus said, ``We need to come  back to what Martin [Luther King Jr.] called Building the Beloved  Community-helping communities address education, incarceration, mental  and physical health in an integrated and systematic way. If we want a  better future for the next generation, we need to build a movement that  is strategic and constant!''   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Gus Newport for his  tireless work on behalf of our communities and citizens.   May the memory of Gus Newport be a blessing.                            ____________________
