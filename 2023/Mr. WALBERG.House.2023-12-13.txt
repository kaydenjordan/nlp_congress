 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 927. Last week,  Americans watched in bewilderment as the presidents of Harvard, MIT,  and Penn were unable to say if calls for a genocide of Jews violated  their harassment and bullying policy.   Let's not forget campus leaders go after microaggressions, but  suddenly when it comes to anti-Semitism, they chose to remain silent.   At that same hearing, I asked Harvard's President how she could  rectify cracking down on faculty for saying there are biologically two  genders but maintain that calling for genocide is protected speech.   The reality is that at these universities, free speech only applies  to certain people at certain times, which is why these schools rank at  the bottom of scorecards that judge freedom of speech.   The inability of these presidents to condemn anti-Semitic rhetoric  only encourages further harassment and jeopardizes the safety of Jewish  students, and ultimately all.   Mr. Speaker, they need to be held to account. I encourage adoption of  the resolution.
