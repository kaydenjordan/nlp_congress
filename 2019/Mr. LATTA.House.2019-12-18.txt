 Madam Speaker, this is a sad day for our country, one that  our forefathers warned us against.   We have watched this illegitimate impeachment process unfold while  making a mockery of our constitutional duties. House Democrats have  conducted the most polarizing impeachment process in our Nation's  history, and the men and women I represent are tired of this Democrat- run House putting political games above our Nation's interests.  [[Page H12173]]    House Democrats held secret meetings, withheld important documents,  deliberately misrepresented information to the public, and did not give  due process to the President. This investigation was unfair, and the  American people expect more out of Congress.   The Articles of Impeachment are not based on facts but, instead, are  entirely politically motivated. The truth is there was no pressure put  on President Zelensky, and the transcripts confirm that there was no  conditionality.   This inquiry has been rigged from the start, lacking fairness,  transparency, and truth. It has been a waste of taxpayers' dollars, and  it is based off the opinion of an unnamed whistleblower and hearsay.  The accusations in today's proceedings do not align with the facts.   This impeachment process is out of step with existing precedent for  Presidential impeachment proceedings, and it is not a process I will  support. I urge my colleagues to put country first and vote in  opposition to the Articles of Impeachment.
