 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join my  colleagues. I was fortunate to hear the ``deaness'' of our delegation  speak earlier.   I am not very good at farewells or good-byes. I am far better at  hellos. We could never say goodbye to such an engaging, compassionate  and caring individual, which is reflected in the legislation that he  has put forward, reflected in the way that he has represented the  people of Rhode Island, how he has engaged himself on this floor with  individual Members, what he has done time and again, leading with his  heart, but using that great brain power and strategy to get things done  on behalf of people.   I know it has been mentioned about our beloved colleague, John Lewis,  and staging that sit-in here on the floor, but I believe that that is  something that everyone who was serving here at the time will never  forget.   Again, it was his leadership, it was his compassion, and it was his  heart. He is a man amongst men who demonstrates that daily.   I love and respect him. I will miss him but not for long, because we  will always be together. By now, I think just about the whole Congress  is headed to Rhode Island for a drink at Clem's.   I thank him so much for his service. I thank him so much for his  commitment to the people of Rhode Island. The country is better off  because   David Cicilline has served and represented the people of  Rhode Island here in the people's Chamber.                                General Leave
