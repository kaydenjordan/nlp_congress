 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 1004.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Katko). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 156 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1004.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  0916                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1004) to amend chapter 3 of title 5, United States Code, to  require the publication of information relating to pending agency  regulatory actions, and for other purposes, with Mr. Simpson in the  chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) and the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 1004 is sponsored by Representative Tim Walberg, my colleague  from Michigan. Cosponsors include Representative Farenthold,  Representative Meadows, Representative Gosar, and myself.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of  2017.   Every year, agencies promulgate thousands of new regulations and  impose billions of dollars in regulatory costs on the American public.  Those rules are conceived of, developed, written, and imposed by  unelected agency officials--bureaucrats.   In return for the authority to issue regulations, Congress and the  American people require two simple things from agencies. First,  agencies must inform the public about their intended regulatory  actions--early and accurately--to provide ample time for thoughtful  feedback and consideration from the public. Second, we want the  agencies to listen to what the public has to say about the proposed  regulatory action.   Making sure the public has an opportunity to participate in this  process is key. The public comment period is an essential part of  upholding our democratic values. It ensures Americans have a voice  heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process.   H.R. 1004 helps preserve and strengthen the integrity of the public  comment process in several ways. First, the bill defines the parameters  of how an agency should communicate when asking for and offering a  proposal and asking for public feedback. H.R. 1004 requires the agency  to identify itself in communications on the proposal. Imagine that. We  ask them to identify themselves. The agency must clearly state whether  it is accepting comments or considering alternatives.   Most importantly, agency communications during this process must use  a neutral, unbiased tone. This bill requires agencies to do only what  you would expect them to do if the request for feedback was genuine and  sincere. This bill will uphold the purpose and value of the notice and  comment process enshrined in the Administrative Procedures Act.   When issuing new regulations, agencies must provide notice of the  regulation and accept comments from the public before finalizing the  regulation. Often, regulated entities, small businesses, and subject- matter experts can provide new insights and perspectives agency  officials simply do not have and do not understand. The notice and  comment period allows the public to provide valuable insight to the  agencies to help them make better regulations, more effective  regulations, and minimize the adverse impacts.   However, not every agency takes this opportunity to really listen to  the public. Often, agencies develop a proposed regulation and assume it  is the end of the story. In effect, agencies reduce the notice and  comment process to checking the box.   A perfect example, unfortunately, is when EPA developed the waters of  the United States rule, known as WOTUS, EPA's behavior during the  notice and comment period indicated that the EPA had little interest in  listening to the public. Quite the contrary.   EPA used Thunderclap, an online social media platform, to disseminate  government-sourced messages through unaffiliated individuals to  encourage the public to provide positive comments. They did not  identify themselves and used a third party to source comments that  would support their  [[Page H1470]]  perspective. The goal was clearly to pad the administrative record with  positive feedback rather than soliciting genuine input in an effort to  measure the rule's effect on the public.   In fact, the Government Accountability Office found the EPA undertook  a covert propaganda campaign by soliciting social media comments in  support of their proposed rule. Let me say that again: a covert  propaganda campaign.   GAO also told EPA to report this violation to the President and  Congress because the agency's appropriations were not available for  those prohibited purposes. They spent taxpayer money--our money--on  something that was prohibited.   H.R. 1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, seeks to shine a  light on how agencies are communicating about pending regulatory  actions. This bill simply tells agencies they need to keep to the facts  and avoid soliciting support when they ought to be soliciting comments.   H.R. 1004 also establishes transparency requirements for the agency  in how it communicates to the public. The bill requires agencies to  post on their website some basic information about each communication  about a pending regulatory action. For each communication, the public  will be able to see a copy of the communication, the intended audience,  the method of communication, and the date it was issued--simple  transparency expectations. Additionally, H.R. 1004 requires agencies to  post information online about each of their regulatory actions.   Mr. Chairman, the Regulatory Integrity Act will bring integrity back  to the rulemaking process with transparency and simple guidelines for  effective and appropriate communication.   The Regulatory Integrity Act is a good, bipartisan bill. This bill  received support in the previous Congress, and the House of  Representatives passed the bill last Congress.   On February 14, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government  Reform approved this bill without amendment.   I thank Congressman Walberg for his leadership on this issue. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who is my colleague and good  friend.  [[Page H1471]]                                     time  0930     Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who is my colleague and good  friend.  [[Page H1471]]                                     time  0930     Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who is my colleague and good  friend.  [[Page H1471]]                                     time  0930     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, one thing is clear to me, even as a freshman: we need  to correct the record here.   My colleague from the minority suggests that somehow, magically, the  GAO just determined they were the police officer, they cried foul, they  stopped them.   Let's be clear about this. First, the GAO intervened because they  were asked to do so by Chairman Inhofe. They investigated after the  chairman asked them to look into it because of the concerns; not in  advance, not because they found it independently, but because it was  such a significant and egregious action that the chairman of the  committee said: We need to look at this. And they did so.   Second, it was after the fact. What they found was that it was so  extraordinarily egregious, they actually cited them for inappropriately  spending taxpayer money.   Now, let's talk about what they did. We talk about chilling  communication. Knowingly, why would you put out something on a social  media site such as Thunderclap sourcing messages, not identifying  yourself, if for any other purpose but to create propaganda? Why would  you do that?   H.R. 1004 simply requires--and I will repeat them, because the  minority seems to have a problem understanding this--the agency  identified itself in its communication on a proposal: hello, this is  the EPA. We are talking about this problem.   They make clear they are accepting public comments for and against:  What do you think about it; what are the problems; will this work?  Imagine that concept.   They require that agencies provide feedback on the comments that is  genuine and sincere and not have already written the final bill--as my  colleagues says, the perfunctory process.   That is what it requires. I have a difficult time understanding how  that chills input from the public. And to be absolutely blunt with you,  if it chills a few bureaucrats from deciding what they think is best  rather than what this body believes is best, or, frankly, what the  courts believe is best, then we have achieved our objective here today.   So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will make my statement brief. As you  know, I believe in a little bit of brevity around here. Let me suggest  that we have talked at length on the content of the bill and the intent  of the bill. Let me suggest that my colleague may have used the wrong  example or analogy because we all know, where there is one mosquito,  there is more. Where there is one, there is more. At this point in  time, this bill says we are going to take care of his mosquitoes. With  all due respect, I ask my colleagues to support the bill, as I believe  it puts the transparency required in rulemaking that will require  agencies to disclose they are asking for comments and who is making the  comment. It is one more step in getting the government accountable to  the people rather than accountable to itself.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1004         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Each such amendment may be  offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated  in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the  time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the  proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall  not be subject to a demand for division of the question.                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  part A of House Report 115-21.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, after line 17, insert the following new paragraph       (and redesignate subsequent paragraphs accordingly):        ``(2) Propaganda; publicity; advocacy.--The terms       `propaganda', `publicity', and `advocacy' mean information,       statements, or claims (or using such information, statement,       or claim, as applicable) that--        ``(A) are not widely accepted in the scientific community;       or        ``(B) are beliefs or assertions that are unsupported by       science or empirical data.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 156, the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chair and the managers of the bill, in this  instance Mr. Raskin and his collaborator, the Republican manager as  well. I thank them for their very thoughtful discussion. I also want to  indicate that this regulation does have a perspective of excessiveness  on a matter that can be confined to instructions to the agencies that  have the responsibility of implementing the laws that we pass here in  the United States Congress.   My amendment improves the present underlying bill by making clear  that  [[Page H1475]]  communication of information statements or claims that are generally  accepted by the scientific community or supported by empirical data is  not restricted by this bill.   H.R. 1004 directs each Federal agency to make information regarding  their regulatory actions publicly available in a searchable format on a  prominent website. That information would have to include the date a  regulation was considered, its current status, an estimate of when the  regulation will be final, and a brief description of the regulation. In  addition, agencies will be required to track the details of all public  communications about pending regulatory actions.   But it further provides that:   ``Any public communication issued by an Executive agency that refers  to a pending agency regulatory action, other than an impartial  communication that requests comment on or provides information  regarding the pending agency regulatory action,'' among other things,  ``may not--be directly or indirectly for publicity or propaganda  purposes within the United States. . . .''   I want to make sure that if an agency is telling the truth, then that  agency is not going to be charged, as was said by Mr. Raskin, using a  sledgehammer, that they can't make those communications. Take, for  example, someone claiming that global warming is a hoax, but, if you  read the facts, you will find out that a landmark 2013 study assessed  4,000 peer-reviewed papers by 10,000 climate scientists that gave an  opinion on the cause of climate change. It showed 97 percent of the  authors attributed climate change to manmade causes. That may be a  simple statement made by an agency based on science and empirical  study. That should not be prohibited.   The Jackson Lee amendment will protect Federal agency employees who  might otherwise be ostracized, marginalized, discriminated against,  wrongfully terminated or mistreated, or the whole regulation process  imploded for statements made even though the statement is externally  valid, logical, rooted in fact, or supported by empirical data,  although contrary to an administration's political agenda. I want this  to be straight up. I want these agency representatives to do what is  right, so I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules  Committee for making the Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I also wish to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings  for their work in bringing the legislation before us to the floor.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment to H.R. 1004.   The Jackson Lee Amendment improves H.R. 1004 by making clear that  Communication of information, statements or claims that are generally  accepted by the scientific community or supported by empirical data is  not restricted by the bill.   H.R. 1004 directs each federal agency to make information regarding  their regulatory actions publicly available in a searchable format on a  prominent website.   That information would have to include the date a regulation was  considered, its current status, an estimate of when the regulation  would be final, and a brief description of the regulation.   In addition, agencies would be required to track the details of all  public communications about pending regulatory actions.   H.R. 1004 further provides that ``any public communication issued by  an Executive agency that refers to a pending agency regulatory action,  other than an impartial communication that requests comment on or  provides information regarding the pending agency regulatory action,  among other things, may not ``be directly or indirectly used for  publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States unless  otherwise authorized by law.''   Thus, in addition to requiring each federal agency to make  information regarding regulatory action publicly available and  accessible online, H.R. 1004 places restrictions on the type and  quality of communications agencies may make.   This vague phrase--``publicity or propaganda purposes''--creates  substantial uncertainty and confusion as to what public communications  are permissible, and risks discouraging agencies from keeping the  public apprised of the important work they do on its behalf.   The Jackson Lee Amendment will protect federal agency employees who  might otherwise be ostracized, marginalized, discriminated against,  wrongfully terminated, or mistreated for statements made even though  the statement is externally valid, logical, rooted in fact, or  supported by empirical data, although contrary to an administration's  political agenda.   Under the Jackson Lee Amendment, for example, a communication that  human activity is a major contributor to climate change is not  propaganda because it is an assertion supported by an overwhelming  consensus of the scientific community.   On the other hand, a claim that there is `widespread voter fraud' in  presidential elections could be considered propaganda, because there is  no reliable and statistically significant empirical data to support  such a claim.   Federal agencies' ability to engage and inform the public in a  meaningful and transparent way regarding their work on important  science-based rulemakings that will greatly benefit the public is a  public good that we must nurture and protect.   While propaganda may corrupt information or ideas by an interested  party in a tendentious way in order to encourage particular attitudes  and responses, information, supported by facts or empirical evidence,  on the other hand, does not.   The Jackson Lee Amendment safeguards the legitimacy and transparency  of communications issued by federal agencies, ensuring that the  information disseminated to the public is accurate and reliable.   I urge my colleagues to preserve the bedrock principles of empirical  research, scientific method, and free inquiry that are indispensable to  free societies by voting for the Jackson Lee Amendment.                     [From cnbc.com, February 17, 2017]       Murray Energy CEO Claims Global Warming Is a Hoax, Says 4,000                           Scientists Tell Him So                           (By Tom DiChristopher)         Murray Energy Chairman and CEO Robert Murray on Friday       claimed global warming is a hoax and repeated a debunked       claim that the phenomenon cannot exist because the Earth's       surface is cooling.        Murray appeared on CNBC's ``Squawk Box'' to discuss       Republicans' rollback of an Obama-era rule that would have       restricted coal mining near waterways. President Donald Trump       signed the measure on Thursday in front of Murray and a group       of Murray Energy workers.        Murray Energy is the country's largest coal miner. Many of       its mines are in Appalachia, a region that would suffer some       of the biggest impacts of the rule. Murray also successfully       sued to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which       would regulate planet-warming carbon emissions from power       plants.        Asked about the economic analysis behind President Barack       Obama's energy regulations, Murray said, ``There's no       scientific analysis either. I have 4,000 scientists that tell       me global warming is a hoax. The Earth has cooled for 20       years.''        It was not immediately clear who the 4,000 scientists       Murray referenced are.        Asked for clarification, a spokesperson for Murray Energy       sent links to the Manhattan Declaration on Climate Change,       which says ``human-caused climate change is not a global       crisis,'' and the Global Warming Petition Project, a list of       science degree holders who don't think humans cause climate       change.        Murray's claim that there is no scientific analysis behind       climate change is not true.        A landmark 2013 study assessed 4,000 peer-reviewed papers       by 10,000 climate scientists that gave an opinion on the       cause of climate change. It showed 97 percent of the authors       attributed climate change to manmade causes.        His second claim that Earth is cooling is also false.        Temperatures were the warmest on record last year,       according to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration. It was the third year in a row global average       temperatures set a record.        ``The planet's average surface temperature has risen about       2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late       19th century,' a change driven largely by increased carbon       dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere,''       NASA and NOAA said.        Climate change skeptics sometimes point to cool land       temperatures to dispute global warming. Scientists have       repeatedly noted that water covers 70 percent of the Earth's       surface, so it is highly misleading to cast temperatures on       land as a representation of global-scale temperatures.        Land also heats and cools more quickly than the ocean, The       Weather Channel noted while debunking a recent Breitbart News       article that was widely found to have cherry-picked data to       cast doubt on climate change.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
