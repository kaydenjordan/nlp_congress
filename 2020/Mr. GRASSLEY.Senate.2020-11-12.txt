 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, Iowa is home to a lot of people who have  a heritage from the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. November 17  is coming up pretty soon, and it marks the 31st anniversary of the  Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia.   In 1989, the Czech people stood up against Communist rule and,  through nonviolent demonstrations, precipitated the nation's transition  to democracy. The Velvet Revolution lasted 43 days and in the end ended  41 years of Communist control of Czechoslovakia. Jingling keys became a  symbol of the revolution and of the new doors that democracy and  freedom from communism would unlock for those great people in  Czechoslovakia.   Now we have two countries--the Czech Republic and the Slovak  Republic. We also have a National Czech and Slovak Museum in Cedar  Rapids, IA. This museum helps to educate Americans about these events I  just talked about and, most importantly, to teach them about the  importance of never giving up on fighting for freedom.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
