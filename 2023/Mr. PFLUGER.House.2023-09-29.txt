 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House  Republicans' plan to cut spending to keep government open and to shut  down the border. The President has failed Americans. He has failed  Texans. He has failed us by not securing our border.   Mr. Speaker, 7\1/2\ million illegal immigrants, 150 people just this  year who matched the terror watch list, 13,000 criminals, 100,000-plus  fentanyl poisoning deaths is unacceptable. Enough is enough.   This plan, which would also include H.R. 2, the most secure border  act in decades, puts the President on notice.   Now is the time.   This is the most important border security vote in 20 years. This  vote right here not only cuts spending, but it shuts down the border  and the disaster, the chaos, and the unacceptable level of death that  our President has caused.   This bill deserves our attention. I urge my colleagues to cut the  spending, to keep the government open, and to shut down the border.
