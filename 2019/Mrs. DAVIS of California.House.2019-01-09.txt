 Mr. Speaker, we are about to witness the  longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Hundreds of thousands of  Federal employees, many in my own district, are not certain when or if  their next paycheck is coming, and for what? For what? For a border  wall?   Mr. Speaker, in San Diego, we know walls. We have a triple fence, and  we know there are real concerns on the border. Let's work on solving  those problems. Spending billions of dollars on a wall won't.   In San Diego, we have the most modern port of entry in the country.  It works well to catch drugs and stop criminals. If the President wants  border security, well, that, that should be our focus.   Paola Avila, of the San Diego Chamber said it best: ``Our border  region is an opportunity zone, not a danger zone.''   Let's take that opportunity and work to improve our border, not waste  money on a wall. And let's not waste any more time. Federal employees  want to get back to work.   We have already passed legislation, bipartisan legislation, to end  this shutdown. Let's reopen the government today.                            ____________________
