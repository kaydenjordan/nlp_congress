 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, ``You don't want to take money out of the  economy when the economy is shrinking.'' ``You don't want to take money  out of the economy when the economy is shrinking.'' Those aren't my  words. Those were the words of the current Democratic leader in 2008:  ``You don't want to take money out of the economy when the economy is  shrinking.''   Well, apparently, it is a philosophy the Democratic leader no longer  subscribes to because, last week, he introduced legislation to take  money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking.   The Democrats' so-called Inflation Reduction Act--which is a misnomer  if ever there was one, since the bill will do nothing to help alleviate  our current inflation crisis--will take hundreds of billions of dollars  out of the economy in the form of new tax hikes and comes just as our  economy posted a second quarter of negative growth.   Notably, the bill imposes a $313 billion tax hike on American  businesses, with roughly half of that increase falling on American  manufacturers. I guess the President's commitment to boosting American  manufacturing takes a backseat to raising revenue to fund Democrats'  Green New Deal priorities.   I don't think I need to tell anyone what happens when you raise taxes  on businesses, particularly when the economy is shrinking. You get less  growth, fewer jobs, and lower wages. According to an analysis from the  National Association of Manufacturers, in 2023 alone, the Democrats'  bill would reduce real gross domestic product by more than $68 billion  and result in 218,108 fewer workers in the overall economy--a $68  billion reduction in GDP and more than 218,000 fewer workers.   And ordinary Americans would bear a substantial part of the burden of  this tax increase. According to data from the nonpartisan Joint  Committee on Taxation, the Democrats' bill would increase the tax  burden of Americans across every income bracket, with more than half of  the increased tax burden falling on Americans making $400,000 or less.  Next year alone, the Democrats' bill would increase the tax burden on  Americans earning less than $200,000 by $16.7 billion.   Democrats are brazenly attempting to sell this new tax as somehow  closing a loophole instead of hiking taxes on American businesses, but  that isn't even close to being the truth. When companies pay less than  the current corporate tax rate, they are often simply taking advantage  of tax credits that Republicans and Democrats put in place to encourage  investment in things like research and development or the production of  new technologies.   Democrats aren't closing a loophole in the tax bill. Let's face it.  They are raising taxes on American businesses at a time when our  economy has posted two consecutive quarters of negative growth. They  are raising taxes on businesses that are already struggling with  historically high inflation.   Democrats claim they will make large companies pay at least a 15- percent minimum tax, but that isn't true either because Democrats have  created carve-outs to their own minimum tax. That is right. Not all  companies will have to pay the new book minimum tax. For instance,  green energy companies and companies that take green energy tax credits  will be allowed to pay less than the Democrats' alternative minimum  corporate tax rate. In other words, if you are a member of or invest in  the Democrats' preferred industries, you get special tax treatment  under their legislation. So much for ensuring that all companies--all  companies--``pay their fair share.''    In addition to their $313 billion tax hike on American businesses,  Democrats' legislation also raises taxes on investment--another bad  idea at a time when our economy is already shrinking. Perhaps  Democrats' real plan is to reduce inflation by slowing our economy and  ensuring that we enter a recession or what is known as stagflation.   Democrats' legislation also raises taxes on oil and gas production  even as Americans continue to struggle with high energy prices,  including a 75-percent increase in gas prices since President Biden  took office.   Taxes aren't the only way the Democrats raise revenue in this bill to  pay for their Green New Deal measures. The Democrats' bill also  attempts to raise revenue by increasing IRS audits and enforcement. The  Democrats' legislation gives the IRS an additional $80 billion in  funding over 10 years--$80 billion, about six times their annual  budget. This would allow the IRS to hire an additional 87,000  employees, meaning that the IRS would have nearly--do you believe  this?--three times as many personnel as U.S. Customs and Border  Protection, the Agency that is charged with overseeing security at our  Nation's borders--87,000 new employees. The IRS's budget would also  substantially exceed Customs and Border Protection's budget if this  legislation is enacted.   Now, you might think that given the raging crisis at our southern  border, the Biden administration would be focused on beefing up funding  and personnel for Customs and Border Protection instead of the IRS, but  you would be wrong. Apparently, the need to find money for Democrats'  Green New Deal trumps the need for a secure border.   Of the additional $80 billion the Democrats' bill would hand to the  IRS, 57 percent or more than $45 billion would go to enforcement and  only 4 percent to taxpayer services. Think about that. Four percent for  an Agency, as I said on the floor yesterday, that only succeeded in  answering about 1 out of every 50 taxpayer phone calls during the 2021  tax season and has repeatedly, as we all know, mishandled sensitive  taxpayer data.   To name just one instance, confidential taxpayer information was  either leaked or hacked from the IRS last year and shared with the  left-leaning ProPublica in order to advance a partisan agenda. More  than a year later, the IRS still hasn't provided meaningful followup to  Congress or accountability to taxpayers for that leak. Yet Democrats'  focus is not on improving the IRS responsiveness and accountability but  on boosting the number of audits.   Speaking of those audits, no one should think the IRS would be just  auditing major corporations and billionaires. No, this bill would  result in a lot of audits of small businesses and ordinary Americans.  In fact, it is extremely unlikely the Democrats will be  [[Page S3877]]  able to gather the revenue they are claiming they can get from  increased IRS enforcement unless they audit Americans making less than  $200,000 a year.   Based on data, again, from the Joint Committee on Taxation, 78 to 90  percent of the revenue projected to be raised from underreported income  would likely come from those making under $200,000. Only 4 to 9 percent  would come from those making more than $500,000. That, again, is from  the Joint Committee on Taxation.   I just want to repeat that. Seventy-eight to ninety percent of the  revenue projected to be raised from underreported income would likely  come from those making under $200,000 a year. In other words, all this  talk about audits and, you know, closing the tax gap and forcing people  to pay taxes that are due that they are not paying today and implying  that somehow that is all going to apply to high-income taxpayers or big  corporations or big businesses is just flat inconsistent with the data  and the facts as compiled by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Up to 90  percent of the revenue projected to be raised from underreported income  would come from those making less than $200,000 a year.   So, Mr. and Mrs. American Taxpayer, get ready. Get ready for the IRS  enforcement auditor to come to your house and to start harassing you so  that the Democrats can pay for their massive tax-and-spending spree.   After more than a year of high inflation spurred by Democrats'  reckless American Rescue Plan spending spree passed last year and with  an economy that has shrunk for the past two quarters, it is hard to  believe the Democrats are trying to pass hundreds of billions of  dollars in tax hikes, but that is exactly what is happening. Once  again, economic common sense is taking a back seat to Democrats' big  spending and big government ideology.   Democrats have already inflicted a lot of economic pain on the  American people, and if this legislation passes, there is more to come.   I yield the floor.
