 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the Illinois  Representatives to express our deep condolences for the victims of the  tragic multi-vehicle accident last week on I-55, and to offer our  sincere gratitude to the brave Illinois first responders who assisted  motorists at the scene.   The dedication and commitment of our first responders has been  unwavering, and we are keeping the victims, their families, and their  friends in our hearts and our prayers during this difficult time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Budzinski).
