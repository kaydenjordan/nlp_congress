 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to  thank Cyreia Sandlin, a reporter, for her decade of service to the  greater Savannah area.   Cyreia first arrived in Savannah in 2011 after graduating from the  University of Missouri School of Broadcast Journalism earlier that  year. Since then, Cyreia has dedicated herself to keeping the people of  Savannah informed and educated, serving as an anchor on Savannah's most  popular morning news show.   Additionally, her focus on community news has helped the area's  growing population maintain its small-town kinship.   Cyreia has also helped her community outside of the newsroom. She has  served as the president of the Telfair Museums' William Jay Society,  sat on the board of the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club, and volunteered  at the Children's Hospital at Memorial Health.   A dedicated voice in her community, Cyreia Sandlin has provided the  people of Savannah with a reliable source for news and information for  over a decade. I thank her for all that she has given, and I wish her  the best of luck in her new position.                            ____________________
