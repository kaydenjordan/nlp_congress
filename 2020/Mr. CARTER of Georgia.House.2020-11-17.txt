 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Hugh Pendleton Nunnally, Jr., who was a pillar in the Golden Isles  community.   Hugh was born and raised in Atlanta and graduated from Georgia Tech  with a degree in agriculture. After graduating, he was fortunate enough  to be mentored by Malon Courts of the Courts & Company and became a  broker within 2 years.   In 1955, he was drafted into the Army and finished his service in  1957 as a sergeant.   Following Hugh's time in the Army, he became a founding partner in  the brokerage firm Budd & Company and then a founding partner of  Presidential Financial Company.   After the death of his precious wife, Miriam, he was devoted to many  philanthropic efforts, including the Southeast Georgia Health System,  the Nunnally House, the College of Coastal Georgia, the Humane Society  of South Coastal Georgia, and the Hospice of the Golden Isles.   Hugh will always be remembered for his endearing smile, compassion,  and selflessness.   My thoughts and prayers are with all who knew and loved him during  this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the time today to speak on this  important legislation, and I thank Congresswoman Barragan for being a  champion of this issue.   The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on our communities. Now, more than  ever, we must support minority academic institutions and the critical  research they conduct. Minority academic institutions can play a big  role in conducting critical research and helping us work to lessen the  health disparities minority communities face.   We must ensure schools, including the Morehouse College in my home  State of Georgia, are able to conduct their research without  disruption. Their efforts will better prepare all of us to respond to  the coronavirus and other health inequities more effectively.   I urge passage today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time today to let me speak on this  important legislation, and I thank Congresswoman Dean for introducing  it.   I am glad to be a lead Republican on this bill, as it corrects a  loophole in the Orphan Drug Act that has been and very well could be  taken advantage of at the expense of the American people's health.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for  drug manufacturers to invest in research to bring innovative drugs to  market that may not become profitable or that treat a small portion of  the population.   Unfortunately, a loophole exists that allows some drugs to obtain  market exclusivity even though they can easily recoup their R&D costs  and turn a profit. This exact problem took place in just the past few  years when a drug treating opioid abuse disorders got FDA approval-- orphan status--and a new 7-year exclusivity period, despite the active  ingredient remaining the same, all based on the drug's original 1994  orphan designation. This subsequently blocked a new, innovative opioid  abuse drug from coming to market during the opioid epidemic--a drug  that would help save lives.    The Orphan Drug Fairness Act would stop some drugs from obtaining  exclusivity, in turn allowing more competition and innovation in the  marketplace, benefiting consumers' health and lowering costs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 6435, because  of the positive impact it will have on the American people.  [[Page H5833]]    It has been no surprise that we have seen a rise in fraud and  criminal activity as the Nation grapples with the pandemic response. In  these difficult times, scammers have sought to take advantage of our  fellow Americans. Whether it is elderly individuals being preyed upon  by financial scammers or people ordering fake health products, there  has been a number of scams facing our constituents.   That is why I introduced the Combating Pandemic Scams Act with my  good friend, Congresswoman Kuster, to address this issue.   This bill would direct the FTC, along with other Federal partners, to  disseminate information about these scams to the public to better  protect themselves. That information would be user-friendly, ensuring  vulnerable populations, such as senior citizens and those with  disabilities, would have the same amount of access. Ensuring people  have the most up-to-date information on how to protect themselves is  critical to getting through these trying times.   Federal agencies, such as the FTC, have been very active in going  after these offenders who have targeted Americans during this pandemic.  This bill will support those Federal efforts and help prepare Americans  to help protect themselves from these scams.   The bottom line is, this is commonsense legislation to go after the  people preying on our neighbors and communities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their bipartisan support of  this legislation and the committee staff for their work on getting this  across the finish line.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation.                                time  1445
