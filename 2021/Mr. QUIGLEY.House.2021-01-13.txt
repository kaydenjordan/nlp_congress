 Madam Speaker, now we hear talk of the President's  notion of a peaceful transfer of power.   Which apparently means what? Minimal casualties?   Now we hear talk of healing after the criminal acts are completed.   Never, as a criminal defense attorney, did I say: Judge, yeah, my guy  completed the armed robbery, but let's heal now.   No. There was accountability. There was accountability then, there  should be accountability now, and there should be impeachment now.
