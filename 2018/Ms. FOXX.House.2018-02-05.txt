 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the 242 athletes  who made the 2018 United States Winter Olympic team. This is the  largest delegation of athletes from any nation attending the Winter  Olympic Games in history.   While reviewing the roster, I was pleased to see that the world will  get to know something I have known for a long time: North Carolinians  are strong competitors, three of whom I would like to salute.   I offer my well wishes and congratulations to Heather Bergsma of High  Point, North Carolina, who will compete in long track speed skating;  Kimani Griffin from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who will compete in  long track speed skating; and Bobby Sanguinetti from Wilmington, North  Carolina, who will compete in ice hockey.   The Olympic Games remain one of the only avenues in which the world's  community may come together despite resounding differences. I wish  these North Carolinians the very best as they compete on the world  stage, along with their fellow United States athletes, and will look  forward to cheering all of them on.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce very much for his help  on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak in support of the War Crimes Rewards  Expansion Act, introduced by my good friend Eliot Engel and me. It is  another excellent example today of bipartisanship here in the House.   As Chairman Royce said, this bill expands and reforms the War Crimes  Rewards Program, which provides bounties for perpetrators of the  world's worst human rights abusers.   The current program authorizes these rewards only for the purposes of  prosecutions in international tribunals. While experts can attest to  the necessity of international tribunals or mixed court tribunals in  limited circumstances, the program fails to offer  [[Page H761]]  the same advantages and incentives to prosecutions in national  jurisdictions using national courts.   There is already broad consensus that prosecuting perpetrators of  atrocities like the genocide that plagues religious minorities at the  hands of ISIS has the greatest impact when the prosecutions are  conducted within the society in which the crimes occurred.   When governments can keep these prosecutions within national  jurisdictions, witnesses have easier access to courts, public awareness  of these brutal atrocities is maximized, and parties will more likely  understand domestic laws. Furthermore, domestic trials are often  cheaper, quicker, and less resource intensive, meaning more resources  can be devoted to items like discovery and analysis.   Congress has already attested to the threat that these crimes posed  to U.S. interests, including the heavy price tag in the forms of  regional instability, refugee flows, economic losses, and  reconstruction costs.   A related program, the Rewards for Justice Program, authorizes  similar bounties for terrorists wanted by the United States for  violations of United States law, most famously, the one that was placed  upon Osama bin Ladin. The bounties have led to the disruption of  terrorist activities, but also to the prosecution of terrorists like  Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade  Center.   Our bill would bring the War Crimes Rewards Program into conformity  with that standard by explicitly listing violations of U.S. law as a  basis for issuing the reward, not just the conviction by an  international tribunal. It would also allow the U.S. to work with our  allies to issue joint rewards, another provision in the terrorism  authorization that the human rights provision lacks.   This bill will leave important safeguards already incorporated into  the current program in place. These safeguards include the  ineligibility of government officials, consultation with the Attorney  General, and congressional notification of the awards.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, national governments are sovereign, and the  U.S. Government shouldn't be neglecting their proper role by offering  this tool solely to tribunals. Currently, there are efforts to  encourage the prosecution of ISIS perpetrators of rape and genocide  against Yazidis in national courts using domestic laws that provide for  such prosecutions. This bill would make it clear that the U.S.  Government should also be encouraging such efforts.   The genocide by ISIS fighters in the Middle East; war crimes  perpetrated by Syria's brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad; and the North  Korean regime's crimes against its own people must all be opposed by  the United States. It is my hope that the passage of this bill will  send the signal that these brutal atrocities and the cowards who  perpetrate them will be hunted down and punished with all means  possible.   I thank my good friend and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Eliot Engel, for his role as the lead Democrat cosponsor of  this bipartisan legislation. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for bringing  this to the floor. Lastly, I thank the committee staff for their  thoughtful contributions and assistance.
