 Madam Speaker, many of us in this Chamber have young  children. For us, today's vote comes down to simple questions: Can you  as a mom or dad imagine getting a call that your child's school was  locked down because of an active shooter? Can you imagine standing  helplessly behind a police line as gunshots are fired near your  daughter's classroom? Can you imagine having to identify the  unrecognizable body of your missing baby boy by his favorite shoes? Can  you imagine standing in line for a DNA test praying to God that it does  not come back a match?   I ask those questions because that is what 19 families in Uvalde just  had to do. That is their reality and it has been the reality for 14  families in Parkland, 20 families in Sandy Hook, 12 families in  Columbine, and the list goes on.   If you imagine that reality, then do today what should have been done  25 years ago. Pass the legislation so no parent in America ever  experiences this horrific reality again. Our children are counting on  us and they are watching.
