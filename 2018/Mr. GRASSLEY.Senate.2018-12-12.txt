 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, as the 115th Congress winds down, I  would like to reflect on the enactment of the historic tax legislation,  which passed last year, and what is ahead for us in the new year.   In December of 2017, Congress passed, and the President signed into  law, the most comprehensive reforms to the Nation's tax laws in more  than three decades.   For years, both sides of the aisle have talked about the need for tax  reform that would provide tax simplification, tax fairness, and  increase America's economic competitiveness. With the enactment of the  law called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we finally made all three of  those goals a reality.   Significant simplification was achieved for individuals by nearly  doubling the standard deduction. This means people will be able to pay  less and avoid the tedious task of itemizing their taxes. Overall,  roughly 90 percent of taxpayers will file their taxes by simply taking  the standard deduction.   Moreover, thanks to a significantly higher alternative minimum tax,  which we refer to as the AMT exemption, millions of middle-class  taxpayers will no longer be faced with figuring out their tax liability  two times: one time to calculate their regular tax liability and the  second time to calculate their tax liability under the alternative  minimum tax.  [[Page S7475]]    It also provided tax fairness by reducing taxes across every income  group. In fact, middle-income families experienced the largest tax cut  by percentage.   Additionally, the reforms made the Tax Code more progressive, with  taxpayers earning more than $1 million shouldering a larger share of  the tax burden than they did under the previous law. In addition to  nearly doubling the standard deduction, tax relief was targeted at  middle-class families by doubling the child tax credit from $1,000 to  $2,000 per child.   It also reduced the previous 15 percent tax bracket to 12 percent and  the 25 percent tax bracket to 22 percent. As a result, a typical family  of four earning $59,000 a year will see a tax cut of more than $1,600  in the year 2018.   A key motivation for tax reform was to boost economic growth and  increase America's global competitiveness. America's Tax Code should  favor American jobs, American workers, and American businesses. That  means leveling the playing field so that we are not put at an economic  disadvantage with other countries competing with us, so the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act brought the corporate and international tax systems into  the 21st century. You can tell it is already working because other  countries are looking at lowering their tax rates to compete with us.   Of course, what we did included lowering the corporate tax rate from  35 down to 21 percent. In one fell swoop, we went from a tax rate that  was the highest in the developed world to below the world's average of  23 percent. How can you be competitive if you are a country at 35  percent and the average is 23 percent? This means global corporations  will be more inclined to create jobs here, rather than in other  countries.   We also modernized America's international tax system. We were one of  the very last major countries to tax businesses on a worldwide basis.  By moving toward a more territorial system, we freed up more than $2  trillion for investment here at home that American companies were  holding offshore.   These changes to the international tax rules don't just help U.S.  companies that operate globally to compete in the worldwide  marketplace, but they also help those companies grow their businesses  here at home with more jobs, better wages, and increased investment.   Just as important, we worked to ensure that small businesses and  pass-through entities received more equitable treatment compared to  what a corporation gets. We have a new 20-percent qualified business  deduction benefiting pass-through businesses of all sizes, down to the  smallest family farmer or corner bakery. Enhanced expensing rules were  included to help all businesses, spurring investments in new equipment  and machinery.   Our efforts have contributed to a strong and growing economy. The  unemployment rate is at a half-century low; wages are rising at the  fastest rate in nearly a decade; and workers, employers, and small  business owners are all very optimistic about the future--more  optimistic than for a long, long time. America is working again.   As we look forward to a new year in 2019, with a new Congress and a  new majority in the House, it is my hope that we can work in a  bipartisan way to build upon this economic success I just described. I  will be doing my part as the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance  Committee, and I see plenty--plenty--of opportunity.   Unfortunately, I hear increasing calls from the incoming House  majority pledging to erase the progress made with the tax cuts and tax  reforms I have just outlined.   The proof of tax reform's success is in today's economy. It is  obvious to most people that it is in the best shape it has been in for  a long time. Why would we want to go backward--toward stagnation,  pessimism, and, obviously, joblessness?   Of course, no major piece of legislation is perfect. To the extent  that there are legitimate efforts to perfect the law, then I want  people to know that I am all ears. But to the extent that these efforts  would undermine the strength of the American economy for the sake of  ideology--and that ideology would be hiking taxes and undoing important  reforms to modernize the tax system and increase America's global  competitiveness--then they will be met with stiff opposition from this  Senator.   Instead of playing politics, we should be focused on examining how  the law is affecting individuals, families, and businesses in our  respective States and districts. Where necessary, we should work  together to take action and ensure the law is fulfilling its full  potential.   We should also work toward providing tax certainty for individuals  and small businesses. This would include making permanent marginal tax  rate cuts for individuals and families, making permanent the doubling  of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, also making permanent  the innovative 20 percent deduction for small businesses to provide the  certainty that is needed to make investment and to encourage that  investment and also to encourage hiring decisions and, lastly, the  ability of businesses to recover the cost of investment in property and  equipment faster.   I hope my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in these  efforts. I have yet to hear a good reason why we shouldn't make these  and other tax relief measures permanent. It is the right thing to do  for the economy, the right thing to do for job creation, and the right  thing to do for wage growth.   I also wish to see us continue working on other important issues we  started in this Congress. This includes improving retirement savings,  bringing the IRS into the 21st century, protecting taxpayer rights,  enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, and encouraging  research, development, and innovation.   I also hope there will be plenty of opportunity to work on a  bipartisan basis on tax issues involving everything from education to  renewable and alternative energy, to consumer-directed healthcare  options. I have heard a lot about the desire of the new House majority  to engage in oversight of the current administration.   I will put my record of oversight up against anyone's record.  However, I want my colleagues to know I do not intend to engage in  political fishing expeditions. I think a person like me who has had an  equal opportunity approach to oversight--treating Republican  administrations the same as Democratic administrations--speaks for  itself.   I will not go along with efforts to weaponize the authority of tax- writing committees to access tax returns for political purposes. Such  an action would be unprecedented, but if Democrats are interested in  doing nonpartisan, good government oversight, count me in.   I hope they will join me in my efforts to hold the IRS accountable to  the taxpayers; ensure the nonprofit sector is living up to the purposes  of its tax-exempt status; that they will also help me stand up for tax  whistleblowers who expose tax cheats; and track down, expose, and  address tax shelters.   My hope is, in the new Congress, we will be able to work to address  important tax matters in a bipartisan fashion. I am proud of my strong  record of bipartisanship on the Finance and Judiciary Committees. I  intend to continue my good working relationships with my colleagues  across the aisle and hope to forge a few new ones, not only in the  Senate but also with the new majority in the House of Representatives.   Senator Wyden, who will be the ranking Democrat on the Finance  Committee, and I have had a good working relationship on so many  different issues over a long period of time, and I think we will be  able to work together as well. We have already started communication  along that line.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, when we set out to update and reform our  criminal justice system, we sought the expertise from a broad range of  stakeholders and advocates. Our focus has always been to reduce crime  and recidivism and improve fairness in a way that promotes safety and  respect for the law. We could not have done this without the essential  input from a number of key law enforcement organizations that partnered  with us in this endeavor.   The Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of  Chiefs of Police, and National Organization of Black Law Enforcement  Executives played a formative role in the updated text we released  earlier today. Their continued leadership and good faith engagement  have cut a path forward on a once-in-a-generation chance to improve  American justice. I would also like to thank the National District  Attorneys Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, and  Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, who gave  valuable input on this bill. Their engagement offered important law  enforcement perspective in the initial stages of our work.   While some groups have chosen to stay on the sidelines or even  undermine our work, these organizations have provided us with critical  feedback needed to refine and strengthen the First Step Act. They have  helped to advance law enforcement priorities and the goals of reform.   With President Trump's continued leadership, the wealth of input from  voices across the political spectrum, and Senator McConnell's work in  bringing this up for a vote, I look forward to getting this bill signed  into law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
