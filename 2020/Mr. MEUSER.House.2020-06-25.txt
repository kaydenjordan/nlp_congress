 Mr. Speaker, what started as a tragedy, then turned  disturbingly into our streets, resulted  [[Page H2507]]  with tonight's vote with a partisan bill to nowhere.   The people we have been elected to serve have asked--in fact,  demanded--that this Congress do something to calm the unrest in our  communities. Congress was asked to lead. Instead, this House has  decided to bring forth another partisan bill to nowhere.   Senator Tim Scott and others worked tirelessly in an inclusionary  matter and developed the JUSTICE Act, a bill that would bring law and  order and justice to communities.   This bill will not become law. This bill that has been passed in the  House will not become law because it was not inclusionary and would not  reform the police. But by eliminating qualified immunity and no-knock  warrants, it would put people and police into dangerous and costly  scenarios.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is another lost opportunity to serve the  people we serve.                            ____________________
