 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivor Protection Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.  [[Page H2628]]     Mr. Speaker, is it not true that under the Born-Alive  Abortion Protection Act that infant survivors of abortion would receive  lifesaving medical care?    Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, does an infant survivor of an abortion not  deserve the same care as other living human beings?    One more parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Will the Chair entertain a unanimous consent request to  enter into the Record comments from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam  about infanticide?    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot be  entertained on H.R. 962, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to  immediately schedule the Born-Alive bill so we can stand up and protect  the sanctity of human life.
