 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I, too, stand in strong support of this legislation.   A recent poll out by Ernst & Young showed that millennials are  starting businesses at a rate that is only one-third of prior  generations. When asked why they are not starting businesses, those  millennials responded that they have insufficient financial means in  order to start businesses, despite a deep desire and will to start  businesses. Over 78 percent said that they wanted to start a small  business eventually, but they had insufficient means to do so. This  bill starts to rectify that problem.   Those millennials could go to expensive and fancy investment bankers,  but that is prohibitively expensive. Who they are going to turn to are  their friends and family, those who most believe not only in the  product, but in themselves.   I want to see us enable small businesses to get started back home.  That is what I continue to hear as I go door to door in the district  and as I talk to people. They want to be in control of their financial  future. They want to have all of the opportunities that were afforded  to their parents and their grandparents.   This bill begins to push back against a regulatory environment that  has for too long smothered opportunity in Indiana in favor of more  opportunity in D.C. We must rectify that. This legislation goes a long  way towards that.   I am supportive of the legislation, supportive of small businesses  back home, and supportive of the many Hoosiers who want to start small  businesses.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.
