 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment and the underlying  legislative effort that would lower the cost of prescription drugs,  crack down on junk insurance plans being encouraged by the Trump  administration, and reverse the administration's irresponsible sabotage  of the Affordable Care Act.   Specifically, my amendment would require the HHS Secretary to conduct  educational outreach to communities with high health disparities and  would thereby expand outreach efforts to increase coverage among  African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, low-income families, and  rural communities.   Our effort to help more Americans get access to affordable healthcare  comes just as we are seeing the impact of the Trump administration's  effort to undermine our healthcare system.   This week, we learned that more than 1 million Americans lost their  health insurance in the past year, and the number of Americans in high- deductible plans reached an all-time high.   Black and Latino Americans and families living at or near the poverty  line are particularly impacted by President Trump's sabotage. These  communities are the most at risk of being uninsured, and these  communities have always faced the greatest barriers to obtaining care  and have reported the poorest health outcomes.                                time  1700    Before the Trump administration, we saw large gains in coverage for  low-income individuals and people of color under the Affordable Care  Act.   Finally having that health insurance made a key difference in  determining when people got care, where they got their care, and,  ultimately, how healthy they could be. However, this progress has been  rapidly reversed over the last 2 years.   My amendment would ensure that we aren't leaving behind those with  predictably poor health outcomes, like those with lower life expectancy  or children born with lower birthweight.   Families in high-disparity areas suffer from low levels of  healthcare, literacy, language barriers, and limited awareness of the  Affordable Care Act's coverage options.   In this uncertain environment, in our complicated healthcare system,  in this constant fight for access to healthcare in this country,  knowledge is half the battle.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. Help  all Americans attain the knowledge they need and win their healthcare  battles.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time  is remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
