 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, first, let me say that the previous question and the  rule should be defeated not just because it is designed to undo the  protections that help the American people but because voting for this  will prevent Congress, this Chamber, this body from clearly rejecting  some of the White House's worst behavior.   Just over a week ago, the White House issued a statement on  International Holocaust Remembrance Day. That statement failed to  mention that 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust. It  never mentioned them.   It is deeply troubling because the United States has, until now, been  at the forefront of the fight against efforts that would deny the  extent of Jewish suffering and death during the Holocaust. And yes,  there are still many deniers of the Holocaust who traffic in conspiracy  and claim the whole thing never happened.   It should be a shocking omission coming from the White House, but,  frankly, not all that surprising for an administration based on a  campaign that trafficked in anti-Semitism.   But you know what? I thought to myself: maybe they will fix the  statement; maybe this is all a misunderstanding, an accident. But no,  they didn't fix it. They doubled down and they defended it. Not only  that, we found out that the White House purposely took out the language  stating that Jews died in the Holocaust. So it was not an error. It was  purposeful from beginning to end.   Now, I know this: the White House thinks it is living in a post- factual world. They think that they can get away with saying anything  they like and anything they want and that people will just believe it.  But the truth is, what they say has very, very real consequences.   Even after our parents and grandparents, the Greatest Generation,  fought and worked so hard to defeat Nazism, now we see a public dinner  party held right here in this city where people were doing the Nazi  salute.   Even after there has been so much work to stop targeting religions,  now we are seeing a resurgence of swastikas across the country and  around the world.   Even after law enforcement has worked hard to protect our people, now  there is a wave of bomb threats against synagogues.   This is what is happening. This is fact. Frankly, those now feeling  emboldened were inspired by the President, first in his campaign and  now in his Presidency.   We all know that one of the President's members of his National  Security Council led a website that fosters extremist views. So don't  count me amongst the surprised when the White House issues a statement  like this, but don't expect me to accept it either. None of us,  Democrat nor Republican, should accept it.   So I urge my colleagues to vote against this previous question,  against this rule, to allow consideration of a resolution that states  this Congress' clear position against Holocaust deniers. We need to  restate the truth as clearly as we can.   The White House was wrong on this issue, and here are some more  facts. Yes, the Holocaust happened. No, the Jewish people weren't  simply another group of people in a long list of targets. The Holocaust  was designed to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Earth.  Other groups of people were targeted and killed, but anti-Semitism was  at the core of the Nazi ideology of a Final Solution.   As the late Nobel Peace Prize recipient Elie Wiesel said, while  receiving the Congressional Gold Medal from President Ronald Reagan:  ``It is true that not all victims were Jews, but all the Jews were  victims.''   I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this  measure so that we can, in a bipartisan way, express the truth. If  people aren't going to tell the truth about this then we are all lost.    Truthfully, I found the White House statement to be shameful. It  needs to stop, and it needs to stop now. This is your chance to lend  your voice to the record. Will you stand with me? Will you stand  against Jewish Holocaust deniers? Don't be enablers. This is your  opportunity. There may not be another to repudiate what the White House  has done.   Vote ``no'' on this previous question and vote ``no'' on this rule.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.
