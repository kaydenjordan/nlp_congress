 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to address a grave concern  about our relationship with Brazil. This nation, which holds non-NATO  ally status with the United States, has constantly undermined us in  recent years in ways that warrant our undivided attention.   Just recently, the former convicted criminal and now reinstated  President of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, hosted  and praised the infamous dictator Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela.   Lula's actions have legitimized a man who is currently sought by the  U.S. Department of Justice for narcoterrorism, a man who, because of  his alleged humanitarian crimes, cannot even set foot on U.S. soil  without fear of arrest. In addition, Lula has publicly criticized the  United States for support to Ukraine and has even suggested that our  Nation is purposely prolonging the war for commercial interests.   This is the same leader who has actively sought to undermine U.S.  currency through their BRICS agreements with Russia and China and who  maintains strong ties with the Chinese Communist Party.   Madam Speaker, Brazil is not a minority player on the world stage. It  is the largest economy in South America and the 10th largest globally,  the 4th largest food producer in the world, the 2nd largest producer of  iron ore, and a significant player in the energy sector. It holds  strategic importance in the Southern Hemisphere, a fact that the CCP  seems to understand better than us.   We should be working to forge stronger ties with Brazil, encouraging  it toward democratic and capitalist values rather than standing by as  it deepens its ties with communistic and autocratic regimes around the  globe.   Brazil's growing alignment with the Chinese authoritarian government  is already yielding dangerous impacts on its democracy. Even mainstream  USA media outlets' reports are showing an unsettling trend: a rise in  state-sanctioned actions against free speech, free press, and civil  liberties in Brazil. Increasingly, the country's judicial system is  being weaponized, and censorship is on the rise.   We must take decisive action to condemn Brazil's current engagement  in suppressing civil liberties, its deepening ties with authoritarian  regimes, and the serious risk this trend poses to Western democracies.   Madam Speaker, as the first Brazilian American elected to this House,  I implore all my colleagues to treat this matter with the urgency it  deserves. It is a matter that affects not only America but the free  world as a whole.                            ____________________
