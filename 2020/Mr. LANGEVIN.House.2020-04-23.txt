 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the Paycheck Protection Program and  Health Care Enhancement Act.   COVID-19 is a crisis with few parallels in world history. Yet I have  been amazed by the resilience of my fellow Rhode Islanders: the  tenacity of our small businesses and the dedication and bravery of our  frontline healthcare workers.   This bill is for them. It refills the coffers of the Paycheck  Protection Program, which is a vital lifeline for so many small  businesses. Thanks to House Democrats' efforts, it backstops our  hospitals, community health centers, and nursing homes and funds the  nationwide testing strategy.   This cannot be the end of the work of Congress to help Americans  weather the storm, but it is another vital step as we confront this  crisis.
