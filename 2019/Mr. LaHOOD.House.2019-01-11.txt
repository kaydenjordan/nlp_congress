 Madam Speaker, on November 29, 2018, Deputy U.S. Marshal  Chase White was senselessly killed in the line of duty while serving a  warrant in Tucson, Arizona.   Born and raised in Peoria, Illinois, Chase led a life committed to  serving his community and his country. Known as a leader amongst his  peers, Chase entered the Air Force following graduation from the  University of Illinois and served Active Duty from 2000 to 2007. He was  set to leave for deployment as a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force  Reserves the same week he was tragically murdered.   A loving father of four, his mother, Reverend Lynnda White of  Peoria's Universalist Unitarian Church, described him as a ``hero'' to  his children ``because his family was his life.''   This week, we recognized National Law Enforcement Appreciation. While  we take one day to celebrate the service of those who protect our  communities, it is important we never forget the brave men and women,  like Chase, who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.   Each day, law enforcement officers leave their families with no  certainty they will return home safe, yet they are willing to face  these risks to keep their communities safe. I am grateful for the  courageous men and women, like Chase, who button up their uniform each  day, and we thank them for protecting our families so bravely.   Madam Speaker, at this time, I would ask for a moment of silence for  Chase White                            ____________________
