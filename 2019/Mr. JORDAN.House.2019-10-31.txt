 Madam Speaker, trying to put a ribbon on a sham process  doesn't make it any less of a sham. Never forget how this whole thing  started.   Democrats are trying to impeach the President of the United States 13  months before an election based on an anonymous whistleblower with no  firsthand knowledge, who has a bias against the President and who  worked with Vice President Biden.   The day after the now famous phone call between President Trump and  President Zelensky, the so-called whistleblower gets a readout from  somebody on that call, writes a memo. In the memo, he uses terms like  ``this call was scary,'' ``frightening.''   But what does he do? He waits 18 days before he files a complaint.   And who is the first person he goes to see, the first people he goes  to see in that 18-day timeframe? Chairman Schiff's staff. Chairman  Schiff's staff.  [[Page H8687]]    Madam Speaker, 435 Members of Congress and only one individual, one  Member of this body, knows who this person is who started this whole  darn crazy process: Chairman Schiff.   And what does this resolution do? It gives him even more power to run  this secret proceeding in a bunker in the basement of the Capitol.                                time  0945    This resolution continues the unfair and partisan process. Just 2  days ago, 2 days ago, we were prevented from having the witness answer  our questions in one of these depositions. And this resolution is going  to give more power to the person who made that decision in the bunker  in the basement of the Capitol.   We have less than 13 months before the next election. Americans  understand that this is unfair. Americans get fairness. They  instinctively know this is an unfair and partisan process. They will  see how unfair and partisan it is today when the vote happens on the  floor of this House. We can do a lot better than this. We can do a lot  better than this, and the American people see through it.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, and I thank the gentleman on  the Rules Committee for his work and his leadership.
