 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize September as National Recovery Month.   It is important that we draw attention to this special month as we  continue to battle the ongoing addiction epidemic in our country.   For 32 years, National Recovery Month has continued to celebrate the  gains made by those in recovery as well as promote and support new  evidence-based treatment and recovery practices. It is also a time to  focus on raising awareness and understanding of mental health and  substance use disorders.   Over the past month, many of my colleagues have sported purple  ribbons to show our support for those in recovery.   Currently, over 23 million Americans are in recovery from an  addiction to drugs or alcohol. By recognizing National Recovery Month,  we can highlight the strength of the recovery community and show  support to our healthcare workers, first responders, friends, family,  and community who support those in recovery.   Addiction to alcohol or other substances like opioids is an ongoing  epidemic plaguing communities across the Nation. We know addiction does  not discriminate. It can happen to anyone, regardless of race, gender,  or socioeconomic status.   That is why this year's National Recovery Month theme is ``Recovery  for Everyone: Every Person, Every Family, Every Community.''   As we continue to battle the addiction epidemic, we must highlight  the work of organizations like Faces and Voices of Recovery that  promote National Recovery Month and continue to provide resources to  those in recovery as well as friends and family.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, there were more than 5,200 deaths  due to drug overdoses this past year. These numbers continue to be  highly alarming, and we must continue to work to combat this epidemic.   No one can tackle addiction on their own, and by recognizing National  Recovery Month, we are showing there is light at the end of the tunnel,  and with the right support, there is a road to recovery.   Throughout the month of September, Faces and Voices of Recovery  encourages local communities to host events to highlight the services  available for those in need.   Last week, Venango County Human Services celebrated National Recovery  Month at Franklin's Bandstand Park. This event had family-friendly  activities, where those who participated could win prizes, enjoy  refreshments, and pin a ribbon on the recovery board. The event  celebrated community members, first responders, healthcare workers, and  others who support recovery. Local vendors were encouraged to set up  tables to share information about their programs. The evening ended in  a candlelight vigil, remembering those who had passed due to their  addiction.   By engaging our local communities, we can continue to make recovery  and those who support it possible. We can work together to change the  way addiction and recovery are understood, to better support those who  are struggling.   As September ends, let's continue to elevate the organizations that  provide resources and support to those recovering from addiction.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the State College Area Meals on Wheels as they celebrate 50  years of service and 1.5 million meals delivered.   State College Meals on Wheels prepares and delivers meals to the  elderly and those people living with disabilities within the State  College school district.   What originally started as a small vision serving under 30 clients  has now blossomed into eight separate delivery routes, averaging 250  clients a year.   When our world came to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic, Meals on  Wheels stepped up. The organization didn't miss a single delivery  during the pandemic. They even picked up a few more clients who were  adversely affected.   Like many, Meals on Wheels had to adapt to the pandemic. A key aspect  of the meal delivery was the frequent in-person conversations with the  clients. When COVID-19 prevented the face-to-face chatting, they  changed their services to provide regular phone calls to catch up with  their clients.   Madam Speaker, State College Meals on Wheels is a staple in our  community, and I congratulate them on 50 years and 1.5 million meals  delivered.                            ____________________
