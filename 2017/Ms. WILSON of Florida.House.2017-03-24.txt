 Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by asking  my Republican colleagues one simple question: Don't you have  constituents who get sick and need insurance?   Everyone gets sick, rich and poor, Black and White, men, women, and  children.   Having insurance gives us peace of mind. It helps ensure that a  medical crisis is not exacerbated by a financial crisis. It often makes  a difference between life and death. If the Affordable Care Act is  repealed, your constituents and millions of people will be kicked off  the insurance roll, and that is a shame. They will suffer, and their  families will suffer.   I have health insurance, and so does every Member of Congress. We  even have a clinic and doctors at our disposal right here in this  Capitol.   Doesn't every American deserve the same treatment as Members of  Congress?   Instead of moving backwards, Republicans should partner with  Democrats to amend and strengthen the existing law. By working  together, we can create a plan that works for all Americans, not just  the Members of Congress. Vote ``no.'' Vote ``no.''
