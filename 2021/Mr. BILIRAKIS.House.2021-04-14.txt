 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 941, the Timely  Reauthorization of Necessary Stem-Cell Programs Lends Access to Needed  Therapies Act, or the TRANSPLANT Act.   As co-chair of the Blood Cancers Caucus, I urge my colleagues to  support the TRANSPLANT Act. This bill is about providing hope to those  who are struggling with life-threatening illnesses. The TRANSPLANT Act  reauthorizes the C.W. Bill Young Transplant Program, in addition to the  National Cord Blood Inventory Program.   I remember Bill Young, Chairman Young, a great friend of ours, and he  said that this was one of his greatest accomplishments. I also know  that Chris Smith, who will be speaking later, was also involved in  this. He has been a champion on this issue, Mr. Speaker. So I  appreciate both of them.   This Federal program provides critical support in the advancement of  research for better treatments and the infrastructure necessary to  organize registries, which will help ensure transplant patients have  access to lifesaving procedures. Simply put, its continued  reauthorization is vital for patients with diseases like blood cancer,  sickle cell anemia, and inherited metabolic or immune system disorders.   I sincerely appreciate the work of my friend and colleague and fellow  Blood Cancers Caucus co-chair, Congresswoman Matsui, in addition to the  legacy of bipartisan leadership and support of these programs by  Members like, as I said, Chris Smith.   I thank the chairman, as well and the ranking member, for placing  this particular bill on the agenda. I know it will get through the  Senate this time.   Additionally, I appreciate the critical daily work of the National  Marrow Donor Program, operating the Be the Match national registry,  connecting patients in search of a cure with lifesaving bone marrow  donors, even in the midst of this historic pandemic.   I would also like to take a moment to recognize the great work of Dr.  Joanne Kurtzberg, the president of the Cord Blood Association. She also  serves in multiple roles at Duke University, including the director of  Carolinas Cord Blood Bank. Dr. Kurtzberg has dedicated her professional  career to cord blood research, banking, and transplantation; and she is  an internationally recognized umbilical cord blood transplanter. She  advised Congress on the creation of the public cord blood banking  program, which was part of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act  of 2005. Dr. Kurtzberg continues to be a trusted adviser to Congress on  this important program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join us in expediting  passage of this lifesaving bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, this is a very important bill and needs  to pass as soon as possible. I really appreciate the chairman placing  the bill on the agenda. I urge the Senate to pass it as soon as  possible, and, of course, my colleagues today, if we can pass this bill  immediately so we can get it to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 164, the Advancing  Education on Biosimilars Act.   This bill is a bipartisan companion to H.R. 1873, championed in the  House by Dr. Bucshon and Congressman Peters.   This bill would require the FDA to maintain and operate an internet  website to provide educational materials for healthcare providers,  patients, and caregivers on biological products, including biosimilar  products and interchangeable biosimilar products.   It also would require the Department of Health and Human Services,  HHS, to develop continuing education programs or to improve existing  programs for healthcare providers, such as doctors and nurses, to  promote a better understanding of biosimilar interchangeable products.   By increasing awareness about available biosimilar products and  providing educational resources for physicians  [[Page H1755]]  and patients about their benefits, we can increase adoption of these  lower cost alternative therapies when appropriate and drive down drug  costs for Americans across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan effort to lower drug  costs through the uptake of biosimilar products, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), a great member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee and a great resource for us nonphysicians.    Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote to pass this bill  so we can quickly make this law and get it to the President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 415, the Ensuring Innovation  Act. This legislation is the bipartisan companion to H.R. 1857 led by  Representatives Guthrie and Schrader.   This legislation would ensure that only the most innovative products  are eligible for certain market exclusivities and would increase the  availability of lower-cost generic drugs. Great work by these  Representatives.   Currently, the FDA grants 5 years of marketing exclusivity to drug  products determined to be a new chemical entity. Clarifying what  qualifies as a new chemical entity will prevent drug manufacturers from  receiving exclusivity by making minor changes to existing drugs, which  would block generic competition from the market.   This important bipartisan legislation will help lower prescription  drug prices while preserving incentives to innovate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this great  bill. I commend my colleagues for focusing on this particular issue,  which is just so important to our constituents. Again, let's pass this  bill as soon as possible and get it to the President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1215, the Fraud  and Scam Reduction Act. I want to thank Representative Blunt Rochester,  my good friend Representative Walberg, and the other members of the  Energy and Commerce Committee for their tireless work on this important  bill.   H.R. 1215 would establish a senior scams prevention advisory council,  which will create model educational materials to inform employees of  retail companies and financial institutions on how to identify and  prevent scams.  [[Page H1758]]    This bill would work in concert with other recently enacted  legislation to provide Americans with the tools they need to educate  and protect themselves against these bad actors. It is a very good  bill, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. Walberg), my good  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to pass this bill and get  it to the President--actually, before that, we have to get it to the  Senate and pass it immediately to protect our seniors, particularly  during this very difficult time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1460, the Nicholas and  Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of 2021.   I thank Representatives Carter and Kuster, two great members of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce. I thank them for their work on this  important piece of legislation and for the many years they have served  and worked to protect consumers.   Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning  fuel, and most people know that. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon  monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious health  condition that could result in death, unfortunately.   Mr. Speaker, unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from motor  vehicles and the abnormal operation of fuel-burning appliances, such as  furnaces, water heaters, portable generators, and stoves kills more  than 400 people each year and sends more than 15,000 to hospital  emergency rooms for treatment.   This legislation would protect Americans from an otherwise  undetectable harm. This bipartisan bill represents a longstanding  commitment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce to protect America's  consumers, families, and children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this particular bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), my good friend.   Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate his perspective on the Committee on  Energy and Commerce as the only pharmacist on the committee. I thank  him for sponsoring this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.  It is a great bill, a good consumer protection bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 446, the Protecting  Seniors from Emergency Scams Act. I would like to thank Representative  Robin Kelly of the Energy and Commerce Committee for her bipartisan  work with Representative Troy Balderson to protect our constituents.   The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the lives of millions of Americans  upside down, unfortunately. We were all forced to isolate, sometimes  even away from our families and friends, to stay safe. Unfortunately,  it is during these times when bad actors aim to exploit the most  vulnerable. Promising fake lifesaving medication and stimulus checks,  scammers will stop at nothing to take advantage of others.   H.R. 446 would protect Americans, especially seniors, from malicious  and deceptive scams by augmenting the tools included in other recently  enacted legislation. As they have worked on legislation to fight  scammers, I have supported my colleagues' efforts to incorporate  provisions that encourage cooperation with law enforcement. I am  pleased to see such efforts continue in this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, of course, I urge my colleagues to pass this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson), the cosponsor of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1762, the Protecting  Indian Tribes from Scams Act. I want to thank Representative Mullin and  Representative O'Halleran for their work on this particular issue. This  bipartisan piece of legislation will help our Native nations.   One area that can be overlooked in Federal fraud prevention efforts,  Mr. Speaker, is scams targeting Indian Tribal members. The scope and  scale of scams that target Indian Tribes have not been well documented,  hindering efforts to prevent them.   This legislation would direct the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission,  to submit to Congress a report on unfair or deceptive acts or practices  targeting Indian Tribes.   Simply put, these scammers ruin lives, unfortunately. To address  these scams properly, we must educate all Americans on how to avoid  malicious scammers.   This legislation passed the House last Congress, and I am hopeful we  can again pass it today and get this legislation to become law as soon  as possible. I can't think of a better person to sponsor this than my  good friend, Mr. Mullin.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1766, the FTC  Collaboration Act.   As bad actors and scammers continue their efforts to take advantage  of American consumers, we must not back down when it comes to ensuring  the safety of our constituents and authenticity of consumer products.  The FTC Collaboration Act directs the Federal Trade Commission to  examine how it can work better with State attorneys general to prevent,  publicize, and penalize scams in the United States.   This legislation would require the FTC to submit a report to Congress  on how to enhance collaboration with State law enforcement. I remain  confident this can help in other agenda items we can work together on  in this particular session. It is so important that we work together  with our colleagues on the State level.   I am proud of the important steps this bill takes to keep consumers  safe and, importantly, prioritize our most vulnerable during COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. In closing, I ask my  colleagues to support this very important bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1002, the Debarment  Enforcement of Bad Actor Registrants, or the DEBAR Act, which was  introduced by my very good friend, Mr. Latta.   This provision would give the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA,  debarment authority to prohibit a person who has repeatedly violated  the Controlled Substances Act from receiving a registration to  manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance.   It makes a lot of sense. A recent Department of Justice Office of the  Inspector General report found that when  [[Page H1764]]  certain bad actor registrants have their registration revoked, they can  reapply for registration the very next day. Registrants who pose a  significant risk of diverting drugs could be given the opportunity to  do so once again.   We have to stop this. That is why this legislation is so vital.   Repeat offenders should not be allowed to get a new registration from  the DEA just days after their previous registration was revoked because  they broke the law. Limited debarment authority is a commonsense and  effective administrative tool to address diversion, fraud, and  misconduct.   I strongly support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this good bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, which was  introduced by Representative Griffith.   In order to prevent people who have not been vetted by authorities in  dispensing controlled substances, this bill would clarify that the  transfer of any controlled substance registration without written  consent from the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, is prohibited.   A 2018 Energy and Commerce Committee report, which summarized the  committee's bipartisan investigation into the distribution of  prescription opioids by wholesale drug distributors, and the DEA's  subsequent enforcement practices found that an opioid distributor and  its pharmacy customer did not go through the appropriate process of  transferring a registration to a new pharmacy owner.   Failing to contact the DEA appropriately and to verify whether the  agency approved the transfer of a registration to dispense controlled  substances creates a serious risk that could lead to drug diversion.   Madam Speaker, of course, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).                                time  1415     Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this very good bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.
