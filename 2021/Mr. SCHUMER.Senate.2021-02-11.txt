 Mr. President, for the information of Senators, it is my  understanding the schedule today will be similar to yesterday's  proceedings.   We will plan to take a short break every 2, 3 hours, and we will  accommodate a 30-minute recess for dinner, assuming it is needed.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 47,  the managers for the House of Representatives have 8 hours remaining to  make the presentation of their case.   The Senate will now hear you, and the Presiding Officer recognizes  Mr. Manager Raskin to continue the presentation of the case for the  House of Representatives.                       Managers' Presentation--Resumed    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, thank you.   Distinguished Senators, Representative DeGette of Colorado will now  show how the insurrectionists themselves believed that they were  following President Trump's marching orders.   Ms. Manager DeGETTE. My friends and colleagues, yesterday was an  emotionally wrenching day. As I watched the footage of the violence in  the Capitol Building, my own experience flooded back to me. I was one  of the unlucky Members who was stuck in the House Gallery along with  Congresswoman Dean.   As the House floor was cleared beneath of us of Members and staff, we  could see the mob pounding on the door to the House Chamber. We could  see the Capitol Police officers inside the Chamber pull their guns and  point them at the intruders. Then we heard gunshots on the other side,  and we flung ourselves down on the floor and removed our Member pins.  Then we heard pounding on the very flimsy Gallery doors right up above  us. Finally, after that situation for some time, we were told to run  out of the door at the end of the Gallery.   As we ran through a line of police toward the staircase, this is what  I saw: the SWAT team pointing automatic weapons at marauders on the  floor. Looking at these people makes you wonder: Who sent them here?   In the next few minutes, I want to step back from the horrors of the  attack itself and look at January 6 from a totally different  perspective--the perspective of the insurrectionists themselves.   Their own statements before, during, and after the attack make clear  the attack was done for Donald Trump, at his instructions and to  fulfill his wishes. Donald Trump had sent them there.   They truly believed that the whole intrusion was at the President's  orders, and we know that because they said so. Many of them actually  posed for pictures, bragging about it on social media, and they tagged  Mr. Trump in tweets.   Folks, this was not a hidden crime. The President told them to be  there, and so they actually believed they would face no punishment.   The defense argued in their briefs, and they argued again here on  Tuesday that the insurrectionists were acting on their own, that they  were not incited by President Trump or acting at his direction. This is  in their brief:         They did so of their own accord and for their own reasons,       and are being criminally prosecuted.    But that is just not the case. It is not what the insurrectionists  actually said. They said they came here because the President  instructed them to do so.   Leading up to the attack, the insurrectionists said they were coming  to DC for President Trump. He invited them with clear instructions for  a specific time and place and with clear orders: Stop to fight--or to  fight to stop th certification in Congress by any means necessary.    The crowd at Donald Trump's speech echoed and chanted his words, and  when people in the crowd followed his  [[Page S646]]  direction and marched to the Capitol, they chanted the same words as  they breached this building.   Now, let's return to the speech for a moment. During the rally,  President Trump led the crowd in a ``Stop the steal'' chant. Here is  what that chant sounded like from the crowd's perspective:   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. (Inaudible.) And to use a favorite term       that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the       steal.        (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')        (People chanting: ``Stop the steal.'')    Soon after, the President basked as the crowd chanted, ``Fight for  Trump.'' And when he incited the crowd to show strength, people  responded: ``Storm the Capitol.'' ``Invade the Capitol.'' Here are both  of those moments but from the crowd's perspective:   (Video presentation of 1-6-20201.)         (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.'')        President TRUMP. Thank you.        Unidentified Speaker. Yes.        Unidentified Speaker. Invade the Capitol Building.    We also have another perspective from this moment, online extremist  chatter. At the same time as the people in the crowd shouted, ``Take  the Capitol Building,'' as President Trump said, ``Show strength,'' a  person posted to Parler saying:         Time to fight. Civil war is upon us.    Another user said:         We are going to have a civil war. Get ready!    An analysis found that members of ``Civil War'' quadrupled on Parler  in the hour after Donald Trump said, ``Show strength.''   When the insurrectionists got to the Capitol, they continued those  rally cries. Insurrectionists holding Confederate flags and brandishing  weapons cheered the President's very words:   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible.)        Unidentified Speaker. Fight. Fight. Come on, man.       (Inaudible.)        (People chanting. ``Stop the steal.'')    You heard them chanting ``Stop the steal,'' and as the crowd chanted  at the rally, the crowd at the Capitol made clear who they were doing  this for. They also chanted ``Fight for Trump.''   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.'')    And it wasn't just that they were doing this for Mr. Trump. They were  following his instructions. They said he had invited them, and, in  fact, as we heard, he had invited them.   As one man explained on a livestream he taped from inside the  Capitol, ``Our president wants us here. . . . We wait and take orders  from our president.''   Footage from inside the Capitol shows when the insurrectionists first  got into the building and confronted police, the mob screamed at the  officers that they were listening to President Trump.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Stand down. You're outnumbered.       There's a fucking million of us out there, and we are       listening to Trump, your boss.    The insurrectionists argued with law enforcement that they shouldn't  even be fighting them because they believed that the Commander in Chief  was ordering this. This was the person's understanding.   When President-Elect Biden went on television that day to demand an  end to the siege, one woman asked this:   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Does he not realize President Trump       called us to siege the place?    The examples of these types of comments are endless. Don't worry. I  won't play all of them. But it wasn't just the words of the  insurrectionists that proved that they did this in response to orders  from their Commander in Chief. We can see this in the fact that they  were not hiding.   One rioter, in a livestream at the Capitol said:         He'll be happy. We're fighting for Trump.    (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Let's call Trump, yes. Dude, dude,       let's tell Trump.        Unidentified Speaker. Trump would be very upset.        Unidentified Speaker. They'd be like, no. Just say we love       them. We love you, bro.        Unidentified Speaker. No, he'll be happy. What do you mean?       We're fighting for Trump.    And, again, this was not an isolated incident. The individuals in  this slide posted photos of themselves committing these crimes. Trump  supporters who had broken into the Capitol were taking selfies,  streaming live videos, and posing. In fact, they wanted the President  to know: ``This is me!'' In fact, you can see the person wrote on his  own posting: ``This is me!''   And if there were any remaining doubt, after hours of prompting, when  President Trump finally told the insurrectionists to go home, only then  did some of them begin to listen.   As you previously saw, at 4:17 p.m., Mr. Trump released a prerecorded  video saying to the mob:         Go home. We love you. You're very special.    Shortly after he tweeted this video, a few of the insurrectionists  who had seen it could be claiming victory--heard claiming victory--and  telling people to go home because of Donald Trump's message and  instructions.   You saw earlier the insurrectionist Jacob Chansley, who told someone:         We won the day.    A little before that video of Chansley, he said the same thing to the  crowd through a bullhorn and instructed them to go home because of the  video that President Trump had tweeted. Let's watch.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Today is ours, ladies and gentlemen.       We won the day. Today is ours. We won the day. That's right.       Donald Trump has asked everybody to just go home. You can       look it up on his Twitter. He just did a video. It's a minute       long. He asked everybody to go home.    Even after the attack, the insurrectionists made clear to law  enforcement that they were just following President Trump's orders.  They didn't shy away from their crimes because they thought they were  following orders from the Commander in Chief and so they would not be  punished.   They were wrong. After the attack, there were dozens of arrests.  These were Federal offenses, including assaulting the police. When law  enforcement interviewed the people who were at the Capitol on January  6, they, once again, said it was because the President told them to be  there.   Robert Sanford was seen in this widely circulated video throwing a  fire extinguisher that struck a Capitol Police officer outside the  building.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   A witness told the FBI that Sanford said he had traveled to  Washington, DC, on a bus with a group of people. The group had gone to  the White House and listened to Donald J. Trump's speech and then had  followed the President's instructions and gone to the Capitol.   Folks, the insurrectionists didn't just make this up. As Sanford's  lawyer explained:         You're being told, ``You gotta fight like hell.'' Does       ``fight like hell'' mean you throw things at people? Maybe.    The lawyer added that his client ``wouldn't have been there if it  wasn't for the president.''   Now, Sanford wasn't the exception; he was the rule. In their  statements after the attack, insurrectionists routinely echoed what  they had said before and during the attack: They were there because the  President told them to be.   Now, look, the lawyers who are saying that their clients were told to  commit these acts by Mr. Trump, well, they know that putting the blame  on the President doesn't exonerate their clients. They are just saying  it, frankly, because that is exactly what happened.   Another Trump supporter who has been federally charged is Texas real  estate agent Jennifer Ryan. Now, Ms. Ryan has given many TV interviews  in which she says she was only doing what the President asked her and  others to do. She also recorded video before the rally talking about  the mob's plans for violence, and here is what she said.   (Text of video presentation.)          I ask unanimous consent that the House stand in recess  for 15 minutes.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will stand in recess.    I ask unanimous consent that the House stand in recess  for 15 minutes--the Senate, the Senate.   There being no objection, at 2:10 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 2:45 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.                      Managers' Presentation--Continued    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will come to order.   Manager Raskin.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. Castro will now return to address the harm visited upon America's  national security by these events and the damage to our international  reputation.   Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. My colleagues discussed with you the  many harms to our Nation as a result of President Trump's conduct. Now  I would like to spend some time talking about the harm to our national  security and our standing in the world.   On January 6, when President Trump incited a mob to march to the  Capitol, he led them to a building that houses some of our Nation's  most sensitive information. Consider who was part of that mob. Some of  the individuals were on the FBI watch list. The past behavior of some  individuals led here by President Trump so alarmed investigators that  their names had been added to the national Terrorist Screening  Database, and at least one of the insurrectionists may have intended to  steal information and give it to a foreign adversary.   According to charging documents, Riley Williams allegedly helped  steal a laptop from Speaker Pelosi's office to ``send the computer  device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to  SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service.''   While we can't be certain if or how many foreign spies infiltrated  the crowd or at least coordinated with those who did, we can be sure  that any enemy who wanted access to our secrets would have wanted to be  part of that mob inside these halls.   The point is this: Many of the insurrectionists that President Trump  incited to invade this Chamber were dangerous--people on the FBI watch  list, violent extremists, White supremacists. And these  insurrectionists incited by President Trump threatened our national  security. Stealing laptops, again, from Speaker Pelosi's office; taking  documents from Leader McConnell's desk; snapping photographs, as you  saw in the videos earlier, in sensitive areas; ransacking your offices;  rifling through your desks.   The President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, knew the  risk of anyone reaching the Capitol. He swore an oath to preserve,  protect, and defend this country. And yet, he incited them here to  break into the Capitol.   Senators, as you all know, we have spent trillions of dollars  building the strongest military in the world and billions of dollars on  the most sophisticated weaponry on the planet to prevent the kind of  attack that occurred at this Capitol on January 6. Here is what the  insurrectionists incited by President Trump did.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Hey, let's take a seat, people. Let's       take a seat.        Unidentified Speaker. You be Nancy Pelosi.        Unidentified Speaker. Let's vote on some shit.        Unidentified Speaker. Oh, my God. We did this shit. We took       this shit.        Unidentified Speaker. She's in the House. The House is on       the other side.        Unidentified Speaker. I want to just get a snap of that.        Unidentified Speaker. Yeah, take a picture.    In many ways, this room is sacred and so are the traditions that it  represents. They have been carried on for centuries.   Congress has declared war 11 times on this floor, including entering  World War II--where Congress passed the Civil Rights Act and expanded  the right to vote to ensure that no matter your race or your gender,  you have a voice in our Nation.   This floor is where history has been made. And now, our intelligence  agencies and law enforcement agencies have the burden to figure out  exactly what was stolen, taken, ransacked, and compromised.   As acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin explained, ``Materials were  stolen, and we have to identify what was done, mitigate that, and it  could have potential national security equities.''   These investigations are necessary now because of the actions of  President Trump. And it wasn't just the people that he led here the  intelligence agencies have to look into, it is also what they took and  what they gathered, and it was the very fact that this building, with  so much sensitive information and some classified information, that  this Capitol was breached.   Think about it. Every foreign adversary considering attacking this  building got to watch a dress rehearsal, and they saw that this Capitol  could be overtaken.   As Elizabeth Neumann, a former Trump administration official, stated,  ``[Y]ou have terrorists who would love to destroy the Capitol. They  just saw how easy it was to penetrate. We just exposed a huge  vulnerability.'   And it is not just the Capitol, this attack has implications for all  government buildings.   Senator Rubio made this point well.   (Text of video presentation.)          Thank you. Thank you. Now, I have two--we are going to  do the adjournment resolution in a moment. I have two other things that  we have to do. They are quick.   First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to  make several unanimous consent requests as if in legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Friday,  February 12, from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. that, notwithstanding  adjournment, the Senate be able to receive House messages and executive  matters, committees be authorized to report legislative and executive  matters, and Senators be allowed to submit statements for the record,  introduce bills and resolutions, and make cosponsor requests, and,  where applicable, the Secretary of the Senate, on behalf of the  Presiding Officer, be permitted to refer such matters.    And a second request, poignantly appropriate at this  moment: I ask unanimous consent that, pursuant to the order of the  Senate of January 24, 1901, the traditional reading of Washington's  Farewell Address take place on Monday, February  [[Page S666]]  22, following the prayer and pledge; further, that Senator Portman be  recognized to deliver the address.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the  trial adjourn until 12 noon tomorrow, Friday, February 12, and this  also constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, at 4:24 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Friday, February 12, 2021, at 12  noon.
