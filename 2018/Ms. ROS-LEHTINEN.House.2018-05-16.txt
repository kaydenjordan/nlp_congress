 Mr. Speaker, last week all Americans were relieved  when three of our own citizens were released and returned home from  North Korea. We are happy for them, for their families, and we rejoice  in their reunification.   However, Mr. Speaker, this success only serves as a reminder that we  have American citizens and legal permanent residents being unjustly  detained elsewhere around the world, particularly in Iran. We know that  the Iranian regime has played this game of detaining citizens from the  U.S. and Western nations in an effort to get political and financial  concessions from us. They hold these folks hostages, use them as  bargaining chips, destroying lives and families in the process.   Last year, my south Florida colleague and ranking member on our  subcommittee, the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, Ted  Deutch, and I held a hearing titled: ``Held for Ransom: The Families of  Iran's Hostages Speak Out.'' We heard from Doug Levinson, the son of  Bob Levinson, who has been missing in Iran since 2007--11 years. Bob is  the longest held civilian hostage in America's history. He is also a  constituent of Ted's, and I know that Congressman Deutch has worked  tirelessly over the years to do whatever he can to bring Bob home and  to reunite him with his family.   We also heard from other individuals--Babak Namazi, whose father and  brother have been unjustly detained by the Iranian regime. I have met  with Babak many times, and my heart just breaks each one of those  times, especially when we hear of Americans being freed from North  Korea while Baquer and Siamak, his father and brother, linger in Iran's  prison.   And our subcommittee also heard from Omar Zakka, son of Nizar Zakka,  a U.S. legal permanent resident and hostage of the Iranian regime.  Nizar has gone on hunger strikes about a dozen times since first being  detained in 2015.   I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that the Iranian regime used the news of the  freed Americans from North Korea as a means to torture their hostages.  The mental, physical, and psychological abuse that these individuals  must be undergoing is beyond comprehension.   The White House has said that this is a priority: to release all  unjustly detained persons in Iran--not just American citizens and U.S.  legal permanent residents, but all foreigners who are unjustly  detained.   President Trump spoke about how this would not happen if he were  President, so it is time for President Trump to make that a reality. He  can start by urging our European friends, some of whom have citizens  detained in Iran as well, to make this more of a priority for them as  well and to condition any further talk on the release of all prisoners.  We have to increase the pressure using all levers that we have, and we  have to bring these brave individuals home.   I was pleased to see President Trump announce his intent to appoint a  special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs earlier this week. This  is a positive first step, Mr. Speaker. It signals an intent to make a  more concerted effort to bring these Americans home.   For the sake of Nizar and his family, for the sake of Baquer and  Siamak and their families, for the sake of Bob Levinson and his family,  and for the sake of Princeton graduate student Xiyue Wang and his  family, and for all the Americans and other foreigners being held in  Iran, we need to make this a priority. We need to secure their  immediate release.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Centro  Mater on celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.   This outstanding organization was founded by Mother Margarita Miranda  Otero in 1968, with the goal of providing greatly needed childcare  services to newly exiled Cuban families in Miami. Mother Otero  succeeded and, over the next five decades, Centro Mater has grown and  expanded its mission to provide quality healthcare and services to  disadvantaged children of all backgrounds.   With centers in Little Havana and Hialeah, Centro Mater offers a  positive and nurturing environment for over 1,200 underprivileged  children. Centro Mater's staff also offers enriching and educational  social programs for the parents of the students, such as English  classes and training workshops. These life-changing services empower  children and their families within our greater Miami community.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate everyone involved at Centro  Mater for all that they have accomplished in the past 50 years, and I  thank them for improving the lives of so many in my congressional  district.
