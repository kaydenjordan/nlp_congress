 Madam Speaker, sadly, under Biden, only  36 percent of voters said the American Dream is achievable--that is, if  you work hard, you will get ahead, especially with equality and not  being held back by forced equity sameness. This is according to a  recent Wall Street Journal national opinion poll.   This gruesomely indicates it has been reduced from 53 percent 10  years ago to where it is now at 36 percent. Even ``CBS News'' reports  with the failing Biden economy:   The typical American household must spend an additional $11,443  annually just to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed in  January of 2021.   That is before inflation even soared to 40-year highs.   Republicans, led by Speaker   Mike Johnson, will continue to fight  and push for legislation to reduce inflation and create jobs.   We send our sympathy and appreciation for the life of Secretary of  State Henry Kissinger, who served with President Richard Nixon. He is  beloved in South Carolina because he became a naturalized citizen in  our State at Camp Croft in Spartanburg.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders for  terrorists. It is sadly clear that there will be more 9/11s across  America imminent in our country.                            ____________________
