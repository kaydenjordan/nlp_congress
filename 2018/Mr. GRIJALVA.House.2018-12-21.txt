Reed Hobe Sound National  Wildlife Refuge.   We concur with the gentleman, the majority, Mr. McClintock, on this  issue. I ask all Members to please vote in favor of the resolution. It  is a fitting tribute to a former Interior Department official who  helped develop the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. It  is a fitting tribute, and I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6287 would provide grant funding for the operation,  security, and maintenance of the memorials honoring those men and women  who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
