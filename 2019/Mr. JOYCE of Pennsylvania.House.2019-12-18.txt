 Madam Speaker, I rise today on this dark  day in the United States House of Representatives to voice my  opposition to the shameful impeachment process that has occurred in the  people's House.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not like  President Trump. We know this because they proudly boasted about their  intention to impeach our President before he was even sworn into  office.   Out of disdain for the President and for those of us who elected him,  the House of Representatives is considering two Articles of Impeachment  that are so very weak that they even fail to include specific crimes.   The people that I represent in south-central and southwestern  Pennsylvania know the truth. The American people know the truth. This  impeachment circus has never been about the facts. This process has  always been about seeking revenge for the President's election in 2016  and attempting to prevent him from winning again in 2020.   Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly oppose this partisan and shameful  effort to impeach our democratically and duly elected President.   Madam Speaker, for the sake of our Nation, I urge my colleagues to  join with me and vote ``no'' on the Articles of Impeachment.
