 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a small business  that not only serves delicious food, but provides dignified work and  promotes inclusivity for individuals with intellectual disabilities.  This week, it is my pleasure to honor  [[Page S2502]]  No Limits Cafe of Middletown, NJ, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   No Limits Cafe was created to help intellectually disabled  individuals achieve their full potential. When their daughter, Katie,  was born with Down syndrome, founders Stephanie and Mark Cartier began  advocating for children with intellectual disabilities, ID. As Katie  neared adulthood, Stephanie and Mark were concerned by the lack of  meaningful employment and job training available for people with ID.  They believed dignified work provided a sense of pride, purpose, and  fulfilment. Employment was empowering. For adults with ID, it could be  a life-changing opportunity. In 2017, they began planning a business  that would enable adults like Katie to gain valuable work skills.   Over the next 3 years, the Middletown community rallied to support  what would later become No Limits Cafe. After the Cartiers bought an  old restaurant, local businesses and organizations donated money,  materials, and labor to transform the building into a welcoming and  accessible space. No Limits Cafe was chartered as a nonprofit 501(c)(3)  organization, reflecting its commitment to ``do good'' in their  community. Stephanie and Mark developed a two-phase program to fulfill  their mission of helping adults with ID gain working skills and  independence. First, employ 25-30 adults at the cafe with ID. Then,  provide restaurant industry training workshops and place trainees  within local restaurants. Near the end of 2019, more than 30 adults  with ID were hired as the nonprofit enterprise prepared to launch.   On February 6, 2020, No Limits Cafe opened its doors to widespread  acclaim. In addition to gaining marketable skills, employees formed  friendships, developed independence, and expressed a sense of pride in  their work. No Limits Cafe was profiled in outlets ranging from local  news and radio to ABC World News Tonight. Their motto of ``Eat Well--Do  Good'' was clearly reflected in their work.   Like many other nonprofits, No Limits Cafe experienced a sharp  decline in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. Without enough  money to pay their staff, Stephanie and Mark were forced to lay off all  36 employees. They donated the cafe's perishable supplies to a local  food bank, unsure of when they could afford to reopen.   When the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program--PPP--Stephanie and Mark immediately applied. The  PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and  nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. In  early May, No Limits Cafe received a PPP loan. As a result, Stephanie  and Mark have been able to rehire all 36 of their employees and will  reopen No Limits Cafe for takeout starting Memorial Day weekend.   No Limits Cafe is an outstanding example of how purpose-driven  businesses can positively impact their communities. I commend their  efforts to provide training and employment for adults with intellectual  disabilities, a historically underserved population. Congratulations to  Stephanie, Mark, and the entire team at No Limits Cafe. I look forward  to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
