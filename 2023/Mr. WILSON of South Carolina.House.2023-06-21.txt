 Mr. Speaker, appeasing Iran endangers  America and the world, according to Matthew Continetti of the American  Enterprise Institute, as reported in the June 17 edition of National  Review.   ``For President Biden is on the verge of betraying Congress and the  American people by rewarding the Islamic Republic of Iran for various  misdeeds.   ``According to news reports, Biden is prepared to authorize billions  of dollars in payments to Iran in exchange for the release of U.S.  prisoners. . . . Biden will say this perverse arrangement is necessary  to free innocents. . . . What he won't be able to do is call it a deal.   ``Biden can't call the agreement a deal because he wants to avoid  congressional review. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015  forbids the President from relieving nuclear-related sanctions . . .  without congressional approval.   ``Notice that the deal-that-is-no-deal says nothing about Iran's  deadliest proxy, Hezbollah, or about Iran's drone traffic,'' to attack  Israel and murder Ukrainian civilians.   In conclusion, sadly, the insulting plea deal for Hunter Biden  exposes the Biden crime family has shamefully corrupted the Federal  judicial system.                            ____________________
