 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight how the Build  Back Better Act will improve the lives of people all across our  country.   For far too long, pharmaceutical giants have charged outrageous  prices for lifesaving medication. The Build Back Better Act will  finally allow Medicare to negotiate prices and cap the price of insulin  at $35 a month.   For years, hardworking people who fell ill or cared for an aging  loved one were forced to choose between their livelihood and their  health or that of their loved ones. Finally, the Build Back Better Act  will ensure more people have decent healthcare and that their coverage  is more affordable.   Importantly, all of this will be paid for without raising taxes on  middle-class families because when billionaires pay their fair share,  we can invest in those who make and build what makes and builds  America.                            ____________________
