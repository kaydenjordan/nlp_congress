 Madam Speaker, the transcript has now been released of the  phone conversation between President Trump and President Zelensky.   The evidence is clear, unfortunately, that the Speaker of the House  of Representatives has been functionally catfished into a politically  fatal impeachment proceeding based on rumors, based on faulty evidence,  and based on a bloodlust for the President, politically, that does not  serve our Nation well.   Let me give you the high points. There is no quid pro quo between  President Trump and President Zelensky for anything, much less military  aid. There is no eight times a reference to Joe Biden. I think The Wall  Street Journal will have a good deal of retracting to do today. In  fact, President Zelensky, himself, identifies the rooting out of  corruption as the reason for his election.   Early on in the conversation between President Trump and President  Zelensky, President Zelensky says: We, here in Ukraine, are trying to  drain the swamp much in the way you are working to drain the swamp in  the United States of America.    This wasn't a call about leverage. This wasn't a call about threats.  This was a mutually appreciative and mutually laudatory call between  two leaders who are trying to clean up some of the garbage in their  respective countries that has polluted politics.   Now, the President does ask for a favor from President Zelensky, but  the favor is on behalf of our Nation. The favor we seek is cooperation  between the Zelensky government and Attorney General Bill Barr as we  work to determine what activities in Ukraine may have been in any way  involved in the 2016--not 2020, but 2016--efforts to interfere with the  United States election.   The President even references CrowdStrike, attempting to get to the  bottom of these improper actions, which, again, may have emanated from  Ukraine. John Solomon with The Hill has a great deal of reporting on  that very question.   Zelensky ran against corruption. Thus, it would be only appropriate  that, in a conversation about that election victory, they would discuss  and reference what are, obviously, mutual goals between the United  States and Ukraine to have the world safer for democracy.   The President also mentions Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Let me be clear  about this: Mayor Giuliani has every right to go to Ukraine to try to  ascertain whether or not activities in that country were harming his  client as a result of the corrupt connections that may have existed  between the DNC and some elements in Ukraine.   I feel like we have been here before. House Democrats told us it was  all about collusion. We had to wait for the Mueller report. Well, when  the Mueller report falls flat on collusion, then it is all about  obstruction of justice. Until Robert Mueller testifies and that falls  flat, then it is all about abuse of power. Until the Democrats go to  court and are unable to make the case in court that there has been an  abuse of power. Now, lo and behold, it is all about Ukraine.   Do you know what? I saw this movie as it related to Russia. I didn't  like it very much, and I doubt I am going to enjoy the cheap Ukrainian  knockoff.   The Speaker has embraced these concerns. I fear that her embrace of  impeachment does great damage to the House of Representatives. There  may be a time where we have to solemnly exercise our impeachment powers  because there is true crime or corruption, and the Speaker's actions  have embarrassed the United States Congress and harm our entire  country.   President Zelensky, in this call, indicates that he will conduct an  investigation into corruption. It is a promise  [[Page H7910]]  not only that he made to President Trump but that he made to his own  citizens. In that promise, President Zelensky says that any  investigation will be both open and candid, open and candid  investigations of corruption of election meddling. I sure would like to  see that level of candidness and openness in our House of  Representatives.   Certainly, my greatest hope is that the Attorney General's  investigation into the corrupt origins of the efforts to smear the  President of the United States will be exposed and those responsible  will go to jail.   That is how we restore honor to this House. That is how we solve and  heal some of the great wounds that were inflicted on this body by the  Speaker yesterday. Maybe next time the radical left will wait for the  facts before engaging in a reflexive, fact-free impeachment.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. McHenry) for yielding, and it is on behalf of those cannabis  patients in Fort Walton Beach and across the Sunshine State that I rise  in support of the SAFE Banking Act.   I am proud to have been a part of drafting Florida's medical  marijuana laws, and it is ludicrous that the Congress of the United  States would stand between people operating under the color of State  law and their ability to access the financial system.   It is good for no one to have billions of dollars rolling around  outside of the accountabilities, efficiencies, and safeguards that the  American financial system provides.   A vast majority of States have legalized some form of cannabis, and  if a business is legal in that State, it should have the same financial  protections as any other business.   I am a proud original cosponsor of the SAFE Banking Act, and I thank  my colleagues for their tireless work on this issue. I know the bill is  not perfect. I expect the bill to get better in the Senate, but  hopefully, this will build some commonsense momentum for real cannabis  reform.  [[Page H7973]]    Let's get this drug off the schedule I list and do right for the  great people in the country.
