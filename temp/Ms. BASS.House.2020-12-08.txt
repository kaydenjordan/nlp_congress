Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to be the author of H.R. 8161, The One Stop  Shop Community Reentry Program Act of 2020, and I urge my colleagues to  support this important reentry measure and pass this bipartisan bill  today.   I would like to take a moment to give a special thanks to  Representative Guy Reschenthaler for his support.   H.R. 8161 will provide much-needed resources to especially  communities with a disproportionate number of returning citizens. The  idea of the bill is to provide grants to establish a centralized  process to assist individuals returning to their communities after  incarceration. It acts as a bridge by providing guidance to those who  are leaving prison and jails on how to become productive members of  their communities.   The concept of the bill is that funding would be provided to  communities and neighborhoods to establish programs where people who  are formerly incarcerated can run the program to essentially be a hand- holding bridge for people who are coming out of facilities to help them  reintegrate into the community.   Many things that we might take for granted, such as getting your ID,  getting a driver's license, paying your back child support, learning  how to use transportation or the latest technology are things that can  lead to recidivism for people if they are not able to reintegrate.   If you don't have a driver's license and you come from communities  like mine in Los Angeles, without a car, it is virtually impossible to  have a job that would allow you to support yourself.   Establishing a one-stop center where formerly incarcerated people are  involved in every aspect of the management and running of the center  will allow people to be reintegrated.   This Congress, in a series of hearings, the Judiciary Committee heard  the challenges faced by people who are recently released. Sadly, these  stories have only gotten worse over the years because, as we have  incarcerated more people, we have also passed laws that essentially do  not allow them to function in the legal economy, and we shouldn't be  surprised when people recidivate.   For example, in some prisons, we have training programs. In  California, we had a training program to teach people who were  incarcerated how to be barbers, but then we passed laws that said we  wouldn't allow formerly incarcerated people to get a barber's license.  So that type of reintegration bridge is what this bill addressed.   As we have passed policies that lead formerly incarcerated people  outside of the legal economy, in these communities where there is a  disproportionate number, you actually can see an increase in crime  rate, because people will do whatever is needed to survive, and many  times that means going back to illegal activity.   Each year, over 650,000 people are released from custody. Finding  jobs, job training, housing, and placement, or even finding a hot meal  can be challenging. For many, these barriers seem insurmountable. This  is especially true for individuals who are returning to their  communities and might have substance abuse, mental health disorders, or  educational challenges.   We already know that many people who are incarcerated do not have a  high school diploma. So a one-stop community center can help them get  the resources and the training that they need so that they can become  productive citizens.   During our hearings, we heard great examples of community leaders who  are doing this work with minimal resources. Susan Burton, for example,  the founder of A New Way of Life in Los Angeles, transports women as  soon as they are released and provides them a safe place to live.   Criminal justice advocates Andrea James, Conan Harris, and Big John,  from Los Angeles, have testified before the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security. They highlighted the importance of  starting reentry services on the very first day someone enters into  custody.   H.R. 8161 transforms obstacles into bridges. That is why having all  reentry services in one place is so critical. Trained staff and peer  mentors can guide returning individuals through the process of finding  a safe place to sleep, apply for benefits, addressing family  reunification, and starting the process of gaining employment.   Importantly, one-stop centers will be led by and employ formerly  incarcerated individuals who can act as mentors. They can provide  direct services to recently released individuals. This will give them  the wherewithal they need to meet the challenges before them.                                time  1615    H.R. 8161 provides support for smaller or rural communities that are  not large enough to support a large one-stop operation. So it  authorizes the Department of Justice to establish a 24/7 reentry  service assistance hotline to direct recently released individuals to  appropriate reentry services in their localities.   It is important to remember that the vast majority of the 2.3 million  people  [[Page H7006]]  who are currently in custody will be released. Without the right types  of support, they are highly likely to recidivate. No reentering person,  regardless of where they live, should be left wondering how to  establish their life and find gainful employment.   Our bipartisan bill provides communities with desperately needed  resources to assist returning citizens in their efforts to successfully  rejoin their communities. Between the one-stop center and the 24/7  hotline, Congress is again providing leadership on reentry issues and,  in turn, promoting public safety.   This is a bipartisan effort, and again, I want to thank my colleagues  for their cosponsorship and for working with me on this issue.   For the foregoing reasons, I urge my colleagues to join in supporting  this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, the overwhelming majority of incarcerated  individuals are released from jail or prison and returned to their  communities. This bill would take meaningful steps to make the reentry  process more efficient and, ultimately, more successful.   Along with the 24/7 reentry hotline, community-funded reentry  programs, like the services included in this bill, will reduce  recidivism and improve overall community safety. These individuals will  be able to successfully rejoin and contribute to their families and  communities. That is why this bill is so important.   In our Nation, we used to believe that, if you committed a crime and  you served your time in prison, you were able to reenter society. This  bill is a return to that time period.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill. I thank my colleague, Representative Armstrong, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
