 Mr. Speaker, we woke up this morning to yet more  horrific images of dozens of people killed by another chemical weapons  attack in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, this included children who were gasping for their last  breath as they perished because of the brutal, murderous dictator  Bashar al-Assad, who decided that chemical weapons would be used to  extinguish their life.   Mr. Speaker, for 6 years, we have failed in the Western world to  address this horrific act. In fact, for the first time since World War  II, we are accepting the use of chemical weapons as just a normal part  of everyday life.   Mr. Speaker, the Western world, the free world, needs to stand up,  needs to make clear that Assad needs to go, and needs to stand up for  humanity, lest we see these images again.   We wonder how to defeat terrorism. Mr. Speaker, you do it by denying  terrorists the recruits of the next generation, of which Bashar al- Assad is creating many.                            ____________________
