 Madam President, first, I want to thank my  colleague from Ohio for his commitment to Ukraine, to get knowledgeable  about Ukraine, what the needs are, and for continued support for lethal  aid for Ukraine. And I hope this body continues to support Ukraine.                          Unanimous Consent Request    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of my bill, which is at the desk; I further  ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I have been in the Senate  about 4 years now, and I am not sure I can recall a day before this one  that so perfectly exposed Washington's total dysfunction.   Last night or I guess this morning just before 1:30 a.m., Senate  leadership finally dropped the $1.7 trillion Pelosi-Schumer spending  bill--all 4,155 pages of it. In typical Washington fashion, hostages  have been taken to pressure Members of this body to approve this bill  without a reasonable opportunity to review, debate, or amend it.   Most important to me are the Florida families fighting hard to  recover from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole who are being used as pawns in  exchange for approval of the massive and reckless $1.7 trillion Pelosi- Schumer spending bill.   Immediately after the storm passed, I made clear that I would fight  for and support a stand-alone disaster aid funding package to get  Floridians the assistance they needed to recover. I even wrote to  Senators Leahy and Shelby, the Senate top appropriators, urging them to  work with me on getting much needed aid to Florida families as quickly  as possible in a stand-alone disaster supplemental bill. My letter to  them was written on September 30, 2 days after Ian made its  catastrophic landfall near Ft. Myers, FL, but the aid Floridians  desperately needed was delayed and turned into a hostage taken by  Senate leadership so it could be stuffed in this massive omnibus bill.   To tell folks in the Sunshine State who are still picking up the  pieces left by Ian and Nicole that this aid only comes as part of the  4,000-plus page omnibus spending bill is sickening, and I am not going  to stand for it.   Government has an essential role to play in our society and core  responsibilities to fulfill. We all pay taxes so that government has  the resources to keep its promises to us and provide core services like  national defense, Social Security, and Medicare.   If this spending bill helped balance the budget and only contained  the things that the Federal Government should be responsible for, I  would gladly vote for it without hesitation, but that is not what we  are facing here.   When I ran for the Senate in 2018, I promised Florida families to  make Washington work for them. That doesn't mean zero Federal spending;  it means responsible spending by a Congress that is accountable to  taxpayers who fund it. That is how we governed when I was Governor of  Florida, and the result was better returns for our State's families.   Because we governed responsibly, the economy grew. A growing economy  meant we could cut taxes and pay off State debt while making record  investments in education, environment, and public safety. Washington  can work this way, too, but not while failed politicians refuse to be  accountable with your money.   The truth is, at more than 4,000 pages, the Pelosi-Schumer spending  bill has a lot of policies and funding priorities I actually fought for  this year. It has more funding to preserve and protect Florida's  Everglades, funding to support our military, and, yes, disaster aid for  the families and communities devastated by Hurricanes Ian and Nicole.   I support all these things, but I will never support the other parts  of the bill that continue gross, reckless spending of taxpayer dollars.  These are things like $2.3 million so the Department of Education can  reach out to student loan borrowers and urge them to apply for Biden's  illegal debt forgiveness program that has been blocked by the Federal  courts, more than 7,500 Member projects or earmarks, funding for Biden  to continue supersizing the IRS with 87,000 new agents, and  continuation of policies that force every family to give the IRS  visibility into their personal finances.   We just found out this terrible bill prohibits Border Patrol from  using this funding to do its job and secure the border. The bill says:         None of the funds provided in subsection (1)(A) shall be       used to acquire, maintain, or extend border technology and       capabilities, except for technology and capabilities to       improve Border Patrol processing.    So nothing to stop illegal crossings. We are just going to focus on  processing people who already broke the law by illegally crossing the  border. And while we are throwing a muzzle on our own Border Patrol, we  are giving money to countries like Egypt to secure their borders. That  makes no sense. We should do both.   Florida families deserve better than to be forced to accept these  radical policies and reckless spending in exchange for disaster relief.  It is insane that I even need to come to the Senate floor to say that,  but I am sick and tired of seeing dysfunction in Washington create hard  times for families in the Sunshine State.   So I am here today to get things done for families in my State who  are hurting and ask that the Senate take up and pass the disaster aid  contained in the omnibus as a separate and stand-alone measure. This is  the exact same language that was written in the omnibus bill that my  Democratic colleagues seek to pass. I did not limit this just to  Florida; the aid I am asking the Senate to pass benefits other States  that have been impacted by disasters like tornados, flooding, and  wildfires too. More aid may be needed, but getting this done is a good  first step and is something that should never have been jammed into a  massive end-of-year spending bill.   We can fix that error today, pass this on its own, and get relief on  the way to families and communities in need.   I had hoped my colleagues would see the common sense in this simple  request. Instead, Democrats have blocked this from passing tonight.   America's national debt is $31 trillion and growing. When are we  going to be so fed up that we decide this isn't sustainable--when we  get to $35, $40 or $45 trillion in debt?    Too many Democrats and Republicans in Washington are happy to close  their eyes, plug their ears, and pass another reckless multitrillion- dollar spending bill we can't afford. I am not going to do that. I am  going to fight every day for Florida families, but I won't cave to more  spending and let the hard-working people of my State be treated as  pawns in Washington's corrupt spending games. Doing so would be a  betrayal of my promise to Floridians that I would always fight against  Washington's corrupt dysfunction and wild spending.   We all get hired by voters in our States to represent them here in  the Senate. How is adopting a massive, 4,000-plus page bill without  reading it or debating its contents doing the job we all got elected to  do?   Think about it this way: If you hired someone to negotiate a big,  expensive contract for you and they told you to sign it without reading  any of it, would you ever hire them again? No. No one would hire  someone like that. That is exactly what is happening here.   We are asked to approve this massive bill days before a new  Republican majority takes power in the House. It is nothing short of  shameful abandonment and betrayal of our House colleagues and the  conservative voters in Florida and across the Nation who elected them.   My colleague's decision to block disaster aid from quickly passing  tonight is shameful as well. It is insane that my colleague has  insisted on holding this aid hostage in a massive omnibus  [[Page S9596]]  instead of standing with families hurting from Hurricanes Ian and  Nicole and getting them relief today.   With inflation up nearly 14 percent since Biden took office, labor  participation at historic lows, Federal debt skyrocketing, and a  recession on the horizon, there has never been a more important time to  stand up and demand fiscal sanity in Congress. That is why I think it  makes a lot of sense that the House Republicans have made it clear that  they do not support passing the Pelosi-Schumer spending bill. Passing  an omnibus right now ties the hands of the new Republican House  majority and extends the priorities of Nancy Pelosi and House  Democrats--the leaders and party that the American people just voted  out of power.   Shockingly, some in the Senate have tried to argue that we should  ignore the wishes of House Republicans. They argue that expecting a  new, slim House Republican to keep the government funded is just too  much to ask. I think that is nonsense.   The way I see it, the decision before Senate Republicans is as simple  and straightforward as it gets here in Washington: We can either stand  with Republicans or once again cave to the Democrats. We can either  make sure it is House Republicans--not Pelosi and her outgoing Democrat  majority--who get a say in how Congress spends taxpayer dollars next  year or we can hand the recently fired Speaker a massive retirement  gift on her way out the door.   I will tell you this: Florida families know that the process we have  up here is not working. Inflation is raging, debt is out of control,  and Congress so routinely passes massive, thousand-plus page spending  bills without giving anyone time to read them that even the press  doesn't bother to scrutinize this broken system anymore. While this  might be business as usual in Washington, hard-working Americans find  it disgusting.   Congressional Republicans should be taking every opportunity to stop  the reckless, Big Government policies that Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and  Senate Democrats have jammed down the throats of the American public  over the last 2 years. I promised Florida families that I would do  that, and I won't back down on my word.   I yield the floor.
