 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a rule providing  for consideration of several bills that will support pregnant women in  the workplace and reaffirm our shared commitment to equity and  diversity.  [[Page H4397]]    Of these important bills, one stands out as personal to me: the  resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment related to  COVID-19.   For many Asian Americans across this country, the harmful rhetoric  from the highest officials of our land is a painful reminder of our yet  unrealized potential as a Nation. This pain is informed by our lived  experiences.   For me, having been born in a Japanese-American internment camp, I  learned from my parents and grandparents the dangers of governing with  fear and hatred, not acceptance and unity.   If our country is to successfully contain the spread of this deadly  virus, the Federal Government must demonstrate that every single  American is valued and that their stories and lives matter. Americans  of all backgrounds deserve to know that their government holds a  fundamental dedication to their well-being.   However, when our leaders use language that undermines our collective  resolve, it diminishes public trust, undercuts public health, and harms  families. This rhetoric does not align with the values we work to  instill in our children, and it has no place in America today.   This is an important statement for this Chamber to make, and I look  forward to a vote on the House floor soon.
