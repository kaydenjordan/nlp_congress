 Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 83rd anniversary of  the first Social Security check being issued. Since then, Democrats  have worked to protect and strengthen Social Security, which has kept  seniors from poverty and helped ensure a secure economic future for  working Americans.   This year, Social Security beneficiaries received an 8.7 percent  cost-of-living adjustment, the largest increase in decades.   While 70 million Americans are benefiting from this increase today,  Republicans are working hard to slash Social Security and Medicare. To  add further insult to injury, the Republican economic scheme includes a  30 percent sales tax that will impact every American family.   Our children, our families, and our seniors do not deserve to carry  the undue financial burden of Republican tax breaks for large  corporations and billionaires.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  realign their priorities and start working for the people.                            ____________________
