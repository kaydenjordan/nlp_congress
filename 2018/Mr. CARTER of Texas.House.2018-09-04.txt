 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   I rise today on behalf of H.R. 6447, the Chief Data Officer  Authorization Act. This bill designates the chief data officer to  increase transparency and to ensure best practices are implemented  throughout the DHS. My bill is the culmination of listening to my  constituents and DHS employees along the border regarding transparency,  communication, and oversight issues at the Department of Homeland  Security.   Every day 240,000 employees at DHS go to work to ensure the security  of our Nation. Many of these men and women are under intense pressure  to identify efficiencies and do more with less. This bill answers their  request for help in managing and sharing information to protect the  homeland.   I have also heard from my constituents who are concerned about  government transparency. I truly understand the need to keep the public  informed on how their government is working for them. This bill is in  answer to those concerns.   This bill also ensures Members of Congress receive the answers and  the  [[Page H7803]]  data they need to effectively perform our constitutional oversight  responsibilities.   I echo the sentiments of many of my colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation. Today is a big step forward for the American  people.   This bill ensures DHS does not fall behind other government agencies  as we increase transparency for those we serve. I urge my colleagues to  support the passage of this bill.
