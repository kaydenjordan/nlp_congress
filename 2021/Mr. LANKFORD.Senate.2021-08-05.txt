 Mr. President, I do object.    Reserving the right to object.   I would say this is a complicated issue to walk through the issues of  immigration, and there are a lot of questions that hang out there.  Secretary Mayorkas was in front of our committee on May 13 to be able  to walk through the issues we are facing.   Just as a quick review, we had a record number of people illegally  cross the border in March. That was beaten in April. That was beaten in  May. That was beaten in June. That was beaten in July.   In July, we had 210,000 people illegally cross our border, that we  know of.  [[Page S5918]]    The DHS, in a recent court filing--actually filed in a court filing  where they made this statement:         Based on current trends, the Department expects that total       encounters this fiscal year are likely to be the highest ever       recorded. . . . The Department also expects that these       numbers will climb even higher if the CDC Order [Title 42] is       enjoined.    There is a real issue that is going on. So when Ale Mayorkas was in  front of our committee, our committee had direct jurisdiction for  oversight in what is happening in Homeland Security. There have been a  lot of changes that have been done this year in how we are enforcing or  not enforcing the border.   We have record numbers of individuals crossing the border. The border  wall and that whole infrastructure, as well as the technology on the  southern border, all the construction has stopped on that. The best we  can tell, we have spent $2 billion this year not building the wall.    Currently, it is not getting better. It continues to be able to get  worse. We have 10,000 migrants in the Rio Grande Valley currently being  held right now. That is 783 percent overcapacity in the Rio Grande  Valley right now.   And on the Interior enforcement side with ICE--we have 6,000 ICE  agents--and the last number that we saw last month, they did 3,000  deportations among 6,000 ICE agents in a month. The standard for them  to actually interdict, detain, or deport an individual has now reached  such a high standard that they have to contact regional leadership and  ask permission by name to be able to interdict someone.   That has dramatically slowed down what is happening in Interior  enforcement, what is happening at our border area.   And as we continue to be able to watch the number of individuals  cross our border that are COVID positive, we have this odd situation  where the Nation and the President are talking to companies and telling  companies, ``you need to mandate vaccines and you need to mandate  masks,'' when at the whole time we are literally bringing people from  all over the world across our southern border and releasing them into  the United States.   We have legitimate questions that need to be answered. May 13, when  Ale Mayorkas was in front of our Committee, there were multiple  questions that I had. It was a very cordial interchange and very frank  going through the issues. I asked him very specific questions for  specific numbers.   He said: I will follow up with that.   We wrote him a list of specific questions and asked for specific  answers for that. To their credit, 2 months later--2 months later--we  got a list of answers to the questions that I had asked. That was 24  hours ago.   The very specific answer on the issues--I asked about the volunteer  force in DHS. The humanitarian exceptions to Title 42, including the  policy documents, they were very commendable on how they actually  answered those.   To DHS, I would ask specific questions on how they are handling sex  offenders, because ICE agents have told me over and over again sex  offenders are not being interdicted in the numbers they were in the  past. They gave us very specific answers on that.   But the problem was, half of the questions they gave us answers to  and half they did not. For instance, we asked about the study that they  started January 20th on the border wall. That study was supposed to be  60 days. It has now been more than 200 days. We just asked for the  status of that study and, if we could see any of it, what were the  findings.   Instead, I was sent a press release that they had put out. That is  not what I need. In fact, that press release was copied in multiple  places in the document to say ``this is responsive.'' That is not  responsive.   There is a new process that has been put in place by this DHS called  notice to report, where literally there is a large number of people  crossing the border at once. They are taking those individuals out,  doing biometrics, background checks and releasing them into the country  with the statement of: Turn yourself in at an ICE office somewhere in  the country.   No administration has ever done that. As far as we can tell, 55,000  people this year have been released into the country under a notice to  report. That is a new process that is undefined. The questions we asked  about that were completely unresponsive.   The Supreme Court made a decision on what is called a notice to  appear just this year that should change the process from how DHS  handles notice to appear. We asked very specific questions on how DHS  is handling this issue based on the Supreme Court decision that was  made a few months ago. They were completely unresponsive on that.   We asked about cost analysis for the border construction, what is  happening on eminent domain on those issues and areas where they are  choosing not to do eminent domain, and they were completely  unresponsive to that.   So literally half our questions they answered completely, and half  our questions they sent us fluff.   I am the only one who is holding this up--I am very aware--but it is  also my committee of jurisdiction that specifically has border  management. I am the one who is supposed to ask these questions, and I  am asking these questions, and they are not unreasonable questions.   We are just asking to be able to get an answer to the questions so we  can figure out what is the process and what is happening.   As recently as today, I learned that ICE is currently looking at a  facility in western Oklahoma to do what they are calling a surge  overflow temporary facility. That surge overflow temporary facility  they are looking to open is in western Oklahoma, to move people from  the border, process them in western Oklahoma, and then release them  from western Oklahoma.   It is not an unfair question for me to ask: What is this facility?  What is its purpose? And will individuals who are not legally present  in the country be released in western Oklahoma?   This is the same question that has been asked by mayors and leaders  in Arizona, who have a facility like this in Arizona, where processing  was done there and then they were released from there. And mayors and  individuals there have asked the question: Why are individuals who are  not legally present in the country being brought from the border to my  town, and then released in my town?   It is not unfair for me to be able to ask that as well. I have  already had that conversation with the Secretary of DHS. I do not have  an answer.   So, yes, I object because we need to get some straightforward answers  to some very straightforward, very fair questions.   I object.    I object.
