 Mr. Speaker, after too long, Americans are  waking up to the dangers of the Chinese Communist Party. As we combat  the economic and the health ramifications of the coronavirus, it has  never been more important that we take on this hostile regime.   It has been my honor to serve on the China Task Force and help expose  the threats that the Chinese Communist Party poses to our national  security and to the American people.   Just yesterday, Congressman   Michael McCaul released the House  Foreign Affairs Committee's report into the origins of the coronavirus  pandemic. Their evidence clearly confirms that the Chinese Communists  covered up the coronavirus, enabling a local outbreak to become a  pandemic.   The Chinese Communist Party knew that the coronavirus could be spread  by human-to-human transmission, and yet this regime hid findings from  global leaders, public health experts, and even the World Health  Organization.   Leaders in the Chinese Communist Party knew that this virus could be  catastrophic, and yet they deliberately chose to cover up their  missteps rather than sound an alarm and warn the world that this virus  was being unleashed.   Their lies cost American livelihoods. Their lies cost American lives.  This pandemic's destruction could have been prevented. This didn't have  to happen.   Now Americans are facing a choice. If we do not act now, who will  stop the Chinese Communist Party from simply repeating this coverup?   Inaction is not an option. America must prevent another pandemic from  reaching our shores.   And our work cannot stop there. Sadly, the Chinese Government's  malicious acts extend far beyond the coronavirus pandemic. From  cyberattacks on American citizens and blatant overreach into our  virtual networks, to espionage in our academic institutions and illicit  fentanyl that kills on American streets, we cannot ignore the Chinese  Government's pervasive threats to our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, this is no distraction; this is reality. For the safety  of the American people, for the future of our Nation, the Chinese  Communist Party must be held accountable.   For months, the China Task Force has focused on researching these  issues and exploring legislative solutions. We are currently working on  a final report that will detail our findings and recommend a pragmatic  path forward. While our work on this report is coming to a close, our  commitment to the cause will continue.   During these busy days, I recognize that many issues are competing  for America's time; but to be fair, these threats require our action.  The Chinese Government's coverup of the coronavirus pandemic requires  action. The Chinese Government's persecution of Uighurs requires  action. The Chinese Government's monopoly of the medical supply chain  requires action. The Chinese Government's attempts to control the  world's network requires action.   Despite the challenges that we are facing at home, the American  people must stand together against the Chinese Communist Party. Our  national security should never be a partisan issue. The health of the  American people should never be a partisan issue. By working together,  we can strengthen our defenses, defend human rights, spur innovation,  and equip Americans to lead the way in global innovation.   Moving forward, it is imperative that America continues to strengthen  our supply chain, to pursue fair trade deals with China, and,  ultimately, to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its  actions.   Once again, it has been my privilege to serve the American people as  a member of the China Task Force. I thank Leader McCarthy for the  opportunity to serve, and I am grateful to Chairman   Michael McCaul  for his leadership.   This is a long road, but it is worth the fight. And as I always  believe, America will win that fight.                            ____________________
