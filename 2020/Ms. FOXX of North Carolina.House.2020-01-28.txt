 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend  President Trump for providing much-needed relief and regulatory clarity  through the enactment of the Navigable Waters Protection Rule.   Under the Obama administration, in an era rife with government  overreach and constricting regulations, our Nation's hardworking  farmers were subjected to regulations--specifically, under the Waters  of the United States rule--that impeded on their businesses and their  livelihoods.   Instead of enacting meaningful environmental protections and  returning power back to State, local, and municipal governments, WOTUS  put government overreach in the express lane. Farmers were forced to  hire expensive attorneys to define which bodies of water on their  properties were subject to Federal regulations.   The most concerning part is that bodies of water such as small ponds,  [[Page H573]]  ditches, drains, and even areas of dry land were subject to these  regulations.                                time  1015    Sadly, this is just another textbook example of the types of  government overreach that must be eliminated. Thanks to the Navigable  Waters Protection Rule, erroneous, misguided regulations enacted by the  Obama administration are finally repealed. Hardworking Americans will  once again have the freedom to compete within the marketplace, spur  innovation, and create lasting value.   Under this rule, regulatory certainty will be returned to farmers,  landowners, and manufacturers; the laws and specific powers that the  Federal Government has been given under the Constitution and the Clean  Water Act will be respected; and the relationship between the Federal  Government and the State regarding the managing of land and water  resources will be rebalanced.   By eliminating these constructive regulations, President Trump  continues to deliver on his promises to our farmers, landowners, and  manufacturers.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand alongside the President as we  support, defend, and fight for the men and women who provide food,  shelter, and essential commodities that Americans rely on every day.     Recognizing National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month     Mr. Speaker, January has been proclaimed  as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.   These appalling criminal acts not only tear at the fabric of our  society, but they also reflect a blatant disregard for the sanctity of  human life.   Though human trafficking is often a hidden crime, its effects are  far-reaching. It is estimated that over 25 million people--children and  adults around the world--are victims of both human trafficking and  slavery. Traffickers rob victims of their freedom, split families  apart, and impose sizeable threats to communities.   Let's be clear. We must remain relentless in our fight to end these  abhorrent crimes. We must all work together to protect and support  survivors, prosecute those responsible, and proactively foster a  culture of justice and accountability for these crimes.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  amend the rule to provide for a motion to recommit on the Senate  amendment to H.R. 550 so that minority voices can be heard on the  critical issue of war.
