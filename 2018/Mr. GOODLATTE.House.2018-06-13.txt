 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4655) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit the  importation or transportation of child sex dolls, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 4655         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Curbing Realistic       Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots Act of 2017'' or as       the ``CREEPER Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds as follows:        (1) There is a correlation between possession of the       obscene dolls, and robots, and possession of and       participation in child pornography.        (2) The physical features, and potentially the       ``personalities'' of the robots are customizable or morphable       and can resemble actual children.        (3) Some owners and makers of the robots have made their       children interact with the robots as if the robots are       members of the family.        (4) The robots can have settings that simulate rape.        (5) The dolls and robots not only lead to rape, but they       make rape easier by teaching the rapist about how to overcome       resistance and subdue the victim.  [[Page H5120]]         (6) For users and children exposed to their use, the dolls       and robots normalize submissiveness and normalize sex between       adults and minors.        (7) As the Supreme Court has recognized, obscene material       is often used as part of a method of seducing child victims.        (8) The dolls and robots are intrinsically related to abuse       of minors, and they cause the exploitation, objectification,       abuse, and rape of minors.       SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF IMPORTATION OR TRANSPORTATION OF CHILD                     SEX DOLLS.         Section 1462 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (a), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (b), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (3) by inserting after paragraph (c) the following:        ``(d) any child sex doll; or''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:      ``In this section, the term `child sex doll' means an       anatomically-correct doll, mannequin, or robot, with the       features of, or with features that resemble those of, a       minor, intended for use in sexual acts.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on H.R. 4655 currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we consider the Curbing Realistic Exploitative  Electronic Pedophilic Robots Act of 2017. It criminalizes the  importation and transportation of child sex dolls.   I have mixed feelings today about bringing this bill to the floor. I  am happy that this legislation is moving through, and we are taking  steps to address a problem that very much needs to be addressed. I am  distraught, however, that this problem even exists. I am saddened that  there are people in this world who would create realistic child sex  dolls and distraught that there are people in this world who would buy  them.   These dolls are being manufactured in China and Japan and being  shipped all over the world. Consumers can order bespoke dolls providing  pictures of specific children they would like the doll to resemble.  They can indicate a preferred facial expression, such as sadness or  fear. These dolls can be programmed to simulate rape. The very thought  makes me nauseous.   While a small group of people advocate for the use of these dolls to  curb pedophilia, there is absolutely no scientific literature  supporting this view. To the contrary, these dolls create a real risk  of reinforcing pedophilic behavior, and they desensitize the user,  causing him to engage in sicker and sicker behavior. They put our  children in danger, and we must not tolerate them.   In April of this year, Amazon announced it was removing anatomically  correct child sex dolls from its website. I call upon all internet- based retailers and media platforms to do the same.   Australia and the United Kingdom have already taken steps to  criminalize the importation of child sex dolls and are actively  prosecuting these cases. There is no reason that the United States  should not follow suit.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Donovan of New York for  introducing this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan), the chief sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this truly is, as the gentlewoman from Texas said, a  disgusting topic, but it is one that I think is very necessary to  protect our children and to protect our society.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   I, again, thank the gentleman from New York for offering it. His  experience as a prosecutor and his testimony to how horrific he finds  it, even as a veteran prosecutor, should tell all the Members all they  need to know about how important it is to pass this bill and start  doing what the United Kingdom and Australia are already doing, and that  is getting after the people who would import this kind of trash into  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6029) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 to reauthorize the comprehensive opioid abuse grant  program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6029         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reauthorizing and Extending       Grants for Recovery from Opioid Use Programs Act of 2018'' or       the ``REGROUP Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE OPIOID ABUSE                     GRANT PROGRAM.         Section 1001(a)(27) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10261(a)(27)) is amended by       striking ``through 2021'' and inserting ``and 2018, and       $330,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6029, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in July 2016, Congress enacted the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act, otherwise known as CARA. The statistics  then were shocking, and, unfortunately, they have not yet subsided. In  2016, more than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, including  illicit drugs and prescription opioids. This figure has nearly doubled  in the past decade.   Part of CARA created a comprehensive opioid abuse reduction program  at the Department of Justice which directs Federal resources for drug  abuse programs targeted at the opioid problem within our criminal  justice system.   By establishing this competitive grant program, CARA gives States and  localities maximum flexibility to attack opioid abuse issues unique to  their communities. States are now able to use the grant funds for a  variety of important criminal justice programs, including alternatives  to incarceration, treatment programs for incarcerated individuals,  juvenile opioid abuse, investigation and enforcement of drug  trafficking and distribution laws, and significant training for first  responders in carrying and administering opioid overdose reversal  drugs, like naloxone. States can enlist nonprofit organizations,  including faith-based organizations, in the fight against opioid abuse.   In 2016, CARA authorized this new program at $103 million annually  over 5 years. However, 3 months ago, Congress tripled that  authorization to $330 million, including funds for drug courts, mental  health courts, residential drug abuse treatment for State prisoners,  and veterans' treatment courts. Therefore, the bill before us results  in no net increase in spending authorizations and no additional burden  on the American taxpayer, which is a responsible, good government  approach to this epidemic.   This bill reauthorizes the CARA program through 2023, so we can make  sure there is no lapse in our efforts against drug addiction.   While Members of this body should be proud of our accomplishments,  there is still much more work to do. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill and thereby reassure all Americans that we are committed to  fighting the opioid epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), whom I failed to note in  my opening remarks is the chief sponsor of this legislation and someone  very dedicated to addressing problems with opioid abuse.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I, too, want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).  I want to thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member of the Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee for her  dedication to addressing this very serious problem.   I want to urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this  fine legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
