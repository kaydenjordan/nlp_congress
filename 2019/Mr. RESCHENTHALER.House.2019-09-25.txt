 Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I served  as a magisterial district judge. I was on the front line of the  criminal justice system, and I handled preliminary hearings for sexual  assault and rape cases. Let me tell you, these crimes are incredibly  heinous, and stories from the victims are absolutely heartbreaking.   Many of these victims went through a grueling evidence collection  process in the hopes they would help catch their rapist. Unfortunately,  this evidence often sits untested on shelves for months to years while  sexual assault victims wait for justice and their rapists roam the  streets. This is especially dangerous because those who commit sexual  assault are likely to do it again. They are typically habitual  offenders. So when we delay the testing of these kits, we do so at the  expense and the risk of others being sexually assaulted.   So that is where the Debbie Smith Act comes in. The Debbie Smith Act  provides funding for DNA testing and training to eliminate the backlog  of untested DNA and rape kit evidence. Since 2004 nearly 200,000 DNA  matches have been made thanks to the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant  Program. Again, that is over 200,000 DNA matches since 2004. But  without congressional action, this legislation is set to expire on  Monday.    The Senate recognized the critical need to reauthorize this bill.  They passed this bill back in May and sent it to the House for  consideration, but, unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues refuse to  bring this bill to the floor. They would rather play politics than put  criminals in jail.   This is absolutely despicable. Sexual assault victims have been  through enough. We should not hold this up for funding so that  Democrats can score cheap political points with their radical, far-left  base.   So I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reexamine  their priorities and help us get justice for these crime victims. This  issue is too important for partisan games.
