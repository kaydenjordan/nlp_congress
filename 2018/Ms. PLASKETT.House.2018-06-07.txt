 Mr. Speaker, last year's natural disasters in the U.S.  Virgin Islands have left thousands of properties damaged and destroyed.  The vast majority of those homes, businesses, and critical  infrastructure have yet to be repaired.   It is imperative that any funds authorized and intended to be  allocated for the Virgin Islands be released to the territory  immediately.   While the Federal funding does not include the full amount or all of  the requests of the Virgin Islands, it will help substantially in the  rebuilding efforts to create better housing opportunities, to help  build a resilient utility system, burying lines, creating microgrids,  and implementing renewables in our energy portfolio.   Due to the tenuous position of the U.S. territories, the U.S. Virgin  Islands has been unable to pay contractors up front for critical  repairs. We don't have the millions to pay up front and seek  reimbursement from the government.   Treasury and its Secretary has been unwilling to lend us or loan us,  under reasonable terms, the money that Congress allocated for us to be  loaned.   I am requesting that the Federal Emergency Management Agency expedite  the release of the funds to the Sheltering and Temporary Essential  Power pilot program immediately so that project contractors and  subcontractors may be paid as soon as possible and recovery efforts  continue.   Mr. Speaker, when contractors lay off workers, our economy falters.  And as hurricane season is beginning, this needs to be done now.                            ____________________
