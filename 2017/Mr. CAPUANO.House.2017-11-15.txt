 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am a  former tax lawyer. My wife is a practicing CPA. We have heard this  before: simplification is going to help. It has never put a single  accountant out of business, and it won't do it now. It is another part  of the big scam going on.   Why? Sure, I will probably get a tax break out of this; some of my  constituents will. But what do we get in return? We don't get  healthcare. We don't get better roads. We don't get better education.  But we do provide a $5,000 to $10,000 debt for our children. We do tell  our seniors: Too bad if you have a heart attack or cancer; no more  medical deductions for you. We tell our current graduate students: Too  bad, no deductions for you. And on and on and on.    And by the way, we have a new provision in here that I like to call  the ``Dynasty Protection Act.'' Why? Because if you have a dynasty, if  you are worth $30-, $40-, $50-, $100 million, your children get to keep  it all. Not because they have done anything, but because they won the  genetic lottery. Good for them.   And then if they do get up off their butt and get a job, maybe start  a hedge fund with all the money they inherited, they get another tax  credit by not touching the special tax deals--you have the hedge fund  managers. And if they earn a little extra money, they get to keep more  of it because there is no alternative minimum tax left.   I know that President Trump will particularly appreciate that  provision because we all know--the only tax return we have seen--the  AMT cost him $31 million. So thank you from the rich.   Now, I don't have any problem with people being wealthy. I represent  many of them. They don't want this tax cut because they know it is bad  for America.    Mr. Speaker, as a final insult, the corporate tax you  have encourages businesses to send jobs offshore by not taxing profits  made offshore when they expand jobs, if they do. They will do it  offshore, not here in America.
