 Madam Speaker, the American supply chain crisis has  reached a very critical point. A record number of container ships are  waiting to enter U.S. ports, especially off of L.A. and Long Beach.  They even miss the trip up to Oakland sometimes, too.   This leaves small businesses and grocery stores with empty shelves.  It leaves farmers and others that produce things in California and the  U.S. waiting and wondering if they can get their products on to ships.   At the same time, reckless spending has caused inflation for  Americans to skyrocket. Food on the shelves is more expensive. This  isn't just a problem for upper-class people, as some in the  administration are saying. This hits all Americans, especially those on  fixed incomes, really hard.   Now, a good thing, everyone saved 16 cents on their Fourth of July  barbecue that the Biden administration was touting recently; though  Thanksgiving is predicted to be the most expensive meal in the history  of the holiday this year.   The current inflation rate has forced households to spend another  $175 a month on food, fuel, and housing; let alone what is coming in  the home heating oil this winter.   Inflation has climbed over 6 percent in the last year, making it the  worst year since 1990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   We need to get to work solving this problem for the American people,  not focusing on unprecedented spending sprees.   Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.                            ____________________
