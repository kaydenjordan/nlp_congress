 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I want to celebrate in advance Texas  Independence Day on March 2, 1836.  [[Page H905]]    They say everything is better in Texas. Let me just tell you, I am  here to confirm that that rumor is true. More correctly, it is no  longer a rumor.   We have a saying in Texas, and that goes like this: It ain't bragging  if it's facts, and that's the facts about Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be joined by my good Texas friends from  both sides of the aisle to celebrate Texas Independence Day.   On March 2, 1836, that was the day the Republic of Texas was born.  During the Texas Revolution, a convention of 59 Texans met at  Washington-on-the-Brazos and declared our independence of Texas from  Mexico. The declaration decried the arbitrary acts of oppression and  tyranny from the Mexican Government under the dictator General Antonio  Lopez de Santa Anna.   In particular, it noted that the government had ``ceased to protect  the lives, liberty, and property of the people from whom its legitimate  powers are derived.''   The Texans signing that declaration sought to protect our rights of  free speech, our rights to keep and bear arms--sounds familiar--and our  rights of freedom of religion.   I am proud to report these same freedoms still hold true in Texas  today.   March 2 is a day that all Texans come together and celebrate the  calls of ``Come and Take It'' and ``Remember the Alamo.'' We remember  and honor the pioneering, independent, trailblazing spirit of the great  State of Texas.   Independence has flowed through the veins of Texans ever since. May  our thirst for freedom never die, and may we and our offspring always  remember that freedom is worth fighting for.   Mr. Speaker, just like those iconic frontier days, we are still at  work using what my grandfather--who came over on a boat from Germany,  by the way, in 1903--what my grandfather called good old-fashioned  Texas horse sense to get the job done. You tell kids that today, ``good  old-fashioned horse sense,'' and they look at you funny. They call it  common sense. The sad fact of the matter is that common sense isn't  very common these days, but in Texas, it is still alive and doing quite  well.   Before turning it over to my fellow Texans here tonight, I would like  to share two of my favorite quotes from Davy Crockett, who was a Member  of Congress from Tennessee. His first quote is: ``I must say as to what  I have seen of Texas, it is the garden spot of the world, the best land  and best prospects for health I ever saw, and I do so believe it is a  fortune to any man to come here.''   Of course, when Crockett ran for reelection to the U.S. House of  Representatives, he got defeated. Then he uttered his second, probably  more famous quote. He said to the people who voted him out: Of course,  I may not know what you all want to do. I am going to Texas. Y'all can  all go to hell.   I am just quoting Davy Crockett, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a Texan and even prouder to represent  the great people of Texas here in Washington. As the song says, ``God  Bless Texas.''   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), who is  also my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my distinct honor to have  one of our newest stars from Texas, Ms. De La Cruz, come share with us.   Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to honor our  heroes of the Texas Revolution.   On February 24, 1836, over 187 years ago, a group of Texians and  Tejanos were surrounded by General Santa Anna in a little mission known  around the world as the Alamo.   It is my high honor to read Lieutenant Colonel William Travis'  stirring words.   ``Commandancy of the Alamo Bejar, February 24, 1836. To the People of  Texas and All Americans in the World--Fellow Citizens and Compatriots:  I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I  have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and  have not lost a man.   ``The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion; otherwise, the  garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken. I have  answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves  proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I  call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism, and everything dear  to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. The  enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to  3,000 or 4,000 in 4 or 5 days.   ``If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as  long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due  to his own honor and that of his country.   ``Victory or death. William Barret Travis, Lieutenant Colonel  Commandant.   ``P.S. The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight, we  had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses  80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves.  Travis.''   We know that the Texans lost this battle, but they did not lose the  war. Cries of ``Remember the Alamo'' swept across the land, and from  these ashes arose a nation, a land built on faith, family, and freedom.                                time  2015    I stand here in Congress as a proud Tejana and encourage my fellow  Texans to remember the fearless men and women who built this land, our  land, known worldwide as Texas.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Self), another rising star in the Texas  delegation.    Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize  another fellow Texan who has been very instrumental in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa), a good friend of ours.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, a little historic perspective of what Congressman  LaMalfa was saying. When you think about how Texas came into the Union,  he called it annexation, but the truth of the matter is, Texas came  into the Union unlike any other State in the history of the world,  really. All the other States were annexed. Texas was a republic, so we  came in by treaty. Of course we did. We had to do it our own way.    If you think back to that time, Mr. Speaker, things were happening  really fast. After America won its independence in 1781, the battle of  Yorktown, some 30 years later, I guess, or 40 years later, Mexico, in  1821, won its independence from Spain. A scant 15 years later, the  Texicans, as we were called, won our independence from Mexico.   Now, when Congressman LaMalfa was talking about annexation, how  annexation was happening fast--of course, Pete Sessions was right.  Texas entered the Union as the 28th State on December 29, 1845. I think  about that, Mr. Speaker, from time to time.   What was the legislature of Texas thinking back then when we had a  chance to annex the rest of the United States? What were they thinking?   But nonetheless, that is what they did.   It is my distinct pleasure now to bring up another rising star in the  Texas delegation, Nathaniel Moran.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Moran).    Mr. Speaker, I will say all of our speakers today  laid out an exact reason why Texans love freedom and why they are  willing to fight for freedom at any cost.   We need to be teaching our children that freedom isn't free. I hope  we are. Texans get it. Freedom isn't free.   I want to end by saying: May all the United States join us in  reclaiming what the song says so eloquently: ``God blessed Texas.'' I  say amen and amen.   Congratulations, Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
