 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 375, the Payment Integrity  Information Act. I was proud to introduce H.R. 5389, the House  companion to this bill, earlier this year.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman, Mr. Meadows, as well as  Representatives Cheri Bustos and   Greg Gianforte for their work on  this bill.   My constituents sent me here to Congress to represent some of the  hardest working, creative, and entrepreneurial folks in our country.  Every day, I work to protect the hard-earned dollars of these families,  and I remain committed to ensuring that the Federal Government is a  good steward of their tax dollars.   In fiscal year 2018 alone, the Government Accountability Office  estimated that improper payments throughout the Federal Government  totaled $151 billion. Since 2003, when agencies were first directed to  begin reporting improper payments, cumulative improper payments  estimated across government have totaled $1.4 trillion.   These improper payments can be overpayments, underpayments, payments  made to ineligible parties, or payments that were not properly  documented. Frankly, it is outrageous.   Whether it is overpaying a defense contractor or underpaying a senior  on their Social Security benefits, the Federal Government has an  obligation to put commonsense policies in place to end these improper  payments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan  and commonsense bill to tackle Federal waste, fraud, and abuse so that  we can make room to fund the priorities that Minnesota families care so  much about, like special education and addressing our crumbling  infrastructure.
