 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Heller  amendment No. 1146. Amendment No. 1146 provides tax relief for families  with children. This week we are setting in motion one of my top  legislative priorities in the Senate; that is, to bring tax relief to  American families.   For decades, Nevadans have been waiting for an affordable and fair  tax code that they can understand, and I have long said that the Tax  Code is too costly and too complex. We need to simplify our code in a  way that creates jobs and allows Nevadans to keep more of their hard- earned tax dollars. With this budget, we are taking an enormous first  step in providing meaningful relief to Nevadans and middle-class  families across the Nation.   Under our leadership and thanks to the work of the chairman of the  Budget Committee, we are finally in a place where we can provide real,  meaningful tax relief for all of America. As a member of the Senate  Finance Committee, I have been working with my colleagues to craft a  tax bill that accomplishes three major goals. The first is to create  more jobs; No. 2 is to increase wages; and, finally, No. 3 is to boost  American competitiveness.   So the question is, What does tax reform mean to an average Nevadan  who works hard and is trying to provide a better life for themselves  and for their children? It means you can keep more of your hard-earned  paycheck, and it will be easier for you to file your taxes, less  paperwork, more money. Lower rates for businesses mean more jobs, they  mean higher wages, and they mean growth in our communities, all of  which will benefit you.   As the son of a school cook and an auto mechanic, I understand  discipline and hard work--all of it--that goes into every dollar and  every paycheck, and I am working to see that we have more of it in your  back pocket. That is why my amendment is absolutely critical, because  it delivers this desperately needed relief and lets the middle-class  families keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, helping them make  ends meet and invest in their families.   For too long, American families have been struggling with stagnant  wages and incomes, as well as slow economic growth made worse by the  policies of the Obama administration. In inflation-adjusted terms,  nationwide median household incomes stayed below what it was in 2007  all the way up to 2015. Last year, it was only $890 more than it was in  2007. In my home State of Nevada, the situation is even worse. Median  household income still hasn't fully recovered and is $7,000 lower today  than it was in 2007.   Tax relief for families with children, through an enhanced child tax  credit, for example, will help begin to address the financial  insecurities facing American families and will help families confront  the rising cost of raising children. Expansion of the child tax credit  will help hard-working, middle-class families in many ways, allowing  them to keep more of their hard-earned income to use for the needs of  their families and for their children.   I urge everyone in this Chamber to support children, I urge them to  support middle-class families, and I urge them to support my amendment.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                               Las Vegas Strong     Mr. President, I rise today still in shock, still in  mourning over the events of October 1, when 58 people--some of them  Nevadans, many of them visitors to our State--were brutally gunned down  by a madman on the Las Vegas Strip.   In addition to those horrible deaths, almost 500 people were injured.  Many of them face long roads to physical recovery and an even longer  and more painful road to emotional recovery. I know I speak for all of  my Senate colleagues in praying for them and wishing them the quickest  recovery possible.   This madman's actions devastated our city, but I rise today to tell  you that the sense of devastation is being replaced by a renewed sense  of community, a renewed sense of family, of unity, of faith, and a  renewed sense of strength. I have had the honor of experiencing it  firsthand in the eyes and the voices of those who survived and those  who chose to stay in harm's way to help each other when they could have  fled to safety. I have heard and seen this renewed sense of community  and strength in the faces of our first responders, none of whom have  ever encountered anything as horrific as the carnage of October 1 but  who plunged into danger to save lives. Because? Because that is what  they do.   I had the privilege of meeting a Las Vegas police officer, Sergeant  Jonathan Riddle, who was stationed a block from the shooting scene  doing traffic work. When he first heard the popping noises, like most  of the concertgoers, he thought it was fireworks, but the second volley  told him otherwise, and his training kicked in. He grabbed his rifle  and he sprinted toward the chaos. Keep in mind, this police officer  knew, through his training, that heavy-caliber bullets were being fired  and that his protective vest would not stop them. He also knew his  rifle was useless because the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay,  and he couldn't shoot at the hotel for fear of hitting an innocent  bystander. So he was, for all intents and purposes, defenseless. He  knew it, but he ran anyway. He ran toward the violence. He ran toward  it with one purpose, to help in any way he could.   It is almost not fair to single him out because dozens of metro  police officers did the same thing, and firefighters, paramedics, and  ambulance drivers  [[Page S6527]]  also. It was not just professional first responders who emerged as true  heroes on October 1. Taylor Winston, a marine, was just trying to enjoy  the concert that night, but when the bullets started raining down, he  was driven by his training, his instincts, his compassion for his  fellow human beings. He helped several people over a fence where they  took cover, but he realized the danger wasn't over. Looking around, he  spotted a pickup truck with a long bed. He borrowed the truck. I use  the term ``borrowed'' loosely. He loaded the back of it with injured  people and rushed them to the hospital, but he wasn't done. He made a  return trip, loaded the pickup again with wounded individuals and got  them to the hospital.   Jack Beaton's last act on Earth was one of sacrifice and heroism. He  draped himself over his wife, protecting her from the deadly bullets.  He told her he loved her, then was hit and died in her arms.   Jonathan Smith shouted warnings when he realized what was happening,  but when some people were too stunned to move toward safety, Jonathan  moved toward them, getting them out of the line of fire. That is when  Jonathan himself was hit. He survived but will likely always have a  bullet lodged in his neck. It is a painful reminder of his heroics, but  I hope it will also remind him of the people he saved.   John, a cab driver, accelerated toward the screams and the chaos and  shouted for a frightened group of girls to jump into his cab, and he  drove them to safety. Then John turned around and drove back to the  shooting scene and transported another group to safety. In all, John  possibly saved 11 lives.   There was a woman at the concert, a respiratory therapist, who had  her cell phone shattered by a bullet while the cell phone was still in  her hand. Shards of hard plastic tore through her hand and embedded in  her skin. What did she do? She pulled the shards out of her hand,  bandaged herself up, and rushed to the hospital where she worked to try  to help other people more badly injured.   At our local hospitals, doctors and nurses worked miracles around the  clock. When operating rooms were not available, they treated the  wounded in hallways. Surrounded by shouting, crying, chaos, and blood,  they saved one life after another after another. Their skill, their  composure, their dedication to saving lives was stronger that night  than the evil intentions of the madman with a rifle.   I was walking the hallway of one of our hospitals with the hospital's  CEO when a woman rushed toward him, grabbed him by the arm, and through  tears and sobs, thanked him for the work his staff had done. Her niece  had been wounded, but she was heading home. She said she could never  thank the hospital staff enough.   In the aftermath, the community banded together to provide every  resource possible to the victims and their families. The Las Vegas  Convention Center's South Hall was dedicated to family reunification  and support services. Airlines answered the call to provide free  flights to the families of victims. Hotels and casinos across Las Vegas  offered free rooms. The American Red Cross partnered with the Mirage to  host a blood drive. Millions of dollars have been raised by local  businesses and people across the country to support the victims.   The employees of Mandalay Bay and other MGM resort properties were  understandably stricken and horrified by the shooting, but they too  asked how they could help. Instead of being frozen by their shock and  grief, they mobilized--donating blood, offering help to the families of  the victims, organizing memorials, and otherwise coming together as a  team, motivated by compassion and selflessness and providing comfort  and solace.   True leaders have emerged in the wake of this tragedy. My friend  Sheriff Joe Lombardo, head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police  Department, has been steadfast in this crisis. He will always be  remembered as a rock-solid presence when our city most needed one.   Let me say this for the world to hear. Our great city will not cower  in fear because of this horrible act. We will mourn, we will heal, we  will comfort each other, and we will pray, but make no mistake about  it, Las Vegas is open for business. Las Vegas will not simply go on,  but we will thrive. So come to Las Vegas, and maybe come away with a  greater appreciation of what our city, our people are all about. From  the blood and the horror, the terror, the carnage of October 1, Las  Vegas has risen.   We have never shied away from our image as a city of entertainment.  Our hospitality defines us, but the world has now seen a side much more  profound--something we have always seen--and that is a home, a family,  a community of people who will stand by each other during the darkest  moments, a community of people bound by faith who will stand in the  face of danger to protect a neighbor, a friend, a family member, or  someone they have never met.   Everyone around the world has heard of Las Vegas. The very name  conjures images almost immediately. Its skyline cannot be mistaken for  any other. Yet prior to October 1, almost no one knew the true Las  Vegas, the Las Vegas we are seeing now, a city that responds to  cowardly violence with love and compassion for each other, a city that  responds to hatred with faith and strength. ``Las Vegas Strong'' is a  slogan we are now seeing on billboards, marquees, and T-shirts, but  behind that slogan is a true story of true strength. It is a story of a  city growing, emerging, and becoming closer and more united.   A deranged man with a rifle brought death and carnage and terror to  Las Vegas, but today Las Vegas stands stronger. Las Vegas stands  unafraid. Las Vegas's true identity has been revealed, and it is one of  compassion and one of heroism. It is my hope that we will honor the  memory of those lost by holding on to the sense of unity and family  that has emerged since October 1 and that we will, all of us, continue  to be Las Vegas Strong.   May God bless the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and may God  bless the United States of America.   I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.                           Las Vegas mass Shooting    Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, as the newest Senator from the  Silver State, I am humbled to serve and represent my fellow Nevadans.  We Nevadans are very proud of our State, its people, and the spirit of  self-reliance and community that guides us every single day. We are  proud of the vastness and beauty of our rural counties and the energy  and diversity of our cities, such as Reno and my hometown, Las Vegas.   When I was preparing to deliver my maiden speech before this body, my  intention was to honor the Silver State's history and people, as well  as share the issues I had planned to fight for while I am here in  Congress--issues that matter to hard-working Nevadans. That speech was  meant to celebrate Nevada's founding and values, to declare the basic  right of every individual to education and affordable healthcare, to  remind my colleagues of the dignity of equality and the right to marry  whomever you love. That speech was meant to proclaim the dignity of  women and their right to make their own health choices, to defend the  right of immigrants and Dreamers to live in our country without fear,  and to call on this body to fight for American values, including  diversity and inclusion. That speech was meant to demand that our  country's leaders respect every American, regardless of the color of  their skin or how they choose to worship.   Unfortunately, my maiden speech on the floor of this body will  instead talk about mass murder. Today I want to recognize the courage  of heroes and first responders and honor the wounded and those  murdered. I want to recognize the fundamental dignity of every American  in this age of violence, rancor, and ignorance, the dignity of  Americans not to be slaughtered by other Americans just for walking  outside and attending a conference.   With over 43 million visitors per year, Las Vegas prides itself on  warmly welcoming people from all around the world to revel in what we  have to offer. Hospitality, in every sense of the word, defines who we  are. When travelers come to Las Vegas, they plan to enjoy themselves in  the company of loved ones and friends and become a part of our Nevada  family.   On October 1, a man attacked that family by smashing two windows in  his  [[Page S6528]]  32nd floor hotel suite and unleashing a barrage of bullets onto 22,000  people attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival. In 10 minutes, 58  innocent people were massacred, and more than 500 people were injured.   At first, concertgoers confused the rapid gunfire for fireworks. The  grim realization that repetitive bursts were not fireworks but bullets,  came as those in the crowd began to collapse, one after another, and  blood began to stain the ground. This was a concert on the Las Vegas  Strip, but it looked more like a battlefield. These were innocent  people.   The human cost of this atrocious act of terrorism is incalculable.  Children lost parents. Parents lost children. Friends lost friends.  Those who survived the ordeal must not only heal from physical wounds  but cope with the mental scars that will haunt them forever.   I will never forget the stories I heard walking through our hospitals  and meeting with our first responders and those recovering from their  wounds. Entire emergency room and hallway floors were stained with  blood. A recovery room in one of our hospitals was turned into a  makeshift morgue. A victim's phone rang continuously with calls from  her father, who would soon learn that she would never be coming home.    There is one life story cut short for each of the 58 people killed  that night. We have come to learn their stories--stories of sacrifice,  of courage, and of love.   A young man died after taking the bullets that would have ended his  girlfriend's life. A security guard was killed on the job. As bullets  ripped through the night sky and bodies began falling to the ground, he  took responsibility for keeping the public safe by directing the  panicked crowd. He made the ultimate sacrifice--protecting others.   With approximately 2 million residents, the Las Vegas area is not a  small town, but this tragedy has shown just how strong and connected  our community is. It goes beyond Las Vegas. There are so many  communities across this country that were injured by this tragedy in  some way. Many of those killed and injured were visitors to Las Vegas.  All Nevadans grieve for those dead and are doing what they can to help  the survivors.   Mr. Rogers has a timeless quote:         Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are       helping.    As we embrace others and the families of those wounded and those  murdered, we also recognize so many in the community who helped. Even  in the middle of the attack, there were helpers who shielded strangers  from bullets and helpers who led people out of the concert venue. There  were helpers who plugged strangers' bullet wounds with their fingers.   There were helpers like Jonathan. Despite receiving a gunshot wound  to the neck, Jonathan saved the lives of 30 people by leading them out  of the venue and aiding them in taking cover. He did this even after  losing sight of his own family.   Jonathan later said: ``I decided I'm not going to leave anybody  behind.''   There were helpers like Taylor, an Iraq war veteran, who turned a  parked utility van into an ambulance. After climbing a fence as he fled  the gunfire, he came across the vehicle, and he knew what he had to do.  Before first responders arrived, Taylor drove roughly 30 people to area  hospitals.   There were other helpers, like Tami, also an Iraq war veteran, who  stayed behind to help victims on the ground. Tami used her ER nursing  experience to triage those who were immobile because of their injuries.  Despite her best efforts, Tami couldn't save one young woman and had  the heartbreaking task of telling a mother that her daughter was dead.   Tami said:         I'll never forget that girl's face. I had to tell the mom       that her daughter had gone.    In the toughest of circumstances, the promptness, efficiency, and  professionalism of Southern Nevada's first responders and medical  community saved many lives and ensured that this tragedy did not  escalate into a further loss of life.   Andrew, an ambulance dispatcher, calmly and purposefully directed his  team despite it being his first day in his new role.   There were doctors across our valley who did not need a call to rush  to our hospitals to help. There were nurses who stayed long past their  shifts to help care for and comfort the wounded, and our police  officers and firefighters ran toward the bullets to help. These first  responders, doctors, and nurses knew some of the people they were  helping.   The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Clark County Fire  Department, American Medical Response, MedicWest Ambulance, Community  Ambulance, University Medical Center, Sunrise Hospital and Medical  Center, The Valley Health System, and Dignity Health deserve our  deepest thanks for their valor and their unmatched bravery.   I also honor and thank the Red Cross and the Department of Veterans  Affairs, which brought mobile units to our hospitals, and the volunteer  mental health counselors who came from all over the country to help  provide comfort and support. I will never forget their dedication as  our community grappled with this senseless tragedy.   In the days that followed, our community's compassionate response  showed the world who we are as Las Vegans. So many unnamed heroes in  our community stood for hours in line to donate blood. They came to the  family reunification center and gave food and water and clothing-- whatever they could--to help families and those who were wounded.  Artists and volunteers created beautiful memorials and prayerful spaces  for honor and grief. Local businesses, as well as airlines like  Allegiant and Southwest and medical providers like The Valley Health  System, MedicWest, and American Medical Response, made sure that the  families of the slain as well as the wounded were provided help,  support, and relief from medical bills and travel costs. In less than a  week, dedicated volunteers built a beautiful remembrance wall and  planted a healing garden for all of us to express our grief, reflect,  and to remember.   Our city also received an outpouring of support and solidarity from  countless fellow Americans, State governments, and foreign embassies. I  was personally touched by the outpouring of support from my colleagues  in this Chamber, and I thank them for it.   The people of Las Vegas came together to heal and protect their  community, but they cannot do it all on their own. It has been  difficult for all of us to understand the events of the past 2 weeks,  but one thing is clear: We cannot stand by and do nothing.   As a lifelong Las Vegan, I have never seen such a profound community  response. In the midst of such horror, I am so proud of my community,  and I continue to be amazed at the strength and spirit that will help  move us forward. But they need our help. The time has come for the  people in this room--all of us--to do our part to keep our communities  safe.   Over the past few weeks, I have heard my colleagues saying things  like ``no law could have stopped that'' or ``you can't legislate away  evil.'' While that may be true, we are not helpless. When something bad  happens, we can always take steps to understand what happened and work  together to find a way to stop a future tragedy. Listen, we cannot stop  every shooting, but we can do something to prevent these senseless mass  murders.   Just over a year ago, 49 people were murdered at a nightclub in  Orlando--then, the deadliest shooting in modern history. My hometown of  Las Vegas has now broken that record with 58 men and women being  murdered by 1 man with multiple guns that were rigged for combat. This  is a horrific distinction to bear.   Will we stand by and wait for the next community to break that  record?   In our communities every day, Americans make commonsense decisions to  protect their health and safety. They lock their doors. They set their  alarms. They go to their doctors for annual check-ups. They wear  seatbelts. After the worst attack on American soil on September 11,  2001, we reshaped the way we protect our country and our way of life.   Now, in the wake of the worst mass shooting in modern American  history, I am calling on my colleagues to work with me to take  reasonable, concrete steps to reduce the likelihood of another  senseless shooting massacre on American soil.  [[Page S6529]]    Do not get me wrong. The people of Las Vegas are grateful to have the  thoughts and prayers of nearly every Member of Congress, but thoughts  and prayers alone are not enough. Now it is time for action--meaningful  action--to prevent mass murders.   Let me be very clear. This is not about taking away guns. I grew up  in a family of gun owners and hunters. My father was a member of Ducks  Unlimited. I have family members who are avid sportsmen, including an  uncle who was a member of the Nevada Bighorns Unlimited. My husband is  a retired Secret Service agent. We are proud gun owners. I believe that  Americans have the right to own guns.   But with the right to own a gun comes a shared responsibility to  ensure that weapons do not fall into the hands of dangerous people. The  right to own a gun must be balanced by the right of every American to  be able to go out in public without having the fear that he will be  shot and killed at a church, in a movie theater, in a classroom, in a  nightclub, on a baseball field, or at a concert. The right to own a gun  is important, and equally important is the right not to be killed by  someone who has no business owning a gun.   The Second Amendment calls for gun ownership in defense of the  security of America, not to terrorize its citizens. Congress has the  responsibility to keep weapons that are designed for our military out  of the hands of mass murderers. When we took office, each of us swore  an oath to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution. That means that we  are sworn to protect the lives and liberty of the American people.   Are we keeping that promise?   If there are commonsense, reasonable, proven steps that we can take  to keep innocent people from dying at the hands of mass murderers, why  wouldn't we take them? Why wouldn't we pass legislation that the  majority of Americans supports? Why wouldn't we ban the tools used to  kill and injure almost 600 people in the space of 10 minutes?   Many place blame with the strength of organizations like the National  Rifle Association and other allied interest groups. Yet a recent poll  finds that 93 percent of voters in gun households support universal  background checks. Count me as part of that 93 percent. Congress is not  going to repeal the Second Amendment, but its Members need to find the  courage to be honest that there is a problem.   I echo my colleague Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who gave his  maiden speech on this very same topic in 2013, right after the horrific  massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He said that he never  expected to find himself talking about guns in his maiden speech, but  the issue of gun violence found him. I am devastated to say that the  issue of gun violence found me too. It found the city of Las Vegas  along with finding everyone else in the State of Nevada. It has already  found other Members of this body and their neighbors across the  country.   Like Senator Murphy, I am making it my mission to prevent another  tragedy like this one from ever happening again. We should return to  commonsense principles as we determine how to move forward.   One, guns should not be available to people who are mentally ill,  have a history of violence, or are suspected terrorists.   Two, everyone who buys a firearm should undergo a background check-- no exceptions for people who buy from online retailers, gun shows, or  private dealers. We cannot enforce our laws if we are not running  background checks to determine who is trying to buy a firearm.   Three, certain military-style accessories that are necessary for war  zones simply do not need to be in our communities.   As Members of this body are aware, the mass shooting in my hometown  was made all the more lethal because of what is referred to as a bump  stock--a tool that is designed to turn a semiautomatic rifle into an  even deadlier weapon in order to kill as many people as possible and  rain gunfire down on 22,000 concertgoers. This Chamber should speak in  a unified voice that these tools do not belong in our country. This has  nothing to do with infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law- abiding gun owners. You do not need a bump stock to hunt unless you are  hunting people. If we do nothing now, there will be more massacres. We  will see more fathers without daughters, more mothers without sons, and  more sisters without brothers.   The time has come to ask ourselves: Who will really be at fault the  next time something like this happens? Will it be the deranged killer  who used a loophole to get his hands on a deadly weapon or the people  who failed to close that loophole when they had the chance?   My colleagues are right in that we cannot legislate away mental  illness, and we cannot legislate away evil, but we can legislate to  prevent murder. We can take smart, sensible steps to keep Americans  safe. We can work together with gun owners and citizens against gun  violence to make Americans safer.   To my colleagues who are undecided, I invite you to come to the  hospitals with me in Las Vegas. Hear from the people who came to Las  Vegas for a night of fun and country music and who will have to live  with emotional and physical scars for the rest of their lives.   Hear from Dana, who will never see her fiance again. Hear from  Lindsey, who will never see her sister again. Hear from Hannah's three  children, who will never see their mother again.   I spent much of the last 2 weeks talking with families of those who  were wounded or killed. That Monday night after the massacre, I  remember hugging a mother and father who were looking for their 26- year-old daughter at the family reunification center. They had gone to  all of the area hospitals with the hope that they might find their  daughter alive. Their final hope that night, if you want to call it  that, was waiting in the reunification center for the call from the  coroner's office to see if their daughter's body had been identified.   It so easily could have been my family, frantically searching,  waiting, and grieving in that center. My niece was at that concert.   The people of Las Vegas responded to the worst tragedy our city has  ever seen with unprecedented bravery, selflessness, and compassion. We  are Vegas Strong.   It is long past time for Congress to follow their example and the  example of so many other communities in our country touched by this  violence and, finally, to summon the strength to get something done and  reduce gun violence in America.   Let's not ignore the lives of those murdered or those wounded. Let's  actually come together and agree that we must do something to honor all  of the daughters, mothers, sons, fathers, sisters, brothers, and  friends we have already lost to senseless gun violence.   It is time for us to move beyond resolutions. We must now have a new  resolve to protect the basic freedom and safety of all Americans.   Work with me. Reach out to my office so that we can find common  ground and finally offer the American people something more than just  our thoughts and prayers. Let's get something done in honor of the  loved ones who are still with us, the family members and friends we  would do anything to protect, the people in our lives we could not bear  to lose.   I ask my colleagues to work with me. Work with me to prevent this  from ever happening again.   Mr. President, thank you for listening.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize Don  Carano, one of northern Nevada's most influential figures, a great  business leader, and a man I am privileged to have called a friend. Don  recently passed away peacefully at the age of 85.  [[Page S6533]]    My sincerest condolences go out to his family, friends, and loved  ones. All of northern Nevada mourns the loss of Mr. Carano, who helped  make Reno a better place to live and work, not only for his employees,  but for the entire community.   Throughout his life, Mr. Carano was a caring, giving man who charted  his own path as an entrepreneur. Some of his businesses include  Eldorado Resorts, Ferrari-Carano Vineyards and Winery, and the McDonald  Carano law firm. Mr. Carano was also instrumental in the construction  of the National Bowling Stadium and the Reno Events Center in downtown  Reno.   Born in Reno, Mr. Carano went to Southside Elementary School,  Billinghurst Junior High School, and Reno High School before earning  his college degree and serving in the U.S. Army for 2 years as an  officer. Thereafter, Mr. Carano completed law school at the University  of San Francisco and began his law practice in Reno. In 1973, he opened  the Eldorado Hotel Casino, the first major casino to open on Virginia  Street north of the railroad tracks, which changed the profile of  gaming in northern Nevada.   Mr. Carano's many contributions and honors include the International  Gaming and Wagering Business Hall of Fame, Nevada Food and Beverage  Directors Association Man of the Year awards, the American Lung  Association Distinguished Community Service Award, Hotelier of the Year  Award, ``Knight in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic'' by the  Consul General of Italy, University of San Francisco Law School's  Alumnus of the Year, International Restaurant and Hospitality Rating  Bureau's Lifetime Achievement Award, the WIBC Gladys M. Banker  Friendship Award, and many more. Just this year, Mr. Carano was  recognized as a ``Distinguished Nevadan'' by the University of Nevada,  Reno.   As Nevada's senior Senator, I thank Mr. Carano and his family for  their decades of work in helping make Reno the thriving, booming,  biggest little city that it is today. I ask all of my colleagues to  join me in memorializing Mr. Carano and the legacy he leaves behind.  Lynne and my family give our deepest sympathies to his wife, Rhonda,  his five children Gary, Gene, Glenn, Gregg, and Cindy, 11  grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren as they cope with this great  loss.                            ____________________
