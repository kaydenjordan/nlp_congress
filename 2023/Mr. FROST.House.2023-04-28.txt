 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud adoptee, a son with  two loving parents who provided me with all the love and support a  child could ever ask for.   Yet, I heard in this Chamber a few days ago someone saying my parents  aren't real parents.   Let me be clear: I am their child. They are my parents. For bigoted,  closed-minded reasons, certain folks have decided that people who adopt  their children are lesser than.   Make no mistake, whether you adopted your child, had biological  children, or found your chosen family in some other way, you are a  parent.   Because I haven't seen any of my Republican colleagues in this  Chamber condemn these disgusting comments, I hope that they don't also  agree with it because I won't allow anyone in this Chamber to  disrespect my family or yours.   Directly to the people who have opened up their hearts and homes to  children ready for their embrace, don't let anyone ever diminish who  you are. You are real parents, a parent and nothing less.
