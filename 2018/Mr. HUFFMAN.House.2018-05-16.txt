 Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Colorado is right that  the pace of revelations and controversies surrounding this Trump White  House and their personal financial and political involvement with  Russia, their attempts to interfere with and obstruct justice relating  to Mr. Mueller's investigation, the pace of all that is just dizzy. So,  here we are, 1 year into the work of Special Counsel Mueller.   I am glad that Congressman Perlmutter began his remarks by reminding  us of the context of this issue; the fact that what happened in the  2016 Presidential election was a big deal. It was unprecedented. A  foreign adversary maliciously interfered in our election with a  specific intent to help one candidate and to hurt another. They placed  a bet on Donald Trump. They put their thumb on the scale in every way  they could to help Donald Trump.    Maybe that is why all along he has been reluctant to acknowledge what  obviously happened. He doesn't want to talk about it. He wants to write  it all off as a witch hunt and a conspiracy theory. He probably feels a  little defensive about that cloud of legitimacy involving Russian  interference.   Based on what we know so far, there may be an even more sinister  explanation for some of his behavior. It may be that he--or, at least a  lot of people very close to him--were actively working with the  Russians as part of this. That is what the Mueller investigation is  looking into and that is what the American people have to find out. We  have to know the full extent of exactly what happened, no matter where  those facts may lead.   The truth is, at this 1-year mark in this historic investigation,  this historic scandal, there is plenty of reason to worry about what  President Trump might do by way of trying to block and stop and  interfere with this investigation. It is not just us saying it. You can  look at his own word.   He has said at various times in recent months: ``At some point I will  have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get  involved.''   That is obviously a threat, whether that is using his pardon power or  beginning to fire people in the Department of Justice, the FBI, or even  the Special Counsel himself.   He has threatened to reveal conflicts of interest of the Special  Counsel. Obviously, this is a favorite tactic of President Trump,  trying to intimidate, trying to posture with folks who he perceives as  adversaries.   He said on another occasion: ``Mueller is most conflicted of all  (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so  they go crazy.''   These are the ravings of someone who is acting very defensively. And  I would say as a former attorney--Congressman Perlmutter is a former  attorney himself--it really speaks to a consciousness of guilt. We  would argue that if we were in a court of law and we had evidence of  statements such as this repeatedly calling this investigation a witch  hunt.   On another occasion, he says: ``As I have been saying all along, it  is all a big hoax by Democrats based on payments and lies. There should  never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch hunt.''   On another occasion he said:         Why don't I just fire Mueller? Well, we'll see what       happens.    Taken together, all of his various statements should be very  troubling to anyone who cares about the independence of our law  enforcement agencies and about the integrity of this critically  important investigation.   I am glad to stand with the gentleman tonight and every night that we  have had these Special Order hours to continue to make sure that our  colleagues here in the House know that we are going to defend this  investigation, that we are going to do everything we can to make sure  that our law enforcement professionals and Special Counsel Mueller have  the chance to fully find the evidence, wherever it may lead, to get the  truth out to the American people. We deserve nothing less.   I am glad to see our colleague, Joe Courtney from Connecticut,  joining the conversation.    Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of thoughts. First of all,  that infamous Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 just stinks to high  heaven; the gentleman is absolutely right. Anyone who looks objectively  at what we know about that meeting, anyone who is not hosting a show on  FOX News, at least, would feel that there is a big, big problem here  and we have got to ask some hard questions.   Of course, Donald Trump, Jr., initially outright lied about it, said  it was about adoption. And then we saw the full text of the email  exchange, making it very clear that this was the front-end part of a  quid pro quo between the Trump operation and the Russians, that this  was the offer of assistance, of dirt, of a bombshell on the Clinton  campaign. And of course that was greeted with enthusiasm by Trump, Jr.,  who hastily arranged the meeting, brought in the top brass, said he was  very excited about it if it is what he thought it was.   And then, when it proved not to reveal that bombshell, he immediately  expressed how disappointed he was, and some phone calls ensued. One of  those phone calls was from a restricted number, and he claims he didn't  remember exactly who that call was. Well, turns out his dad, our  President now, has a restricted number.   And that is a knowable fact. If our colleagues on the House  Intelligence Committee were serious about this investigation, they  would find out who that phone call was to because it is one of the dots  that could need to be connected around this very controversial Trump  Tower meeting. But they are not interested at all. They didn't ask  those questions. They didn't even require Trump, Jr., to answer the  questions, and they have rushed to shut down their investigation.    So that brings me to the other point. We have all talked about the  threats to the Mueller investigation from President Trump himself, but  there is another threat from within these walls, from our colleagues on  the House Intelligence Committee, who have taken this sacred trust of  oversight that we have as Members of Congress and, unfortunately,  compromised it to the level that they seem to simply be fronting for  the President instead of doing a genuine investigation.   Unlike their colleagues in the Senate who at least acknowledge the  obvious, that Russia was trying to help President Trump in its  interference, their report doesn't even say that. And then they include  a gratuitous statement that they find no evidence of collusion, despite  everything we have been talking about, everything that is already in  [[Page H4132]]  the public record. We have got a real problem within these walls that  also threatens the investigation.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has just hit on the ``quo.''  We talked about the ``quid'': the solicitations from Russia. Through  Papadopoulos, even earlier, in April, the spring of 2016, those  solicitations were welcomed and embraced by the highest levels of the  Trump campaign, possibly even Mr. Trump himself. We need to nail down  that phone call and a few other details.   But now we are talking about the ``quo'' part: what would Russia get  in return? And we know from undisputed evidence that Mike Flynn was  working on sanctions relief even before they took office, during the  transition, violating, apparently, the Logan Act as he was doing it. We  know that this President and others in his administration have bent  over backwards to try to cut Russia breaks on these sanctions.   So, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is exactly right to focus on that  obvious piece, the ``quo'' part of this seeming quid pro quo. That is  another reason why we have to let this investigation run its course: so  that we can find out exactly what happened here.
