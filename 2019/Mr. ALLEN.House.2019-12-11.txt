 Madam Chair, we all agree here that prescription drug  prices are skyrocketing, and Congress must act. That is something that  we all agree on. The question is how do we go about it.   A couple of facts:   One, H.R. 3 is a radical government takeover of the pharmaceutical  industry, and it ultimately will prevent Americans from accessing  potentially lifesaving cures.   Fact 2: According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers,  H.R. 3 will prevent as many as 100 fewer drugs from entering the U.S.  market in the next decade.   Fact 3: Countries that have adopted similar drug pricing schemes, as  proposed under this legislation, have experienced a decrease in access  to innovative new medicines, increased wait times for treatment, and  supply shortages for in-demand drugs.   Americans will not stand for this. We have an alternative: H.R. 19,  the Lower Costs, More Cures Act.   I urge Members to work together in a bipartisan way on H.R. 19.
