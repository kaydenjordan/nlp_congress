 Mr. Speaker, the American people are  demanding of us to do what is right. That is why I proudly voted  ``yes'' to keep the government open, to pay our troops, to provide  funding for our Nation's military, and to reauthorize CHIP, healthcare  for children in need, for 6 years.   Instead, Democrats in the Senate voted ``no.'' They said no to all of  these critical priorities--national security, healthcare for our  children, keeping the government open--all while they pushed their own  political agenda. The only thing they said yes to was the Schumer  shutdown.   Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. Nothing in this bill is controversial.  We did our job. We have passed reauthorization for CHIP, the Children's  Health Insurance Program, not once but twice, and it has stalled in the  Senate.   Democrats own the Schumer shutdown. They have said no to policies the  American people want and the American people need.   Washington is broken. We need to get back on track. Mr. Speaker, I  urge my colleagues to work together, to work in the interest of all  West Virginians and all Americans, working for working families,  military families, and retirees. They are all depending on us.                            ____________________
