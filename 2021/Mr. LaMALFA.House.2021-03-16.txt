 President Trump is owed yet another apology from fake  news outlets. The recent revelation about the Washington Post and its  retraction and other disinformation sources going with a made-up  narrative from ``sources'' in the Georgia election scandal prove, once  again, that no act is out of bounds for the media, Democrats, and  others with Trump derangement syndrome in their effort to discredit  President Trump. The Washington Post even went so far as to criticize  all conservative media for not covering this story.   Two distorted accounts of phone calls by President Trump got us two  phony, baseless impeachment proceedings by this House. With no real  review, witness testimony, or anything else resembling due process in  the bum-rush to have round two of impeachment, the blatant political  usage of this process is a stain on this institution and should be an  embarrassment to all who drove it.   Apologies are owed not only to President Trump, but, more  importantly, to the citizens of the United States, who lived through a  year of being clamped down, their jobs lost and damaged, savings used  up, and a giant legacy of deficit and death that this institution  should be tackling.   Instead, many weeks and costs wasted on two impeachments in two years  in the House. Shame on this institution for fulfilling this fake news.                            ____________________
