 Madam Speaker, as cochair of the bipartisan Congressional  Ukraine Caucus, I rise to express my deep concern on the issue of  transatlantic energy security. The Kremlin and complicit European  nations are seeking to complete the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. This  Russian malign influence project will increase Vladimir Putin's  leverage in Europe and disrupt the NATO alliance.   Current news reports indicate that a deal between the Biden  administration and Germany is imminent. According to these reports,  there is little in the deal that will prevent Russia's capacity to  coerce our allies. Congress understands history's key lesson: When  Germany and Russia collude, the people of Central and Eastern Europe  pay the price.   Congress has now voted twice on an overwhelming bipartisan basis to  sanction the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. These sanctions are mandatory, not  discretionary. Given the administration's abuse of the sanctions  waiver, I was pleased the Committee on Appropriations  unanimously adopted my bipartisan amendment to repeal the waivers  moving forward. While I look forward to reviewing the deal, the  Congress--as Article I of the Constitution mandates--must reject any  deal that fails to prioritize energy security in the transatlantic  alliance.                            ____________________
