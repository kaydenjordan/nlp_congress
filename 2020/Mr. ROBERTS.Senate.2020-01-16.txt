 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life  of Chris Allen, who worked as my senior economic policy adviser. It is  fitting that I do so on the Senate floor because Chris Allen would be  the first one to tell you he loved his job.   This statement was delivered so frequently and with such sincerity  that one was compelled to look inward and remind one's self of what a  privilege it is to work in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the American  people.   Chris Allen was a student of history and a lover of politics. Ladies  and gentlemen, Chris Allen loved tax policy. If that doesn't tell you  what a special person he was, I don't know what does.   Chris's attitude about his job extended to his coworkers. He loved  his coworkers. When he was on my staff, Chris was always willing to  help junior staff, senior staff, or interns. It didn't matter--he had  time for you. He rolled up his sleeves and pitched in. He gave you  advice. He truly cared.   When it came time for my 2014 campaign, Chris spent his vacation days  with me in Kansas--knocking on doors, walking in parades, and being a  force of positive energy no matter what we faced. Normally these are  grueling tasks but not for Chris. He had fun. He loved it.   As a matter of fact, posted on the wall of our little Hart kitchen,  we have a selfie on election night of my crew at the victory party. The  picture is entitled ``This is what victory looks like.'' And right  smack-dab in the middle is one smiling Chris Allen. Now, when I am  heating up my coffee, I look at Chris in the picture, and I can feel  his joy as he is surrounded by our family of staffers.   Elections weren't his only love. Chris Allen loved a cold beer. He  loved a natty jacket. He loved loud pants. Sometimes he loved wearing  them together. He loved his lacrosse. He loved his Baltimore  neighborhood. He loved all things English and French. He loved  researching his ancestry.   Chris Allen loved his parents, his in-laws, his brothers, his nieces  and nephews, but nothing compared to his love for Lynda, Lucie, and  Sophie. He was not just a proud dad who boasted of his daughters'  accomplishments big and small; he was better. He was a father who took  delight in the things his daughters said and did, big and small. They  were cherished. May they understand today and always that we loved  Chris, and he loved them.   I always looked forward to my briefings with Chris. For one, he got  my jokes. He understood my references to radio and television shows and  personalities that my other staff would have to research and look up.  But he was also understanding of the history of the issues, even those  not in his portfolio.  [[Page S273]]    He was an excellent steward of my priorities on the Finance  Committee, so much so they stole him from me. At the time I told him,  ``Listen, you still work for me, you are just sitting down the hall.''   To illustrate Chris' popularity, I would like to share this story.   There is an annual, all-day legislative meeting held in Washington  for a Kansas group that requires a lot of preparation. My staff must be  able to speak about a variety of topics and difficult issues before an  audience of at least 100 Kansans. At one of these such meetings, Chris  had just left my office to work at tax nerd nirvana, the Senate Finance  Committee. I called him back to answer a few tax questions while my new  staffer transitioned into the role. Before Chris was scheduled to  arrive, a number of questions about taxes came up and my staff deferred  to him, mentioning they would wait for the ``real tax guy'' to show up.  Their repeated deference to him built up a feeling of anticipation in  the room. At long last, Chris strolls in, and heads swivel around to  the back of the room to see the great tax man cometh. It was like Elvis  had entered the building. The audience got to their feet and gave him a  standing ovation. One man was even moved to testify how Chris had  helped his community on a rural tax issue and it had made all of the  difference. And at the front of the room on the panel, there sat Chris  in his dapper jacket, his head tilted back and his beaming smile. He  loved to help and they loved him.   Whether it was the tax reform bill or pension legislation, Chris'  brilliant mind made the measure better--every time. And his work will  have a long lasting influence on our Nation and literally millions of  Americans. What a career Chris Allen had.   Everyone in this room will probably agree that Chris's best stories  were about himself, and he was usually his own punchline. Something had  happened to him. He had messed something up, or he had gleefully  embarrassed his daughters. You can hear him now. I was a bit player in  one of his favorite tales. It was his first Finance Committee hearing  working for me. Chris had prepped for days--weeks probably. He was both  nervous and excited. As we walked over to the committee room, he told  me he was calling Lynda, hoping she could watch the hearing on CSPAN  and catch him sitting behind the dais.   So I decided to have a little fun with Chris. As the time for  questions got to the Senator next to me, I very dramatically motioned  to Chris. Chris looked shocked--I am sure he was thinking, ``Oh no,  what could I have forgotten to tell him.'' Chris leaned in, and I put  my hand to the side of my mouth: ``Chris, this is your moment. Look  very serious. Nod your head a few times. Now point at the paper I am  holding--now tell me something very crucial . . . we are going to make  sure Lynda sees you!''   Chris got the biggest kick out of it, and we met the goal--he was on  CSPAN. So while we take the issues and the policy very seriously, and  we negotiate very intensely--and Chris could sure do that--we can also  stop for a minute to appreciate where we are and what a privilege it is  to do these jobs. As I said, Chris never forgot or took it for granted.  He appreciated every minute in the Senate.   I understand Lucie has shared a link to a Google doc for Chris's  friends and loved ones to share their ``short but interesting stories  about Chris.'' I encourage everyone to do so. These stories will be a  treasure trove for Lynda, Sophie, and Lucie. I hope you can preserve  them in some way with his genealogy work. I know he would like that.   I will conclude with a note to Lynda and the girls: I always say you  are only as good as your staff; it is your friends and family who make  you what you are. In my office, staff are family. Chris was family; you  will always be family. Besides, Chris still works for me. He is just  sitting and smiling a few floors up.                            ____________________
