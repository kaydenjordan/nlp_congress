 Mr. Speaker, for too long, communities of color, Black  and Brown communities, have suffered environmental injustice.   For too long, these same communities have been on the front lines of  environmental air pollution that has caused higher rates of cancer and  asthma and, with COVID-19, more deaths. For too long, these communities  have literally said: I can't breathe.   My very own district is surrounded by three freeways and the Port of  Los Angeles. Ports are critical jobs. They provide movement of goods.  They are a huge economic engine. But they also are the cause of air  pollution on the docks, not to mention the truck traffic that goes to  and from ports.   Today, I am proud to say that my bill, the Climate Smart Ports Act,  is included in this infrastructure package. It will make a significant  difference to air quality in my district and for the 40 percent of  Americans who live near a port.   This bill will invest billions in zero-emission technology at ports  and clean trucks that go to and from ports. That is right, zero  emissions.   Bottom line is it will save lives, create jobs, and fight the climate  crisis. Today I ask you to join me in voting for H.R. 2: to invest in  our Nation's infrastructure, to invest in greening our ports, to invest  in fighting the climate crisis, and to invest in improving air quality  for the people.
