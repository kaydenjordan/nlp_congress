 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the  chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, and it is the largest  bipartisan and bicameral caucus in the United States Congress.   Every year we have an annual congressional shootout, which consists  of sporting clays, trap, and skeet shotgunning, and it is a competition  between Republican Members of Congress who are members of the  Sportsmen's Caucus and Democratic Members of Congress who are members  of the Sportsmen's Caucus.   This year, we had 28 shooters, and I am pleased to say that the  Republican team once again retained the trophy for another year.   We also had some individual competitions going on, and I would like  to recognize those Members of Congress.   The Top Gun Member of Congress this year goes to Representative  John  Rutherford from Florida. Now, Mr. Speaker, this was his first time at  this event, and he had the second highest score for a Member of  Congress since the year 2010. He shot 61 out of a total possible 75.   We also had a Top Gun Republican Member, Richard Hudson from North  Carolina.   We had a Top Gun Democrat. That was Representative  Mike Thompson  from California, who always shoots well. I like shooting against him.   Of course, I won the Top Skeet Award. Duncan Hunter from California  won the Top Trap, and the Top Sporting Clays was Representative Austin  Scott, who is also the co-vice chair on the Republican side for the  Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus.   Now, the caucus is made up of two chairmen, one Republican and one  Democrat, and two co-vice chairmen, one Republican and one Democrat. I  would like to take this opportunity to yield to the co-chairman, the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman from Texas, and I want to invite all Members of Congress to  join the Sportsmen's Caucus. It is not just about hunting and fishing.  It is about access to outdoor property that we own as taxpayers. Public  access is important. It is about trapping. It is about a lot of other  outdoor activities that we can take advantage of.   The sporting clay competition that we had is open to all Members,  from beginner to expert. Come out and enjoy the day next year about  this same time, and enjoy a day out in Maryland at the Prince George's  Trap and Skeet Center gun range club. It is a great afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, this trophy will reside in my office, 2229 Rayburn House  Office Building if anybody wants to come by and admire it. It will have  a new plaque saying the Republicans won the 2018 competition.                            ____________________
