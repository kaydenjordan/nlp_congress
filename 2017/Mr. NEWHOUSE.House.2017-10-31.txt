 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of Leslie Amundson from my hometown of Sunnyside, Washington. Les was a  decorated war veteran, a small-business owner, a farmer, and, truly, a  pillar of our local community.   Les served this country honorably. As an Army Air Corps pilot during  World War II, his plane was shot down over Holland. He and his crew  spent a month hiding underground and being cared for by the Dutch  people before being captured by the Nazis. Les served 18 months at a  prisoner of war camp and earned a Purple Heart.   His family's roots were only strengthened when Les married and bought  a farm in Sunnyside where he and his wife, Helen, raised their five  children. He would often find opportunities to contribute and to help  those around him, and his appreciation for the community showed in his  actions.   Les leaves behind a legacy of devotion to the people of Sunnyside and  to our Nation.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult  time, and I ask my colleagues to please join me in remembering my  friend Les Amundson.                            ____________________
