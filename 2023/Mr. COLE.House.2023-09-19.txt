Sec. 6.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger  Fernandez), my very good friend, pending which I yield myself such time  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  House Resolution 680.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last week the Rules Committee met and reported out a  [[Page H4393]]  rule, House Resolution 680, consideration of H.R. 4365, the Department  of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2024, under a structured  rule.   It provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations or  their designees. It also makes in order 184 amendments; more than 75  percent of those eligible for consideration. Finally, it provides for a  motion to recommit.   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, our democracy remains a beacon of hope to the entire  world. Billions of people across the globe look to the United States as  a leader in freedom and liberty and as a protector of peace. From the  very moment our Nation was conceived, a strong national defense has  been a differentiator of democracy. Essential to protecting the  homeland, international order, and the American people from those who  would seek to do us harm, we must never lose sight of the need to  maintain a strong defense.   Although our men and women in uniform give of themselves every day,  they cannot do their jobs unless Congress does its job. Only Congress  can provide the funding our military needs to fulfill its duties. That  is our responsibility. Today we move forward with that commitment as we  take up H.R. 4365, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for  fiscal year 2024. We must do our duty and make sure that our brave  military members can move forward with theirs.   With evolving threats, we continue to face a struggle seen throughout  time. The contest between freedom and tyranny is not far from us. From  Vladimir Putin's unjust and illegal invasion of Ukraine, to China's  posturing in the South China Sea, to continued threats posed by  extremists and terrorists, hostile actors are looking for weakness.  Yet, America's Armed Forces remain ready to meet any challenge wherever  it may arise. Continuing to meet those threats requires an appropriate  investment of national resources. With today's measure, we fulfill that  commitment and ensure that our Armed Forces will have the resources  they need to meet any foe anywhere in the world at any time.   The bill before us provides full funding for the national defense. It  appropriates $826 billion in new discretionary spending, which is a  modest increase of $300 million over the President's budget request and  nearly $29 billion, or 3.6 percent, over the fiscal year 2023 enacted  level.   H.R. 4365 makes targeted investments that support critical  priorities. Perhaps the most important of these priorities is to  reinvest in our servicemen and -women. The bill provides a 5.2 percent  pay raise for our servicemembers. For junior enlisted servicemembers,  we provide an historic pay increase of an average of 30 percent,  ensuring that we not only offset the effects of President Biden's  inflationary crisis for these younger and most junior servicemembers,  but also ensuring that we can retain servicemembers who are at the  beginning of their military careers.   I would be remiss, Mr. Speaker, not to give credit to the gentleman  from California (Mr.  Mike Garcia), my good friend and fellow defense  appropriator, for this particular measure, both in the appropriations  bill and, frankly, in the NDAA, as well. His work on behalf of younger  servicepeople has been exemplary, relentless, and effective.   The bill also makes continued and necessary investments to ensure  that we will continue to have the best equipped and best-trained  fighting force now and into the future. We fund continued expansion of  the Navy, making sure that we will be able to continue to protect  freedom of the seas around the globe and fund development and  acquisition of next-generation weapons systems.   However, it doesn't stop there, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4365 also ensures  that the Biden administration cannot continue to put politics ahead of  national security. It preserves existing and longstanding bipartisan  bans on taxpayer funding for abortions. It also ensures that Federal  dollars cannot be used to indoctrinate our troops with progressive  ideology like critical race theory training, and instead ensures that  the Pentagon's focus is where it should be: on military readiness and  preparedness so that our warfighters can defeat aggression and defend  freedom anywhere in the world.   All in all, there is much to like in today's bill, Mr. Speaker. I  look forward to advancing this measure through a robust amendment  process on the floor and onward to final passage. I urge Members to  support both the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I begin by returning my deep respect, my deep regards,  to my good friend from New Mexico. It has been a delight to have her on  the Rules Committee, and we have found a lot of common ground working  on Native American issues, where, frankly, she is an acknowledged  national expert. I look forward to a long and good relationship with my  friend.   When it comes to this rule and bill, obviously, we have  disagreements. Let me talk first about the point my friend makes about  timing and how many bills have gotten done and where we are in the  process. There is actually a great deal that I agree with her on.   Sadly, we ought to also remember the Democratic Congress of last year  didn't finish the appropriations process until December. If you looked  at it the year before, it didn't finish until March the next year,  after the end of the fiscal year. Being late around here is not new for  either party, but our friends set the standard last time, I think. We  will see how we end up.   My friend made a comment that we had only done one bill. I will say  that is one more than the Democratic United States Senators managed to  do.   The reality is the Senate didn't produce, under Democratic control,  any bills for the last 2 years--none out of subcommittee, none out of  full committee, none across the floor.   We are dealing with a very difficult body on the other side of the  rotunda. These timing issues, hopefully, we can all get better at this  and work together. I actually think we have something this year in the  debt ceiling agreement that will be helpful in that regard.   The reality is if we don't get our work done by January 1, which is  about the time Democrats got their work done last year, we will have a  yearlong CR with a 1 percent across-the-board cut.   I don't know any appropriator on either side of the aisle who wants  to see that happen. I don't think most people who care deeply about the  defense of the United States do. We have some forcing mechanisms in  place. Hopefully, we will continue to make some better progress there.   In terms of my friend's point about divisive social policy, I will  point out where this started. It is the executive branch that made  decisions to do things much differently than we have done before, and  usually with no consultation with the Congress of the United States.   Most of the things my friend disagrees with we consider corrective of  executive overreach, including violation of the Hyde amendment, which  is essentially, in my view, what the Department of Defense has decided  on its own to do without discussion or consultation with the Congress  of the United States. That is unfortunate. That is something,  hopefully, we can work through and resolve in the months ahead.   I will also say that we are just very different in terms of where we  think the focus ought to be. This bill focuses on weapons acquisition,  training, and readiness. We live in a very dangerous world. We think  there is a big difference, for instance, between climate resilience and  actively pushing climate change legislation, which we believe the  original administration budget does.   We want to refocus on the things that we think matter. We are not  going to beat our adversaries if, God forbid, we find ourselves in a  contest with any of them and our forces aren't well trained, aren't  well armed, and aren't well prepared for the challenges they are going  to face. That should be the main focus of the Department of Defense. We  think the administration has lost its focus. We see this bill as a  useful corrective.    Finally, I point out to my friends on both sides of the aisle that,  quite frankly, whatever we pass, we are going to sit down and negotiate  with the United States Senate and with the President of the United  States. As my friends know, the Democrats control the United States  Senate, and we have a Democrat as the President of the United States.  Wherever we end up, it is going to be a process of give-and-take and  discussion, but it is important that the House have an opening  position.   The last point to make on this is if we get this bill across the  floor--and I do say ``if'' because there is some controversy about  whether or not we will make it, even on our own side. Even though  nobody disagrees with the rule or disagrees with the bill, they have  other points sometimes they want to make. Sadly, it shouldn't be with  this bill. However, my friends never got the Defense bill across the  floor by themselves when they were in the majority. There were too many  divisions and splits within their Caucus to even bring it to the floor.   If we manage to get this bill across the floor, we will actually, in  that single action, have moved across the floor a larger percentage of  the discretionary budget of the United States than my friends were ever  able to do when they were in the majority.   It is a complex bill, over half of the discretionary spending of the  United States. There are lots of barriers and flash points where we  disagree, but it is important that we continue the dialogue and the  motion forward.   I think we have the opportunity, in passing the rule and the  underlying legislation, to do that today, and I urge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to vote accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I both agree and disagree with my friend from New Mexico  about shutting down the government. I personally could not agree more  with her. I think it is a dumb thing to do. I think it is a dangerous  thing to do.   I have never favored shutting down the government, and I have argued  against it. The tactic doesn't work. I think it won't work this time.  The American people expect us to keep the essential services of  government going while we negotiate and get to a final solution.   I will correct my friend on one thing. The Democrats have shut down  the government. Frankly, they shut it down over DACA in 2017.   Now, I always hand the Democrats this: When they shut it down or do  something stupid, they are pretty quick to realize it, and they back  off. I think they shut it down on a Friday and reopened it on a Monday,  but they did indeed shut it down.    It is simply an inappropriate tool in the toolbox, in my opinion. I  have seen both sides use it. My side, sadly, has used it more. I hope  we don't do it this time.   Certainly, the great majority of our Members and the Speaker do not  want to see a shutdown, and I think they have made that apparent over  and over again.   I hadn't particularly intended to comment on the ranking member's  amendment because I know how passionately my good friend feels about  this. I respect those feelings. Honestly, I respect the feelings of all  those who hold that view.   I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing with President  Biden when my good friend, the ranking member, is disagreeing with him.  It shows it is not really a partisan issue. I think it is an issue of  judgment.   I have no doubt the President of the United States agonized before  making this decision. It was clearly a decision he did not want to  make, but I think he was compelled by two factors that probably decided  the case for him, although I don't presume to speak for the President.   Number one, we ought to always remember the enemies of Ukraine,  Russia, introduced these weapons on the other side first and was using  those weapons indiscriminately.   Second, Ukraine is using these weapons in defense of its own  territory and its own people in its own territory. That is not what the  Russians are doing. They are aggressively, on the other side, using  these in another country.   Finally, again, just to be fair about the President's dilemma, we  have used an extraordinary amount of ammunition trying to support  Ukraine. I think we have some strains on our own stockpiles, and I  suspect that was part of the decisionmaking. When you are in a war, you  are in it to win it.   Frankly, it was not the Ukrainians or the Americans that introduced  this first. It was not the Ukrainians or the Americans or the European  allies, who were there in vast numbers, that started this conflict. It  is to the advantage of all that it ends as quickly as it can. The level  of casualties on both sides is horrific, but the person who bears  responsibility is Vladimir Putin. Frankly, the country that is the  aggressor is Russia, and I am not going to begrudge the Ukrainians for  getting what they need.   As critical as I can sometimes be of President Biden, I will  certainly not criticize him in this case because I think, in this case,  he reluctantly made a tough decision, a decision he probably didn't  want to make, but I think he made it for the right reasons. Therefore,  I won't be supporting my friend's amendment later on today.                                time  1245    Although, again, I am glad we were able to make it in order. I think  it is an important issue for us to discuss, and I look forward to a  very vigorous debate on that later this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, there are some areas where I agree with my good friends and  some areas where I disagree. Nobody disagrees on the importance of the  fentanyl crisis and the importance of dealing in any way we can through  whatever means we have with those who engage in trafficking that  illegal drug that has killed tens of thousands of Americans.   Quite frankly, I suspect later this week or next week we will give  our friends the opportunity to work with us on homeland security  measures that will deal with just that.   I would point to, frankly, the abject failure of the Biden  administration to defend the southern border. The green light that has  been put out there is a huge cost for this massive influx of drugs into  our own country.   We passed H.R. 2 on this floor, Mr. Speaker, to try and deal with  that, and we are going to provide our friends with some opportunities  where maybe we can find some common ground. You can be pro-immigration  and pro-border security at the same time. I think this administration  has had a hard time doing that, and quite frankly, most of the policies  that it reversed--whether it was building the wall or remain in  Mexico--from the last administration were effective. You can tell by  the record numbers of illegal entries we have, the record amount of  trafficking we have in drugs, and sadly, in human beings across the  border to know that the Biden border policy, which my friends have  supported, has been a disaster. It is one that, again, we hope they not  only recognize that disaster, but will work with us to correct some of  those measures.   Again, I am going to agree with my friend from New Mexico. I don't  believe in shutting down the government. I know we occasionally have  some people who believe that, although it is a very small number, it  can be a very influential number in a House that is very narrowly  divided.   We are going to provide some opportunities both to our own Members  and to our colleagues on the other side to avoid that and to negotiate  in good faith, but again, I just reiterate a point where I know my  friend and I agree: It is not an appropriate tool. It does not work. I  would hope that we can avoid that.    We also need to sit down and work together where we can, and there  are a lot of areas in this bill that we can work on.   The last point I will make--my friends talk about the conflicts that  we have in the Defense bill--remember, we had a conflict in the last  Congress when my friends in the House tried to unilaterally overturn  the Hyde language, a bipartisan agreement that goes all the way back to  1975 or 1976, as I recall, Mr. Speaker, and when that was struck, there  were less than 150 Republicans in the House, so it was genuinely  bipartisan. It wasn't just something we crammed down.   My friends have changed their mind over the issue of using Federal  dollars for abortion over the years. We have not changed our position,  and we were able to beat that back even when we were in the minority  because, at the end of the day, they couldn't pass the bills without  Republican support.   I think the administration has tried to go around Congress in this  case and use Federal dollars without congressional consent to  facilitate abortion, other than in cases where we are talking about  rape, incest, or the life of the mother. We have no debate over the  appropriate use of Federal dollars in those cases. We do in others. It  doesn't mean people can't travel; we just shouldn't be using Federal  dollars in this area. That is a longstanding principle that I would  argue the Biden administration is trying to subvert.   By the way, it is a principle that President Biden, until 2019 when  he was running for President, accepted throughout his entire career. He  was a champion of that until 2019 when his own party moved so far left  he had to change his longstanding position in pursuit of the  nomination.   Again, this is politics, people are allowed to do what they want, but  please don't chastise us for being consistent with a position we  assumed in 1975 and have not changed. It is our friends who have  changed their mind on this issue, and frankly, it is the administration  that tried to subvert the will and the authority of Congress by moving  around it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Nobody is arguing against diversity in the military. The American  military has actually usually been the leader in this area, whether it  was desegregation or certainly addressing the inequities between men  and women, and we haven't gotten it right, but I think broadly it has  worked in the right direction and quite often ahead of the rest of  society.   The real problem here is we want to focus on training and weapons,  not on culture wars. We think the administration has gone around  Congress in some cases--the Hyde amendment being one of them. My  friends have their lawyers, we have our lawyers. I guess they will go  to court and sort that out.                                time  1300    There wasn't any consultation with the Congress, any discussion on  this. That was a decision made unilaterally by the administration. I  think Congress has every right to be consulted. They don't have money  by their own right in the executive branch. They have what we give them  for the purposes that are specified by the Congress of the United  States. They don't get to just make it up on their own.   I know there was at least some discussion back and forth where people  warned: Don't open this door without a discussion and without a green  light from Congress. That didn't occur, and so we are in this  discussion.   Now, over the course of reaching a bill, I suspect we will find some  sort of solution or work it through one way or the other. I hope we do,  because I don't think anything is more important, in what I think is a  very dangerous world, than equipping, training, and preparing the men  and women who protect us all.   On that, we have a lot more common ground than division. Again, I  think this was a choice by the administration. It provoked a response  by Congress. We will try to work it through  [[Page H4399]]  by normal legislative means and see where we end up.   Mr. Speaker, I will reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have great affection and respect for my friend, the ranking member  and formerly the chairman of the full Rules Committee.   I will start where I began this debate. Remember, my friends,  Democrats didn't finish the appropriations process on their side until  December of last year, and Democrats controlled all three parts of  government. They had the Senate, the House, and the Presidency, and  they didn't get done until December. The year before that, they didn't  get done until March of the year after.   I wish the process went easier and smoother as well, but I don't  think it goes much differently, regardless of who happens to be in  control. I do think that we are trying to make some progress here.   Now, my friends are worried about what is cut. They ought to be  worried about what was spent. We are running a $1.7 trillion deficit.  That deficit is bigger than the entire discretionary budget of the  United States of America. It is not just bigger than the defense  budget; it is bigger than everything.   It got a lot worse when my friends controlled the executive branch  and both houses of Congress. You did over $3 trillion worth of spending  outside the normal appropriations process; $1.9 trillion for an  unneeded American Rescue Plan when we were coming out of COVID, roughly  $700 billion from the much-misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which even  the President now says was misnamed because it really had to do more  with climate change. That was money we didn't have, money that fueled  inflation that made life worse for every single American.   I don't even get to the knockoffs, like transportation bills that  don't pay for themselves. I had voted for every other major  transportation agreement in my time here, two of them under President  Obama, but they paid for themselves either through gasoline taxes or  ticket fees, what have you. Now, we have got a trillion dollars here,  but it is not enough. We will just throw another several hundred  billion dollars on in debt. We are paying for that now.   I am not going to be critical of my party for trying to push down  some of the spending; $1.7 trillion this year. You guys can't find  anywhere to cut.   Now you want to talk about defense? I am happy to talk about defense.  My dad was a career noncommissioned officer at the height of the Cold  War. You know what we spent on defense then? Fifty percent of the  Federal budget, 9 percent of the GDP. You know what we spent during the  great Reagan buildup? Six percent of the GDP, about a third of the  Federal budget. You know what we spend today? About 3 percent of the  GDP and about 15 percent of the budget.   Believe me, there has been an explosion of domestic spending over the  decades, largely driven by my friends, and it is unsustainable. We  cannot stay on the path we are on.   We can argue about this or that. I have a bill I would invite my  friend to look at, try and go back and do with Social Security what we  did in 1983 on a bipartisan basis. We need to start getting the  spending under control. The spending that is driving us out of balance  is largely not in the Pentagon. It is largely in entitlement spending,  which I would be the first to say that both sides have been reluctant  to deal with. Neither of the last two Presidents have been willing.  This President actually voted for a Social Security commission that  reformed and stabilized it when he was a Senator. Now,  [[Page H4400]]  the White House rules these things out. No, we can't talk about it,  can't do it. By the way, his predecessor was exactly the same, so  Republican and Democrat alike.   I would love to be more restrained in the spending, and I think that  is what my colleagues are trying to do, even when I don't always agree  with the tactics they use. They are motivated in the right direction,  which is to deal with a $1.7 trillion deficit.   We are trying to make some appropriate decisions. Again, we work in  the legislative process. I remind my friends, they control two-thirds  of it. By the way, the Defense bill last year, which was passed almost  exclusively with Democratic votes, the omni, to be fair, actually had a  larger increase in the defense budget than my friends pushed, $45  billion--I actually agree with that, by the way--than this year, where  we are basically at the President's number.   We can all play this game with numbers and what have you. Let's try  to work toward a deal. I think we can get there, but I don't have any  illusions it will be easy along the way. I certainly have seen both  sides make missteps, in my view, in handling these situations over the  years. I hope we don't do that again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I urge all my colleagues to support the resolution.   Today's rule will make in order the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2024. It will provide full and  complete funding for our national defense needs, ensuring that our  servicemembers are fairly paid, and supporting the well-being of  military families.   It also makes certain that our troops will never face a fair fight by  giving them every advantage possible. We make appropriate investments  in the development and acquisition of weapons systems needed to  preserve and defend freedom around the globe and restrict the Biden  administration from forcing progressive ideology on the Armed Forces  and circumventing the authority of Congress when it does so.   Bottom line, the bill targets resources to its new core mission,  protecting our homeland and security interests and making sure that our  forces are the best trained, the best equipped, and the best prepared  in the world.   To my friends, it has been an interesting debate, as always. I enjoy  exchanging observations with my good friend from New Mexico, and we  strayed sometimes off this bill and off this rule.   I do want to mention a couple of things. The rule, I think even my  friends would agree, is a pretty robust rule. We are going to have 184  amendments, a very thorough debate, so I look forward to that.   Second, it is lost sometimes, but we actually basically fund the  military at the level that the President requested, so those people who  think it is over the top probably should have their argument with the  White House as opposed to us. Personally, I would have liked to have  done more, but we are going to go with the President's number,  essentially.    Finally, we do disagree about the manner in which the administration  is using the military. We think they are advancing progressive ideology  when they ought to be focused on weapons acquisition, training, and  warfighting, and we think that ultimately weakens the country.   We live in a very dangerous world right now. I would actually argue  we are not spending enough on defense when we look at what is happening  in the Western Pacific with China; when we look at what the Russians  are doing, the acts they are engaged in, in Ukraine. I want a robust  budget, and I want one that we come together on.   In the end, I think we will be able to achieve that, and I look  forward to working with my friends to accomplish that objective.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Leger Fernandez is as  follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 680 Offered by Ms. Leger Fernandez of New                                   Mexico    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 7.
