 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk  about the urgent need to address the high and rising costs of  prescription drug prices in this country.   Far too often, I have heard heartbreaking stories from Oklahomans and  people in my community who face the unacceptable reality of choosing  between putting food on their table and taking the lifesaving  medications they need.   Earlier this year, I held a townhall where I heard from many people  in Oklahoma, and we released a report about the soaring costs of  insulin. In my district alone, more than 22,000 seniors on Medicare and  other Oklahomans living with disabilities and diabetes face  prescription drug costs of more than $25 million.   It is time to act and make medicine more affordable and make it  possible for people to get the lifesaving prescription drugs they need.   One important solution is limiting the out-of-pocket costs for  patients at the pharmacy counter. That is why I introduced the Capping  Drug Costs for Seniors Act. This practical solution lowers the cost for  patients directly. This bill keeps Medicare part D patients from paying  more than $2,000 out of pocket, which has a real impact for 46 million  Americans who rely on this program.  [[Page H8233]]    Medication only works if it is taken as prescribed. The high cost of  prescription drugs forces too many people to choose between putting  food on their table and buying the medicine they need.   We must continue working on this important issue and create pathways  to affordable medications and improving health.                            ____________________
