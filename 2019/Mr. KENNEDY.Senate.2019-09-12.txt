 Madam President, $1 million a minute--not $1 million an  hour or a day or week, $1 million a minute. That is how much we borrow  every minute to operate the Federal Government. It is $1.4 billion-- that is nine zeros--a day. That is how much more we spend than we take  in. Some people have said--I have heard Americans say this--that we  spend money like a drunk sailor. That is not accurate because a drunk  sailor stops when he runs out of money. We just borrow.   We don't just print this money. We issue Treasury notes and Treasury  bonds and Treasury securities. We borrow it. Some Americans loan it to  us. Some folks in other countries like Japan and China, they expect to  be paid back, and we do have to pay them back. In a couple of years, we  are going to be spending more in our budget on interest on our debt  than we are spending on defense.   Now we are in the middle of putting together a budget for the  American people. The first thing we had to do was agree on how much  money we are going to spend. They call that the topline number, but  that just means how much money we are going to spend for the next 2  years. You will not be surprised to learn we are going to spend more.   I think it was a bad deal. I voted against it. Our agreement on what  we are going to spend in the budget we are putting forward now,  according to the CBO, is going to add to our $22 trillion--that is 12  zeros--deficit. In fact, what we just agreed to, the additional  spending, is going to add, according to our Congressional Budget  Office, $12 trillion over the next 10 years.   I voted against it. I lost. The majority rules. Now we are trying to  put together a budget with all this extra money, and our challenge is  or ought to be: How do we spend the money the American people are going  to give us in an efficient way? I think every single Member of the  Senate wants to do that.   I want to talk for a few minutes about an issue that is going to come  up. It is going to come up through the subcommittee I chair. It has to  do with elections, and it has to do with money.   Russia tried to interfere with our election. You can write that down  and take it home to mama. It is true. They did it. They didn't change a  single vote, but they did try to influence the way Americans did vote.  To try to prevent that from happening again in 2018, this Congress gave  our States $380 million to shore up their election systems. They  haven't spent all that yet.   This Congress also took other steps. The Senate has unanimously  approved two bipartisan election security bills. I think they are both  now pending in the House. We passed the Defending the Integrity of  Voting Systems Act. That is going to make it a Federal crime to hack  any voting system in a Federal election. We passed the Defending  Elections Against Trolls from Enemy Regimes Act. We call that the DETER  Act. It will bar people who interfere in our elections or attempt to do  so from entering the United States. Our Department of Homeland  Security, very able women and men, and our cyber security advisors  there, smart people--they are helping our State and local officials, on  a daily basis, guard against threats.   We had a classified briefing. By ``we,'' I mean all Members of the  Senate, Republicans and Democrats. ``Classified'' means it is in our  room down in the basement where foreign agents cannot listen in. The  FBI Director was there. The Director of National Intelligence was  there. Most senior ranking members of our military were there, and the  topic was: How did we do in 2018? We know the Russians and others took  a run at us in 2016. They didn't succeed, but they tried. How did we do  in 2018?   Let me tell you, our men and women at the FBI and in our military and  in Homeland Security, they are on it. Our 2018 election went off  without a hitch. I am not saying some foreign despots didn't try to  influence how we voted, but they didn't change a single vote. Our  people did a great job, and every Senator, Democratic and Republican,  in that room, in that classified setting--I can't tell you the details.  I wish I could. If I could, you would be impressed. But everybody  walked out of there and said: Man, we are on it. The 2018 elections  went off without a hitch, and, by God, we are ready for 2020.   We didn't just do that. I am going to go back to what I just said. We  gave our States $380 million. They haven't even spent all of it yet,  but there is going to be an effort to spend a whole bunch more to give  it to the States. I don't know how much, but at least $200 million,  maybe $400 million, maybe a billion. If I thought it was necessary, I  would vote for it.   Some of my colleagues, in perfectly good faith, think the States need  more money, even though they haven't spent what we gave them to begin  with and even though all of our intelligence officials say we are ready  for 2020. Some of my colleagues, in good faith, think they need more  money, but some of my colleagues see this as a first step to  nationalizing elections, and that is what worries me.   Do you know what makes our elections safest of all? You can't just  hack one system. You have to hack 50. You have to hack 50 because the  States run elections, and they do a pretty good job. They do a really  good job.   There is an effort--not by all but by some--to get the Federal  Government in charge of elections. Do you know how you do that? You  don't just jump in and grab them. You sneak up on them. I will tell you  how you sneak up on them. You start giving them money, and you get them  addicted. You give them a little more money, and you get them addicted.  Then, the next thing you know, the Feds are running the elections, and  not for all but for some of my colleagues that is what this is about.   This country started out as a self-reliant, tax-averse Union of  States. They were very skeptical of the Federal Government. Our  original States and all those after them, they insisted on running  their own elections, and it has worked. We don't need the Federal  Government in charge of elections.   There are some of my colleagues coming this time--and, look, I am not  impugning their integrity. They are entitled to their opinion because  this is America, but I am entitled to mine. In the effort last year, we  were able to beat it back. I am afraid some of my friends on this side  of the aisle this time are having second thoughts. I am hearing all  kinds of rumors. It is amazing what you can pick up around this place  if you just walk around the floor and keep your mouth shut and your  ears open. You hear all kinds of stuff.   I am here to say, if we do it, we are going to look back, when the  Federal Government is running our elections and screwing them up, and  say this is where it began. If you want to put the U.S. Federal  Government in charge of your elections instead of the States, if  [[Page S5461]]  you think that is a swell idea, I want you to close your eyes for a  minute and imagine living in a world designed by the post office  because that is what you are going to get.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Secretary of the Senate be authorized to  request from the House of Representatives the return of the papers to  S. 1790 to provide for a correction. I further ask that if the House  agrees to the Senate's request, upon receipt of the papers from the  House in the Senate, notwithstanding passage of the bill, the amendment  at the desk be agreed to and the papers be returned to the House.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I am not going to speak for 10 minutes,  but I do want to call attention to an example of breathtaking  hypocrisy, and I am not proud of it.   We all understand in a social contract that the price of living in an  organized society is giving up some of our hard-earned money. That is  why we pay taxes. Nobody likes paying taxes, but we understand that  taxes are necessary to pay our teachers, build our roads, defend our  country, and help those who are less fortunate than us.   We set up a pretty good apparatus to go after you if you don't pay  your taxes. If you don't pay your taxes, or you don't pay them in the  right amount, or you don't pay them on time, they have people trained  in the IRS--I am not criticizing. They are just doing their job, but  they will chase you like a hound from Hades. So you  [[Page S5463]]  pay. That is the law, and we are all supposed to abide by it, but what  happens when the Department in which the IRS is centered will not  follow the same rules? I am talking about the Department of Treasury.  The IRS is under the Department of Treasury. Now, what is good for the  goose is supposed to be good for the gander.   The U.S. Department of Treasury is sitting on $26 billion--not  million, billion. That is nine zeros of matured, unclaimed savings  bonds that belong to the people of this country. They have the names,  and they have the addresses. Do you know what they are doing to try to  contact these Americans? Nothing. Zero. Nada. Zilch. They just sit  there holding on to the money.   We know what a savings bond is. We couldn't have won World War II  without savings bonds. A lot of Americans took their hard-earned money,  and they bought savings bonds. You know how it works. I am just making  these numbers up, but you buy a savings bond. You give the Federal  Government 100 bucks. You don't get anything every month. You give up  100 bucks, and in 20 years you go back and redeem your bond and it is  now worth $200. In the meantime, the Federal Government gets this loan  to use your money. When that 20 years is up, the bond matures. It  doesn't pay interest anymore.   Some people lose their bonds. Some people forget about their bonds.  Some people pass on, and their kids inherit their bonds. They are lost,  but you can always count on the Department of Treasury to keep a list  of who owns bonds and which ones have been redeemed and which ones  haven't. The U.S. Department of Treasury has that list, and there are  millions of Americans whose names are on that list. They have names and  addresses, and they don't do anything to give it back. They just stand  there sucking on the teat.   Let me give you some examples. We are talking real money. I will just  pick a couple out: New Jersey, $695 million belongs to the people of  New Jersey--not the politicians in New Jersey, not the government, the  people--that the Treasury is holding.   Let me see if I can find--Washington State, $560 million belongs to  the people of Washington State--not the big dogs, not the mayors, not  the politicians, the real people who get up every day and go to work  and pay their taxes. For Hawaii, they have $113 million. In my State,  Louisiana, there is $337 million. There is $3 billion belonging to  people in California.   We are going to get up in the morning, and the IRS--they are just  doing their job. You better pay your taxes. They will take your  firstborn. But when they have $26 billion of the American people's  money, you can't find them with a search party. It is not right. It is  not right.   I sued them when I was State treasurer, and I got a bunch of other  State treasurers to sue them too. I don't like suing people, but the  Department of the Treasury has spent tens of billions of dollars  fighting the American people. They just don't want to give the money  back--and you wonder why people hate the government.   I have a bill to try to do something about it. It is not personal. I  think the world of our Treasury Secretary. I would think a whole lot  better of him if he would start writing checks to the American people.  I am not going to give up on this issue. All we are asking is that the  Treasury Department share the names with the States. Every State has an  unclaimed property program. They have a great one in Washington, a  great one in Hawaii. Usually it is a State treasurer. They know to give  money back to people. They don't charge a fee. Right is right, and this  is wrong. The Department of Treasury needs to give the money back.
