 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia Broughton,  my caseworker in San Pedro, California, who is retiring after her  distinguished career in public service.   Patricia has served for 32 years, and has served five Members of  Congress, including me. She also served former Representatives Janice  Hahn, Jane Harman, the late Steve Horn, the late Glenn Anderson, and  then myself.   Patricia isn't just a caseworker, she is a miracle worker. She has  handled virtually every type of case that is referred to a  congressional office.   Patricia has resolved Social Security and Medicare claims for  seniors, helped disabled veterans who weren't receiving their veterans'  disability checks, and assisted those who had trouble with the  Immigration and Naturalization Service and the IRS.   Patricia has been an advocate for the frustrated, and a source of  comfort for those tangled up in the Federal Government's bureaucracy.   I wish Patricia the best in her well-deserved retirement from public  service.                            ____________________
