 Mr. Speaker, over the last week, our relationship with Iran  has fallen to its most difficult period since 1979. The United States  killed Major General Qasem Soleimani, a bad man whom we do not mourn,  and yet it was a provocative and disproportionate event.   Iran responded with missiles on two of our military bases. I am  grateful, thankful that none of our soldiers were in that attack and  that tensions between our countries appear to be easing.   I hope we can use this moment to assess where we are, how we got  here, and find the better path that lies ahead.   First, I call on the administration to share the intelligence with  Congress about the timing and rationale for the strike.   Second, I urge continued de-escalation. We stand less safe in  heightened tensions with Iran. It is essential that we emphasize  diplomacy once again.   Third, I ask that we treat this moment as an opportunity to redefine  our relationships with foes and friends alike and how we act as a  nation.   We will always defend America's security, but we should never create  needless provocation. As Matthew tells us: ``Blessed are the  peacemakers: for they shall be called children of God.''                            ____________________
