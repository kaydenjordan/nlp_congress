 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be here. This is a somber time.  Yes, the Senate has sent us something over  [[Page H5889]]  again that we never got to really look into before we have to vote in  the House.   Madam Speaker, I actually have a bill, H.R. 7909, that I think you  all would be interested if I had gotten to speak to it in the Committee  on Rules this morning.   It does three things: It says to our law enforcement retired  professionals if they want to get a part-time job as an armed resource  officer with the school district, they don't have to pay Social  Security, withholding taxes, FICA--none of that--that is so they don't  get thrown into a higher income tax bracket.   The second thing it does, is it allows schools to hire an absolute  professional, a retired law enforcement professional at a reduced rate,  because they don't have to match Social Security, withholding, and  FICA.   But third and most importantly what it does, is it gives the students  and the teachers and the staff of that facility, first-class armed  protection in that school system and in that school district so that  when and if this happens, they have got a professional there.   May 18, 2018. It was a Friday; 10 people were killed in Santa Fe High  School, in my district.   John Barns, a police officer, an unarmed police officer was there  within 3 minutes.   He came around to confront the gunman, and the gunman pretty much  eviscerated his right arm with a shotgun. Other police officers showed  up quickly.   Madam Speaker, we can do this with help to the school districts. We  can get armed professional police officers there to help protect our  schools, the kids, teachers, and the staff. It doesn't have to be about  violating the Second Amendment. It doesn't have to be about taking away  gun rights. This is one simple thing.   Madam Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to look at that bill, see  if they are interested in it because it is one way we can help.                                time  1000
