 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, and  I rise today to oppose President Trump's anti-immigrant executive  orders and to share with you why I feel these orders harm the people  across my district and, ultimately, across our Nation.   I am here because my grandfather came here as an Italian immigrant  back in 1921. He told us that the reason he came here was to give his  children a better life, and he wanted a chance to achieve what I think  we all know to be the American Dream.   I am here in front of you living the reality of that dream. And that  is why I strive every day as best as I can to give back to my country  and community here in Washington, D.C., and especially on the central  coast of California.   I do that not only because of my grandfather, but because it was our  forefathers that made it clear that this is a nation, this is a country  based on ``We the People.'' And so to me, being in this country, being  American, means that all of us bear the burden to serve one another and  to welcome those--especially those--who are willing to come here and  share in that responsibility. I believe that we should embrace them. I  believe that we should embolden them with the opportunities to share in  that American Dream.   We know that the world looks to the United States for enlightened  leadership, but these ill-advised actions send a wrong message about  our values as a nation. We are a nation of immigrants. We are stronger  because of our diversity and because of the people who have taken the  risks to come here just as my grandfather did, to live here and to  contribute to our country and our communities.   On the central coast of California, that is the heart and soul of  that area. I see hardworking men and women who have come to this  country to live in it and contribute to it. The two main industries  there on the central coast are agriculture and tourism--big industries.  [[Page H1061]]    There are people, workers, owners who contribute greatly not only to  those industries, but to our communities, and they are our neighbors,  our friends, our families, our children. They sit next to my two  daughters and play with them at school. Clearly, without them, my  community would be a shell of its former self.   I hear the pain in their voices because they feel that this  administration's executive order targets them and makes them feel  unwelcome. I see that these types of executive orders drive a wedge in  our country, and it drives them further away from participating in our  community.   Before I was sworn in on January 3 of this year, I was a prosecutor;  and for the 5\1/2\ years that I was there at the Monterey County  District Attorney's Office, I prosecuted gang crimes. That kind of  prosecution, as you can imagine, as you know well, it can be very  difficult to have witnesses come forward and participate in one of the  cornerstones of our country: our criminal justice system. They are  intimidated. They are worried about retribution and retaliation.   Yet now, from what I have heard, they are worried not just about  criminals; they are worried about the government, the government  cracking down on them if they came forward, cracking down on them and  sending them back to where they came from. These executive orders  discourage participation in our community. Instead, as a nation, we  should encourage people to step up, to step forward, and to be a part  of our criminal justice system.   Last weekend, I met with community members and I heard directly from  them about their concerns, and this weekend, I am doing it again. I am  holding a townhall to continue this conversation.                                time  1745    I believe it is our responsibility to listen to all of our community  members and consider the implications of these types of executive  orders and the implications that they have on all of our constituents.   When the President of the United States was sworn in, he took an oath  to protect all members of our Nation by supporting and defending our  Constitution. As a Member of Congress, I took an oath to support and  defend that very same Constitution. Rest assured, I will honor that  oath, and I will honor the oath to my grandfather and to this country  by fighting and resisting unconstitutional orders from this or any  other President.
