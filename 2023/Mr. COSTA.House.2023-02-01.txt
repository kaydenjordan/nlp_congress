 Mr. Speaker, we are mourning today the loss of Officer  Gonzalo Carrasco, Jr., who, sadly, was shot and killed in the line of  duty yesterday protecting the citizens of Selma, California. Selma,  California, is a wonderful community of about 30,000 people in the  heart of the San Joaquin Valley.   Officer Carrasco was a son of farmworkers, a graduate of Reedley High  School, and worked constantly to increase his opportunities to become a  police officer. He also, sadly, was preparing to become a father.   He served with the Selma Police Department for 2 years and did all he  could to protect the community.   His service, bravery, and sacrifice will never be forgotten. It is a  sad day for the people of Selma.   I extend my heartfelt condolences to his family, the Selma Police  Department, and the people in the valley.   May he rest in peace. God bless him. We owe him a debt of gratitude.                            ____________________
