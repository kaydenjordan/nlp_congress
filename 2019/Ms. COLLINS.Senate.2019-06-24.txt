 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from  Alabama, Senator Jones, to urge our colleagues' support for our  amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. It would repeal  the Survivor Benefit Plan and dependency indemnity compensation offset,  more commonly known as the military widow's tax. This unfair offset is  currently preventing as many as 65,000 surviving military spouses--more  than 260 of them in the State of Maine--from receiving the full  benefits they deserve.   The Defense Department's Survivor Benefit Plan, or SBP, is primarily  an insurance benefit that military families purchase in their  retirement. It provides cash benefits to a surviving spouse or other  eligible recipients when a retiree passes away. On the other hand, the  Department of Veterans Affairs dependency and indemnity compensation,  known as DIC, is a monthly, tax-free payment to survivors and  dependents of servicemembers who pass away from service-related  conditions.   For example, if a military retiree pays premiums into the SBP  insurance program, then his or her spouse ought to be able to receive  those benefits when the retiree passes away. What we find instead,  however, is that surviving  [[Page S4201]]  spouses receiving these insurance payments have a dollar-for-dollar  offset for the separate payments they are receiving from the VA. In  some cases, this leads to the total elimination of the Survivor Benefit  Plan benefit. In other cases, the offset greatly reduces the benefit.  In either case, it is out-and-out unfair and harms the survivors of our  servicemembers and military retirees. The average offset amounts to  about $925 per month, which is often a significant amount of money that  a widow or a widower needs to help support their families or themselves  in the absence of their spouses.   Military commanders often say that you recruit the soldier but you  retain the family. We have an obligation to make sure we are taking  care of our military families who sacrifice so much for our country.   Our amendment has the support of numerous military and veterans  advocacy groups, including the Gold Star Wives of America, the Military  Officers Association of America, the National Military Family  Association, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, and the VFW,  among others.   More than 75 Senators--three-quarters of the Members of this  Chamber--and 340 Members of the House of Representatives support the  effort Senator Jones and I have led by cosponsoring our stand-alone  bill. In fact, this legislation has been adopted by the Senate in the  past numerous times, always by an overwhelming margin or by a voice  vote, only to be later stripped out in the conference process.   This problem goes back decades, but this year we can finally solve it  once and for all. It is time for us to do our duty not only to support  the brave men and women who serve in our military but also to support  their families. I encourage each of our colleagues to join in this  bipartisan effort and support the repeal of the military widow's tax as  part of the NDAA.    Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 150th  anniversary of the town of Grand Isle, ME. As one who was born and  raised in Aroostook County, it is a great pleasure to celebrate the  generations of industrious and caring people who have made Grand Isle  such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.   Named for a large and fertile island in the St. John River, Grand  Isle is a small town with a rich history. For thousands of years, the  river valley has been the home of the Micmac and Maliseet. French  explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first visited the area in 1604.  In the late 1700s, French-speaking Canadians began settling in the  area, laying the foundation for the vibrant Acadian culture that is so  important in Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and as far away as  Louisiana.   The Acadian settlers created a vibrant community. They cleared  farmland, established lumber and grain mills, railroad roundhouses, and  thriving general stores. In the 1870s, as railways expanded in the  region, the people of Grand Isle joined with their Canadian neighbors  on the opposite shore of the St. John River to build a ferry system  that used an 800-foot cable suspended above the river to connect the  products of their hard work to faraway markets.   When the World Acadian Congress convened in Aroostook County in 2014,  the descendants of those neighbors again came together to build a  replica of that historic ferry. The Grand Isle homecoming held during  the Congress celebrated the rich Acadian traditions of great food,  music, and dance, and of close-knit families and lasting friendships.   Those traditions are preserved and honored at the Cultural Museum of  Mount Carmel and its remarkable collection of Acadian artifacts. The  museum is located in the former Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic  Church, one of the few surviving 19th-century Acadian churches in  northern Maine. That beautiful architectural gem was lovingly restored  by the people of the region and is listed on the National Registry of  Historic Places.   The celebration of Grand Isle's 150th anniversary is not merely about  the passing of time; it is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the  people who pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great  community. Thanks to those who came before, Grand Isle, ME, has a  wonderful history. Thanks to those there today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  Minnesota, Senator Smith, in introducing the School Food Modernization  Act to assist schools in updating outdated kitchen equipment, allowing  them to provide healthier meals to students.   School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More  than 95,000 schools participate in the National School Lunch program,  serving upwards of 30 million children each day. Many children consume  up to half their daily caloric intake at school, and some get their  most nutritious meal of the day at school instead of at home. Because  school meals are a significant source of daily nutrition for so many,  we must consistently aim to improve the program to best serve students.   Schools built decades ago often lack the equipment and infrastructure  necessary to do more than reheat and serve one or two meal options each  day. In 2014, it was estimated that Maine schools alone would need  $58.8 million for equipment infrastructure upgrades needed to serve  healthy meals to all of our students. I am pleased that the Agriculture  Appropriations Subcommittee has consistently recognized this need, and  in Fiscal Year 2019 appropriated $30 million for School Equipment  Assistance Grants. Through this funding, Maine will be able to  competitively award $85,470 to school districts in need of updated  equipment.   Nutrition directors at Mount View High School in Thorndike, Maine,  used USDA Equipment Assistance funding to purchase a blast chiller to  accommodate increased quantities of fruits and vegetables. Thanks to  this equipment, the school is now able to quickly and safely preserve  the food's freshness while reducing spoilage. Other schools have  acquired hot holding cabinets, mobile food carts, and even combination  ovens, which prepare foods faster and maintain more vitamin and  nutrient content compared with many other cooking methods. Our  legislation would codify and improve this successful grant program to  better meet the growing need nationwide.   The School Food Modernization Act seeks to help school food service  personnel offer a wide variety of nutritious and appealing meals to all  students. First, the bill would provide targeted grant assistance to  supply the seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to  purchase high-quality equipment. Second, it would establish a loan  guarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new  equipment. Finally, to aid school food services personnel in running  successful, healthy programs, the legislation would authorize USDA to  provide support on a competitive basis to highly qualified third-party  trainers to develop and administer training and technical assistance,  including online programs.   I appreciate that some provisions of this legislation were  incorporated into previous versions of the Children Nutrition  Reauthorization legislation approved by the Senate Agriculture  Committee. I encourage our colleagues to continue to support school  kitchen equipment needs as the reauthorization process continues.   Mr. President, if our school children are going to be able to learn  and succeed, they need their minds and bodies to be fully nourished.  This bill would help us achieve that goal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  Minnesota, Senator Smith, in introducing the School Food Modernization  Act to assist schools in updating outdated kitchen equipment, allowing  them to provide healthier meals to students.
