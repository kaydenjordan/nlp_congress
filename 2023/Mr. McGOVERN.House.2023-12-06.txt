 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a profoundly stupid resolution. Under Republican  control, this Chamber has become a place where trivial issues get  debated passionately and important ones not at all. Republicans have  focused more on censuring people in this Congress than passing bills  that help people we represent or improving this country in any way.  What a waste of time and money. They have turned this place into a  joke.   They came into the majority talking a big game, but have delivered  nothing, not a single, damn thing. They talk about passing this and  passing that. All their hyperpartisan bills are going nowhere.   What we are now doing is distracting from the fact that the  Republican agenda has been a total and complete failure, the least  productive Congress in history, the most rules failed in a single year.  They dragged America to the brink of default twice, almost shut down  the government, wasted weeks fighting about who should be Speaker, and  hitting each other in the hallways.   We should be talking about important issues in this Chamber, Mr.  Speaker. We should be addressing healthcare costs, helping Americans  build economic security, competing with our adversaries abroad, and  investing in our people at home.   We just had a shooting in Las Vegas. We should be talking about  preventing gun violence in this country, and you have us here talking  about how someone tried to go out the wrong door of the Cannon House  Office Building.   Honestly, what the hell is wrong with you?   Congressman Bowman apologized. I want to read his statement so we can  be clear about what we are talking about here today. ``Today, as I was  rushing to make a vote, I came to a door that is usually open for votes  but today would not open. I am embarrassed to admit that I activated  the fire alarm, mistakenly thinking it would open the door. I regret  this and sincerely apologize for any confusion this caused.''   He messed up. Like many of us do every day, he was rushing to get to  votes. Guess what? No one was hurt. No one's life was put in danger.  Votes went on like nothing happened. Anyone who works here knows that a  fire alarm going off across the street wouldn't impact votes here in  the Capitol.   I find it terribly ironic that we are talking about censuring Mr.  Bowman, yet we never censured any of our colleagues who tried to  overturn the election on January 6 or who failed to respond to a  subpoena or who put our national security in danger by storming the  SCIF with their phones.   In fact, to the contrary,   Mike Johnson, the new Speaker of the  House, held a press conference yesterday about the January 6 video  footage. Something he said stuck with me:         We have to blur some of the people's faces who participated       in the events of that day because we don't want them to be       retaliated against and charged by the DOJ.    Just to be clear, Republicans want to protect the insurrectionists,  shield them from accountability, the people who beat officers, kicked  in doors, smashed windows, desecrated this building, and tried to take  down our democracy. Not our doors; America's doors, America's officers,  America's windows. This is America's building that Trump's mob defiled.   Speaker Johnson wants to protect the mob but has us here debating  this absurd censure. What a pathetic exercise in retaliation and  revenge. What a petty thing it is to bring this garbage to the floor.  Sadly, it is just a typical week for this disgraceful Republican  majority.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6191]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I will say it again, this resolution is  profoundly stupid.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Bowman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman talks about following the  Constitution. Really? Coming from that side, it is laughable to hear  that. There was silence about the crimes of Donald Trump; silence about  what happened here on January 6. Silence.   Do you want to talk about opening a door?   The people who stormed this place broke down doors trying to kill  people. Silence. I don't want to hear any lectures about upholding the  Constitution. There is nothing but silence about the crimes of those  who attacked this Capitol on January 6.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, let me just respond to the gentleman by  saying if this isn't political or partisan, I don't know what the hell  is. This is a pathetic display that we are seeing here on the House  floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Aguilar), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my Republican  colleagues: Are you listening to yourselves talk?   We are in the House Chamber. Heads of state address this body. We  have debates about war and peace, and you are talking about a fire  alarm? I mean, give me a break.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, it is really rich to get a lecture from  someone about civility who stood on this House floor and screamed and  interrupted the President of the United States during his state of the  Union, or somebody who continues to circle the wagons and cheer on the  insurrectionists who attacked this Capitol violently on January 6.   I was the last person off the House floor on that day, and I saw what  happened. Then for people to come down here and defend those actions,  it is pathetic and disgusting.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, oh, my goodness, I had trouble following  the gentlewoman. I mean, was crime up or down in the last  administration? The one thing I can say with certainty is that crime  was way up in the White House in the last administration without a  doubt.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Frost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington State (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Ms. Bush).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I apologize to the American people. I apologize that Republicans are  wasting  [[Page H6197]]  their hard-earned taxpayer money with yet another stupid and  meaningless censure resolution instead of doing anything that will help  the American people.   Jamaal Bowman is a good man, a decent man, a kind man. He was rushing  to exit a House Office Building so he could go vote, and he activated a  fire alarm in the process of trying to open a door.   Did he destroy government property? No.   Did he obstruct an official proceeding? No.   Did he wield a deadly weapon? No.   Did he assault or injure anyone? No.   However, did he apologize and take responsibility for his actions?  Yes, he did.   That is more than we can say for January 6, when this building was  desecrated by an angry mob sent by Trump to overturn an election.  Republican Members of this body still act like nothing happened. How  disgusting. How offensive it is to the men and women who protect us  that my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to act like  nothing happened that day.   At the end of the day, this has nothing to do with Congressman  Bowman, and my friends know that. It is about deflecting from how  unhinged this majority is. They had to expel one of their own Members  last week, for God's sake. They had the first Speaker in history to be  ousted. They have nothing of any consequence to show for an entire year  in the majority. Nothing. They have done nothing. They have wasted time  on stupid measures like this. Nothing.   This whole exercise is just nuts. For Republicans, it is all about  appeasing their orange overlord in Mar-a-Lago who can do no wrong.   They don't care about governing. They aren't fit to govern. They  aren't concerned about the serious and complex issues facing this  country, the world, or the people we represent. For them, being in  power is all about retaliation and revenge, and the destruction of  their perceived enemies. It is time for the Republican Party to grow  up.    Mr. Speaker, I don't want to waste another second on this meaningless  resolution. This is pathetic. The Republicans have turned this Chamber  into a place where trivial issues get debated passionately and  important ones not at all.   My friends have done nothing--not a damn thing--for the people that  they say they represent. How can anybody on the other side of the aisle  go home with a straight face and say that they are representing their  constituents? They have produced nothing for them. They have turned  this place into a joke.   It is sad that we are here today. Again, I will end as I began, by  apologizing to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this pathetic, stupid  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
