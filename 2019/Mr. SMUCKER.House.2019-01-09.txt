 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent and  a friend of mine, Mr. Ken Schwebel, of Mount Joy, Pennsylvania, who  faithfully served as the chairman of the Keystone Chapter of Associated  Builders and Contractors in 2018. Ken also currently serves as the  president of the Witmer Group, a leading regional masonry company.   Ken led the Keystone ABC Chapter through many milestones during his  time as chair. Under his leadership, the chapter chartered its first- ever college student chapter from Millersville University, and also  taught middle-school children more about construction through two  Construction War programs.   The chapter also had a record number of participants in networking  events, and had the largest enrollment in its apprenticeship program  under Ken's leadership.   I would like to congratulate and thank Ken for his service to the  construction industry and to our community.                            ____________________
