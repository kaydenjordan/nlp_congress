 Madam Speaker, as cochair of the Congressional Caucus  on Foster Youth, I rise to recognize November as National Adoption  Month.   All children deserve the love and security of a forever family.  Unfortunately, this is not a reality for too many children across the  country.   More than 123,000 children are waiting right now to be adopted from  foster care in the United States. Those who reach adulthood and exit  care without a family are far more likely to experience bouts of  homelessness and unemployment, among other negative outcomes.   Madam Speaker, who among us would have succeeded without the love and  support of our families to be there for us, whether it was the family  we were born into or the family we make.   Madam Speaker, we must ensure that every child has the family they  need to thrive. Adoption provides this pathway.   On November 17, 19 Rhode Island families celebrated National Adoption  Day by finalizing the adoptions of 23 children.   I would like to honor these families and others who open their hearts  to children in need. There is no greater gift than the gift of a  forever home.                            ____________________
