 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, I came to the floor to talk  about how the President's economic policies are failing to serve the  lower and middle-income Americans he claims are his priority.   The President talks about wanting to give American families ``a  little more breathing room,'' but his Big Government, big spending  policies are taking away Americans' breathing room, as cash-strapped  families struggling with the effects of the President's historic  inflation crisis can attest.   Today, I want to talk about another set of the President's policies  that aren't serving Americans, and that is the President's energy  policy. Since the day he took office, President Biden has pursued an  agenda that is hostile to conventional sources of energy; namely, oil  and natural gas. He set the tone on his very first day in office when  he canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline--an environmentally responsible  pipeline project that was already underway, and was to be paired with  $1.7 billion in private investment in renewable energy to fully  offset--fully offset--its operating emissions.   He also almost immediately froze new oil and gas leases on Federal  land, sending a clear signal to oil and gas producers that his  administration would be reluctant to work with them to increase  American energy production. And he has continued along the same lines  ever since, from raising taxes on conventional energy to proposing a  rule that would effectively mandate that automakers only make electric  vehicles beginning in the near future. The President's policies have  targeted conventional energy.   In March, the President announced that he would close off a  substantial part of the Arctic to oil and gas development. In the same  week, his Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule--a so-called  good neighbor rule that threatens to close a number of fossil fuel- powered power plants.   So why is all this a problem? After all, Members of both parties  support alternative energy technologies. Why are the President's  efforts to shut down conventional energy production a problem?   Well, the President's attacks on conventional energy are a problem  because conventional energy still plays an essential role in providing  a steady, reliable energy supply to American consumers.   No matter how much the White House might wish it weren't the case,  the technology to fully transition the United States to clean energy  simply doesn't exist yet, and all of the Green New Deal, anti- conventional energy policies in the world can't change that basic fact.   What the President's Green New Deal, anti-conventional energy  policies can do, however, is jeopardize our Nation's energy supply and  drive up prices for American consumers. Americans know the energy price  hikes of the Biden administration all too well. From restricting oil  and gas production to imposing tax hikes on conventional energy,  President Biden's energy policies have driven up Americans' energy  costs, but that will be nothing compared to what will happen if the  President succeeds in choking off and drastically reducing conventional  energy production. Prices will soar; blackouts, brownouts, and calls  for energy rationing will become commonplace; and our economic and  national security will be in jeopardy.   We are not at the point yet where we are experiencing blackouts and  brownouts on a regular basis--unless, I guess, you are a resident of  California, whose energy grid is known for being unreliable because of  the State's overreliance on renewables--but the President's policies  could push us over the edge.   In February, the PJM Interconnection, which manages a substantial  part of Eastern America's electric grid, released a report warning that  fossil fuel plants are being forced to retire at a faster rate than new  renewables can be brought online, at a rate of roughly 2 to 1. In other  words, we are rapidly approaching a situation where we simply don't  have the ability to keep up with  [[Page S1476]]  the electricity demand, and as the report underscored, that situation  is being driven by anti-conventional energy policies.   The Wall Street Journal, which weighed in after the PJM report was  released, noted that ``most projected powerplant retirements are  `policy driven.' '' That is what the report says. In other words,  powerplants aren't closing because they have reached the end of their  operating lives; they are closing because of policies designed to  discourage conventional energy.   I have already mentioned the EPA's new good neighbor rule, which  could force powerplants in 22 States to close. Then there are things  like utility company environmental, social, and governance--or ESG-- policies. They are policies that utility companies can voluntarily  adopt but that this administration wants to mandate, which the PJM  report highlights as a factor in plant closures.   Not only do overreaching ESG policies force some of our most reliable  energy facilities offline, these facilities are also being replaced  with technologies like solar that are inherently intermittent and can't  be dispatched in times of high demand.   The Wall Street Journal notes that ``Illinois and New Jersey climate  policies could reduce generation by 8,900 [megawatts].'' That amount of  energy would be enough to power over 7 million households.   So, in other words, policies that discourage conventional energy are  already having an effect and threatening our Nation's energy supply. If  the President continues to pursue these types of policies, his  Presidency may be remembered not just for a historic inflation crisis  but for setting off a long-term energy crisis caused by an unreliable  and insufficient energy supply.   Instead of trying to bring about a clean energy future before we have  the technology to get us there, the President should be pursuing an  ``all of the above'' energy policy--an energy policy that embraces the  full spectrum of available energy sources, both renewable and  conventional.   I am a strong supporter of clean energy, like so many of my  Republican colleagues, but unlike Democrats, Republicans recognize that  our Nation is not going to be fully transitioning to 100-percent zero- emission energy anytime soon no matter how much the administration  would like it to. There are a lot of hurdles to be crossed before we  can rely solely on clean energy.   So Republicans are committed to supporting both alternative energy  and the responsible development and deployment of the conventional  energy we need to keep our Nation's energy grid reliable and Americans'  energy costs down. For evidence, you need look no further than the  energy legislation recently passed by the Republican-led House of  Representatives, which would advance both responsible conventional  energy development and clean energy technologies.   Predictably, the Senate Democrat leader has declared this legislation  ``dead on arrival'' in the U.S. Senate. Democrats are so beholden to  the radical environmental wing of their party that anything that  doesn't adhere to their Green New Deal orthodoxy isn't up for  discussion. But Democrats' opposition is unfortunate, not just because  this legislation would help ensure an adequate supply of conventional  energy but also--also--because it would help advance alternative energy  projects.   Republicans' legislation would tackle permitting delays, which are a  leading impediment to energy development, including alternative energy  development. Republicans' legislation would also actually help support  the electric car development that Democrats are so committed to by  enabling the development of critical mineral resources here at home-- the same critical minerals that are essential ingredients in electric  car batteries.   While I am on the subject of cars, I will say that the President made  one right decision on energy last Friday by approving the sale of E15  fuel for this summer. Americans saved $57 million last year thanks to  summertime E15 sales. With the war in Ukraine continuing to stress fuel  markets, renewing this E15 permission will help drive down the expected  summer surge in gas prices while at the same time benefiting  our environment and offsetting production cuts from OPEC.    But while I am glad the President listened to calls from me and  others to extend E15 sales through the summer, it is unfortunately one  of just a handful of times when the President has opted for reliable  and affordable energy instead of an unrealistic anti-conventional  energy policy.   An ``all of the above'' energy policy--a policy that embraces both  conventional and renewable energy sources--is essential for keeping  energy prices affordable, ensuring the reliability of our Nation's  energy supply, and keeping our Nation secure. If the President doesn't  start encouraging conventional as well as renewable energy development,  consumers and our country are going to pay a heavy price.   The President has already ensured that he will be remembered for a  historic inflation crisis. He should make sure he isn't remembered as  the instigator of a future energy crisis as well.
