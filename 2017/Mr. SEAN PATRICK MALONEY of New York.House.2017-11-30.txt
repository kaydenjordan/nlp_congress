 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a  giant of the Hudson Valley, former Congressman Maurice Hinchey.   Mr. Hinchey passed away last week, but 21 years ago, I had the  opportunity to be a young volunteer on his campaign for Congress. A few  days ago, I attended his wake with hundreds of my neighbors in the  Hudson Valley.   When you met Maurice Hinchey, you met, first and foremost, a real,  live, flesh-and-blood human being who was strong, principled, and  passionate. That person became a real hero to many of us in the Hudson  Valley.   We celebrate his life of service in the Navy, in the New York  Assembly, and, of course, here in the Congress.   I am blessed to represent a district that includes many of the same  communities that Maurice Hinchey represented. When I took office, I  heard the same thing again and again: if you want to succeed, just do  what Maurice Hinchey did. That advice is easier said than done, but I  have tried.   He was one of a kind: a leader, a fighter, a gentleman, and a  statesman. He was a tireless advocate for the Hudson River and for the  larger environment.  [[Page H9562]]    We are all blessed to have been served by him, and he will be sorely  missed.                            ____________________
