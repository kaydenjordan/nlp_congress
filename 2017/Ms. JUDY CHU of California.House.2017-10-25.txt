 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to the underlying rule that would allow for consideration of  the Senate-passed Republican Budget. If passed, this budget would allow  Republicans to fast-track their tax plan through Congress without  Democratic support.   Now, I stand in support of a tax plan to help the middle class, but  that is not the tax plan we are seeing proposed by Republicans.  Instead, we see that 80 percent of the benefits will go to the richest  1 percent in this country. The problem? Somebody has to pay for it, and  it looks like it could be the middle class.   I have heard from workers worried that cuts of contributions to their  401(k) plans will ruin their retirement. I have heard from seniors  worried that losing homeowners' incentives will make it harder for them  to stay in their homes. And I have heard from families worried that a  repeal of the State and local tax deduction will increase their tax  burden.  [[Page H8162]]    In fact, we know that one-third of the middle class will see their  taxes increase under this plan. And the numbers show that, as our  constituents begin to learn more, they are realizing that this plan  only cuts taxes for the wealthy and corporate interests and leaves  middle class families behind. That is why a Reuters poll released  yesterday found that fewer than a third of Americans support the  Republican tax plan at all.   This tax plan for the rich will increase the deficit by $2.2  trillion. And who will pay for it? Your children and their  grandchildren. They will have to suffer from the cuts made down along  the line to education, to Medicaid, to Medicare.   And for what? To make the rich richer? To line the pockets of  Washington special interests? That is not right.    Reject this budget. Most importantly, reject this tax plan.
