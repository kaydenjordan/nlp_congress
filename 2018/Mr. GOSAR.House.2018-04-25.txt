 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill offered by  Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers.   This is a great piece of legislation that supports smart  hydroelectric operation, a stable and integrated energy grid, and above  all, reinforces that the United States Congress has a vested interest  in ensuring it, Congress, rather than the judiciary, promulgates  Federal policy.   H.R. 3144 keeps in place the operational plan, developed by consensus  through multiple agency processes and based in the best available  science, for four dams in Washington State which have wrongfully come  under siege recently due to an arbitrary court order by a judge in  Oregon.   In general, continuing to lean on hydropower as a long-term component  of our Nation's electrical grid is an absolute no-brainer. Hydropower  is a clean source of energy, and its reliability and cost effectiveness  are just a few of the reasons it enjoys the stature it has today.   It needs to maintain that stature, including the requirement of  careful science-based policy crafting when changes to hydroelectric  policy are in question if we are to guarantee a reliable energy future  for our country.   But if overzealous special interest groups have their way, we would  immediately begin deconstructing and destroying all our dams across the  country. To their mindset, dams are not natural parts of the landscape  and, therefore, represent a most serious threat to the planet. To them,  changes to the natural landscape are anathema, despite the fact that  the only real constant on our planet and in the environment is change  itself.   The judges's order in this case in question is, unfortunately, in  keeping with this very same mindset. This is not a stretch to say  because he, in fact, fails to rely on the only available and complete  science that informed past decisions concerning the Federal Columbia  River Power System.   These past decisions, keep in mind, included the Obama  administration's green-lighting of the current operation plan in 2014  that the judge seeks to overturn with his spill order.   What the judge did in this case was to take it upon himself to depart  from agency consensus based on sound science and ordered changes to the  operation plan of the power system just because he wanted to.   He ordered this major policy change first, which will cost  electricity customers in the region $40 million annually, by the way,  and pegged future changes to the outcome of a NEPA review which is just  getting underway.   But the only grounds for so radical a policy change would be if the  NEPA review in question called for those changes when it is finally  finished. The judge doesn't know what the outcome of the NEPA review  will be, obviously, because it is still being conducted.                                time  1545    He made his decision without basis, and now the country is supposed  to pay for it. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  constantly rail about how they oppose bills and proposals and prevent  the National Environmental Policy Act review process from being carried  out.   H.R. 3144 also allows continuation of a court-ordered national NEPA  review process. If my colleagues practice what they preach, then they  would support this bill as it allows the NEPA review process to be  carried out. Congress has an obligation to remind everyone involved  that we are the constitutionally authorized policymakers and that we  choose to make policy and require agency decisionmaking on the basis of  sound science.   This bill will keep the current operation plan in place until 2022,  unless the NEPA process review finishes first, at which point the NEPA- supported plan would commence. This bill abides by the proper statutory  NEPA process, even though the judge's order fails to do that.   As stated by the Public Power Council, H.R. 3144 allows a court- ordered NEPA process to continue without avoiding a costly and  potentially harmful spill experiment. The fear is that without this  legislation, a spill regime will be put in place that increases  regional power costs while providing no apparent benefit to the fish it  purports to help.   What is perhaps most crucial to keep in mind during this whole debate  is the broader significance of this bill to any Member who has a major  public works infrastructure operating in their district. Without this  bill, it is possible that this judge's terrible precedent could stand.  At that point, nothing stands in the way of an activist judge across  the country waking up one day and deciding to put a halt to a whole  slew of public works infrastructures which makes this country tick.   H.R. 3144 is absolutely necessary to establish congressional intent.  Sound process must win the day over the capriciousness of any given  activist judge or his political leanings.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from the  local public utility districts on behalf of H.R. 3144.                                                 Pend Oreille County                                         Public Utility District,                                        Newport, WA, April 24, 2018.      Hon. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers,      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives McMorris-Rodgers and Newhouse: On       behalf of the Public Utility District No. 1 of Pend Oreille       County we greatly appreciate the support you have shown for       hydropower and, more specifically, the Federal Columbia River       Power System (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of H.R.       3144. This bill supports the hydro system and the many       benefits it brings to the region through renewable, reliable       and affordable power.        Despite the success of the current FCRPS Biological Opinion       (BiOp), the plan has been rejected with a ruling that all       options need to be reviewed including breaching or removing       one or more of the four Snake River dams.        Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of       federal hydro system operations by directing the federal       agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014.       The current BiOp is based on the best available science, has       been vetted by stakeholders and was formally approved by the       Obama administration. Implementation of the BiOp has       successfully increased salmon runs due to operational       requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage       technologies.        The Bonneville Power Administration has spent over $15       billion on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since       1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are paid for       by our customers through their electric bills. Their bills       are already higher by at least 15 percent for fish mitigation       programs. The ``spill test'' ordered by the judge will be an       additional cost that will result in higher electric bills for       Northwest families and businesses and likely to be more       detrimental to the fish runs than helpful. Your legislation       will bring an end to the wasteful activities.        This is particularly important for Pend Oreille PUD as our       largest industrial customer Ponderay Newsprint is a large       consumer of BPA power for its operations. The  [[Page H3554]]       unnecessary spending and additional mitigation costs continue       to put jobs at stake in our rural communities.        We appreciate your leadership on this issue with the       introduction of H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to       follow your lead.            Sincerely,                                              F. Colin Willenbrock,      General Manager.                                   ____                                                    Wahkiakum PUD,                                      Cathlamet, WA, April 23, 2018.      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Newhouse: On behalf of the Public       Utility District No. 1 of Wahkiakum County we greatly       appreciate the support you have shown for hydropower and,       more specifically, the Federal Columbia River Power System       (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of H.R. 3144.

Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Newhouse: On behalf of Douglas County       PUD we greatly appreciate the support you have shown for       hydropower and, more specifically, the Federal Columbia River       Power System (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of H.R.       3144. This bill supports the hydro system and the many       benefits it brings to the region through renewable, reliable       and affordable power.

Ivory,      General Manager.                                   ____         Representative Newhouse: I wanted to reiterate to you one       more time how important the bill you co-sponsored, H.R. 3144,       is to Franklin PUD and our customers. We hope the bill gains       positive traction this week and advances to the House Floor.        Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of       federal hydro system operations by directing the federal       agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014.       The current BiOp is based on the best available science, has       been vetted by stakeholders and was formally approved by the       Obama administration. Implementation of the BiOp has       successfully increased salmon runs due to operational       requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage       technologies.        The Bonneville Power Administration has spent over $15       billion on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since       1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are paid for       by our customers through their electric bills. For Franklin       PUD customers, their bills are already higher by at least 15-      18 percent for fish mitigation programs. The ``spill test''       ordered by the judge will be an additional cost that will       result in higher electric bills for Northwest families,       businesses, and Franklin PUD customers, and is likely to be       more detrimental to the fish runs than helpful. Your       legislation will bring an end to the wasteful activities.        We appreciate your leadership on this issue with the       introduction of H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to       follow your lead. Thanks again for coming to the Tri-Cities       this month to hear our customers issues regarding ag,       irrigation and fish, that are all impacted by the continuance       of this spill that is not required.                                             Debbie Bone-Harris,                                        Sr. Manager, Public Affairs,      Franklin PUD.                                   ____                             Resolution No. 8860      A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING H.R. 3144 FEDERAL LEGISLATION ADDRESSING               COLUMBIA RIVER POWER SYSTEM BIOLOGICAL OPINION                                  Recitals         1. The state of Washington is the leading U.S. producer of       hydropower, routinely contributing more than one-fourth of       the nation's total net hydroelectric generation;        2. Hydropower accounts for between two-thirds and four-      fifths of Washington's electricity generation, providing       renewable and inexpensive electricity to the region's farms,       homes, businesses, schools and industries;        3. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), U.S. Army       Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation are       responsible for the management of the Federal Columbia River       Power System (FCRPS) in compliance with the Biological       Opinion (BiOp) approved by NOAA Fisheries in 2008/2010 and       supplemented in 2014;        4. The FCRPS BiOp has helped to improve fish runs,       including 97% of young salmon successfully making it past the       federal dams, demonstrating that both renewable hydropower       and fish can coexist;        5. Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, in March       2017, the United States Court for the District of Oregon       directed the federal agencies to undertake a comprehensive       review of hydro operations under the National Environmental       Policy Act (NEPA) and strongly urged the federal agencies to       include analysis of the removal, bypass or breaching one of       more of the four lower Snake River hydropower dams;        6. Bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3144, provides a creative       solution to the endless litigation over federal hydro system       operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the       current federal salmon plan, known as the 2014 Supplemental       BiOp. That plan:        a. Was vetted and supported by the Obama Administration's       top scientists;        b. Has resulted in improved young salmon survival at the       federal dams due to changes in operations and the       installation of new fish passage technologies;        c. Restored thousands of acres of habitat in rivers, the       estuary and floodplains for salmon spawning and rearing; and        d. Would allow federal hydropower operations to continue       through September 30, 2022 or until the court-ordered,       comprehensive environmental NEPA process concludes, a new       BiOp is in place and judicial review is complete.        7. Without the legislation, the federal agencies would be       compelled to author a new 2018 BiOp without the benefit of       the new science and public input provided by the       comprehensive NEPA review; and        8. H.R. 3144 was introduced by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers       (R-WA) and co-sponsored by Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Rep.       Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-OR) and       Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR).        Now therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Public       Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington, that       Grant PUP supports H.R. 3144, and applauds the co-sponsors of       this bipartisan legislation as it:        Offers a creative solution that is good for both salmon,       renewable hydropower and the economy of the Northwest.        Provides relief in the endless litigation of the federal       hydro system.        Provides time for the federal agencies to complete the       court-ordered NEPA environmental review process.        Avoids experiments, modifications or spill tests at the       eight federal Columbia and Snake River dams, which could have       the potential to unnecessarily restrict renewable electric       generation, create uncertainties in BPAss power costs and       supply, and raise Northwest customers' electric rates.        Passed and approved by the Commission of Public Utility       District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington this 24 day of       October 2017.                                   ____                Resolution of the Benton REA Board of Trustees       SUPPORTING H.R. 3144 FEDERAL LEGISLATION ADDRESSING THE FEDERAL               COLUMBIA RIVER POWER SYSTEM BIOLOGICAL OPINION         Whereas, Members of Benton Rural Electric Association       receive 86 percent of their electricity from the Federal       Columbia River Power System (FCRPS); and        Whereas, Hydropower provides 70 percent of Washington       state's clean affordable and reliable electricity and 60       percent of the Pacific Northwest's electricity with the       majority of the power produced by the FCRPS; and  [[Page H3555]]         Whereas, Hydroelectric dams also provide many benefits to       the region, including flood control, navigation, irrigation,       and recreation: and        Whereas, Federal legislation requires the federal agencies       responsible for the management of the FCRPS to operate the       hydro system in compliance with the Biological Opinion (BiOp)       approved by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration       (NOAA) Fisheries in 2008/2010 and supplemented in 2014, and        Whereas, This BiOp was vetted and supported by the previous       presidential administrations' top scientists and has resulted       in wild salmon numbers trending significantly upward due to       changes in operations and the installation of new passage       technologies, and        Whereas, The FCRPS BiOp has successfully improved fish runs       including 97% of young salmon successfully making it past the       dams proving that both dams and fish can coexist; and        Whereas, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has spent       $15.28 billion in total spending on infrastructure and fish       mitigation projects since 1978; and        Whereas, Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, in       March 2017, the United States District Court for the District       of Oregon directed the federal agencies to undertake a       comprehensive review of hydro operations under the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and strongly urged the       federal agencies to include analysis of the removal, bypass       or breaching one or more of the four lower Snake River dams;       and        Whereas, H.R. 3144, ``To provide for operations of the       Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain       operation plan for a specified period of time'', was       introduced in the United States House of Representatives, and        Whereas, The federal legislation would continue federal       hydro operations through September 30, 2022 or until the       court-ordered, comprehensive environmental NEPA process       concludes, a new BiOp is in place, and judicial review is       complete, and        Whereas, The federal legislation would prohibit studies,       plans or structural modifications at the dams which would       impair hydroelectric power generation or navigation on the       Columbia River; and        Whereas, The federal legislation offers a creative solution       that is good for both listed salmon and the economy of the       communities served by Benton Rural Electric Association, and       provides relief in the endless litigation of federal hydro       system operations by directing the federal agencies to       implement the current federal salmon plan, known as the 2014       Supplemental BiOp; and        Whereas, The federal legislation provides time for the       federal agencies to complete the court-ordered NEPA       environmental review process analyzing federal hydro system       operations and focuses the general agencies limited resources       on getting that process right.        Whereas, without the legislation, the agencies would be       compelled to author a new 2018 BiOp without the benefit of       the new science and public input provided by the       comprehensive NEPA review, and avoids experiments or spill       tests at the eight Columbia and Snake dams, and studies and       modifications at the dams which would restrict electrical       generation, which would create uncertainties in BPA's power       costs and supply and raise Northwest electric customers'       rates.        Now, therefore be it resolved that the Board of Trustees of       Benton Rural Electric Association supports the passage of       H.R. 3144 this July 26, 2017.
