 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my  good friend, Mr. Meadows. We have been working on issues like this  relating to the long-term solvency of our Postal Service for many  years, and I look forward to standing on this floor with him in the  near future when we come up with a good, comprehensive solution that  addresses issues like this.   I thank him for his leadership and his support of the Postal Service  and the great postal workers who make up one of the greatest services  that we have in our country.   Unfortunately, the Postal Service today is forced to play by a  different set of rules, and those are unfair. This bill corrects this  by repealing the 2006 mandate that the Postal Service prefund future  retiree health benefits.   In 2006, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act mandated that  the Postal Service prefund retiree health benefits decades in advance,  something no other public or private enterprise is forced to do. Over  the years, this mandate has caused severe cuts and damaged the Postal  Service's ability to invest in even new delivery vehicles.   I have always been a steadfast supporter of the Postal Service and  its workers. In fact, after speaking to many of the postal unions in my  district, like the Letter Carriers and the Rural Letter Carriers', I  proudly cosponsored this piece of legislation.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue and other  important pieces of legislature that impact our postal unions, such as  opposing the privatization of the Postal Service and protecting the 6- day delivery, door-to-door service, and our rural post offices.   Mr. Speaker, we have to work together. We need to make sure that our  Postal Service remains viable. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and  I look forward to working with everyone in this institution in the  future.
