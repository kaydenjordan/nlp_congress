 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1972) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to waive the requirement of certain  veterans to make copayments for hospital care and medical services in  the case of an error by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1972         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Billing Accountability       Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO WAIVE                     REQUIREMENT OF CERTAIN VETERANS TO MAKE                     COPAYMENTS FOR CARE AND SERVICES IN THE CASE OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ERROR.         (a) Hospital Care, Nursing Home Care, and Medical       Services.--Section 1710(f)(3) of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       subparagraph:        ``(G) The Secretary may waive the requirement of a veteran       to make a payment under this subsection or subsection (g)       if--        ``(i) an error committed by the Department or an employee       of the Department was the cause of delaying notification sent       to the veteran of the requirement to make the payment; and        ``(ii) the veteran received such notification later than       180 days after the date on which the veteran received the       care or services for which the payment was required.''.        (b) Medications.--Section 1722A of such title is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new       subsection (c):        ``(c) The Secretary may waive the requirement of a veteran       to make a payment under this section if--        ``(1) an error committed by the Department or an employee       of the Department was the cause of delaying notification sent       to the veteran of the requirement to make the payment; and        ``(2) the veteran received such notification later than 180       days after the date on which the veteran received the       medication for which the payment was required.''.        (c) Billing Procedures.--        (1) In general.--Subchapter I of chapter 17 of such title       is amended by adding at the end the following new section:       ``Sec. 1709C. Procedures for copayments         ``(a) Care at Department Facility.--(1) In requiring a       veteran to make a payment for care or services provided at a       medical facility of the Department pursuant to this chapter,       including sections 1710 and 1722A, the Secretary shall       provide to such veteran a notification of such required       payment by not later than 180 days after the date on which       the veteran receives the care or services for which payment       is required.        ``(2) If the Secretary does not provide to a veteran a       notification of the required payment by the date required       under paragraph (1), the Secretary may not collect such       payment, including through a third-party entity, unless the       Secretary provides the veteran the following:        ``(A) Information regarding how to apply for a waiver       described in section 1710(f)(3)(G) or section 1722A(c) of       this title, as appropriate.        ``(B) Information regarding how to establish a payment plan       with the Secretary.        ``(C) Opportunity to make such a waiver or establish such a       payment plan.        ``(b) Care at Non-Department Facility.--(1) In requiring a       veteran to make a payment for care or services provided at a       non-Department facility pursuant to this chapter or other       provision of law, the Secretary shall provide to such veteran       a notification of such required payment by not later than 18       months after the date on which the veteran receives the care       or services for which payment is required.        ``(2) If the Secretary does not provide to a veteran a       notification of the required payment by the date required       under paragraph (1), the Secretary may not collect such       payment, including through a third-party entity, unless the       Secretary provides the veteran the following:        ``(A) Information regarding how to apply for a waiver       described in paragraph (3).        ``(B) Information regarding how to establish a payment plan       with the Secretary.        ``(C) Opportunity to make such a waiver or establish such a       payment plan.        ``(3) The Secretary may waive the requirement of a veteran       to make a payment for care or services provided at a non-      Department facility pursuant to this chapter or other       provision of law if--        ``(A) an error committed by the Department, an employee of       the Department, or a non-Department facility was the cause of       delaying the notification sent to the veteran of the       requirement to make the payment; and        ``(B) the veteran received such notification after the       period described in paragraph (1).''.        (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 1709B the following new item:  ``1709C. Procedures for copayments.''.        (d) Improvement of Procedures.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs shall--        (1) review the copayment billing internal controls and       notification procedures of the Department of Veterans       Affairs; and        (2) improve such controls and procedures, including       pursuant to the amendments made by this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 1972, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1972, as amended, the VA  Billing Accountability Act.   This bill would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to waive  copayment requirements if veterans are not notified of their need to  pay a copayment for a given service in a timely manner.   VA's untimely processing of claims is well-documented. The negative  impact those challenges have on recruiting and retaining community  providers is also well-documented. However, those challenges also have  a negative impact on our veterans.   Three years ago this June, the VA Medical Center in Minneapolis,  Minnesota, initiated a review of past processes on veteran inpatient  copayment charges for the years 2011 to 2015. Following that review,  thousands of veterans in Minnesota and Wisconsin were charged  copayments for services that they had received as much as 4 years  earlier.   Receiving a large bill out of the blue for care that was received, in  some cases years ago, understandably caused great concern and upset  among veterans. The VA Billing Accountability Act would prevent that.   The VA MISSION Act that the House passed last week included several  provisions that would make it easier for the VA to process and pay  claims accurately and on time. This bill would protect veterans by  setting specific notification procedures that the VA must abide by when  a veteran is going to be charged a copayment for a VA service and by  authorizing the VA to waive a copayment if an error committed by the VA  caused a delayed notification.   I am grateful to my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative Lloyd  Smucker, for introducing this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues  to join me in supporting it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), my friend and classmate. He is also the  gentleman who introduced this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), who has been working very hard on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member Walz. I  once again encourage all Members to support H.R. 1972, as amended, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3642) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a  pilot program to improve the access to private health care for veterans  who are survivors of military sexual trauma, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 3642         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Military Sexual Assault       Victims Empowerment Act'' or the ``Military SAVE Act''.       SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM FOR PRIVATE HEALTH CARE FOR VETERANS                     WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA.         (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       carry out a pilot program to furnish hospital care and       medical services to eligible veterans through non-Department       health care providers to treat injuries or illnesses which,       in the judgment of a professional employed by the Department,       resulted from a physical assault of a sexual nature, battery       of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment which occurred while       the veteran was serving on active duty, active duty for       training, or inactive duty training.        (b) Duration.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot       program under subsection (a) for a three-year period. If at       the completion of the pilot program an eligible veteran is       receiving hospital care and medical services from a non-      Department health care provider under the pilot program, the       Secretary may approve, on a case-by-case basis, the       continuation of such hospital care and medical services from       that non-Department health care provider until the completion       of the episode of care.        (c) Eligible Veterans.--A veteran is eligible to       participate in the pilot program under subsection (a) if the       veteran--        (1) is eligible to receive counseling and appropriate care       and services under section 1720D of title 38, United States       Code; and        (2) resides in a site selected under subsection (d).  [[Page H4249]]         (d) Sites.--        (1) Selection.--The Secretary shall select not more than       five sites in which to carry out the pilot program under       subsection (a).

(B) The site is in a State in which the National Violence       Against Women Prevention Research Center or the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention, or both, has determined the       rate of sexual assault to be a substantial problem.        (C) The site is in a State that, as of the first day of the       pilot program, has a weighted percentage of reported rape of       not less than 20 percent but not more than 30 percent of       sexual assault cases, in accordance with the finding of the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contained in the       `` `Lifetime Prevalence of Sexual Violence by any       Perpetrator'' (NISVS 2010).        (2) Rural site.--Not fewer than one site selected under       paragraph (1) shall be rural, as determined by the Secretary.        (e) Participation.--        (1) Election.--Subject to paragraph (2), an eligible       veteran may elect to participate in the pilot program under       subsection (a). Such election shall not affect the ability of       the veteran to receive health care furnished by Department       providers.        (2) Number.--Not more than 75 veterans may participate in       the pilot program under subsection (a) at each site selected       under subsection (d).

(f) Authorization and Monitoring of Care.--In accordance       with subsection (e), the Secretary shall ensure that the       Department of Veterans Affairs authorizes and monitors the       hospital care and medical services furnished under the pilot       program for appropriateness and necessity. In authorizing and       monitoring such care, the Secretary shall--        (1) treat a non-Department health care provider that       furnishes to such a veteran hospital care or medical services       under the pilot program as an authorized recipient of records       of such veteran for purposes of section 7332(b) of title 38,       United States Code; and        (2) ensure that such non-Department health care provider       transmits to the Department such records as the Secretary       determines appropriate.        (g) Payments.--        (1) Current providers.--If a non-Department health care       provider has entered into a contract, agreement, or other       arrangement with the Secretary pursuant to another provision       of law to furnish hospital care or medical services to       veterans, the Secretary shall pay the health care provider       for hospital care or medical services furnished under this       section using the same rates and payment schedules as       provided for in such contract, agreement, or other       arrangement.        (2) New providers.--If a non-Department health care       provider has not entered into a contract, agreement, or other       arrangement with the Secretary pursuant to another provision       of law to furnish hospital care or medical services to       veterans, the Secretary shall pay the health care provider       for hospital care or medical services furnished under this       section using the same rates and payment schedule as if such       care and services was furnished pursuant to section 1703 of       title 38, United States Code.        (3) New contracts and agreements.--The Secretary shall take       reasonable efforts to enter into a contract, agreement, or       other arrangement with a non-Department health care provider       described in subsection (a) to ensure that future care and       services authorized by the Secretary and furnished by the       provider are subject to such a contract, agreement, or other       arrangement        (h) Surveys.--The Secretary shall conduct a survey of a       sample of eligible veterans to assess the hospital care and       medical services furnished to such veterans either pursuant       to this section or section 1720D of title 38, United States       Code, as the case may be.        (i) Report.--Not later than 60 days before the completion       of the pilot program under subsection (a), the Secretary       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a report on the pilot       program. The report shall include the following:        (1) The results of the pilot program, including, to the       extent possible, an assessment of the health outcomes of       veterans who participated in the pilot program.        (2) The recommendation of the Secretary with respect to       extending or making permanent the pilot program.        (j) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``non-Department health care provider'' means       an entity specified in section 101(a)(1)(B) of section 101 of       the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2015       (Public Law 113-146; 38 U.S.C. 1701) or any other health care       provider that has entered into a contract, agreement, or       other arrangement with the Secretary pursuant to another       provision of law to furnish hospital care or medical services       to veterans.        (2) The term ``sexual harassment'' has the meaning given       that term in section 1720D of title 38, United States Code.        (3) The term ``State'' has the meaning given that term in       section 101(20) of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 3642, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3642, as amended, the  Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment Act.   It is a tragic fact that there are an increasing number of veterans  who report experiencing sexual harassment or assault while serving on  Active Duty in our Armed Forces. These veterans deserve the very best  care and treatment that we can offer them for the psychological trauma  that they may be feeling as a result of that experience.   This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry  out a pilot program to furnish care in the community to veterans who  have experienced military sexual trauma. This would ensure the veterans  in pilot locations are able to choose a provider that best meets their  specific needs and that they are most comfortable with.   This bill is sponsored by Representative  Andy Barr from Kentucky,  and I thank him for his tireless advocacy to ensure access to care for  veterans who have experienced this trauma.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Walz. Once  again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 3642, as amended, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3832) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into a  memorandum of understanding with the executive director of a national  network of State-based prescription monitoring programs under which  Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers shall query such  network, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3832         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Opioid Abuse       Prevention Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PARTICIPATION IN                     NATIONAL NETWORK OF STATE-BASED PRESCRIPTION                     DRUG MONITORING PROGRAMS.         (a) In General.--Chapter 17 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 1730A the       following new section:       ``Sec. 1730B. Access to State prescription drug monitoring         programs         ``(a) Access to Programs.--(1) Any licensed health care       provider or delegate of such a provider shall be considered       an authorized recipient or user for the purpose of querying       and receiving data from the national network of State-based       prescription drug monitoring programs to support the safe and       effective prescribing of controlled substances to covered       patients.        ``(2) Under the authority granted by paragraph (1)--        ``(A) licensed health care providers or delegates of such       providers shall query such network in accordance with       applicable regulations and policies of the Veterans Health       Administration; and        ``(B) notwithstanding any general or specific provision of       law, rule, or regulation of a State, no State may restrict       the access of licensed health care providers or delegates of       such providers from accessing that State's prescription drug       monitoring programs.        ``(3) No State shall deny or revoke the license,       registration, or certification of a licensed health care       provider or delegate who otherwise meets that State's       qualifications for holding the license, registration, or       certification on the basis that the licensed health care       provider or delegate has queried or received data, or attempt       to query or receive data, from the national network of State-      based prescription drug monitoring programs under this       section.        ``(b) Covered Patients.--For purposes of this section, a       covered patient is a patient who--        ``(1) receives a prescription for a controlled substance;       and        ``(2) is not receiving palliative care or enrolled in       hospice care.        ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) The term `controlled substance' has the meaning given       such term in section 102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act       (21 U.S.C. 802(6)).        ``(2) The term `delegate' means a person or automated       system accessing the national network of State-based       prescription monitoring programs at the direction or under       the supervision of a licensed health care provider.        ``(3) The term `licensed health care provider' means a       health care provider employed by the Department who is       licensed, certified, or registered within any State to fill       or prescribe medications within the scope of his or her       practice as a Department employee.        ``(4) The term `national network of State-based       prescription monitoring programs' means an interconnected       nation-wide system that facilitates the transfer to State       prescription drug monitoring program data across State lines.        ``(5) The term `State' means a State, as defined in section       101(20) of this title, or a political subdivision of a       State.''.  [[Page H4251]]         (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 17 of such title is amended by inserting       after the item relating to section 1730A the following new       item:  ``1730B. Access to State prescription drug monitoring programs.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 3832, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 3832, as  amended, the Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act. More than 140  individuals every day are dying from opioid abuse in the United States,  and opioids have resulted in the deaths of more Americans than the  Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars put together over the same period  of time.   Unfortunately, the news is even worse for our veterans. Former VA  Secretary McDonald stated: Veterans are 10 times more likely to abuse  opioids than the average American, and that is among the leading cause  of homelessness among veterans.   In 2016 alone, the VA treated 66,000 veterans for opioid addiction.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we are failing our Nation's heroes, and,  frankly, that is unacceptable.   That is why I introduced the Veterans Opioid Prevention Act, to  ensure that no veteran slips through the cracks. My bill increases  opioid prescribing transparency at the VA and allows Veterans  Administration doctors to do what most private sector doctors are  already doing. They access State databases listing all opioid  prescriptions from all providers. This allows physicians to easily  identify patterns of opioid use that puts patients at risk for  addiction. Once physicians are able to accurately identify patterns of  use and abuse, we can curb this epidemic and ensure our veterans are  getting the best possible care.   Mr. Speaker, as a veteran and a doctor, I take my responsibility to  serve those who fought for our freedoms very seriously. We can do more  for our veterans, and we must do more to support them and to protect  them.   I believe my Veterans Opioid Prevention Act does exactly that. I urge  all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support  H.R. 3832, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3946) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based  outpatient clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, the Ray Hendrix Veterans  Clinic''.  [[Page H4252]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3946         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The Department of Veterans Affairs community-based       outpatient clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, shall after the       date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as       the ``Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic''. Any reference to such       clinic in any law, regulation, map, document, record, or       other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a       reference to the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3946, to name the  Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in  Statesboro, Georgia, the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic.   This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague, Congressman Rick  Allen, and I am grateful to him for introducing this legislation in  honor of an American hero.   Robert Ray Hendrix joined the Army National Guard in 1949. He was  stationed in Europe during the Korean conflict and served honorably  until his retirement in 1992. In his 42 years of service, Mr. Hendrix  rose to the rank of command sergeant major.   Mr. Hendrix also served in the American Legion for over 60 years,  holding many State and national posts. Along with many accomplishments  for veterans, Mr. Hendrix was instrumental in obtaining 5,000  signatures throughout the community to demonstrate the need for a VA  clinic in Statesboro. Four years later, Mr. Hendrix's effort paid off  when a VA officially dedicated a new clinic.   In addition to his work with the American Legion, Mr. Hendrix served  in a Governor-appointed position to the State Veterans Board through  the VA Service Board for three 7-year terms. Mr. Hendrix's outstanding  service to his country and his fellow veterans shall serve as an  inspiration to us all, and it is my great pleasure to support H.R.  3946, which would name that very clinic he worked so hard to establish,  the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic.   This legislation satisfies all the committee's naming criteria and is  cosponsored by the entire Georgia congressional delegation and  supported by many VSOs. Once again, I thank Congressman Rick Allen for  introducing this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen), the sponsor of this bill.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 3946.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Sergeant Major Walz for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4245) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to  Congress certain documents relating to the Electronic Health Record  Modernization Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4245         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 4245.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4245, the Veterans'  Electronic Health Record Modernization Oversight Act of 2017.   This is not just a transition to a commercial EHR. If successful, it  will be a transformation of how the VA delivers and manages healthcare  to 9 million veterans. But the path to achieving a seamless,  interoperable health record is far from clear.   Much has already been said about the program's price tag: nearly $16  billion over 10 years. It is a gigantic management exercise, involving  thousands of people. It is also an immense challenge to document  clinical processes, maybe for the first time, that doctors and nurses  have been performing for years, and reengineer them.   H.R. 4245 would ensure that the committee gets access to this  program's key performance reports and contractual documents. It would  also require the VA to notify us when significant negative events  occur.   The time to enact legislation is now. The VA awarded its primary  contract to the Cerner Corporation at the end of last week.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Walz for spearheading this  effort. I also appreciate Jack Bergman and Ann Kuster, the chairman and  ranking member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, for  their work on H.R. 4245, and the oversight spade work that they do  every day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4245, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support  H.R. 4245, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4830) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the  disapproval of any course of education for purposes of the educational  assistance programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs unless the  educational institution providing the course permits individuals to  attend or participate in courses pending payment by Department, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4830         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Servicemembers Improved       Transition through Reforms for Ensuring Progress Act'' or the       ``SIT-REP Act''.       SEC. 2. DISAPPROVAL FOR PURPOSES OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE                     PROGRAMS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OF                     CERTAIN COURSES OF EDUCATION THAT DO NOT PERMIT                     INDIVIDUALS TO ATTEND OR PARTICIPATE IN COURSES                     PENDING PAYMENT.         Section 3679 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(e)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this       chapter, beginning on August 1, 2018, a State approving       agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of the State       approving agency, shall disapprove a course of education       provided by an educational institution unless the educational       institution has adopted the following policies:        ``(A) A policy that permits any covered individual to       attend or participate in the course of education during the       period beginning on the date on which the individual provides       to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility       for entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or       33 of this title and ending on the earlier of the following       dates:        ``(i) The date on which the Secretary provides payment for       such course of education to such institution.        ``(ii) The date that is 90 days after the date on which the       individual provides to the educational institution such       certificate of eligibility.        ``(B) A policy that ensures that the educational       institution will not impose any penalty, including the       assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes,       libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the       requirement that a covered individual borrow additional       funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's       inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the       institution as a result of the delayed disbursement of any       payment to be provided by the Secretary.        ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, a covered individual       is any individual who is entitled to educational assistance       under chapter 31 or 33 of this title.        ``(3) The Secretary may waive such requirements of       paragraph (1) as the Secretary considers appropriate.''.

CLARIFICATION REGARDING APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY TO                     USE EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO PURSUE                     INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS AT CERTAIN                     EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT                     INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING.         The section heading for section 302 of the Harry W. Colmery       Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-      48) is amended to read as follows (and the table of contents       for such Act is conformed accordingly):       ``SEC. 302. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE                     UNDER ANY OF THE EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE                     PROGRAMS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     TO PURSUE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS AT CERTAIN                     EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT                     INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 4830, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4830, as amended, the  SIT-REP Act, the Servicemembers Improved Transition through Reforms for  Ensuring Progress Act.   Mr. Speaker, the Post-9/11 GI Bill provides generous education  benefits, including a monthly living stipend to veterans and eligible  dependents. In order for a student to utilize this benefit, they must  provide a certificate of eligibility to the school or training program  and then the institution certifies the student's attendance to the  Department of Veterans Affairs. After this process, the school receives  tuition payment and the veteran receives their monthly housing  allowance.   Mr. Speaker, if all goes well, those claims are supposed to be  processed within 12 to 14 days for original claims, and between 6 to 8  days for supplemental claims. However, there are times when delays do  occur, and they can have a significant impact on a school's and a  student's bottom line. These delays typically occur at the beginning of  a semester, or when a school doesn't do their part to certify a  student's attendance quickly.   Mr. Speaker, we have been told that some schools and training  programs have, essentially, taken these delays out on their student  veterans, dependents and surviving spouses by placing students on  payment plans, blocking access to school facilities; and, in some  cases, have been barring students from registering for classes.   Mr. Speaker, I believe these practices are incredibly unfair, as  students should not be held accountable for bureaucratic delays and  hiccups that are outside their control. I am pleased that H.R. 4830, as  amended, would address this issue and say that in order for schools and  training programs to be eligible for the GI Bill, they must adopt a  policy that doesn't punish students in any way for delays in tuition  fees and payments that are not their fault.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Vice Chairman Bilirakis and the Tragedy  Assistance Program for Survivors, TAPS, a great organization that helps  survivors of all ages deal with loss, for bringing this important bill  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4830, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the vice chairman of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support  H.R. 4830, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
