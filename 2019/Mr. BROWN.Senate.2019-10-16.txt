 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes.    Mr. President, I just came from a rally--a meeting--with  more or less 100 middle-class workers from Wisconsin, West Virginia, my  State of Ohio, and all over the country. There were teamsters and  mineworkers dressed in camo shirts. There were also bakery and  confectionery workers, carpenters, and electricians. They were here  because many of them--maybe all of them--are about to lose 50 percent  of their pensions. They are about to lose their pensions because 10  years ago, in the end days of the Bush administration, which was when  our economy plummeted and people were losing jobs--800,000 jobs a month  in the last months of the Bush administration--and when companies were  going out of business, a lot of the employers of these workers went out  of business. When you put on top of that the Wall Street greed, you can  see why these pensions are in jeopardy.   Too often in this town, the White House, frankly, and my Senate  colleagues don't understand what collective bargaining is about.  Collective bargaining is negotiating at the bargaining table the giving  up of wages today so as to put money aside and have pensions and  healthcare in the future. That is what these workers did, these  teamsters and these confection workers and these ironworkers. That is  what they did, but they are paying a price. There is nothing they did  to cause this, but they are paying a price.   Now, parenthetically, this body fell all over itself to bail out Wall  Street and to help the big auto companies, and look how they are paying  back their workers. This body, the President--all of them are fine with  bailing out the big guys. Yet the President has been absent, and the  Senate Republican leadership has been absent. The exception is that  Senator Portman has been working with me, as has Senator Hoeven and  others, but the leadership has been absent with regard to trying to fix  this pension issue.   You love your country, and you fight for the people who make it work.  You fight for the dignity of work, which means honoring and respecting  work. We have to do better.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2254    Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration  of S. 2254, the Butch Lewis Act; that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley, and we will be  working together on this.   I just want to point out that there was, of course, some  mismanagement. As does the Senator, I want to fix some of the  structural issues, but time is of the essence. I understand this is not  happening today, but time is of the essence with regard to these  pensions, especially for the mineworkers. Those for the teamsters are  next and for the others in the Central States. As Chairman Grassley  knows, it will get worse and worse and worse if we don't get this done  this year.   I do want to emphasize, while there of course is some mismanagement  of funds here, the preponderance of the problem is that a bunch of  mining companies, construction companies, and transportation companies  went out of business with the Bush recession in 2007, 2008, and 2009,  taking away the companies paying into these funds.   The other part of it was Wall Street greed, generally what happened  to the stock market.   That is the preponderance of the problem, but I concur with Senator  Grassley that we can work on a lot of this together. Senator Portman  and I especially have a responsibility to get this done, to make it  happen.   I thank the chairman.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
