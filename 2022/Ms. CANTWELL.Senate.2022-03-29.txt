 Madam President, I thank the leader for mentioning the  move to have a vote on Alvaro Bedoya to be Commissioner of the Federal  Trade Commission. This is such an important task, and I know that the  leader probably knows that Mr. Bedoya hails from New York, but it also  must be a very proud moment for him as well.   The FTC is the security guard for America's consumers. If a company  is lying to its customers about their products and what they can do or  teaming up with competitors to keep prices high, the FTC is the  policeman on the beat, saying those things are not allowed here.    Yes.    Madam President, I thank the majority leader for that  concise documentation of what really the FTC is about. It is about  getting somebody on there who is going to fight to protect consumers on  issues.   We know that we need the FTC now more than ever. We needed their  muscle during the COVID pandemic, as opportunistic scammers stole $5.9  billion out of the pockets of Americans, and that is just the reported  amount. That doesn't include people who never knew that they were  scammed or were too embarrassed to report what happened.   So Congress, on a bipartisan basis, pumped up the FTC's power, and at  the end of 2020, we passed the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act to help  root out promoters of dangerous, fake treatments and cures.   Second, we gave the FTC $30 million in the American Rescue Plan to  promote and protect Americans against scams that targeted their COVID  stimulus payments.   Last year, we confirmed the FTC Chair, Lina Khan, with support from  21 Republicans in this body, and today we are talking about the next  important step in protecting consumers, and that is moving to confirm  Mr. Bedoya to fill the last seat on the Federal Trade Commission.   Mr. Bedoya has the right experience we need to tackle the problems  that we are facing right now--some of the most complicated and pressing  issues regarding how to protect our privacy and protect children's  online privacy. I say that because I heard comments from my colleague  about Mr. Bedoya and the fact that he issued various tweets about this  or that in his time in the private sector.   I guarantee you that if we voted for people based on what their  tweets are, there would be a lot of people who wouldn't be approved at  all, including some of the people who have been through this process.   Mr. Bedoya served as the chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary  Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and Law. So I would say that as it  relates to the FTC's ability to do something about reining in some of  the bad practices that we see online, I think he is a very qualified  person and individual.   Mr. Bedoya graduated summa cum laude from Harvard and holds a law  degree from Yale, where he served on the Yale Law Journal and received  the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans.   So I think that Mr. Bedoya is a person who has dug in on a variety of  issues and has the experience and leadership in one of the most  critical areas--technology--that the FTC is dealing with today.   So I encourage my colleagues to support him. That is why he is  supported by the current Republican FTC Commissioners. They also  support his nomination. They say they recognize his willingness and  expertise and ability to reach across the aisle and find common ground  on solutions that work for people.   It is that skill set that we are looking for at the FTC to help hard- working Americans get a fair shake in the marketplace, whether that is  at the pharmacy, the gas pump, or online.   And I know that as a proud immigrant, Mr. Bedoya will also use his  role to expand the FTC's work in underserved communities.   The FTC needs to be able to protect all Americans, and to accomplish  that, we need to have a Commission that is not deadlocked now but has  somebody like Mr. Bedoya, who can help us move ahead on these issues.   He has experience working, as I said, in the Judiciary Committee. In  2009, he cofounded the Esperanza Education Fund, an immigration status- blind college scholarship for immigrant students, and has been working  on various issues within the community.   Right now, we need an FTC that is going to look at market systems and  make sure there is fair competition to make sure that consumers are  protected and that there is a level playing field.   I think his experience here on the Hill lets him understand exactly  what that is. He has testified before Congress and State legislatures  and appeared in numbers of publications about these critical issues on  privacy and on the online world in which we need to have more  oversight.   So, finally, Mr. Bedoya's experience on, as I said, data privacy  specifically, the internet and making it a safe place for children--he  exposed racial bias in facial recognition software, helped to protect  innocent people from prosecution and companies that have already  collected data on millions of Americans. We need that kind of expertise  that Mr. Bedoya knows and understands how we are using that today and  what we can do to better protect the American consumer.   I hope that my colleagues will join us to approve and move quickly to  discharge the committee of Alvaro Bedoya's nomination to be a  Commissioner of the FTC and support his nomination as we get this to  the Senate floor.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
