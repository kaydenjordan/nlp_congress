 School supplies, gas for the car, swimming  lessons, payment for rent, these are just a few of the ways my  constituents in southeast Louisiana are spending their child tax credit  payments. Especially as my community recovers from Hurricane Ida and  has unexpected costs, the dependability of monthly child tax credits-- an average of $410 for my constituents--has meant a lot.   While this program expires at the end of December, the problems  facing American children and families will not. The Build Back Better  Act includes provisions to continue this program.   Studies show that extending the child tax credit permanently is sound  economic policy and that it can be done better to have better  healthcare, better health outcomes, and more economic opportunities for  families.   We need to put our money where our mouth is and invest in our  children, invest in our families, and pass the Build Back Better Act.                       Remembering Musician Bennie Pete     Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 has taken over 725,000  lives. One person gone too soon that I want to highlight is Bennie  Pete, a New Orleans jazz musician. He passed away at the age of 45 from  complications of COVID-19, shortly after deciding to get his first  vaccine shot.   Bennie played the tuba and cofounded the celebrated Hot 8 Brass Band.  Born in the Upper Ninth Ward, he helped found the band by the age of  18. They played on street corners, parades, and funerals, and then at  bars and bigger venues, and as second lines.   When Hurricane Katrina hit, Hot 8 brought music to the city in a way  that only New Orleans can in the challenging days after the storm,  playing at evacuation shelters and medical centers. The band became  local heroes, a sense of hope, a sense of energy in the days  immediately following great despair.   The Hot 8 grew in popularity, touring in Europe and playing at  Tipitina's and the Jazz and Heritage Festival.   New Orleans will never be the same. We have lost a little bit of our  soul with the passing of Bennie Pete. May he rest in peace.                Improving Louisiana's Environment and Industry     Mr. Speaker, Louisiana's Second  Congressional District includes an industrial corridor of nearly 150  oil refineries, plastic plants, and chemical facilities. Many sites  provide high-paying jobs that lift families out of poverty or build a  better life. But it is, foremost, a place that my constituents call  home.   As their Congressman, it is my job to make sure that it is a safe and  prosperous place to live. Sadly, there have been longstanding concerns  over elevated and disproportionate rates of cancer and respiratory  conditions in this region. It shouldn't be this way. Industry and  community can coexist, with proper monitoring and regulation.   That is why I am calling on EPA Administrator Regan for Federal  assistance to study, monitor, and improve the impacts of emissions and  polluting substances in the river parishes. No one should have to die  for their job.   I stand ready to bring both environmental stewardship and a robust  economy to Louisiana. We can do this. We must do this.                            ____________________
