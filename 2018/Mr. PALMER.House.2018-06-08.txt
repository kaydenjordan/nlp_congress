 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Israel's 70th  anniversary of independence. The United States has no stronger ally in  the Middle East than the State of Israel.   Our relationship is one rooted in shared values and a commitment to  freedom and democracy. Israel's dedication to political and economic  freedom, free and fair elections, and freedom of religion provides a  stark contrast with other regimes in the region.   On this anniversary, I also want to recognize the important  relationship between Israel and the State of Alabama.   Few people know that 5 years prior to Israel gaining independence,  Alabama became the first and perhaps only State to call for the  establishment of a Jewish state.   Seventy-five years ago, on June 10, 1943, in the midst of World War  II, the Alabama legislature unanimously passed a joint resolution  calling for a Jewish state, and for the Jewish people to have the right  to self-government and self-determination.   Since that day, in acknowledgment and support of our mutual values,  Alabama and Israel have maintained a special friendship. Indeed,  Alabama and the United States are proud to call Israel our ally, and  look forward to our continued support of Israel and our continued  friendship.                            ____________________
