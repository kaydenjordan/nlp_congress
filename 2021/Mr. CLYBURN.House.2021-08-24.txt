 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I want to take this time to thank my colleagues in  this august body for the civility that we have demonstrated here as we  approach this final vote.   I want to thank the Democrats, every single one of whom cosponsored  this legislation. I am hopeful that this can be a bipartisan result. I  think all of us know that our country has a history of voter  suppression and voter denial. I think all of us are quite aware of  recent efforts being made in many States. Forty-nine have passed laws  that are called restrictive by objective analyses that have been made.  These laws are not needed. These laws are very creative instruments  that will be used if not checked to suppress the vote.  [[Page H4413]]    We all heard a recent candidate having lost an election call upon  election officials to: Just find me the number of votes that I need to  win this election. If that is not voter suppression, I would like to  know how we would define it.   So I want to thank all of us for what we have done here today, and I  hope that this result can be a bipartisan one.
