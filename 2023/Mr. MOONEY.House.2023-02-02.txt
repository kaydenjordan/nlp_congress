 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Representative  Salazar's House resolution denouncing the horrors of socialism.   I grew up in a home where the American ideals of personal freedom and  limited government were cherished. My mother, Lala Suarez, grew up on a  sugarcane farm in Cuba, where she was one of 14 brothers and sisters.    When Castro took control of Cuba by force, her entire world was  destroyed. My mother was imprisoned by Fidel Castro for 7 weeks.  Thankfully, they never found the gun she had hidden or they would have  executed her and her friends. She fled communism to enjoy freedom and  opportunity in America.   Today, over 60 years later, socialist policies have kept Cuba in  economic ruin.   She met my father, Vincent Mooney, and became a proud American  citizen. My father was a captain in the United States Army who served  in Vietnam to stop the advance of communism.   Growing up, my parents impressed upon me and my three siblings that  America is special. Unlike economically failing socialist countries,  Americans' personal liberty is enshrined in our Constitution and must  always be protected.   All citizens deserve basic freedoms, such as freedom of press;  freedom of speech; the right to vote; the right to be considered  innocent until proven guilty, where in communist countries you are  guilty until you prove yourself innocent; and the right to worship.   As President Donald Trump said right here in this Chamber in his  State of the Union speech: ``America will never be a socialist  country.''   America must never give up on our God-given rights. We must fight  against socialism and for the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, when the government takes away your rights and freedoms,  as the socialist and communist countries want to do, they never give  them back.   Every American should feel blessed to have been born in this country  where we are free. Let's protect our freedoms.    Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the House resoundingly  passed my bipartisan bill, the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural  Job Creators Act.   Rural small businesses face unique challenges that big city  businesses do not. Nearly 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in  rural areas, yet businesses in rural areas raised under 2 percent of  total capital over the last 3 years.   My home State of West Virginia is a very rural State where no city  has a population greater than 50,000 people. My legislation simply  requires the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's  Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation to identify and report to  Congress those challenges rural small businesses face when trying to  access our capital markets.   My bill will make it easier for Congress to do our jobs to make sure  rural small businesses, like those in West Virginia, are not left  behind.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the Senate takes this bill up very soon.                            ____________________
