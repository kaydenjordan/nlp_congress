 Mr. President, today I recognize Darren Hedlund, a  legislative assistant in my Washington, DC, office for all of the hard  work he has done for me, his colleagues, and the State of South Dakota.   Darren is a native of Wall, SD. He graduated magna cum laude from the  University of South Dakota before receiving his master of public and  international affairs from the University of Pittsburgh. While working  on his undergraduate degree, Darren also served as president of his  fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha.   Darren was one of the first people I hired after being sworn in as  Senator in January of 2015. He began his career at the front desk in my  office, answering phones. Through hard work and dedication, Darren  worked his way up to legislative assistant, handling cybersecurity,  Veterans Affairs, foreign affairs, telecommunication, and homeland  security issues for my office. Darren has played an instrumental role  in my office by providing insight and guidance into these issues.   Darren has been a dedicated and faithful public servant during his  time spent here in the Senate. I extend my sincere thanks and  appreciation to Darren for the fine work he has done. I wish him and  his wife Reagan well as they take on life's new challenges together. As  he continues his career of public service, he bears the esteem of a  grateful State and my utmost gratitude for a job well done.                            ____________________
