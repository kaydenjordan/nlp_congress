 Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, I am sorry that I did not catch all of  the Senator's remarks, but I think he said that this is a vote on a  bill that was introduced in the House.   How many cosponsors are on this bill? Is this a legitimate effort  here?    So this is a legitimate bill that is up. Well, it is not  up for consideration now in the House.   Is this the Conyers' bill?    Is there at least a preamble to this bill or just an  opening of a couple of paragraphs or something? Would the Senator  describe it?    And that is in the bill?    Well, I think we have a very honest choice. There has  been a lot of talk about single payer. There was a lot of talk about it  early on in the debate about ObamaCare. I recall in observations made  by President Obama that this was the first step toward single payer. I  understand that--well, I know that the former Secretary of Health and  Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, had the same plan, that ObamaCare  was the first step toward single payer. All you are doing is just  saying, OK, if that is the goal, bring it to a vote.
