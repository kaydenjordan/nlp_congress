 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment that I am offering prohibits any  of the funding in the MILCON-VA appropriations bill from being used to  carry out what I believe are unnecessary and unscientific COVID-19  vaccine mandates at the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Now, there has been some confusion about this. Some people have said,  oh, well, that is not really still going on. Well, I just got an email  from the VA today saying, yes, it is.   There still are vaccine mandates that are being carried out at the VA  and, to the best of my knowledge, it is the last remaining Federal  vaccine mandate, and it needs to end.   Most Federal vaccine mandates ended in May of 2023, with the end of  the public health emergency. The VA, though, was one of the few  agencies to leave the mandate in place.   VHA Directive 1193.01, COVID-19 Vaccination Program for VHA  Healthcare Personnel, outlines the policy and guidance for mandatory  COVID-19 vaccination for Veterans Health Administration healthcare  personnel is still in effect.   The mandate applies to EMS personnel, nurses, nursing assistants,  physicians, technicians, therapists, phlebotomists, pharmacists, health  professions trainees, clerical, dietary, environmental services,  laundry, security, maintenance, engineering and facilities management,  administrative, billing, and even volunteers.   If you want to volunteer at the VA, you better get a jab.   The COVID vax mandate is unnecessary. It hurts healthcare workers. I  believe it hurts healthcare being provided to our veterans.   As of July 15, 2022, the VA had disciplined some 74 workers that we  know of, some of whom were fired.   I do not believe the mandate is necessary to keep our veterans or the  VA staff safe. The former CDC director has said that the vaccines can't  do anything to prevent transmission.   This amendment is about ending COVID madness once and for all at the  VA and making sure that anyone who wants to provide medical care to our  great veterans can do so.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would only respond to the gentlewoman from  Florida when she said it only applies to healthcare personnel. I just  rattled off an entire list of virtually every known possible human  being and job that could apply at the VA, and a whole lot of them  aren't, in fact, healthcare personnel.   I went through an entire list, including laundry, security,  maintenance, engineering and facilities management, administrative,  billing, even volunteers.   Instead, some of my colleagues have said, this doesn't apply to the  VA. Like I said, we reached out to the VA and, sure enough, they  replied today, yes, the vaccine mandate still applies.  [[Page H4004]]    Nevertheless, we get rid of the Medicaid. We get rid of the Medicare  mandates. The private sector is out there. They can do what they want  to do. The vaccine mandate has come and gone in terms of something that  the American people believe we should tolerate.   They want to be able to move about without having the fear of losing  their job, and we have people at the VA losing their job.   We have nurses that have given up their ability to practice. We have  got it throughout our entire--we have members of our military that have  been held up from being promoted and being able to advance. We have  people at the VA. I have met with people who worked at the VA, some of  whom who were facing losing their job. This should end. This madness  should end.   That is what this amendment would do. It would ensure that no funding  goes to continuing and perpetuating that mandate.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment that prohibits any of the  MILCON-VA funding appropriated from being used to modify or remove any  VA display of the original mission statement.   Now, just a quick second before I go there. I didn't reserve my time  because I thought we were trying to move things along. I am going to  say, as a cancer survivor, as someone who did have chemo, and as  someone who was on Neulasta to deal with a weakened immune system, I  was in a hospital, and I wasn't being forced to wear masks and wasn't  being forced to take any shots. If I wanted to take the flu shot, I  could.   We have a CDC Director who said that this vaccine doesn't do anything  to help the spread from other people to you. That is the whole point.   We should get rid of the vaccine mandates, but on another note of  craziness from this administration, on March 16, 2023, earlier this  year, the VA announced it updated the 1959 mission statement from: ``To  fulfill President Lincoln's promise: `To care for him who shall have  borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan' by serving and  honoring the men and women who are America's veterans.''   Now, it is a gender-neutral version: ``To fulfill President Lincoln's  promise to care for those who have served in our Nation's military and  for their families, caregivers, and survivors.''   That is, it upends the quote that is directly from President Lincoln.   The original mission statement is posted in roughly 50 percent of the  VA's facilities. The VA has been working through replacing them over  the last couple of months by a directive. It is unclear how many  displays are left.   The Trump administration resisted calls to change the motto and put  an additional 140 plaques at national cemeteries bearing Lincoln's  quote because it is a good quote. It is a historic quote.   The fact is, we should not use taxpayer dollars to allow this  administration to unilaterally change the VA's historic motto and erase  the words of President Lincoln in order to appease the radical left in  advancing yet another one of their cultural revisionist efforts.   The VA's mission statement, established in 1959, appropriately used  the words of President Lincoln in his Second Inaugural Address  delivered on March 4, 1865: ``With malice toward none; with charity for  all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let  us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the Nation's  wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his  widow, and his orphan.''   That quote obviously came from the timeframe in which we were  concluding the Civil War, and it came a mere month, from my  recollection of history, from when Abraham Lincoln was, in fact,  assassinated.   The speech was in part the basis of the Department of Veterans  Affairs' creation and declared mission.   The Department wants to continue to waste hard-earned taxpayer  dollars to erase history and expunge Lincoln's words by replacing the  VA's mission statement, all in an attempt to earn woke brownie points.   I am thankful, of course, for the millions of men and women who have  served valiantly in our Armed Forces, but changing the VA motto is just  virtue signaling. We should be focused on providing the quality care  and benefits veterans have earned in a timely manner.   The average wait time for new primary care appointments within the 13  South Texas Veterans Health System facilities was 50 days; veterans  seeking their first appointment locally at the new Pecan Valley clinic,  an average of 98 days; the VA clinic in the district I represent,  Kerrville, 23 days, and that is the shortest.   This amendment, like my other amendments, is about restoring VA  focus, not advancing a political agenda out of step with the majority  of Americans.  [[Page H4005]]    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will reiterate the extent to which this motto  came directly from a quote from President Lincoln at his Second  Inaugural Address at a particularly important and historic moment in  our Nation's history. That was the point.    The literal culmination of the Civil War had occurred almost around  that exact date or was occurring shortly thereafter and shortly before  the President was to be assassinated, I believe in April, a month after  this speech. To go back and edit this and then go around changing the  VA to pull out a quote directly from Lincoln just, again, shows a lack  of focus on what the VA should be focused on.   That is the point of the amendment. Can we just get back to trying to  figure out how to provide care and do what we said we are going to do  for millions of veterans who are tired of waiting and having  technological systems that aren't working properly so they have trouble  getting in and out of care and being able to use care in the private  sector? There are lots of things we need to be fixing at the VA, and  this is certainly not one of them.   Madam Chair, I think that I have made the point. I think the  amendment should be supported. I think we should get the VA focused on  what the people of this country want us to focus on, supporting the  care for veterans.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment prohibits any of the funding in  the MILCON-VA appropriations bill from being used to carry out  President Biden's executive orders on climate change.   I was gratified to have offered a similar amendment and to see it  adopted on the floor of the House with respect to the National Defense  Authorization Act, the NDAA. We believe that the United States military  should have a singular focus, and that is also true for the Veterans  Administration. It should have a singular focus--ensuring our veterans  have the care they need, not advancing the climate fetish that is  making us beholden to China for our energy needs, undermining our  national security, and undermining the very reason veterans put their  lives on the line to defend this country.   In August 2021, the VA put forward a ``climate action plan,'' which  includes indoctrinating VA employees with so-called climate literacy,  pushing renewable energy consumption, sustainable buildings, and  greenhouse gas emissions at VA facilities.   Now, VA is transitioning its fleet of over 22,000 vehicles to zero- emission vehicles. Mind you, our American public, who want to go about  carrying out their jobs and their livelihoods, can't even afford  vehicles anymore because we are clamping down on the ability of them to  go purchase vehicles because we are limiting the production of the  internal combustion engine so we can have battery-powered automobiles  that are being produced with lithium and cobalt and things being mined  in Africa while children are being exploited and the Chinese Communist  Party is being empowered, all while China, by the way, has 1,100 coal- fired plants compared to our 250. They are building two a week while we  are basically doing nothing to advance anything with respect to  reliable energy.  [[Page H4006]]    Instead, we are putting all of our eggs in the unreliable energy  basket, which makes us beholden to China, the Chinese Communist Party,  and our enemies around the globe rather than exporting liquefied  natural gas and making us stronger.   Again, the Veterans Administration ought to reflect the American  people and our strength by focusing on its core mission--providing  healthcare and benefits that are necessary for those who have served to  defend our country.                                time  1700    My Democratic colleagues apparently think you can power a VA hospital  on wind and solar alone. Of course, you cannot. It is not possible.   Anybody who looks at it looks at the data and sees on a windless,  cloudy day, how are you powering a VA hospital? You are powering it  with fossil fuels. You are powering it with what little nuclear power  we have, given that we have been unable to build a nuclear plant, by  far the most reliable non-CO2-producing energy in the world.  We haven't been able to do it since the 1970s because of the regulatory  infrastructure in this country. It is absurd.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle go around ballyhooing  about carbon dioxide, and the one reliable energy that you can do has  been prevented by regulatory morass through the better part of my  lifetime of 50 years.   Instead, they go around producing wind and solar, which as more  information comes out about how horrific it has been for the planet,  how horrific it is for children throughout this world mining those  minerals, how empowering it is for our enemies, and here we are trying  to turn the VA into essentially a promotion of the climate agenda for  the radical left.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just reiterate the extent to which we are  turning over our national security to our enemies. Eighty percent of  the solar panels installed in the United States come from Chinese  firms. Seven of the top 10 wind technology turbine manufacturers are  Chinese firms. China controls 77 percent of EV battery manufacturing.   The fact is, our national security is dependent upon our ability to  produce and export liquefied natural gas and being able to use the God- given minerals that we have in this country, oil and gas, to be able to  power the world.   There are almost a billion people on this planet who really have no  access to electricity, some 3 billion who don't have access to reliable  electricity and energy, and all we are doing is constraining the  ability of the world to produce the energy necessary for human  flourishing.   We are all committed to trying to help improve the environment.  Governor DeSantis in Florida has made enormous strides in improving the  Everglades in Florida and received notoriety for doing so.   In Texas, we have the most wind production of any State in the  country, but you have to beg the question as to whether that is a good  thing or a bad thing if you don't have enough fossil fuels to back up  the wind and the solar.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to live in unicorn  land and pretend that you don't need energy to power up the buildings  in which we live in order to make us able to exist on this planet and  actually have human flourishing in the face of weather and the  conditions that we have to live through.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I unfortunately missed one rollcall vote today.  Had I been present, I would have voted NO on rollcall No. 369.
