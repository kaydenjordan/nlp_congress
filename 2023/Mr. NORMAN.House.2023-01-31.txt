 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and I appreciate him  for putting this together.   Mr. Speaker, as citizens of the United States of America, we are  privileged to have a constitutional right of free speech. This right  entitles us to the ability to speak, but not the right to be heard.   Favoring liberal voices over conservative ones, while pretending to  be neutral, is both hypocritical and profoundly unfair. However, no law  compels private companies to be fair and evenhanded arbiters of  information.   Censorship of conservatives online and by Big Tech has become a  commonly used mechanism by the left to silence conservatives. Silencing  people because you simply disagree with them dangerously infringes on  the rights of free speech as protected in the First Amendment of our  Constitution.   When I learned that DIRECTV dropped Newsmax from its channels, I was  outraged. Newsmax is the fourth highest-rated cable news channel and is  watched by 25 million Americans.   Everyone should be allowed to choose what news outlets they want to  hear from, especially with the dominance of the democratic media. I  frequently reach a wide audience of my constituency to communicate the  ongoings of Congress and can personally speak to how large the audience  is based on the feedback I receive from my constituents in South  Carolina's Fifth District and from other States.   I am glad that House Republicans will hold hearings on this matter to  get to the bottom of the blatant censorship of conservative views so  that we will know, once and for all, if DIRECTV has been selectively  targeting Newsmax.   DIRECTV should be held accountable for its actions, and I fully stand  behind conservatives having their voices heard.
