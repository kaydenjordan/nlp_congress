 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Energy and  Commerce be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R.  6160) to extend the chemical facility anti-terrorism standards program  of the Department of Homeland Security, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
