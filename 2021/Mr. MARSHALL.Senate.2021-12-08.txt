 Mr. President, much is grown on Kansas' plains. Crops  and pastures stretch as far as the eye can see. Grain elevators replace  city skyscrapers, and the whisper of the wind substitutes the screech  of sirens and traffic.   What truly makes the prairie special, however, is the people, the  people of the plains. Kindness and resilience define Kansans. Churches  that seem entirely too big for the tiny towns they tower over are  filled on Sundays; and neighbors are checking on each other, sharing  food, sharing laughs, maybe sharing a cup of coffee and even a few  beers.   And perhaps this is why Senator Bob Dole reminded me every time I saw  him: Roger, always remember where you are from.   In every speech I ever heard him give, he always said: Always  remember where you are from.   I thought a lot about that this week. What was Senator Dole saying?  Why was that so important?   And I think, reflecting, he always wanted to make sure that he  remembered his Kansas values and that the people of Russell, KS, shaped  his life, to pay honor to them and respect.   This week, Kansans lost a great friend and neighbor. Senator Bob  Dole, a personification of the gentle toughness cultivated in the rural  Midwest; an advocate for the disabled, the hungry, our veterans and our  American way of life; a genuine once-in-a-generation, from the  ``greatest generation,'' American hero has been called home.   It was to these same plains that a young Robert Dole returned from  war, critically wounded from injuries sustained in 1945 on a  battlefield in Italy. The people of Russell had chipped in money-- $1,800 to be exact--into a cigar box on the counter of Dawson's Drug  Store, where a young Bob Dole once worked as a soda jerk. These funds  were used to help offset the costs of his recovery, and it was a  grueling recovery. During his 3-year hospital stay, he spent time in a  body cast. He fought horrible infections that shot his temperature to  over 109 degrees, which forced the doctors to pack him in ice. He  literally underwent dozens of surgeries on his shoulder, his arm, and  even to remove a kidney. Bob Dole was once a strapping, muscular three- sport varsity athlete at Russell High School, as well as a KU Jayhawk  athlete.     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S9006, December 8, 2021, the following appears: UK  Jayhawk athlete      The online Record has been corrected to read: KU Jayhawk athlete    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Dole was now paralyzed and his weight had dropped to 122 pounds.   All the while, during his recovery there in the hospitals, he  listened to one of his new favorite songs, a source of inspiration,  ``You'll Never Walk Alone.'' I quote from that Rodgers and Hammerstein  classic:         Walk on with hope in your heart and you'll never walk       alone.        Walk on with hope in your heart and you'll never walk       alone.    Americans know of Bob Dole's record of public service, whether it was  passing the Reagan agenda through the Senate, saving Social Security  from bankruptcy, fighting hunger in the United States and abroad, the  Americans with Disabilities Act, his work for veterans that includes  the construction of the World War II Memorial, and so, so much more.   Americans know of his time at the helm at the Republican National  Committee, the U.S. Senate, and the party's Presidential ticket. They  may even be aware of when, in 2014, he regained the strength to travel  and visited all 105 Kansas counties to simply say ``thank you''--thank  you--for the life they had given him.   People may also know that most Saturdays of the past decade, Senator  Dole quietly sat on the south side of the World War II Memorial to  greet and thank veterans as the Honor Flights came to Washington, DC.  It was only fitting that Kansans gathered there this morning to pay  homage and respect and remember our hero. All of this, he did with  humility, with charm and wit--that famous wit that made him so likable,  so effective, and so Kansan.   As we in the Capitol honor Senator Dole, I remember the days that  followed his famous salute of President George H.W. Bush's casket in  the Capitol Rotunda--a moment that inspired and captivated the world-- when he, with the help of his caretaker and fellow veteran Nate, stood  up from his wheelchair and showed his reverence for his once rival and  friend. He, of course, didn't understand what the big deal was. He just  wanted to honor a fellow veteran and public servant. It was just a  reflex for him to show that respect, and his humility in its wake was  his classic style.   I remember the morning earlier this spring when Senator Dole called  me to tell me that he had stage IV lung cancer. He wanted to make sure  that my wife Laina and I knew before the press did. But all the while,  what I remember from that conversation was how upbeat he was, how  positive he was, worried about me and not himself.   But he, again, beat the odds and spent more quality time with all of  us. And every time I saw him, even up to just a couple of weeks ago, he  was always cracking jokes, imparting wisdom, and spending time with all  of his friends.   I am so grateful for the blessing of each moment spent with him  before and after that call. I can't express what I would give for  another one of those moments, as I know is true for his wife, our  friend, Senator Elizabeth; and his most steadfast supporter and  advocate, his daughter Robin.   The same goes for his devoted staff, who are like family to the  Doles. Whenever you visited the Doles, that staff were all family  members. I want to mention Pia, Marion, Mo, Ruth Ann, and so many more.  We mourn your loss and you are in our prayers.   There are so many scores of friends from all ages and so many walks  of life. So many people reached out to me this week to say: We are  thinking of you, we are praying for you, give the Dole family our  condolences.   Now, as his incredible work here is done--and I am going to miss my  friend--the boots that my fellow Kansas Senator and I have to fill are  very large, but, fortunately, he left me with some good advice to fill  those boots.   It was in 2017, shortly after I had been elected and I was facing my  first tough vote, and Senator Dole and myself were able to have a late  morning brunch. I had my notes prepared. I was going to discuss this  issue in great depth and I was prepared for every one of Senator Dole's  questions.   But as I started the conversation, he said: Well, what is going on,  on the Hill?   I said: Senator Dole, I have a tough vote tomorrow.   He took another sip of his lobster bisque and looked at me and said:  Roger, go back to Kansas. The people of Kansas will tell you the  answer.   I know I am going to never measure up to his standard. He set a  tremendous bar for us to reach. While Senator Dole is done, the lessons  we can all learn from his life will be lived out and passed on.  Certainly, the spirit of Bob Dole, the spirit of patriotism, hope,  loyalty, respect, service, and genuine kindness and concern for others  will never fade.   One of the best days of my time in Congress was watching Senator Dole  receive the Congressional Gold Medal in 2018, in our Nation's Capitol  Rotunda. It was a special honor. As a freshman Congressman, I had to  kind of fight my way to the front row or near the front row, and I was  surrounded by other Members of Congress as well. As the President  recited Bob Dole's story, one by one they would look at me and nod. You  know that nod you get, the nod of respect. You don't have to say  anything. I was so proud to  [[Page S9007]]  be a Kansan. My chest puffed up, full of pride. It just made me so very  proud to be there with the Kansans to see this is what a Congressman, a  Senator, is supposed to look like.   For months, as we led up to that event, his family and friends  watched as he struggled to regain strength after several more health  setbacks. I remember the family didn't think he would be able to  attend, but much like the wounded Bob Dole in the forties, he was able  to accept that award personally. He miraculously recovered, like he had  so many times before.   At that marvelous ceremony where he got to hear the gratitude of a  nation, the song "You'll Never Walk Alone'' was played. I was close  enough that I could see him mouth the words to the President: ``This is  my favorite song.'' And I was close enough that I could hear his  voice--a voice we were all familiar with--sing along, softly sing these  lyrics:       When you walk through a storm      Hold your head up high and don't be afraid of the dark      At the end of the storm there's a golden sky and the sweet             silver song of a lark      Walk on through the wind      Walk on through the rain      Though your dreams be tossed and blown      Walk on      Walk on with hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone      You'll never walk alone.    For so many of us--Kansans, veterans, the poor and hungry around the  world, farmers, the disability community, and more--we never walk  alone. We thank you, Senator Dole, for walking beside us, always giving  us hope. We love you, we miss you, and we thank you.   God bless America.   I yield the floor.
