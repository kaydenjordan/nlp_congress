 Mr. Speaker, the United States is facing an inflation and  debt crisis not seen in over 40 years. West Virginians have seen the  value of their savings erode before their very eyes because of reckless  tax-and-spend policies.   We know who is responsible for the current inflation crisis, but what  in our country's history has allowed us to get to this point? The  answer can actually be traced back to 1971, when President Nixon took  the United States off the gold standard.   The gold standard means tying the dollar directly to the value of  gold. Under the gold standard, any American would be able to trade  their dollars for a fixed amount of gold. By linking the dollar to the  value of gold, the money supply could only be increased if the supply  of gold increases. This connects and protects the purchasing power of  your dollars.   That is why I introduced legislation to return the United States to  the gold standard. Had we been on the gold standard or some other fixed  standard, we would not be in the inflation crisis we are in today. I  look forward to working with the Republican majority to make sure this  issue gets attention.                            ____________________
