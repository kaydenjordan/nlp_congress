 Madam Speaker, Congress has a really proud tradition of  passing our annual NDAA. Passing this bill is as important as ever. The  NDAA is the result of hard work on both sides to support our military  and provide our warfighters with the tools and the resources they need.   This bill includes my enhanced Buy American legislation to support  American jobs by ensuring the reliability, stability, and security of  our defense industrial base, strengthening relationships with our  trusted allies. A strong military begins with a U.S. defense industrial  base built with domestic components by an American workforce.   The fiscal year 2024 NDAA is a testament to compromise. I am grateful  to the chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, Mr.  Wittman, and the professional staff for what they have done to get this  across the finish line for the American people.
