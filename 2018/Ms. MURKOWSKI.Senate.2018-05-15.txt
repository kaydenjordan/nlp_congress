 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am honored to join with my colleagues  in honoring the men and women of law enforcement during National Police  Week.   This year, it was our colleague Mr. Blunt, the Senator from Missouri  and the leader of our Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, who arranged an  opportunity for us to speak on the floor, and I thank him for that.   I wish to commend my colleagues Senators Grassley and Feinstein for  putting together the National Police Week Resolution. As of yesterday  afternoon, there were 75 cosponsors to this resolution, which is more  than we have had previously.   In 2017, the law enforcement community lost 199 of its bravest to  line-of-duty incidents. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial  Fund reports that 53 officers have given their lives in 2018; 28 of  those killed by firearms. This is a 56-percent increase over the same  period in 2017.   I am very grateful that in Alaska we have not lost an officer in  2018. We are praying that continues and that we don't see any moving  forward, but we know, like every other State out there, we are living  on borrowed time.   Law enforcement families live on borrowed time. The job is inherently  dangerous, and we pray and wish and hope that loved ones return home at  the end of his or her shift. Really, we know there are no guarantees,  and there never will be.   The last Alaska officer to give his life to protect ours was Sergeant  Allen Brandt. He was with the Fairbanks Police Department. His end of  watch was October 28, 2016. Sergeant Brandt was shot multiple times  just a couple of weeks before his death. Everyone thought he would  survive his injuries. I had an opportunity to speak with him while he  was in the hospital with his wife and his best friend. He was released  from the hospital. Eight days after the shooting, Allen felt strong  enough to actually appear before the Fairbanks City Council in person  to thank the community for their outpouring of love and support and the  unconditional love they had offered him and his family in the wake of  this tragedy. He was very thankful to the community, most certainly,  but he also went on to admonish the community. He said:         We need your support, not just when bad things happen. The       officers do a hard job and most of the time it's thankless.    Those were truly his famous last words. He went to Anchorage for a  second surgery a few days later, and he died on the operating table.   Officer Allen is clearly not forgotten in the Fairbanks community. He  lived a hero's life, and his words before the Fairbanks City Council  will be long remembered: ``We need your support, not just when bad  things happen.'' That has to be the reminder to all of us all of the  time--to be there for those who are serving us, to be there to support  them.   In an editorial published this morning, the Fairbanks Daily News- Miner offers the following:         With police receiving much negative media attention on the       national level, sometimes people forget the vast majority of       police officers are good men and women who put their lives on       the line. . . . Take time to remember the . . . fallen       officers who have given their lives up for their communities.       And be sure to thank the police officers you do see for the       hard job they do, even if nothing bad has happened lately.    Those were words taken from the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner this  morning.   This week, thousands of members of the law enforcement family have  come to Washington, DC, for public ceremonies on the Mall and here at  the Capitol. There have been private moments visiting lost colleagues  at the memorial site. The surviving relatives of the fallen are  grieving and recovering at events sponsored by Concerns of Police  Survivors. This is a great organization, a vital organization, whose  existence is barely known outside of the law enforcement community. I  have had several--several--opportunities over the years to work with  this extraordinary organization as they have been there for the  families who have lost their heroes.   There are ample opportunities this week to thank members of our law  enforcement family for their sacrifices in public and, certainly, ample  opportunities every day of the year to thank our officers in private,  starting with our own U.S. Capitol Police who greet us at the door  every morning. They remain on post when we leave at the end of very  long days. They are here for us day in and day out.   I would just end with an observation. I think the editorial this  morning in the Fairbanks paper offers up words of wisdom. As the  memories of National Police Week 2018 fade, I hope we will not wait  until next May to thank the men and women of law enforcement for their  selfless and at times thankless service to our communities.   With that, I thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
