 Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi and her sham partisan  committee are desperately trying to distract the American people from  all the crises their party philosophy has caused.   The American people are not fooled. No amount of scripted,  teleprompted, overproduced political soap opera can distract the  American people from the pain they are feeling at the gas station, the  grocery store, and the electric outlets, or the tightening of their  purse strings, thanks to the Democrats' wage-killing price hikes.   It has been 18 months since Washington fell into Democrat one-party  rule. Since then, inflation has skyrocketed; gas prices are at an all- time high; and we are headed into a recession.   Why is Speaker Pelosi and her sham January 6th Committee still  obsessing over the former President?   While President Trump lives rent-free in Democrats' heads,  Republicans are working on real solutions to help the American people.  We are trying to rein in reckless spending to bring down inflation and  restart American energy dominance.   Democrats should take notes. The polls show the American people want  these solutions.   Enough of this nonsense January 6 witch hunt.                            ____________________
