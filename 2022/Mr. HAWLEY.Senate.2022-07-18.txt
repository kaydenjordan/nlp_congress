 Mr. President, following my submission yesterday, I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the next part of an  investigation directed by the U.S. Central Command concerning the Abbey  Gate bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       ACTS-SCK-DO      SUBJECT: Findings and Recommendation--Attack Against U.S.           Forces Conducting NEO at Hamid Karzai International           Airport on 26 August 2021        (e) Abbey Gate was structured from North to South, with the       inner Abbey Gate at the north end opening to the actual       airfield. There was a 265-meter corridor between the inner       gate and the outer gate, to the south, known as the inner       corridor. This area served as a sally port for searching and       processing vehicles. Two lanes divided by jersey barriers       were beyond the outer gate. The egress lane from the Barron       Hotel, which joined the gate road from the southeast, was       approximately 120 meters south of the outer gate. The Chevron       obstacle was approximately 155 meters south of the outer       gate. The area between the outer gate and the Chevron was       known as the outer corridor. A sewage canal ran generally       east to west parallel to the inner and outer corridors, on       the east side of the perimeter wall and fence. During       operations of Abbey Gate, 2/1 established a holding area in       the outer corridor lanes, a search and DoS processing       location in the inner corridor, and security/crowd control       positions at the canal and Chevron. Additionally, the sniper       section established  [[Page S3334]]       an overwatch position in the tower at the outer gate. Marines       escorted evacuees through a break in the canal fence or       around the Chevron, and ushered them into the outer corridor       holding area for an initial search. Outside the Chevron, the       Taliban conducted crowd control and initial screening. U.K.       Forces processed their evacuees at the Barron Hotel and drove       them through the outer corridor lanes, through the Abbey       Gate, to the airfield (see all exhibits from       2/1 Marines, Echo Company, Golf Company, and enclosure 11-      13). Companies rotated responsibility for gate operations,       with Golf Company initially taking the canal security       positions, Fox Company taking the Chevron area, and dividing       the inner gate search and escort duties (exhibits 53, 76, 77,       79, 81, 89). Echo Company rotated into gate operations later       in the NEO to enable a rest cycle for all companies (exhibits       53, 56, 76).        (f) Between 20 and 25 August, gate operations took on a       structured and predictable battle rhythm. Crowds were       desperate but manageable, able to be kept calm at Abbey Gate       because Marines interacted with the people continuously and       used the PSYOP capability to communicate (exhibits 57, 79,       80, 83, 85, 88). Early in the NEO, crowds at Abbey Gate       numbered around 1500 between the canal and the Chevron       entrance, and another 500-1000 in the outer gate holding       area. There was a concern throughout 2/1 that the crowds       could riot and force the gate open at any time exhibits 57,       83). The JTF-CR J2 described the crowd as the greatest threat       to mission, because at any time they could have forced their       way past Marines and onto the airfield, stopping air       operations, and ultimately the evacuation (exhibit 15).       Several factors undermined the Marines' and U.K. Forces'       efforts to keep the crowds calm.        (i) The Taliban used excessive force outside the Chevron,       which created the incentive for civilians to avoid the main       road entrance and move to Abbey Gate via the canal (exhibits       53, 77, 79, 80). Over time, the canal became extremely       crowded and people were being crushed and injured (exhibits       53, 77, 79, 80, 214, 220).        (ii) DoS Consular officers provided inconsistent support at       Abbey Gate, and the required documentation for evacuation       changed hourly (exhibits 53, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 85, 88).       Marines often had to halt gate processing and flow, because       the Consular officers were not present to screen and approve       evacuees for movement to the PAX Terminal (exhibits 53, 77,       79, 80, 81, 83, 85, 88). It is possible Consular officers       were absent from the gate because of threat reporting and to       better meter the flow of evacuees and not overcrowd the       airfield (exhibit 146). However, the crowd would eventually       notice the halt in processing and become highly agitated       (exhibits 53, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 85, 88).        (iii) Partner nation representatives/forces consistently       conducted uncoordinated evacuee extractions at Abbey Gate.       Partner nation forces frequently left potential evacuees       unsecured within 2/1 Marines' perimeter, or relied upon       Marines to escort their rejected evacuees back to the canal       (exhibits 53, 77, 83, 88). Partner nation representatives/      forces often pulled out large groups of people, usually       families (exhibits 53, 77, 83, 88). The crowd would see       the disparate treatment of select personnel and become       agitated (exhibits 53, 77, 83, 88).        (g) Threat reporting during the NEO was continuous and       generally non-specific. The USFOR-A FWD and JTF-CR staffs       estimated the threat streams to be credible reports during       the 10-day NEO (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21). The threats varied       from VBIED attacks and Suicide Vest Improvised Explosive       Devices (SVIEDs) against gates, to bags in the crowds or       aircraft hijackings with evacuees concealing bombs and       weapons on flights (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21, 102, 115). 2/1       Marines believed their only means to counter these threats,       without degrading the mission, was to increase overwatch and       actively search for civilians meeting the descriptions       provided (exhibits 15, 53, 56, 57, 77, 80). 2/1 Marines       attempted to balance the need to continue to interact with       the crowd to pull potential evacuees into the outer gate and       increase force protection (exhibits 53, 56, 77). On several       occasions, both prior to and throughout 26 August, 2/1       Marines providing security along the canal pulled back from       the crowd, took a knee behind jersey barriers, and stopped       the flow of processing based on reports indicating specific       times of attack (exhibits 53, 77, 89).        (h) By 25 August, Abbey Gate was the Main Effort for Gate       Operations at HKIA. The terrain and infrastructure at East       and North Gates, coupled with threats to force and large,       unruly crowds, made these gates untenable for evacuation       operations (exhibits 15, 18, 100, 102, 104). Both gates were       effectively closed between 20-25 August (exhibits 15, 18,       100, 102, 104). The West and South Gates were still       operational, but both were used for coordinated arrivals and       openings (exhibits 125, 126). The decreased access to       evacuation processing points at HKIA forced DoS and partner       nations to direct most small groups and individual evacuees       to Abbey Gate (exhibit 15, 125, 126, 127, 146). The canal at       Abbey Gate facilitated crowd control and provided some       standoff, and the Chevron minimized the VBIED threat       (exhibits 53, 56, 76, 77, 83, 84). There were effective       overwatch positions, and the Taliban screened the main       approach (exhibits 53, 56, 76, 77, 83, 84). Over time, crowds       bypassed Taliban checkpoints to get to the canal and seek       access to HKIA (exhibits 77-88).        (i) On 25 August, the crowd in the canal outside Abbey Gate       was noticeably larger than the days prior, numbering around       2000-3000 (exhibits 53, 55, 77, 80). In addition to the       Taliban activity at the Chevron, Marines attributed this       swell in civilians at the canal to the closure of many of the       other gates at HKIA and the impending withdrawal date of 31       August (exhibits 53, 55, 77, 80). The 2 PARA Commander       observed the efficiency and accessibility of Abbey Gate had       become publicly known, drawing more people (exhibit 127). The       crowd was also noticeably more desperate (exhibits 53, 55,       77, 80). Echo Company operated the gate during the day on 25       August, and conducted a RIP at 1600 with Golf Company       (exhibits 56, 77). During Echo Company's time on the gate,       they pushed the crowd back from the sniper tower and jersey       barriers on the nearside of the canal to create standoff       (exhibit 56). With the assistance of U.K. Forces, Echo       Company pushed the crowds 150-meters down the nearside of the       canal, and Marines maintained control of the terrain between       the jersey barriers and newly established perimeter (exhibits       56, 59, 60, 61). After conducting his RIP, (TEXT REDACTED)       Golf Company (TEXT REDACTED) was concerned the Marines and       U.K. Forces were overextended based on recent threat       reporting, and decided to collapse the position back to the       base of the sniper tower at the outer gate (exhibit 77).        (j) During the evening of 25 August and into the morning of       26 August, the crowds in the canal continued to grow and       became increasingly desperate (exhibits 53, 77, 80, 89).       Threat reporting on 25 and 26 August indicated Islamic State       of Iraq and Syria-Khorasan (ISIS-K) would execute an attack       at a gate using a SVIED (exhibits 13, 15, 76, 77). Nearly       every Marine interviewed in 2/1 was aware of the reported       threat, but did not find the information to be out of the       ordinary compared to other earlier threats (exhibits 57, 59,       60, 61, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 86, 89). Many       noted the information was more specific, but changed       regularly (different bags and descriptions of the bomber)       (exhibit 88). At approximately 2330 on 25 August, after       collapsing the nearside canal security down to the sniper       tower, (TEXT REDACTED) had all Marines take a knee and reduce       their posture behind the canal wall and jersey barriers. This       lasted until daylight on 26 August (exhibits 77, 88). (TEXT       REDACTED) had the unit take the same force posture at       approximately 1400 for 30 minutes, based on additional threat       reporting (exhibits 77, 88, 89). After the brief stand-down,       2/1 Marines continued to process evacuees, having what some       considered to be their most productive day on 26 August       (exhibit 80).        (k) Throughout the evening of 25 August, into the morning       of 26 August, units prepared for the planned closure of Abbey       Gate to enable the JTE of Marine forces (exhibits 15, 18, 53,       56, 57, 76, 77). The U.K. Forces were unable to meet the       planned closure time of 1800 on 25 August, and subsequently       were unable to meet the new time of 0700 on 26 August       (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 56, 76, 77). During the afternoon of 25       August, the U.K. PARA units operating from the Barron Hotel       had near1y 1000 evacuees to process (exhibit 127). The 2 PARA       Commander on the ground received two timelines for completion       of evacuation operations, with the initial completion date of       25 August and the adjusted timeline of period of darkness 27       August (exhibit 127). The U.K. met this second completion       time (exhibits 124, 127). A higher authority within the U.K.       Forces, not present at HKIA, was responsible for the change       in the timeline, not the 2 PARA Commander (exhibit 127).        (l) On 26 August, at approximately 1600, Golf Company       rotated the platoons on the line an hour early due to 4th       Platoon growing fatigued, and 1st Platoon took over canal       security (exhibits 77, 89). Most of Golf Company worked the       outer gate because the crowds were growing desperate (exhibit       77). People were being crushed and injured at the jersey       barriers at the base of the sniper tower (exhibits 77, 83,       88, 89). Echo Company was working the inner gate, as of       1200-1300, to provide additional manpower at the gate area       and prepare for the closing of Abbey Gate that night       (exhibits 56, 77). (TEXT REDACTED) was concerned with the       threat reporting and ordered all 1stSgts and Corpsmen to       remain in the inner corridor area for force protection       (exhibit 77). However, some corpsmen were called forward       because of heat and trauma injuries suffered by civilians       in the crowd (exhibits 77, 92). At approximately 1600,       (TEXT REDACTED) attended a meeting with (TEXT REDACTED) 2/      501 PIR (TEXT REDACTED) the 2 PARA (TEXT REDACTED) and the       Taliban to discuss U.K. passage of lines from Barron       Hotel, handover of security of the outer gate to the       Taliban, and responsibility of the inner gate       transitioning to 2/501 PIR (exhibits 53, 77). At       approximately 1700, BGen Sullivan visited Abbey Gate and       discussed the closure timeline with (TEXT REDACTED)       exhibits 15, 17, 18, 53, 77). BGen Sullivan departed at       approximately 1715 (exhibits 15, 17, 18). At approximately       1725, (TEXT REDACTED) 24th MEU (TEXT REDACTED) convinced       an Afghan civilian to speak to the crowd through a non-      standard loud speaker for 10 minutes (exhibit 105). The       messaging pleaded with the crowed to stop pushing, and       stated that women and children were being crushed to death       (exhibit 105). Three snipers from the       2/1 Marines Sniper section, attached to Echo Company, but       in direct support of units at Abbey Gate, were in the       tower at the outer gate (exhibit 62). The snipers in the       tower were (TEXT REDACTED) was at the base of  [[Page S3335]]       the tower near the fence (exhibits 62, 63). They were well       aware of the reported threats and scanned the large and       unruly crowd in the canal for individuals ``out of       baseline'' or demonstrating hostile intent (exhibit 62).        (m) At approximately 1730 on 26 August, the crowds at Abbey       Gate were desperate and growing agitated (exhibits 76, 77,       80, 84, 89). First Platoon, Golf Company, led by (TEXT       REDACTED) were consolidated at the jersey barriers beneath       the tower at the outer gate (exhibits 77, 88, 89, 91, 92).       The platoon was forced to move nearly all personnel into the       corner to hold back the massive and largely recalcitrant       crowd from coming over the barriers and breaching the gate       (exhibits 89, 91). Three members of the FST, Sgt Nicole Gee,       Sgt Johanny Rosario Pichardo, and (TEXT REDACTED) were       operating slightly behind the platoon (exhibits 89, 91, 92,       106, 107). (TEXT REDACTED) 2/1's (TEXT REDACTED) were       standing to the North of the PSYOP vehicle in the outer       corridor (exhibits 53, 76). (TEXT REDACTED) was near the       canal, approximately 30-40 meters from the sniper tower       (exhibits 77, 89, 92). Several members of Echo Company were       in the outer corridor area, escorting civilians or looking       for specific potential evacuees (exhibits 61, 62, 63). SSgt       Darin Hoover was near the fence at the base of the outer gate       tower (exhibit 63). (TEXT REDACTED) was escorting an       interpreter to the canal to look for his father in the crowd       (exhibit 63). Two corpsmen were also in the outer corridor.       HM3 Maxton Soviak was called forward to treat a civilian heat       causality and was rendering aid near the canal, but up       against the fence (exhibit 92). (TEXT REDACTED) came forward       from the inner gate to bring water to the 1st Platoon Marines       on the canal wall (exhibit 92). At approximately 1736 local       time, 26 August 2021, a single explosion occurred at Abbey       Gate (exhibits 66, 98, 72, 121, 236). Overhead persistent       infrared systems captured the time of the explosion at       precisely 13:06:52Z, or 17:36:52 local (exhibit 236). The STP       OIC received notification of the attack from 2/1 Marines by       radio at 1738, and used the Signal Application to warn the       North HKIA Role II-E of potential casualties at 1739 (exhibit       66, 98).        (n) The blast at Abbey Gate killed thirteen Service Members       total, to include eleven Marines, one Sailor, and one       Soldier:        (i) SSgt Darin Hoover, USMC, Echo Company 2/1 Marines        (ii) Sgt Nicole Gee, USMC, CLB-24, 24th MEU        (iii) Sgt Johanny Rosario Pichardo, USMC, JTF-CR (TF 51-5th       MEB)        (iv) Cpl Hunter Lopez, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (v) Cpl Daegan Page, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (vi) Cpl Humberto Sanchez, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (vii) LCpl David Espinoza, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (viii) LCpl Rylee McCollum, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (ix) LCpl Dylan Merola, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (x) LCpl Kareem Nikoui, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (xi) LCpl Jared Schmitz, USMC, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (xii) HM3 Maxton Soviak, USN, Golf Company, 2/1 Marines        (xiii) SSG Ryan Knauss, USA, Bravo Company, 9th       Psychological Operations Battalion (A)        (o) Those killed in action were all located in vicinity of       the tower at the outer gate standing a security position at       the edge of the canal or jersey barriers, with the exception       of SSG Knauss and SSgt Hoover (exhibits 63, 91, 92, 105,       129). Three of the 1st Platoon Marines who were killed in the       blast were elevated on the canal wall, helping pull potential       evacuees into the outer gate: LCpl Rylee McCollum, LCpl Dylan       Merola, and LCpl Kareem Nikoui. SSgt Hoover was in the outer       corridor area, on the inside of the fence, near the tower       (exhibits 63, 91, 92). SSG Knauss was in the outer corridor       area with the PSYOP vehicle, on the passenger's side, to the       rear of the vehicle (exhibits 105, 129). The vehicle front       was pointed at the jersey barrier and canal intersection       below the tower where 1st Platoon was providing crowd control       and security. Autopsy summaries provided by the Armed Forces       Medical Examiner's Office confirmed all Service Members who       were KIA died of blast and ballistic injuries (exhibit 145).       There were no gunshot wounds on any of the KIA, but       significant penetrating ball bearing injuries (exhibit 145).       Injuries sustained to those KIA were primarily lacerations,       ruptures, and bruising to the head, torso, and pelvis       (exhibits 138, 145). Of the protective gear examined by Joint       Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat (JTAPIC),       small arms protective insert (SAPI) plates and helmets were       effective at stopping fragmentation and ball bearings       (exhibit 138).        (p) Those interviewed during the investigation could not       provide a number of civilian casualties caused by the attack.       Most were only aware of open source reporting and concurred       the number would be substantial. Open source reporting       estimates casualties at 160-170 (exhibits 251, 252).        (q) Numerous Marines were wounded because of the attack,       with most being part of 1st Platoon, Golf Company or members       of       2/1 Marines positioned in the canal or in the outer corridor       area, near the physical gate and PSYOP vehicle (exhibits 63,       91, 92, 105, 129, 224). The initial list of wounded is best       captured by the 2/1 S2 blast and injury analysis, sketches       from Echo and Golf Company NCOs, and Aeromedical Evacuation       Critical Care Air Transport Team (AE-CCATT) TRANSCOM       Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System       (TRAC2ES) flight data (exhibits 92, 137, 236). There appear       to be 27 service members reported as initially wounded during       the attack, but eight were not medically evacuated and       instead redeployed with the unit (exhibits 68, 92, 93, 95,       131). The remaining nineteen were redeployed due to their       wounds (exhibit 68). However, since redeploying, units have       reported additional TBI and concussion related wounds for 12       more Marines, for a total of 39 Service Members wounded in       the attack (exhibits 68, 92, 93, 95, 164). This new number       does not include members of the 82nd Airborne who were       conducting a leader's recon at Abbey Gate for the RIP, and       24th MEU personnel, who were also in the outer corridor area       (exhibits 107, 124, 129). The number of wounded from the       attack at Abbey Gate will almost certainly continue to grow.                            ____________________
