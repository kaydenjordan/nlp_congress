 Mr. President, before I give my remarks, I want to echo  what has been said on the floor here by our two colleagues, the two  Senators from the Commonwealth of Virginia, about Senator John Warner.   I would just say, too, that when I first got to the Senate, my first  6 years in the Senate, I was a member of the Senate Armed Services  Committee. When I got here, Senator Warner was the chairman of that  committee. And I had known him a little bit from a distance because I  had worked as a staffer out here back in the 1980s, but I got the  chance to know him in a very personal way as the chairman of the Senate  Armed Services Committee.   And I have to just, again, associate myself with many of the comments  that have already been made about him. He truly was a gentleman in the  truest sense of the word--somebody who represents everything, I think,  that is good about public life in politics and legislating and making  public policy and cared profoundly and deeply for our men and women in  uniform.   As the chairman of the committee, that was his No. 1 priority. Of  course, as has been mentioned, he was a marine and Secretary of the  Navy and had just a deep, deep passion to make sure that the men and  women who defend this country on a daily basis were respected and had  the resources, the equipment, the training, and everything they needed  to succeed in their jobs.   So he truly was a--he couldn't have been a kinder person to me. As a  rookie out here, I remember I was standing over there offering an  amendment to the Defense authorization bill. I think it was my first,  probably, amendment  [[Page S3474]]  on the floor, and it was something that he, as the chairman, opposed.  And he, I think, probably could have eviscerated me if he had wanted  to, but he had that, as has been mentioned--he had that demeanor and  disposition, somebody described it as a twinkle in his eye. He truly  had that. And he really was out of central casting. If anybody wanted  to cast somebody, he certainly could have had a career in Hollywood  because he looked the part. But it was more than just looking the part.  He lived it. He was truly not only a gentleman but a great Senator for  the Commonwealth of Virginia and a great patriot to this country, who  got up every day and thought of ways that he could make our country  stronger and better.   So my thoughts and prayers are with his wife Jeanne and all of his  family today                                 Agriculture    Mr. President, the last several years have been difficult ones for  cattle producers in my home State of South Dakota and around the  country. A 2019 fire, and later COVID, caused reductions in meatpacking  capacity, which left cattle producers with cattle to sell and no place  to sell them.   And even now, with our country well on its way to full reopening,  meatpackers are still not back at full capacity--at least in part, it  seems, because of the enhanced unemployment benefits the Biden  administration is providing are not encouraging workers to come back to  work.   Throughout these challenges, ranchers have struggled, but  meatpackers--meatpackers have seen continued substantial profit  margins. While certainly market forces can see the price for cattle  fluctuate, the gap between meatpacker profits and rancher profits  raises some questions, most especially because more than 80 percent of  the meatpacking market in this country is concentrated in the hands of  just four companies.   That level of concentration creates the opportunity for market  manipulation. The gulf between rancher and meatpacker profits and the  significant power these companies have over the beef industry has  raised concerns that we are looking at something more than just an  issue of supply and demand.   That is why I wrote to the Department of Justice at the beginning of  the pandemic urging the Department to begin an investigation into the  meatpacking industry to make sure that there was no market manipulation  going on. The Department of Justice responded by directing the Justice  Department's Antitrust Division to initiate an investigation.   Well, that was a year ago, and since then, we have heard nothing. No  results from the investigation have been released, and it is not clear  whether the investigation is still ongoing.   So, last week, I led several of my Senate and House colleagues, along  with South Dakota Representative Dusty Johnson, in a letter to Attorney  General Merrick Garland urging the Department of Justice to continue  investigating the beef sector to determine if improper and  anticompetitive activity has occurred. It is essential that we hold the  highly concentrated meatpacker industry accountable to consumers and  producers who depend upon it. I will continue to press the Department  of Justice to thoroughly investigate this situation.   Another important thing that we can do to help ranchers start to see  better prices for their cattle is to encourage competition in the  meatpacking industry. As I said, more than 80 percent of the  meatpacking industry in this country is controlled by just four  companies. Encouraging more companies to get into this marketplace and  encouraging small meatpackers to expand will dilute the power of these  four companies and create more competition for ranchers' cattle, which  will lead to higher prices for ranchers when they bring their cattle to  market.   That is why I introduced the Strengthening Local Processing Act in  February with Senator Merkley. Our legislation would help strengthen  and diversify national meat-processing capacity by providing new  resources for smaller, more local meat-processing operations.   Encouraging new meatpackers to enter the market and smaller  meatpackers to expand their operations will provide livestock producers  with more marketing options and thus increase competition for their  cattle. Plus, spreading out and expanding our Nation's meat-processing  capacity over more plants will make our Nation's meat supply less  vulnerable to interruption in situations like the coronavirus pandemic  or natural disaster.   During the pandemic, outbreaks of COVID at meatpacking plants  seriously compromised supply, as empty grocery store meat sections  attested. Had meatpacking capacity been less concentrated, it is likely  that we would not have seen such significant shortages.   Last month, I requested that the Senate Agriculture Committee hold a  hearing to consider the challenges facing the livestock industry, as  well as the bills that have been introduced this year to try to improve  the situation. I recognize that there are contrasting views among  cattle producers on the best path forward to improve the cattle market,  but I am hopeful that a hearing would help lead to the passage of  legislation that would improve the outlook for cattle producers.   I also recently introduced, along with Senator Tester, an amendment  to the legislation the Senate is considering today that would require  the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to  review the 2015 World Trade Organization ruling that led to the repeal  of mandatory country-of-origin labeling, or COOL, and identify how it  affected U.S. consumers, producers, and the supply chain.   If the review finds negative impacts, the amendment would require the  administration to submit to Congress legislative or administrative  actions to address the impacts. I am a longtime supporter of country- of-origin labeling, and I have been raising the importance of this  issue with the new Biden administration.    I will continue working on a path forward for country-of-origin  labeling. There is strong demand for U.S. born and raised beef, and  consumers want to know where their food is coming from. The least we  can do for our ranchers and the consumers who depend on their products  is to provide them with the benefit and certainty of seeing ``Made in  the USA'' labels on grocery store shelves in South Dakota and around  the country.   I think I speak for a lot of Americans when I say there are few  things I enjoy more than a mouthwatering burger or a really good steak.  And there are a lot of men and women out there in South Dakota and  across the country doing the demanding work of raising cattle so that  the rest of us can enjoy our burgers and steaks and roasts.   I am very proud to represent South Dakota ranchers here in the  Senate, and I will continue to make it a priority to support cattle  producers and make sure that they have fair and transparent markets for  the commodities that they produce.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and the Senator from North Carolina  (Mr. Tillis).
