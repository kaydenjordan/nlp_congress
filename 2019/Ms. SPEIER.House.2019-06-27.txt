 Madam Speaker, this is not my America. This is not the  values of our America. Look at this picture.   Now, some critics think that this should not have been published, but  I disagree, because these people are not rapists or murderers or drug  dealers.   This is Oscar Ramirez and his 23-month-old daughter, Angie Valeria.  They died on the Rio Grande River, Angie clinging to Oscar's neck and  tucked under his shirt in a desperate attempt to survive.   Their story isn't unique. Last Saturday, a mother and three children  were found dead on U.S. soil. Children have been found freezing. We now  know that many of them don't even have simple items of hygiene like  soap and toothbrushes.   A group of women from my district, 20 of them, created a nonprofit  called Bay Area Border Relief. They are in McAllen right now. They took  490 boxes of clothes, and it was actually reduced in less than 2 weeks.   We need to address this issue now.                            ____________________
