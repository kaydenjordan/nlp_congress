 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Jan Gee, the President and CEO of the Washington Food Industry  Association.   Jan was recently presented the Woman of the Year award from the Women  Grocers of America.   She has dedicated more than 30 years to being a voice for small  businesses in  [[Page H2678]]  eastern Washington and continues to work tirelessly on behalf of  family-owned markets and grocery stores throughout our State.   The winner of this award must exemplify the true characteristics of a  leader. With a passion for the independent grocery industry, Jan Gee  fits that description to a ``T.'' She has mentored and empowered women  colleagues, inspiring and encouraging many to take on leadership  positions.   I have known Jan since my days in the Washington State legislature.  She is so deserving of this award because of her hard work, not only  for small businesses but for helping to support the next generation of  female leaders, entrepreneurs, and small business owners in Washington  State.   I appreciate all that Jan has done and congratulate her on being  recognized with the Woman of the Year award.   God bless you, Jan.                            ____________________
