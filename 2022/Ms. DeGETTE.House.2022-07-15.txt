 Madam Speaker, the horror of a 10-year-old girl, the  victim of rape, re-victimized when her parents were forced to take her  out of State because of Ohio's abortion law.   A woman who was having a miscarriage, whose doctor refused to give  her the medical procedure she needed because of fear of being  prosecuted.   A woman trying to get long-acting birth control, whose pharmacist  refused to prescribe the necessary medication for the procedure.   The chaos in the wake of the terrible Dobbs decision is only going to  get worse from here.   The Supreme Court and the Republican Party have declared a war on  Americans' healthcare rights. Every single American has the right and  the freedom to make the healthcare decisions that they need, including  abortion.   We passed this bill last September. We passed it in September after  the first decision in the Supreme Court. We are going to pass this bill  today in the U.S. House of Representatives. We are going to pass this  bill, which codifies Roe v. Wade, every time we need to, to protect  Americans' rights to healthcare and to protect everybody's equality.
