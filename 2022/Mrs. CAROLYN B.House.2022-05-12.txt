 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this  Special Order.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, it has been  nearly 2 weeks since the world saw the Supreme Court's draft decision  to overturn Roe v. Wade.   We all had suspected it was coming. I rise today to oppose that  decision and to oppose what has become the tyranny of the Republican  minority, a minority that has worked for decades to restrict the rights  of women and minorities. The extremist Republican minority has worked  systematically over the years to politicize the Supreme Court by  packing it with activist ideologues who hold views in line with the  demands of these extremists.   Now this Republican minority, after successfully packing the Court  with ideologues, they now seek to use this decision to return women to  a dark time, a time when a woman had no right to decide for herself, to  a time when abortions were illegal.   But let's be clear from the start. This whole argument is not really  about whether or not there will be abortions in this country, for there  have always been, and there will always be abortions in this country  and around the world. The only question is: Will those abortions be  safe and legal?   In 1973, the year of the decision, I marched with many women and  fought for Roe v. Wade. On the day in 1992 when the decision in Planned  Parenthood v. Casey was announced, I announced that I was running for  Congress because I objected to the restrictions they were putting on  women. I wanted equal rights for women and more pro-choice legislators  fighting for women in Washington. So I ran for office and won.   Yesterday, I marched with my Democratic colleagues to the Senate in  support of maintaining Roe v. Wade.   Madam Speaker, I join the majority of women in this country in  strongly opposing this decision, the injustice, this march back to a  darker time, and I will join them in marching, fighting, and  legislating until our rights to control decisions about our lives and  our bodies are secure because I believe there is no democracy if women  cannot make their own choices about their healthcare and their bodies,  including reproductive healthcare.   If this draft Supreme Court decision takes effect, hundreds of  millions of people in 26 States would be deprived of their right to  choose, of their right to abortion. People of color, the LGBTQ-plus  community, young people, people with disabilities, low-income  Americans, those who are the most marginalized will suffer the most.   If Roe falls, State so-called trigger laws, in quotes, already passed  in 13 States, will immediately ban abortion in those States entirely.  [[Page H4903]]    Also deeply troubling, this decision lays the groundwork for the  Court to tear down other fundamental rights, like the right to use  contraception, marriage equality, and so many other rights. All of this  from the Republican Party that proclaims itself to be the party of  smaller government except when it comes to making decisions over a  woman's life.   Yesterday I marched again. I marched to the Senate with my Democratic  colleagues and urged my Senate colleagues to pass the Women's Health  Protection Act, like we passed here in this House earlier. This bill  would establish a statutory right to abortion care across our country.   But as they did earlier this year, the Senate came up short because  there are not enough pro-choice Senators to protect abortion rights for  women. This is unacceptable, and every Senator who voted against the  Women's Health Protection Act must be held accountable by the American  people, by their constituents.   Madam Speaker, yesterday's vote has made one thing clear. The Senate  is so far out of step with what most Americans believe. Eighty percent  of Americans agree that the decision to have an abortion should be left  to a woman and her doctor compared to just nine percent who agree it  should be left to politicians and the government.   The Senate should reflect the will of the people and protect the  right to control our own bodies, which is why we need to fight for a  pro-choice Senate, to protect our rights.   We can and we must do everything we can to ensure that reproductive  rights are the law of our land. Our lives, the lives of our children,  and future generations depend on it.   Madam Speaker, I yield now to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal), the head of the Progressive Caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank  Representative Jayapal for her leadership of the Progressive Caucus and  for her strength in sharing her very personal and painful story. It has  given me more strength to fight this battle, and I hope it will inspire  many, many more as we fight for our basic rights.   Madam Speaker, I yield now to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jones), a leader in the Progressive Caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how  much time is remaining.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank  Representative Jones for sharing that story. It was very moving.   To others that are watching, if you want to share your story, send  them to us so we can read them into the Congressional Record and share  with other Americans about the need to save a woman's right to choose.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), one of the leading voices in Congress for women's rights  and consumer rights.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), and I thank her for her  leadership on this issue.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for her leadership and courage.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire how much time is remaining.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank  Representative Chu, the founder and chair of the ASPIRE Caucus, for her  leadership on this issue. She is the author of the Women's Health  Protection Act, which we supported and passed in this House, and which  we hope to pass in the Senate, and we will fight with all of our  strength to pass eventually.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues for sharing their  stories and the stories of their constituents. I ask the public to send  us their stories so we can read them into the Record as we talk about  the need to protect the freedom of women to make choices about their  own healthcare.   I firmly believe that there is no democracy if the women in this  country--half the population in this country--cannot make basic  decisions about their own bodies, their own healthcare, their own  choices, including reproductive healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues that have reached out and  said they wanted to be here tonight, but they couldn't for other  reasons. We hope to have future speak-outs and future Special Orders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
