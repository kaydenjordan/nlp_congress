 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an incredibly  important national security issue.   We all know that Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 virus originated,  is the home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The WIV is China's only  cellular level 4 biosafety super laboratory that researches human  infectious diseases. This lab is in very close proximity to the wet  market that is reputed to be the origin of COVID-19.   Last year, Senator Tom Cotton was thoroughly dismissed for  questioning the true origins of this virus, citing the Chinese  Communist Party's duplicity and dishonesty from the very beginning.   We all know that the Chinese Communist Party lied to the world about  the severity of COVID-19, how it is transmitted, and the dangers  associated. There needs to be a thorough and serious investigation into  the origins of COVID-19, what the Chinese Communist Party knew, and  when, and what the World Health Organization knew and when.   Uncovering the true origins of COVID-19 will be incredibly helpful in  helping us prepare for the next pandemic, which I think is something we  can all agree on.                            ____________________
