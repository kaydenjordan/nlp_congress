 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life  of Aubrey McGinnis.   Aubrey was born on December 26, 1960, and passed away on Saturday,  March 18, 2017.   Aubrey joined the U.S. Army in 1981, serving the Illinois Army  National Guard for 22 years and retiring as a chief warrant officer 4  pilot.   During his service, Aubrey graduated from the Illinois Institute of  Technology, where he earned a bachelor's of science degree in  electrical engineering in 1986. After working for a few years at Amoco,  he earned an additional degree in aviation technology at Vincennes  University on a Tuskegee Airman Scholarship. Aubrey then pursued his  lifelong passion to fly commercially with, first, Comair, Inc., and  later with United Airlines as an airline pilot.   As a loving husband to Ericka McGinnis and devoted father, Aubrey  enjoyed being a provider and spiritual guide to his beautiful family.   Aubrey was a dear friend to many, and he left a profound mark on the  lives of all those he loved and met. He was a quiet voice of reason and  wisdom, and I am proud to stand here today and honor his  legacy.                            ____________________
