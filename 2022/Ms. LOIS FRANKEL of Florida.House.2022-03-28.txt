 Mr. Speaker, I am very excited to be  supporting this bill today. The gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon) did a great job with the biographies of these two incredible  women, Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, our first two women  on the United States Supreme Court.   I am thinking back to my childhood. It is not that easy to think back  to my childhood, but I am thinking back to my childhood, and probably  one of the most exciting things that I did was a family trip with my  parents and my brother to the Capitol. Now when I think back, and  coming through the Capitol and seeing all those statues, I must have  wondered as a child, did women do anything? It is just amazing, of the  266 statues here in the Capitol, only 14 are women. To me that is  crazy. It is just crazy.   We are honoring these two Supreme Court Justices not just because  they are women. I am not going to go through their biographies again,  but think about it. They went through their careers at a time when  there was no Title IX, there was no equal pay, there were limitations  on how many women could actually get into law school, and then if you  did get into law school--because I was in law school back in the day  when there weren't a lot of us--you were bullied. I mean, you were  bullied in the classroom. Their achievement is absolutely remarkable.   I am very proud that future generations are going to come through  these Halls, and they are going to see representations of these two  women. Millions of children from all over the country and all over the  world--because we are opening up, I hope soon, as we pass COVID--can be  inspired, and I cannot wait. I cannot wait to bring my two little  grandsons so they can see that the girls can do it, too.  [[Page H3890]]    Just to add, this is a bipartisan bill. I am proud to be one of the  sponsors here in the House. Women did this together, but we thank the  gentlemen for being on board.
