 Madam President, I rise today to talk about the Land and  Water Conservation Fund.   Today we have only 39 days until September 30, which is the  expiration of the current authorization for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund. I am committed more than ever to getting LWCF  reauthorized or the authorization across the finish line. I have been  waiting to get a vote for the entire 115th Congress. I have been told  to wait, and I was patient for a while. The last time I was on the  floor, I offered it as an amendment to the last appropriations bill,  knowing that it was not germane but knowing that the issue needed to be  brought to the forefront of the U.S. Senate because it is at the  forefront of the American people. I will reiterate again that I can't  wait any longer.   In 2015, it took the expiration of the Land and Water Conservation  Fund before Congress got serious about reauthorizing the program and  allowing these vital conservation efforts to continue. I am putting  this body on notice once again: I will not allow it to expire again.   Several pieces of legislation have come before this body over the  previous months, and yet again I am being told by my colleagues--many  of whom profess, by the way, to be supportive of this legislation--that  we should wait just a little bit longer, that I can't even receive a  vote on the matter until then. I have offered my colleagues a very  simple proposition: Give me one vote on reauthorizing the Land and  Water Conservation Fund at a 60-vote threshold. I am not asking for us  to forgo the requirements for a 60-vote threshold.   I have asked for an amendment for months on any legislation coming  through the Senate, and I am being repeatedly told no. So I am here  offering a somewhat different solution. The bill that I will ask  unanimous consent on shortly is different in that the language hasn't  been offered as a standalone bill, but it is actually language that has  been passed by the U.S. Senate--this Chamber--by a vote of 85 to 12. It  is a bipartisan bill--or it is bipartisan language that was part of the  energy package that Chairman Murkowski negotiated with the ranking  member, and it includes reforms that both sides would like to see.   There is one change that I am offering today; that is, the ability  for LWCF to be reviewed every 3 years for all future Congresses, if  they believe it is warranted. It does so by including a joint  resolution of disapproval every 3 years in perpetuity, meaning an  individual from this body can come to the floor and, with the  appropriate votes for disapproval, can eliminate the automatic  reauthorization.   This is a permanent authorization of LWCF, but every 3 years, the  Senate as a body can vote to disapprove the automatic reauthorization,  and, in fact, they would essentially bring an end to the program. The  provision gives Congress a chance to take another look at the program  every couple of years, which seems to be in line with a number of what  my colleagues currently want, given the short-period options that I  have been offered in the past few years.   Let me talk about the reason this is permanent, because when LWCF was  created in the 1960s, its original authorization was for 25 years, and  when it came up for reauthorization in 1989, we reauthorized it for  another 25 years. It wasn't until 3 years ago, when it was up for  reauthorization, that all of a sudden the Senate, in their infinite  wisdom, decided: Well, we are only  [[Page S5800]]  going to do this in 3-year increments. And even as late as a month ago,  we were offered a 1-year reauthorization. What does a 1-year  reauthorization say to the conservation community, which plans for  generations what programs they will have to work with? It was only in  2015--after LWCF expired, I might add--that Congress chose a short-term  extension.   I believe that to embrace what the creators of this program believed,  we have to get back to a longer term reauthorization, and I will  propound in this unanimous consent request that it be permanent, with a  3-year review and the ability to pass a disapproval of that  authorization. It is a responsible proposal.   This Chamber agreed to pass these reforms on a bipartisan basis, and  I am offering even more opportunity to appeal to the concerns of my  colleagues than we have ever done. I would urge my colleagues to allow  me to get this bipartisan language passed so that we can concentrate on  other pressing matters.   I think it is important, and I can never miss an opportunity to talk  about what LWCF is. It is a popular and successful bipartisan program.  There is a House companion bill, which has 233 cosponsors. Let me say  that again: It has 233 cosponsors.   LWCF is a dedicated means for the conservation and protection of  America's irreplaceable natural, historic, cultural, and outdoor  landmarks. Over the 50-plus years of its history, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund has conserved iconic landscapes in every State and is  responsible for more than 42,000 State and local outdoor recreation  projects. It is far and away the Nation's most important conservation  program.   LWCF has protected places like the Great Smoky Mountains National  Park, Cape Lookout National Seashore, and the Blue Ridge Parkway  through the Federal programs and places like Whitehurst Forest, Camden  Community Park, and Four Mile Creek Greenway in Mecklenburg County  through State and local programs.   LWCF is already paid for by using a very small percentage of receipts  off of oil drilling revenues. Let me put that in layman's terms that  every Member of Congress can understand. It requires no taxpayer money.  We use a percentage of receipts that we collect off of exploration, and  that funds the Land and Water Conservation Trust.   I might add that this doesn't bypass appropriators. I will remind  everybody that I am not here amending an appropriations bill. This  requires appropriators on an annual basis to appropriate money. The  pot, though, is accrued based upon the royalties off of exploration, so  not a dime of taxpayer money is used.   I might also add that the current account balance for the Land and  Water Conservation Fund is $21 billion. This year, the Congress of the  United States will appropriate roughly $450 million. So if we were to  appropriate the same thing and never increase the size of the trust  fund, this program would run well over 30 years on the existing money  that is in the fund, assuming that there was no increase in the fund's  balance because of money it might make off of it.   LWCF helps make access for outdoorsmen easier by purchasing  inholdings and edge holdings. With changing land use and ownership  patterns, historic recreational access can be cut off or blocked in  many areas. Oftentimes, vast expanses of public land are separated from  roads and towns by narrow strips that are privately held, necessitating  a long drive to access hunting or fishing grounds only a few miles  away.   America's growing population needs more outdoor recreation and more  access opportunities, not fewer. If we want our children and  grandchildren to enjoy the same hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and  paddling opportunities we enjoy today, protection of habitat and  watersheds must keep pace with the growing population and development  pressures. This program is widely supported by the outdoor recreation  industry, conservationists, hunters, anglers, birdwatchers, and all who  appreciate access to America's unparalleled public assets. The U.S.  outdoor recreation economy generates $887 billion in consumer spending  and $65 billion in tax revenue.   North Carolina has received approximately $246.7 million in LWCF  funding over the past five decades. This is a newsletter I got in the  mail over the weekend from the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation. I want to  highlight a few things in this because this is all about the program.   The first one is the ``Community of Stewards'' thanking Project  Parkway volunteers, highlighting the effort where 200 volunteers  devoted their time to cleanup projects along the Blue Ridge Parkway.   ``High Pass Boogie riders'':         This spring's High Pass Boogie motorcycle event was a hit!       Riders enjoyed a weekend of fun and raised $13,000 for the       Parkway.    ``Happy Camper Memories.'' Here is an individual who, as a child,  actually spent her summers camping in the Blue Ridge Parkway, and this  is her story of what it meant to her. Talk about a generational impact.  It is right there.   ``Overlooks get a clear perspective.'' Some of my colleagues say this  empowers the Park Service--or somebody--and they limit access. I just  talked about how we are using this to expand access. But here is one  where the Park Service took on the opportunity, with private funding,  to begin to clear the view over overlooks so that people who ride down  the Blue Ridge Parkway can stop at the overlook and actually see the  beautiful land that is out there, where it had been encroached by scrub  trees. Some of my colleagues would never think that the Park Service  would go in and actually cut down something. Not only did they do it,  they did it with money that was donated to them by people who use the  park.   ``A Fresh Face for Flat Top.'' Flat Top is a property that, when the  Parkway was created in the 1950s under the jobs program, was a  residence that was absorbed into the park property. Hopefully, the  restoration on this will let this property last for another 100 years-- all driven with volunteer dollars, not with appropriations. We know the  backlog we have with maintenance needs on our parks.   The last one I will highlight is ``Farm Aid: Repairs to historical  structures at Humpback Rocks are underway.'' I will just read the last  sentence of the paragraph: ``This is a much needed transformation and a  great example of your donations at work!''   You see, this isn't something where we are trying to pull the wool  over the eyes of the American people. We are actually highlighting the  great things we have preserved, and we have an opportunity to use the  Land and Water Conservation Fund with zero taxpayer dollars to leverage  these private donations for projects like farm aid.   The last one: ``Leave Your Mark on the Mountains: Where there's a  will, there's a way.'' This basically says give to the Blue Ridge  Parkway Foundation.   I say to my colleagues, this makes such common sense to me. Across  this country, we have individual Americans who give of their own money,  not just to protect but to maintain these valuable pieces of land.  Here, we have an opportunity to use money that was designated over 50  years ago, authorized, that we accumulate in a pot, and we use that to  leverage the private donations. Maybe this is a model for us to look at  as to how we do park maintenance, where we might be able to leverage  more private sector dollars to help with park maintenance because this,  in essence, is maintenance, but it is also preservation of national  treasures.   The program has been so successful that just a decade after its  original enactment, Congress, in 1977, decided to triple its  authorization level to $900 million--the level it remains at today. Let  me just point out for my colleagues, it is authorized to be  appropriated, $900 million a year; it has $21 billion in its fund, and  this year we will appropriate about $455 million. I am not here to  fight an appropriations battle. I will save that for when we have  permanent reauthorization because I think it is high on the passion  list of many Members.   As of March 30, about $21.5 billion is in the LWCF fund. From 1965  through 2018, about $39.8 billion was credited to LWCF. Less than half  that amount, $18.4, has been appropriated.   I want every Member to understand what I am asking today. I am going  to ask unanimous consent that the Senate take up a bill with an hour  debate  [[Page S5801]]  and an up-or-down vote that does this: It permanently authorizes the  Land and Water Conservation Fund. It does not appropriate. It still  leaves up to appropriators the annual amount that is appropriated. The  language of this bill is a negotiated, bipartisan reform package led by  the chairman of the Energy Committee. Most importantly, to those who  have been uncomfortable with the extension of reauthorization in the  past, every 3 years the Congress is given the ability to pass a  disapproval for reauthorization, and if they collect those votes, the  program is not authorized.   I am not sure that we have left any concerns that have been raised  over the past year and a half out of the equation in this bill. I thank  the chairman of the Energy Committee for her diligent work at  negotiating the bipartisan language and her willingness to be  supportive of the reauthorization. I firmly believe that she will have  to object because, in some cases, that is your job when you chair a  committee. But before I make my unanimous consent request, I want to  make a promise to all the Members: If I have to come down here and do  this morning and afternoon, day after day after day, I will do it. I  have enough iterations of this bill that I can accommodate the concerns  anyone may have and find a way to get permanent authorization. It is  not because I want it; it is because the American people want it. It is  because the next generation deserves for us to do this. For some  unknown reason, a small number of people will not even allow a vote to  happen.                       Unanimous Consent Request--LWCF    Madam President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of my bill,  which is at the desk, in relation to LWCF; that there be 1 hour of  debate; and that the Senate vote on passage with no intervening action  or debate.
