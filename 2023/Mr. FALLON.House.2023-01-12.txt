 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a co-sponsor of Protecting  America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   China should not be the beneficiary of the Biden administration's  foolhardy abuse of the SPR. It was at 695 million barrels, and it goes  down to 371. That is halved, while the Chinese Communist Party has in  reserve nearly a billion.   This is foolhardy. This is an excellent piece of legislation, and I  urge swift passage. Let's put America first.
