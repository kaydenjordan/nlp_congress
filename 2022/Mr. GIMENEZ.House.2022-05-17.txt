 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the previous  question so that we can immediately consider H.R. 6858, the American  Energy Independence from Russia Act.   This administration's insistence on destroying our energy  independence has worsened the financial strain on American families,  who have already been burdened by crushing inflation under the Biden  administration, and weakened our national security posture by making us  more reliant on foreign sources of energy.   Thanks to the incompetence of the present administration and this  House's failure to secure America's energy independence, Americans are  left poorer, weaker, and with a bleaker outlook toward their future.   Mr. Speaker, it is pretty clear how we got to this point. The Biden  administration's efforts to weaken our Nation's energy security began  on their very first day in office when the President canceled the  Keystone XL pipeline. Since then, the administration has taken further  action to discourage domestic oil production by halting leases for  drilling on Federal lands, the latest of which came just last week when  the Biden administration canceled another round of contracts in Alaska.   These policies have forced our President to tap into the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve to keep gas prices from rising even more, but it is  not working.                                time  1315    At a time when Russia is fueling this barbaric violence on the  Ukrainian people through its gas exports, holding countries around the  world hostage due to their reliance on Russian oil, we need to ensure  the United States not only ends permanently all oil imports from  Russia, but that the United States has a sustained domestic supply to  supplant Russia as a leading net exporter of oil. America, and the  world, is safer when it is our country that is in charge of our own  destiny.   Passing the American Energy Independence from Russia Act will also  have a tremendous economic impact right here at home, at a time when  our fuel costs continue to skyrocket and hurt the pockets of the  American people. Instead of taking the commonsense approach put forward  by this legislation, the President and his allies in this House send  diplomats to negotiate with tyrants and dictators, sworn enemies of  America, such as Iran and Venezuela, seeking deals to import their oil  to the United States. Venezuela, in particular, which sits on the  world's largest known oil reserves, cannot even keep its own people fed  or electricity running due to the malice of its socialist and Russian- allied leadership.   Just today, we learned that the Biden administration is looking to  ease the sanctions on Venezuela in exchange for promises that the  Maduro regime will enter into dialogue with its opposition.  Unbelievable.   Let's end this nonsense and pass the American Energy Independence  from Russia Act. It is time the elected officials in this body, the  ones elected to represent the American people, stop doing the bidding  of our adversaries and promote domestic production of oil.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to move this extraordinarily  important measure forward for our families and for our country's  safety.
