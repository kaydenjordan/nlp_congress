 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the legislation  we are considering today.   In cities across America, violent crime has increased; and in cities  across America, laws already exist to severely punish violent  criminals. But despite this, we are seeing local elected officials,  district attorneys, and prosecutors refuse to enforce existing laws and  police who are continuously held back from doing their jobs.   Instead of offering real solutions to improve public safety, it seems  the majority is determined to punish law-abiding citizens while doing  nothing to actually close loopholes in the system.   If the bills we are considering were really stopping gun crimes and  violent offenders from owning guns, then my amendment would be one we  are discussing today, to prevent minors aged 15 to 17 who have  committed violent crimes from having their records expunged and thereby  able to purchase a firearm.   But rather than take up my amendment to prevent felons from  sidestepping our laws, the majority felt it more critical for public  safety to expand background checks to ranchers and farmers with pest  control issues. This is absurd.   Nothing in H.R. 1446 or H.R. 8 would prevent those seeking to harm  others from acquiring firearms. The people of my district deserve  better than this, which is why I will be introducing legislation that  will actually prevent violent criminals from clearing their record.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and side with  law-abiding Americans and side with those of us who want to take guns  out of the hands of violent criminals.
