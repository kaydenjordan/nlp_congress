 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I have proposed to the Lower Energy  Costs Act will help Congress identify harmful regulations that have  shut down American energy and increased costs on all Americans. This  amendment instructs the EPA to identify and access existing regulations  that have negatively impacted the United States' energy independence  and energy security.   This amendment will provide transparency about the actions taken by  the Biden administration to increase regulatory burdens for energy  producers, diminish energy output for the United States, and raise the  cost of energy for all Americans.   I grew up working in the west Texas oil fields, so I know firsthand  that the best thing we can do for energy producers in our country is to  get the Federal Government out of the way and reduce the number of  burdensome regulations.   Unfortunately, from day one, President Biden has waged war on  American energy and done everything in his power to undo all the  incredible work of the Trump administration to make our country energy  independent.   Since January 2021, the EPA has recklessly issued new rules and  regulations with no regard for their adverse effects on Americans and  our energy security.   They have continued to diminish America's energy independence and  take aim at America's interests and citizens without meaningful  consultation with industry leaders or a logical plan to move forward.                                time  1630    It is time we identify the EPA regulations that have played a direct  role in shutting down our energy production and added additional  expenses to the already burdensome day-to-day cost of living for  Americans.   As many of my Republican colleagues have mentioned, H.R. 1 is just  the beginning of our work on critical energy solutions that will lift  the red tape and expand the production of affordable and reliable  energy rather than hamstring our domestic producers.   The underlying bill is a strong piece of legislation that will reduce  our dangerous dependence on foreign energy sources and get us back on  track to putting America first.   My amendment strengthens an already good bill and will allow Congress  to pinpoint EPA regulations that negatively impact American families,  small businesses, the agriculture industry, and our national security.   We must show Americans that we will not stand by while the EPA puts  the needs of the environmental special interest groups ahead of the  needs of the American people.   While some may wrongfully speak out against H.R. 1, this is an  incredibly strong bill, and it is only the beginning of what the House  majority is going to accomplish to unleash American energy.   My amendment is a commonsense addition to the bill, and it instructs  the EPA to conduct an after-action review to make sure we are doing  what is in the best interests of our country.   I urge every Member in this body to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Self).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the support of my  colleagues on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
