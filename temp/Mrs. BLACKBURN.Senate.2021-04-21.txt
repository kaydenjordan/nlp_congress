 Mr. President, here we are again, teeing up another  discharge motion for another unqualified Biden administration nominee.   If there is one good thing I can say about Colin Kahl, the nominee  for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, it is that you never have to  wonder where he stands on the issues. He is very consistent.   Unfortunately, he has been consistently wrong on some of the last  decade's most important foreign policy questions.   In 2019, when disaster struck all along on our southern border, he  labeled the situation ``Trump's fake border crisis'' and ``a phony  terrorism threat.'' That is a take that aged well, to be sure.   His judgment calls on the actions and motivations of our most  dangerous adversaries have also been particularly terrible.   When President Trump warned the Iranian regime not to resume their  nuclear activities, Kahl declared that ``war drums'' were already  sounding. We know that wasn't true.   When President Trump made the decision to eliminate terrorist leader  Soleimani, Kahl was positive that the strike had started a war. It  hadn't. When I questioned Kahl during his confirmation hearings, he  equated Iranian proxies killing Americans with our subsequent,  proportionate strike against Solemani, saying, ``There were  provocations on both sides.'' Indeed.   Kahl was absolutely sure that given the chance, John Bolton, of all  people, would twist available intelligence and singlehandedly start  wars with Iran and North Korea. Another miss.   He also predicted that Trump would jump into Syria and start a war  with Assad and the Russians, which also didn't happen.   Those hot takes earned him a lot of ink in Foreign Policy magazine  but not a lot of respect. I don't know if he wrote those things because  he wanted to put President Trump in the hot seat or because he honestly  believed them, but I don't think the answer to that question matters.   If he believed them, then it is proof of his terrible judgment.   If he wrote them to inflame the progressive base, it is proof he is  willing to trivialize the prospect of armed conflict for clicks.   How in the world can President Biden expect us to vote for that?   In addition to his poor judgment, Mr. Kahl has also attached himself  to truly terrible policy decisions.   He opposed bipartisan legislation that would have imposed sanctions  on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.   He staffed the effort to condemn Israel at the United Nations  Security Council.   He is ``open'' to moving away from the nuclear triad.   Perhaps worst of all, when he served in the Obama administration as  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, he dropped  the ball on a status of forces agreement that would have allowed U.S.  forces to remain in Iraq.   That failure led to the rise of ISIS.   I have examined Mr. Kahl's record and found nothing but a history of  bad policy judgment, a volatile disposition, and a terrible temper that  manifests in inflammatory rhetoric.   That might be a great resume for a pundit, but it is not the body of  work I want to see from someone who will be responsible for developing  national security and defense strategy.   I oppose this discharge motion, I oppose this nomination, and I urge  my colleagues to spend a few minutes with Mr. Kahl's resume before  placing him in such a powerful position at DOD.                            ____________________
