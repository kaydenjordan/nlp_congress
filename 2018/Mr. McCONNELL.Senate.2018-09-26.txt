 Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the Senate and the  American people will hear from Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine  Blasey Ford under oath. We will hear sworn testimony from both of them  regarding the allegation of 30-plus-year-old misconduct that Dr. Ford  has raised.   It goes without saying, but it bears repeating: Sexual assault is  completely abhorrent. Everyone deserves to be safe. So I am glad Dr.  Ford will be heard.   I would like to particularly thank Chairman Grassley, who worked  tirelessly to establish a fair process and a secure, comfortable  setting for this to take place. He gave Dr. Ford the opportunity to  testify in public or in private or to speak with investigators who  would meet her anywhere she wished or to conduct the entire interview  by phone. He has brought a patient professionalism to this process--one  that stands in stark contrast to those on the other side of the aisle  who self-describe as ``Spartacus'' and play to the television cameras.  Dr. Ford will be heard, thanks to Chairman Grassley and despite the  irresponsibility of Senate Democrats, who ignored her allegation for  weeks and then discarded her request for confidentiality and leaked it  to the press.   Let me walk you through this again. The ranking Democrat on the  Judiciary Committee received a letter from Dr. Ford all the way back in  July in which she stated her allegation and asked for confidentiality.  That was in July. The committee's thorough review of Judge Kavanaugh  was just getting started. There was ample time to vet this allegation  in a serious and bipartisan manner that would have maintained  confidentiality and honored Dr. Ford's request for privacy.   All the Democrats needed to do was go through proper channels and  share the information with their Republican colleagues so the committee  could tackle it together, but that is not what Senate Democrats did.  This is the Democratic caucus whose leader, my friend the senior  Senator from New York, said just hours after Judge Kavanaugh was  nominated that he would ``oppose him with everything I've got.'' This  was just hours after the nomination. This is the Democratic caucus of  which several Members preemptively announced fill-in-the-blank  opposition to any nominee before  [[Page S6314]]  Judge Kavanaugh had even been named. This is the Democratic caucus that  spent all summer searching for reasons to delay, delay, delay this  nomination. This was because there were not enough documents, because  there were too many documents, because of unrelated headlines--you name  it.    No, these Democratic colleagues did not treat Dr. Ford or her  allegation with the seriousness and discretion she deserved.  Apparently, they took no meaningful action for weeks with respect to  her claim. Then, finally, at the eleventh hour, when its introduction  was virtually certain to introduce further delay, they got it to the  press. So much for Dr. Ford's request for confidentiality, I guess.   What lessons can we draw from all of this? If you write to the Senate  Democrats in complete confidence about an extremely sensitive matter,  you will soon wind up a household name. If you are a public servant  whose confirmation those on the far left happen to oppose because they  dislike the fact that you will interpret the law and the Constitution  according to what they mean rather than what those on the far left wish  they would mean, they will not hesitate to weaponize uncorroborated  allegations and drag your name and your family right through the mud.  That is what these guys will do to you--uncorroborated allegations,  which Judge Kavanaugh has denied repeatedly in the strongest terms in  public and to the Senate investigators, all under penalty of felony.   Let's not forget that Dr. Ford's account identifies three other  supposed witnesses, and each of these individuals has denied  participation in or recollection of any such event--also under penalty  of felony in all cases. One of the alleged witnesses is a longtime  friend of Dr. Ford's. She has stated not only that she does not recall  any such party but that she doesn't even know Judge Kavanaugh. No  corroboration. No supporting evidence before us. Just Dr. Ford's  allegation.   By any normal standard of American justice, this is nowhere near  enough to destroy someone's reputation or nullify one's career, but  some of our colleagues are trying to move the goalposts.   The junior Senator from Delaware asserted recently on television that  it is Judge Kavanaugh who bears the burden of disproving these  allegations. Let me say that again. The junior Senator from Delaware  said Judge Kavanaugh bears the burden of disproving these allegations.  Guilty until proven innocent--in our country?   Similarly, the junior Senator from Hawaii has implied that Judge  Kavanaugh does not deserve a presumption of innocence. The junior  Senator from Hawaii has said that Judge Kavanaugh does not deserve a  presumption of innocence because she does not agree with his judicial  philosophy.   Just yesterday, the Democratic leader said that because we aren't in  a criminal courtroom, ``there's no presumption of innocence or guilt  here when you have a nominee before you.'' In America, somebody is  saying that? Well, it will not surprise you to know the Democrats  haven't always taken that position.   Back in 1991, when our friend Senator Joe Biden was chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, he had this to say to Judge Clarence Thomas when  the committee was evaluating an allegation against him.   Joe Biden said:         The presumption is with you. With me, the presumption is       with you, and in my opinion it should be with you until all       the evidence is in and people make a judgment.    That was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Joe Biden, during  the Clarence Thomas proceeding.   My colleagues would do well to remember this commonsense principle.  After all, this is America. Every American understands the presumption  of innocence.   I am glad that Chairman Grassley, his staff, and committee  investigators have worked so hard to clean up this mess and put  together a fair process. I am encouraged by the committee's choice of  Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor with decades of experience in  sensitive investigations, who was recognized with an award by Arizona's  then-Democratic Governor, Janet Napolitano, to lend expertise to this  important process.   It is time for Senators to hear from both Dr. Ford and Judge  Kavanaugh under oath. Tomorrow, we will do just that. Then it will be  time to vote.
