 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4502.  This appropriations minibus makes historic critical investments in  North Carolina's Sixth District and in all of our communities.   This bill invests in new jobs and the future of our workforce with  $11.6 billion for the Employment and Training Administration at the  Department of Labor.   It creates greater opportunities for students to succeed with  increased funding for title 1 grants, HBCUs, and primarily minority- serving colleges and universities, and an increase in Pell grants.   It provides much-needed funding for the health, equity, safety, and  well-being of our communities with funds for public health  infrastructure, maternal and child health, and mental health. It also  takes long overdue action to defend health and reproductive rights by  repealing the discriminatory Hyde and Weldon amendments.  [[Page H4063]]    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill to  support the needs of families and communities across the country.                                time  1730
