 Mr. Speaker, we need to make it easier, not harder, for  eligible voters to make their voices heard in our elections. We need to  make sure that voting is accessible to everyone, whether they want to  go to the polls, vote early, or vote by mail.   In Congress, there is so much we can do to make it easier for people  to vote and participate in our democracy. It starts with passing the  John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. These  commonsense bills would end partisan gerrymandering, expand voting by  mail, protect early voting, help get big money out of our elections,  combat dark money, support election integrity, and make additional  reforms to improve ballot access.                                time  1045    It is time to put politics aside and get these commonsense bills  across the finish line. I will continue to do everything I can to  protect the right to vote and work to make it easier for people to vote  and to participate in our democracy.             Congratulating Mayor Ken Marshburn on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and celebrate the exemplary  service of Mayor Ken Marshburn, a distinguished leader and devoted  public servant to the town of Garner.   During his time in office, Mayor Marshburn has worked tirelessly  alongside council members, town staff, and community leaders to enhance  the quality of life in Garner. He has an unwavering belief in Garner's  potential and has always worked to make Garner a place where people can  not only live but also thrive.   Mayor Marshburn's leadership is coming to an end today with our  elections in Garner. He has steered Garner toward a positive and  prosperous future. His commitment to fiscal responsibility has laid a  solid foundation for the town's growth, attracting new businesses that  enrich our economic diversity. His legacy is one of leadership,  service, and unwavering dedication to our community.   I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Mayor Ken Marshburn for  his unwavering commitment and invaluable contributions to the town of  Garner and extending our best wishes to him and his family as they  embark on this well-deserved retirement.   Our community is richer and brighter due to his leadership and  service. I again thank Mayor Marshburn for his service.                         Fighting Hatred in All Forms     Mr. Speaker, in North Carolina last year, anti-Semitic  incidents increased by 30 percent. The ongoing conflict in Israel has  led to even more anti-Semitic attacks both in the U.S. and around the  world.   Just this week, the ADL's Center on Extremism reported a nearly 400  percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents compared to the same period  last year. The situation has been even worse since Hamas launched a  brutal and calculated attack against Jewish people and the State of  Israel on October 7.   In New York, Jewish students at Cooper Union College were forced to  shelter inside the school library on Wednesday for their own safety  during a campus protest. In Indianapolis, a woman deliberately crashed  her car into the building of what she believed was a pro-Jewish  organization.   Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to remain vigilant against anti- Semitism, discrimination, and prejudice. Let's work to fight hatred in  all forms and ensure that the scourge of anti-Semitism does not rear  its ugly head both at home and abroad.                        Avoiding a Government Shutdown     Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss our core job here in  Congress, funding the Federal Government. We have 10 days until a  government shutdown. Mr. Speaker, I will say that again, 10 days, just  over a week until the government runs out of money.   A government shutdown would hurt the economy, risk our national  security, and would be a disaster for North Carolina. Hundreds of  thousands of people would be put on temporary leave without pay or be  forced to work without pay. Essential staff--like our TSA agents, air  traffic controllers, and many others--would be required to work without  pay through the duration of any shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, there is only one path forward, and that is  bipartisanship. Republicans have a very narrow majority in the House.  Democrats have a very narrow majority in the Senate. We have the White  House, but we have to work together.   Right now there is no plan to fund our government, and we have to do  it next week. This needs to be a priority for this body, for this  institution, and we have to do our job. The American people expect us  to fund the government, and right now there is no plan to do that.   A shutdown will cost taxpayers money. It will hit our economy hard.  My constituents are hit hard right now with the rising cost of  inflation, the high cost of mortgages, and the continuing costs that  hit hard, whether it is childcare or healthcare. A shutdown would be an  incredible unforced error at this time.   Mr. Speaker, we need to fund the government.                            ____________________
