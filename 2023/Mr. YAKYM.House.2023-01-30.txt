 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a special group of  Hoosiers who recently made their hometown very proud.   Earlier this month, the Mishawaka Cavemen won the 3A State title in  wrestling for the fourth time in school history. Their return as State  champions was 13 years in the making for the Cavemen, and it wasn't  easy.   To take home the title, the Cavemen first had to go through the  defending State champs, Columbus East, which they did on their way to  an exhilarating 43-31 win.   As Head Coach Steve Sandefer said: ``You have to wrestle for the guy  next to you.'' I think that is the kind of team-first mindset that  every wrestler embraced wholeheartedly. It is a big part of why they  and the Mishawaka community are celebrating. I know it is an attitude  that will serve these young men well in their future careers and family  lives.   I know one more thing. That approach of rallying to pick up a  teammate when they are down is something that our country could use a  whole lot more of.   Congratulations to Coach Sandefer, his dedicated staff, and all the  wrestlers on their big win.   God bless you. Go Cavemen.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
