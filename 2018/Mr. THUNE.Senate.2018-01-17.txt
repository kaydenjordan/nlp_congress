 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                                  Tax Reform     Mr. President, tax reform has been the law of the land for  less than a month, but it is already fostering a new era of economic  optimism, and American workers are seeing the benefits. For years,  American businesses, large and small, were weighed down by high tax  rates and growth-killing provisions of the Tax Code. Plus, our outdated  international tax rules left America's global businesses at a  competitive disadvantage in the global economy.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed all that. We lowered tax rates  across  [[Page S228]]  the board for owners of small- and medium-sized businesses, farms, and  ranches. We expanded business owners' ability to recover investments  they make in their businesses, which will free up cash they can  reinvest in their operations and their workers. We lowered our Nation's  massive corporate tax rate, which up until January 1 was the highest  corporate tax rate in the developed world. We brought the U.S.  international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our  outdated worldwide system with what is called a territorial tax system  so American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to  their foreign competitors.   Despite the fact that the new law has been in place for less than a  month, it is already having a noticeable effect. Businesses are seeing  a future defined by growth and success, and they are already passing  some of the expected benefits on to their workers. Business after  business has announced special bonuses, wage hikes, or benefit  increases: AT&T, Bank of America, Comcast, American Airlines,  Southwest, Visa, Nationwide Insurance, Jet Blue, and the list goes on  and on.   In addition to giving out bonuses to eligible employees, Walmart is  raising its starting wage for hourly employees, expanding maternity and  parental leave benefits, and creating a new adoption benefit for  employees. More than 1 million Walmart employees will benefit from the  changes.   Aflac is boosting retirement benefits for its workers by increasing  the size of its 401(k) match from 50 to 100 percent on the first 4  percent of employees' contributions. It has also announced a onetime  $500 contribution to the retirement account of every employee.   PNC is giving a $1,000 bonus to 90 percent of its employees and  adding $1,500 to employees' pension accounts. It is also boosting its  minimum pay.   Similarly, Great Western Bank, which is headquartered in my State of  South Dakota, is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour and providing  a $500 bonus or wage increase for nearly 70 percent of its workforce.  The bank is also enhancing its employee healthcare program and doubling  its annual contribution to its Making Life Great Grants community  reinvestment program.   I could go on, but the good news is not limited to increased wages,  bonuses, and benefits, as important as that is, particularly to people  who are living paycheck to paycheck, but companies are also acting to  keep jobs and to create new ones.   Fiat Chrysler just announced it will be adding 2,500 jobs at a  Michigan factory to produce pickups it has been making in Mexico. In  October, CVS Health announced it would create 3,000 new jobs if the  corporate tax rate was reduced. In my own backyard, Molded Fiber Glass  is keeping its doors open longer than expected, which is good news for  its employees and the entire community of Aberdeen, SD.   Then there are the utility companies. Utilities from around the  country are benefiting from tax reform, and more than one is looking to  pass on savings to consumers. Bloomberg reports that ``Exelon Corp.,  the biggest U.S. utility owner by sales, is already offering to reduce  bills.'' In Illinois, ComEd is requesting permission to ``pass along  approximately $200 million in tax savings to its customers in 2018.''  In Washington DC, Pepco has announced plans to pass on tax savings to  customers beginning in the first quarter of this year.   All these benefits are going to make a real difference in families'  lives this year and, in some cases, well into the future, and the main  benefits of tax reform are still to come. The IRS just released the new  withholding tables for the tax law, and Americans should start seeing  the results in February. Thanks to lower income tax rates, the doubling  of the standard deduction, and the doubling of the child tax credit, 90  percent of American workers--90 percent--should see bigger paychecks  starting next month, and that is just the beginning.   One major goal of tax reform was to provide immediate, direct relief  to hard-working Americans, and that is happening right now, but our  other goal was to create the kind of robust, long-term economic growth  that will provide long-term security for American families. That is  already starting with the wave of bonuses and wage increases, but there  is a lot more to come.   As businesses, large and small, experience the benefits of tax  reform, American workers will see the benefits of tax reform. American  workers will see increased access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and  opportunities that will secure the American dream for the long term.   It is a good day in America, and it is going to get even better.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
