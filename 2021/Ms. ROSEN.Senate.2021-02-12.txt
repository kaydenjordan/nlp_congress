 And I'll have lots of fights ahead of us, and       I'm ready to stand up and keep fighting.        We're going to fight.        We're going to fight.        And we need to fight.        Fight.        We need to fight.        We got a few more fights. I'm going to take the privilege       of a few more fights.        And we have the biggest fight of all. I will never stop       fighting. I will fight like hell to fight back against       anyone.         To fight.         I will fight like hell.         To fight.         Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada    Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada, Senator Rosen,  submits a question for the House managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         On January 6, the anti-Semitic Proud Boys group that       President Trump had told to stand by, laid siege to the       Capitol alongside other rioters, including one wearing a       ``Camp Auschwitz'' shirt. Is there evidence that President       Trump knew or should have known that his tolerance of anti-      Semitic hate speech, combined with his own rhetoric, could       incite the kind of violence we saw on January 6?    Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Mr. President, Senators, Donald Trump has a  long history of praising and encouraging violence, as you saw. He has  espoused hateful rhetoric himself. He has not just tolerated it, but he  has encouraged hateful speech by others. He has refused, as you saw in  the September debate--that interview--to condemn extremists and White  supremacist groups, like the Proud Boys, and he has, at every  opportunity, encouraged and cultivated actual violence by these groups.   Yes, he has encouraged actual violence, not just the word ``fight.''  He told groups like the Proud Boys, who had beaten people with baseball  bats, to stand by.   When his supporters in the 50-car caravan tried to drive a bus of  Biden campaign workers off the road, he tweeted a video of that  incident with fight music attached to it and wrote: ``I LOVE TEXAS!''   When his supporters sent death threats to the Republican Secretary of  State Raffensperger in Georgia, he responded by calling Mr.  Raffensperger an enemy of the state, after he knew of those death  threats.   And in the morning of the second Million MAGA March, when it erupted  in violence and burned churches, he began that day with the tweet: ``We  have just begun to fight.''   I want to be clear that Donald Trump is not on trial for those prior  statements--however as hateful and violent and inappropriate as they  may be. But  [[Page S684]]  his statements, the President's statements make absolutely clear three  important points for our case.   First, President Trump had a pattern and practice of praising and  encouraging violence, never condemning it. It is not a coincidence that  those very same people--Proud Boys, organizers of the Trump caravan,  supporters and speakers of the second Million MAGA March--all showed up  on January 6 to an event that he had organized with those same  individuals who had organized that violent attack.   Second, his behavior is different. It is not just that it was a  comment by an official to fight for a cause. This is months of  cultivating a base of people who were violent--not potentially violent  but were violent--and that their prior conduct both helped him  cultivate the very group of people that attacked us; it also shows  clearly that he had that group assembled, inflamed, and, in all the  public reports, ready to attack. He deliberately encouraged them to  engage in violence on January 6.   President Trump had spent months calling supporters to a march on a  specific day, at a specific time, for a specific purpose. What else  were they going to do to stop the certification of the election on that  day but to stop you--but to stop you physically? There was no other  way, particularly after his Vice President said that he would refuse to  do what the President asked.   The point is this: that by the time he called the cavalry--not  calvary but cavalry--of his thousands of supporters on January 6, an  event he had invited them to, he had every reason to know that they  were armed, violent, and ready to actually fight.   He knew who he was calling and the violence they were capable of, and  he still gave his marching orders to go to the Capitol and ``fight like  hell'' to stop the steal. How else was that going to happen? If they  had stayed at the Ellipse, maybe it would have just been to violently-- to fight in protest with their words. But to come to the Capitol?   That is why this is different, and that is why he must be convicted  and acquitted--and disqualified.
