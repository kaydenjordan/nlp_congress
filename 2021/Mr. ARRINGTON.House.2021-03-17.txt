 Mr. Speaker, I stand here on behalf of the freedom- loving members of the Republican Study Committee, the conservative  conscience of the GOP Conference, and the largest caucus with over 150  members and our friend and fearless leader   Jim Banks from the Hoosier  State.   Mr. Speaker, we come to this Chamber with grave concerns, with  profound grief over what is happening to this great Nation at the  southern border, along the border of States like my home State of  Texas. My citizens are on the front lines, and the citizens of the Lone  Star State and border States are at ground zero of this self-inflicted  crisis.   Just because the President won't acknowledge that there is a crisis  doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Mr. Speaker, it is raging out of  control. It is an unmitigated disaster, and as I said, it is self- inflicted.   Reinstating catch and release while we are recovering from a  pandemic? Are you kidding me? We have put mandates and restrictions on  the American people who have sacrificed by staying at home. Some have  lost their jobs. They don't know how they are going to make ends meet  for their family.   Everybody stepped up, Mr. Speaker. They did what they were told to do  in some cases, but they all acted responsibly for the sake of our  country and their fellow man and the country that they love. And now,  we are just letting people cross our border illegally, violate our  sovereignty, break our laws, and then just be released into the  interior of our country with no testing and no screening.   In Texas, Mr. Speaker, we are coming back. We have folks back to  work. Kids are in school. My kids are in school. We feel normal again,  and we are blessed to be in a State that puts a premium on individual  liberty and personal responsibility. We have worked hard to get to  where we are now.   We didn't like everything that was done to us by our government. We  didn't like all the protocols and mandates, but we did the best job we  could for the sake of our fellow Americans. Now, we have the potential  for a flare-up in the pandemic because our hospitals are going to be  overwhelmed again.   Our schools are already overwhelmed as they try to do right by their  students, let them come into the classroom, have that support  structure, knowing that to close your doors on these kids is to close a  bright future for them. It is to lock them out of their greatest  potential and to give them grief and all kinds of heartache and mental  health concerns.   We have our police, who have been disparaged with cries to defund the  police. They would be dismantled if the bill that passed the House  supported by the Democrats ever became law and ripped away the tools  that they have to not only keep our community safe but to protect them  in the process. We have stripped them--or would if the bill passed--of  their legal liability protections. All the while, we are putting more  pressure on our local law enforcement to do the job that the Federal  Government under this Commander in Chief has failed to do.   The Commander in Chief is supposed to provide for the common defense.  He is supposed to be the exemplar for rule of law. He is the chief  enforcer of the law. What kind of example is our President setting to  just throw caution to the wind and let folks come into this country who  are not our citizens, prioritizing them over the safety and health of  our citizens?   I got to hear some of my colleagues express concerns over women's  rights and protecting women from abuse. We all support that, and our  hearts go out to any victims of abuse in this country or any country.  But meanwhile, because of the policies that have been passed by this  President, reinstating catch and release, empowering sanctuary cities,  repealing the stay in Mexico policies, halting funding for the border  wall, all of these things have sent a message that we are open for  illegal business.   If you ask the cartels, business has never been better. We are lining  their pockets while they exploit vulnerable people who are hopeless.  They are being exploited.   Mr. Speaker, one out of every three women are sexually assaulted on  their trek to this country. That statistic is from Doctors Without  Borders. Children are used as a passport, trafficked by these cartels.  We have empowered these cartels. This is a disaster on so many levels,  and I am glad my colleagues are here to express these same sentiments  in their own words.   Mr. Speaker, I will end with this. It is clear there is a cause and  effect here. It is clear that policies have consequences. They incent  behavior, and the behavior is causing chaos at the border.    I believe this President is obsessed. This is just a fundamental  question, why our President would allow this to happen. I believe he is  obsessed with undoing anything that has the name ``President Trump'' on  it, regardless of its merits. I believe he is equally obsessed with  placating the left and their radical agenda. I have come to that  conclusion.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to speak to this. We are going to tell the  truth. We are going to lay out the facts. We are going to call on our  President to do the right thing and prioritize the American people and  their safety and security.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  his remarks. He talked about the incentives. We talked about cause and  effect, and we talked about the consequences of bad policies.   Mr. Speaker, we have had double the apprehensions this year in  January over last year in 2020, well over twice as many illegal  crossings in the month of February. We are now 5,000-plus a day of  people pouring into this country, 500 a day of illegal minors  trafficked here by the cartels. And the CBP tells us that there will be  over 120,000 by the end of the year. It will be a record year. Those  are the results. And the facts don't lie, whether this President or our  colleagues believe it or not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Texas  (Mr. Babin), who represents Texas 36th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  remarks. He mentioned as one of the policies that this current  President has put in place through a unilateral action--by the way, he  has done more executive orders than the last three or four Presidents  combined--was to repeal or rescind the national emergency declaration.  But it is so rich, so rich that at the same time he is doing this, the  Democrat leadership of the House under Speaker Pelosi has lined the  streets around the perimeter of the Capitol with the National Guard.  The height of hypocrisy.   Mr. Speaker, the American people aren't buying this. They are not.  The Speaker called the walls at the southern border protecting our  fellow Americans and communities immoral, until she erected razor-wire  fencing around the people's House. It is offensive. It is shameful, and  it is an outrage. And it is a double standard, if I have ever seen one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern), a  good friend of mine, and a colleague representing Oklahoma's First  District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, our  neighbor to the north, for his remarks. He mentioned that some  political opportunists were characterizing these detention facilities  under the leadership of President Trump as concentration camps. They  called the men and women in uniform, our sons and daughters, who were  called to duty to come alongside the Border Patrol agents to secure our  southern border and defend our people, ``storm troopers.'' They  referred to our attempt to humanely and safely detain the unaccompanied  minors as ``kids in cages.''   Mr. Speaker, where are they now? Where are they now?   Where is the outrage?   Where is the indignation?   Where is the name calling?   How soon we forget.   Mr. Speaker, 13,000 children are being detained right now in far  worse conditions and far more crowded than before.   Where are those colleagues of ours that were clanging gongs and  sounding the alarm?                                time  2100    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany), my colleague, who represents the Seventh  Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, listening to the gentleman, it is just  hard to believe that in the greatest country on planet Earth, that this  is what we are allowing to happen. Reimporting people who violated our  laws, had due process, and we did what the law says, detain and deport.   Today, under Present Biden's deluge of executive orders, they are  released and rewarded: free healthcare, compliments of the taxpayers of  the United States; free education, compliments of the taxpayers of the  United States. We spend $12 billion in Texas alone on illegal  immigration, and the price has just  [[Page H1492]]  climbed higher and higher under this President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Bishop), my dear friend, representing the Ninth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North  Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would say that America is the most generous  Nation, not only the most powerful, but the most generous. We represent  5 percent of the world population, and we represent 20 percent of the  immigrant population. We welcome freedom-loving, law-abiding people who  want to make America their home and make a better life for their  family, but only if they respect our laws and our sovereignty and the  safety of the American people.   Millions of people wait for years to have legal status in this  country, and this President has just created lawlessness and chaos,  just like that, with a pen and a cell phone. The unilateral actions  have been reckless and endangered not only our citizens, but the poor  people that are making this trek on account of his message: Don't come  now, is what he says, but come now. Come one, come all. It is a free- for-all at the border, is what his policies say loudly and clearly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my dear friend from the great State of  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), he represents Arkansas' Fourth Congressional  District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for  his heartfelt comments.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, as you have heard from my colleagues,  there are many levels and dimensions to this crisis. It is a national  security crisis, Mr. Speaker. It is a public health and safety crisis.  It is a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions, and it is only going  to get worse until this President embraces the reality, resists the  left's influence, and steps up and becomes the leader that our country  needs at a time like this.   I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for joining us in this Special  Order.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman),  who represents Wisconsin's Sixth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for  his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I think that this administration and our current  President, Joe Biden, would do well to take a page out of President  Trump's playbook, and I mean this with all sincerity.   The reason people by the millions followed this unconventional,  nonpolitician businessman and leader is because they were convinced he  would fight for them. It is because they watched as he followed through  on what he promised he would do for them. And lastly, Mr. Speaker, it  is because he put America first.   Perfect he was not, but I will tell you what, Mr. Speaker, with every  fiber of his being and ounce of strength in every waking moment, he was  vigilant in keeping those promises, and one of them was to secure the  border and stop illegal immigration once and for all.   Politicians have come and gone. They have made the same promises but  to no avail. President Trump reduced illegal crossings by 75 percent.   We know what to do in this Chamber. We know the policies that would  work to protect our fellow Americans, secure our border, and stop this  chaos and madness that has ensued as a result of these reckless,  unilateral decisions that this President is making.   We know what to do, Mr. Speaker, but there is no political will to do  it. The message, as we have said, is clear. It is demoralizing and  insulting that the leadership of this administration and our Commander  in Chief have prioritized illegal immigrants over our own citizens.   I am wearing a mask in the people's House. Most of our colleagues,  Mr. Speaker, have been vaccinated or have had COVID. We have social  distancing, and we are still wearing masks. What a pathetic posture as  we just release hundreds every day, thousands upon  [[Page H1494]]  thousands--some say the infection rate is upward of 20 percent--into  the interior of our country and into our communities while we the  American people have spent trillions of dollars and made untold  sacrifices to help our country get back to its feet. It is just  unbelievable.   Those poor Border Patrol agents, who have had to hear that they too  should be defunded, are hamstrung, at best. They see the revolving  door.   How would you like to go to work every day, Mr. Speaker, with a clear  mission, and a righteous and patriotic mission, to secure the border  and protect your citizens and have a Commander in Chief who says come  one, come all, and has such little regard for the rule of law and for  those who risk their lives every day to enforce it?   These are just the cold, hard facts. It is the truth. I believe, and  always have, in the American people's good judgment. While some folks  may have had an aversion to the style and personality of the last  President--I can appreciate that--they have to look back and say that  he achieved unprecedented results that left this Nation safer,  stronger, and more prosperous than we have been in recent history, if  ever.   Mr. Speaker, I pray our country will return to that level of  strength, and I pray this President will embrace the facts and reality.  I hope he comes to visit border States like Texas and listens to the  cries that have gone unheard from his administration, from the people  of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California, and throughout this land who  need him to step up and be our Commander in Chief.   Mr. Speaker, I am done, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
