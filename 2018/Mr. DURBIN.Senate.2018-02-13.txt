Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, we are in the midst of debate in the  Senate on the issue of immigration. It is the first time in 5 years we  have taken up this issue. There are many compelling reasons for us to  get this right.   On September 5, President Trump announced that he was going to end  the DACA Program, a program created by an Executive order of President  Obama's that protects 780,000 young people who are undocumented in the  United States. The elimination of that program officially on March 5-- just a few weeks away--will mean that these young people and many just  like them will be subject to deportation and no longer allowed to  legally work in the United States.   President Trump challenged Congress to do something about it, to pass  a law. As you can see, more than 5 months have passed, and we haven't  done that. But we have a chance this week to get it right. We have a  chance to make this work.   This morning, I come to the floor for a brief time to tell the story  of two young women. The first one is named Tereza Lee. Tereza Lee is  the reason for the DREAM Act, which is legislation I introduced 17  years ago.   Tereza was born in Brazil. Her parents were from Korea, but they  traveled to Brazil first. She was brought to the United States at the  age of 2 and made it to Chicago, IL.   Her father wanted to be a Protestant minister and to start a church.  That was his dream, and he worked at it. They were a poor family. They  didn't have much money to start with, but he pursued his dream. He  gathered some people together in church settings.   Her mother went to work at a drycleaners in Chicago, which is not  uncommon. The vast majority of drycleaning establishments in that city  are run and owned by Korean families. It is a hard job, a lot of hours,  but she was prepared to work to feed her family and to raise Tereza and  her brothers and sisters.   During the course of her father's ministry, Tereza started banging  away at an old piano at the back of the church and fell in love with  the instrument. Someone gave her family a discarded piano, and she  spent hours each day practicing. She signed up for something called the  Merit Music Program in Chicago, which is available for kids in public  schools who can't afford lessons, and she developed her skill as a  pianist. At the point she reached high school, she actually was playing  with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. People took notice of it and said:  Tereza, you have to go forward with this amazing skill of yours and  apply to the best music schools. She did. She applied to the Juilliard  School of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and she was  accepted.   She did run into a problem. When it came time to fill out the forms  to go to school, there was a section where she had to declare her  nationality or citizenship.   She said to her mom: What do I put here?   Her mom said: I don't know. We brought you here on a visitor's visa,  and we never filed any more papers.   Technically, Tereza was an undocumented person in America. She didn't  have legal status. So she contacted our office and asked what she could  do. That was 17 years ago. We took a look at the law, and the law is  pretty brutal for those who are undocumented in this country. It  basically said to this 18-year-old girl: You have to leave the United  States for 10 years and petition to come back in and apply for green  card status and citizenship. Ten years? Brought here at the age of 2,  she was banished by our laws in the United States and given no future.   That is when I introduced the DREAM Act--for her initially but for  many others in similar circumstances, kids who are brought here to  America as infants and toddlers, young children, young teenagers who  had no home, who had no country. They go to our public  [[Page S891]]  schools and pledge allegiance to the same flag we pledge allegiance to  every morning, but there is no legal status for them.   The story has a happy ending for Tereza Lee. Even though the DREAM  Act is not the law of the land, benefactors stepped forward and paid  for her education at the Manhattan School of Music, and she ended up  with a Ph.D. in music. She ended up playing piano in Carnegie Hall. She  is now married and because of that marriage has become a legal citizen  of the United States and is the mother of two.   That is the story of Tereza Lee, a Korean-American young woman who,  in her way, with her musical skill, makes America a better nation.   There is another Korean-American girl I would like to salute as well.  Her face may be more familiar. In 1982, a Korean immigrant came to the  United States. He didn't speak English very well. He carried a Korean- English dictionary with him. He had a couple hundred dollars. He landed  in California and decided he was going to make a go of it here in  America, so he went off to school and obtained a degree in  manufacturing engineering technology, and then he started to raise a  family.   In that family was a young girl who showed at a very early age an  interest in snowboarding. Her father, this Korean immigrant with no  measurable skills and little proficiency in English, decided that he  would help her, and he did. He made great sacrifices so she could  develop her skills in snowboarding, and ultimately she became one of  the best in the world.   Yesterday at the Olympic Games in South Korea, she was awarded the  Gold Medal because of her skills in snowboarding and the fact that she  won this halfpipe competition against the others, some of the best in  the world.   This is Chloe Kim. Chloe Kim, this Korean-American girl, like Tereza  Lee, developed an amazing skill. Today, all across this country and all  across the world, we are saluting this amazing 17-year-old girl and the  skill she developed. But let's remember that Chloe Kim's story is the  story of immigration in America. Chloe Kim's story is the story of  people who come to these shores determined to make a life. They don't  bring wealth. Many of them don't even bring proficiency in English.  They certainly in many cases don't bring advanced degrees. They only  come here with the determination to make a better life for themselves  and a better country for all of us.   That is the story of immigration. It is the story of this Korean- American girl, Chloe Kim. It is the story of Tereza Lee, another  Korean-American girl who was a Dreamer and inspired the introduction of  the legislation we are debating this week in the Senate.   There is a difference of opinion among Senators about immigration.  Several Senators have said: We have too many immigrants; we have to  limit those who come to this country. Some of them have even said that  we have to be careful that we select only the best and brightest to  come into this Nation. Well, I am the son of an immigrant myself, and I  can tell you for sure that my grandparents and my mother didn't come to  this country with any special skills or proficiency. They came here  with a determination to make a better life, and they did, for  themselves and for me. That is my story, that is my family's story, and  that is America's story.   This week as we debate immigration, let's not only applaud Chloe Kim  for her great achievement as a first-generation American, the daughter  of an immigrant who came here with nothing, let's applaud Tereza Lee,  too, who was determined against the odds to use her skills to make a  better life for herself and a better country for all of us.   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there have  been meetings going on all day on a bipartisan basis to try to resolve  the issue before us, which was the President's decision to end the DACA  Program effectively March 5 of this year. I believe progress is being  made. I hope we can continue along those lines. The proposed amendment  by the Senator from Pennsylvania does not address this issue, and for  that reason, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.  [[Page S904]]                                ____________________
