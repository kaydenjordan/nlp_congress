 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the importance  of passing the Afghan Adjustment Act as an amendment to the National  Defense Authorization Act, which is pending before the U.S. Senate.   This is our moment. We have been working on this for 2 years--2  years--while people who have stood with our military have been in  limbo, 2 years when they don't know what their future will hold. This  is their time.   This bipartisan legislation that I lead with Senator Lindsey Graham  is also cosponsored by Senator Coons; Senator Moran, who is the ranking  Republican on the Veterans' Affairs Committee; Senator Blumenthal;  Senator Murkowski; Senator Shaheen; Senator Wicker, who is the ranking  Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee; Senator Durbin, who  is the chair of the Judiciary Committee; of course, Senator Graham, who  is the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee; Senator Tillis and  Senator Mullin, with many others who support this bill.   Mr. President, this bill strengthens our national security. It does  right by Afghans who worked alongside our troops. And from a broader  national security perspective, as we look at the many purposes of the  bill before us, this amendment shows the world that when the United  States of America makes a promise, we keep it. We keep our covenant.   Nearly 80,000 Afghans who sought refuge in our country, who are in  our country, are currently in limbo, including many who risked their  own lives and their families' safety to protect our servicemembers.  Among them are translators, humanitarian workers, and courageous  members of the Afghan military who stood shoulder to shoulder with our  troops.   We were right to help those people flee the Taliban and come to the  United States, and it now falls on us to uphold the covenant we made to  them and give them the stability and the security that they need to  rebuild their life.   We know this has worked before. I know this. I have one of the  biggest Hmong populations in the United States of America. They came  after a war in really sad circumstances for our country and for them,  but they have rebuilt their lives. They are now police officers in  Minnesota. They are teachers. They are lawyers. They are legislators.   That is what we did after the revolution in Cuba. That is what we  did. We took people and we gave them a status that allowed them to  succeed in our country.   But in this case, we actually asked them to serve with our military,  to put their lives at risk, to gather intelligence for our military.   Who do you think is going to want to help us in the future if we  don't keep our covenant, if we don't keep our promise?   The bipartisan Afghan Adjustment Act creates a more thorough system  for Afghan allies to apply for permanent legal status. It requires that  applicants go through a vetting that is just as rigorous as the vetting  they would have gone through if they came to the United States as  refugees.   They get this. They are already here.   So one of the reasons that Senator Graham, especially, and Senator  Wicker are so interested in this bill is it actually provides more  security because of the vetting that will occur that otherwise would  not occur. This vetting standard is a standard that eight former Trump  and George W. Bush administration national security officials called  the ``gold standard'' of vetting.   Senator Graham and I worked closely with Republicans, including  Senator Moran, and the Department of Defense to strengthen the bill's  vetting standards. That is what is before us with this amendment-- keeping our covenant and doing the vetting. Both ways you look at it,  it is good for national security.   In addition, our legislation updates the Special Immigrant Visa  Program to include groups that should never have been excluded from the  program in the first place, including the female tactical teams of  Afghanistan, who did so much to support our troops. The entire purpose  of the Special Immigration Visa Program is to provide residency for  those who have supported the United States abroad. It is clear to me  that these brave women should qualify just as many of the men did.   The Afghan Adjustment Act is supported, as I noted, by a bipartisan  group of 11 cosponsors. But get this: This bill has earned the backing  of more than 60 organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars,  or, as we know them, the VFW, and the American Legion. This is one of  their top priorities right now, as well as for some of our most revered  military leaders, including Admirals Mike Mullen, William McRaven, and  James Stavridis; and Generals Richard Myers of the Air Force, Joseph  Dunford of the Marine Corps, and Stan McChrystal of the Army.   I think the Presiding Officer knows a few of these people, and he  knows how they have served our country.   That is why, if you are not going to listen to me, listen to them.  Listen to the leading veterans groups in this country that know how  important it is for us to pass this bill. We must uphold our covenant.   That means bringing well-earned certainty to Afghans who are already  here--an example, Nangialy, who began working alongside U.S. troops as  an interpreter in 2007.   I want to be clear about what it meant for an interpreter to work  alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan. What did it mean? When the  Taliban ambushed our soldiers with bullets, they ambushed their  interpreters too.  [[Page S3515]]  They weren't just sitting in an office being interpreters and just  sitting there and whispering in their books. They were out on the  battlefield with our military. When the Taliban ambushed the soldiers,  they ambushed the interpreters. When our troops were targeted with  IEDs, the interpreters were targeted too.   That is what Nangialy risked, but he did it anyway. Why? To use his  words, ``same goals, same target, and same achievement.''   Now, it wasn't just the interpreters. There is another Afghan who  wants to remain anonymous because his family is still back in  Afghanistan. That is the risk we are putting people in when they are in  this very unclear status. He was a helicopter fighter pilot with the  U.S. military. He worked with our troops to combat the Taliban in  remote areas of Afghanistan for 8 years. On one mission, he was shot in  the face by flying bullets. Miraculously, he survived because the  bullet passed through his cheek and open mouth. He shed blood in our  fight, and we should not let another day go by without keeping the  covenant we made to him.   Another story: An Afghan intelligence sergeant who also wants to  remain anonymous, who helped carry out several operations against the  Taliban and ISIS with our military. In 2018, while working alongside a  U.S. Special Forces group, he was caught in an IED explosion and lost  both of his legs.   Let me repeat that.   His fight with our troops cost him both of his legs. Doesn't he  deserve better than complete uncertainty and a refusal of our  government to even give him a status, a provisional status, and never  knowing if he is going to have to be sent back there? That is what we  are doing?   Our servicemembers and veterans understand this is imperative. I know  every Member in this Senate has been approached by members of our own  military about this. On Veterans Day, on Memorial Day, when you are  walking in a parade, they come up and they tell a story about someone  who stood with them whom they got to know. Maybe that person is still  somewhere in hiding in Afghanistan, but most likely, some of them are  in our country, which is a good thing. But, right now, they are in our  country--let me repeat. They are in our country, living in our country,  but we, right now, are refusing to give them the status that we have  given past people who helped us in conflicts. That is embarrassing.   Some of the most vocal advocates of the Afghan Adjustment Act have  been military groups. A coalition of more than 30 military groups,  including the American Legion and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America, penned a letter calling on congressional leadership to pass  this bill.   They wrote this to the leaders of both Houses on both sides of the  aisle:         America's veterans served with Afghans for two decades in       Afghanistan. We fought side-by-side with them, and we saw       firsthand their courage and dedication. They risked their       very lives to help us and made significant contributions to       our mission.    Again, this is 30 military groups, including the Iraq and Afghanistan  Veterans of America, the American Legion, Blue Star families, Honor the  Promise, the Black Veterans Project--and I could go on and on and on.   What else did they write?   They write:         We call on Congress to pass legislation that would allow       Afghan parolees who are being evacuated from Afghanistan to       have an opportunity to seek lawful permanent residence in the       United States.    Again, these are people who have this SIV status.   Then they go on:         We urge you to support the Afghan Adjustment Act as soon as       possible. We promised to stand by our allies who, often at       risk to themselves and their families, served in uniform or       publicly defended women's and democratic rights. The U.S.       government made a similar promise.    This is a letter from the 30 military groups of our country. They  say:         The U.S. government made a similar promise; keeping it       assures that the American commitments will be honored.    This is 30 military organizations telling us what it was like to  serve alongside our Afghan allies. Most of us in this Chamber don't  know that experience. We don't know how much they owe those Afghan  interpreters--those people who gathered the intelligence. We don't  know. We would go on congressional trips there, but we weren't there on  the battlefield; they were. So maybe, for a change, we should listen to  what they have to say about what they saw. They know that many of these  people are here right now, but we just can't get out of our petty  politics to try to at least give them the status that they deserve.   Many of our Nation's national security experts have also called on  Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act, accurately pointing out  that doing so is both a moral imperative and necessary for our national  security.   Here is a portion of a letter that was sent to congressional  leadership by the following experts: Rick ``Ozzie'' Nelson, former  Director, Office of Combating Terrorism; National Security Council  staff under George W. Bush. He was also a U.S. Navy helicopter pilot  and Afghan veteran; Gus Coldebella, former Acting General Counsel with  the Department of Homeland Security; Michael Neifach, former Principal  Legal Advisor for Immigration and Customs Enforcement with the Homeland  Security Council staff under George W. Bush; Elizabeth Neumann, former  Assistant Secretary for Threat Prevention and Security Policy for the  Department of Homeland Security and former Deputy Chief of Staff for  the Department of Homeland Security; Stewart Verdery, former Assistant  Secretary for Policy and Planning for the Department of Homeland  Security; Ross Ashley, former Assistant Administrator for the Federal  Emergency Management Association, former Virginia Air National  Guardsmen and U.S. Air Force Reserves; Hans Miller, former Deputy  Assistant Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration;  and Lynden Melmed, former Chief Counsel of U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services.   What does this letter say?   This letter says this:         The rationale for the Afghan Adjustment Act is clear.       First, it follows through on our nation's commitment to its       wartime allies by providing at risk Afghans and their       families--including many that supported U.S. military and       diplomatic efforts for the past 20 years--a path to permanent       status in the United States.        Second, it sends a clear message to current and future       allies--    And this is so key and it isn't kind of the first thing you think  about here--       --those that are necessary for U.S. servicemembers and       diplomats to perform their missions in pursuit of national       security--that the United States is a reliable and trusted       partner and it stands by the democratic ideals that it       professes.    This is why Senator Graham and I have worked on this bill for so many  years. This is why we have the ranking Republicans on Veterans', on  Judiciary, and on Armed Services supporting the bill.   When I first got to the Senate, honestly, I thought that would be  enough to get this done; that that would be enough to bless this and  give it the gold standard, just as all of these former Bush and Trump  and Obama and current Biden officials have given it their stamp; that  this is a good vetting process; that it is certainly a lot better than  having people sit here in limbo after they have served our country.    Here is another letter from former Ambassadors to Afghanistan because  it is not just military groups and national security experts. Eight  former U.S. Ambassadors to Afghanistan called on us to pass the Afghan  Adjustment Act. These experts served under Presidents George W. Bush,  Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, and each has an intimate  understanding of the sacrifices made by our Afghan allies.   Remember, it is these diplomats, it is these military leaders who  have asked these Afghans for their help. Regardless of what people  think about what happened with the withdrawal--regardless of people's  views on this--can't we just agree on one thing; that we should stand  with the people who stood with us?   This is what the Ambassadors to Afghanistan under George W. Bush,  Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden have said:         Without the Afghan Adjustment Act, the task of American       diplomacy will be much more difficult. If the United States       does not act to support its allies by passing the Afghan       Adjustment Act, in the future, our allies will be less likely       to support the U.S. missions if they see that our Afghan       partners are abandoned.  [[Page S3516]]         In diplomacy, our words will have lost meaning, and in the       unfortunate event of future conflict--    This is the Ambassadors writing, not me, Ambassadors who went to  serve in Afghanistan and who took on that assignment under four  different Presidents.   They are writing, if we don't do this, ``[i]n diplomacy, our words  will have lost meaning, and in the unfortunate event of future  conflict, what incentive would local allies have to support our  troops?''   A good question.   Finally, I want to share some words from a group of more than three  dozen of our Nation's most esteemed military leaders. They are retired  military leaders. As I mentioned, they are Gen. Joseph F. Dunford of  the U.S. Marine Corps; ADM Mike Mullen of the U.S. Navy; Gen. Richard  Myers of the U.S. Air Force; ADM Jim Stavridis of the U.S. Navy; GEN  Peter W. Chiarelli of the U.S. Army; GEN Stan McChrystal of the U.S.  Army; GEN David McKiernan of the U.S. Army; ADM William H. McRaven of  the U.S. Navy; GEN Austin S. Miller of the U.S. Army; GEN John W.  Nicholson, Jr., of the U.S. Army; GEN M. David Rodriguez of the U.S.  Army; GEN Curtis Scaparrotti of the U.S. Army; GEN Raymond A. Thomas  III of the U.S. Army; GEN Joseph Votel of the U.S. Army; Gen. Mark  Welsh of the U.S. Air Force; Lt. Gen. John A. Bradley of the U.S. Air  Force; LTG Jeff Buchanan of the U.S. Army; LTG Stephen Fogarty of the  U.S. Army; LTG Benjamin C. Freakley of the U.S. Army; LTG Ben Hodges of  the U.S. Army; LTG John F. Mulholland, Jr., of the U.S. Army; LTG  Leopoldo A. Quintas, Jr., of the U.S. Army; LTG Mark C. Schwartz of the  U.S. Army; LTG John C. Thomson of the U.S. Army; LTG Francis Wiercinski  of the U.S. Army; MG Edward Dorman III of the U.S. Army; Maj. Gen. Dawn  Dunlap of the U.S. Air Force; MG Paul Eaton of the U.S. Army; Maj. Gen.  Buck Elton of the U.S. Air Force; Maj. Gen. Walter D. Givhan of the  U.S. Air Force; MG William Hix of the U.S. Army; MG James B. Linder of  the U.S. Army; MG Mark MacCarley of the U.S. Army; MG Mark R. Quantock  of the U.S. Army; MG Edward Reeder of the U.S. Army; MG Patrick J.  Reinert of the U.S. Army; MG Jefforey Smith of the U.S. Army; MG Tammy  Smith of the U.S. Army; MG James ``Boe'' Young of the U.S. Army; BG  Steve Anderson of the U.S. Army; BG Norvell Coots of the U.S. Army; BG  Gary M. Jones of the U.S. Army; BG Richard C. Kim of the U.S. Army; and  Brig. Gen. Chad T. Manske of the U.S. Air Force.   Those are only the ones who signed the letter. So I will just ask my  colleagues--and perhaps we should listen to those who have led our  forces in times of war. When they say that these people stood with them  and when they say that if we do nothing and just let them be in limbo-- and we know, just a few weeks ago, one of them was murdered in the  State of Virginia, in the middle of the night, because he was working  as a Lyft driver--is that what we are going to do? Are we just going to  leave them in limbo or are we going to stand with them as the top  leaders in our military have suggested?   They have been resolute in their support, not just of doing something  about this, but of this bill, of this amendment. We worked with the  military for years on this amendment. They have signed their names to  this letter. What does the letter say specifically?   It says:         If Congress fails to enact the [Afghan Adjustment Act], the       United States will be less secure.    OK. There you go. We can just stand here and not want to deal with  this because everyone wants to go home for August or we can actually  vote on this amendment. That is all we are asking. We want to vote on  this amendment.   They write:         If Congress fails to enact the [Afghan Adjustment Act], the       United States will be less secure. As military professionals,       it was and remains our duty to prepare for future conflicts.       We assure you that in any such conflict, potential allies       will remember what happens now with our Afghan allies. If we       claim to support the troops and want to enable their success       in wartime, we must keep our commitments today. The [Afghan       Adjustment Act]--    And this isn't me talking. This is all the top brass, the top  military, who led us in times of war.   They write:         The [Afghan Adjustment Act] will go a long way.        Additionally, without the fixes applied by the [Afghan       Adjustment Act]--    This is them writing, not me--       our immigration system will be less capable, not more       capable, of properly processing and vetting applicants.    To break from their letter, that was the point I made earlier about  why Senator Wicker and Senator Graham and Senator Moran were so focused  on making sure that this was the gold standard of vetting in this bill.   Back to the letter:         The enhancements that the Afghan Adjustment Act adds to the       security screening process of those who were evacuated are of       critical importance to our national security.    Listening?   Even if you don't agree with me on the security of our country  overall in standing with our allies, at the very least, look at that.  Shouldn't we be vetting people who were evacuated? Hmm. Maybe that  would be a good idea. That is what they say in this letter.   Three dozen military flag officers think that without the Afghan  Adjustment Act, our Nation will be less secure. Our soldiers will face  new obstacles in finding allies on the battlefield, and our immigration  system will be less capable of vetting applicants. Those are plenty of  good reasons to support this amendment and why we have leading  Senators--both on the Democratic side and Republican side--on this  critical amendment. So that is it.   We have the leading people who head the committees in this very  Chamber supporting this bill. That is how much work that Senator Graham  and I have done to get them on board. We have got them on this.   We have got military and veterans groups. We have national security  leaders. We have retired U.S. Ambassadors to Afghanistan under four  different Presidents: Obama, Trump, Biden, and George W. Bush. And we  have all of the top brass retired military officers, whose names I just  read off.   They are not debating which bill or which amendment because we have  been working on it for 2 years. They know exactly what we should do,  and it is this bill, the Afghan Adjustment Act.   All of our colleagues have had at least a year to look at this bill.  So I don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear that, ``Oh, we have  got to look at this more.'' Give me a break. This bill has been out  there for a very, very long time. There is absolutely no reason we  shouldn't have a vote.   If people want to vote against the American Legion, and the VFW, and  all the top brass of the military, and all the Ambassadors who served  under those Presidents, that is fine. That is their right. But we need  to have a vote. That is the only way we can show that we are keeping  our covenant.   Until we get this done, we are essentially asking our Afghan allies-- people who took bullets in the face, who lost limbs--to rebuild their  lives on top of a trapped door that could fall out from under them at  any second. Without the Afghan Adjustment Act, all of it--their jobs,  their homes, their safety--could disappear.   By including the amendment in the NDAA, we can strengthen the  national security of our country by making our vetting program more  thorough--such a top priority of many of our colleagues--while finally  doing right by our Afghan allies who sacrificed for us.   Let's put aside the politics and the distractions. There are a lot of  good things in this bill. We have got a lot of votes on big things and  little things so far. Where is this? Who is going to object to at least  allowing this vote? They can vote against it if they want, some of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but don't deny us a vote.   By ``us,'' who am I talking about? Yeah, the Afghans who are here who  sacrificed for us, the top military, the Ambassadors, the military in  this country who have come up and talked to each and every one of us  about this bill, American soldiers who are begging us to do something  about it. That is ``us.''   The way I see it, this defense bill is about three things: one, our  Nation's security; two, setting a moral example for the world; and,  three, showing people everywhere that when America  [[Page S3517]]  makes a promise, a covenant, it will be kept. The Afghan Adjustment  Act, the amendment that Senator Graham and I have put forth, advances  all of these objectives.   Pass this amendment. Show the world that our word, show our own  military that our word and our covenant matters.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, had I been able to vote, I would have  voted yea on the Kaine amendment No. 429 to require the advice and  consent of the Senate or an act of Congress to suspend, terminate, or  withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty and  authorizing related litigation, and for other purposes.   I am a cosponsor for a similar bill, S.J. Res. 37, led by Senators  Kaine and Rubio, which establishes a mechanism for the United States to  exit the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. Although the  Constitution provides clear guidance on Congress's role in ratifying  treaties, it does not say anything about Congress's role in approving  or disapproving withdrawal from a treaty. I believe, together with  Senator Kaine and Senator Rubio, that the NATO alliance is a  foundational principle of U.S. national security, regardless of who is  President, and the U.S. leadership role in the alliance should depend  on more than the whims of any one administration.                            ____________________     Madam President, on behalf of Senator Tina Smith of  Minnesota, Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota, and Senator Kevin  Cramer of North Dakota, I rise to honor Jake Ryan Wallin, a Fargo  police officer whose life was cut tragically short in the line of duty  on July 14, 2023. He lived every day of his 23 years in the service of  others, and his loss is nothing short of a tragedy for his family, his  community, and our country.   Jake was the beloved son of Jeff and Amy Wallin. Raised in St.  Michael, MN, he was a graduate of St. Michael-Albertville High School  and Alexandria Technical and Community College before attending the  American Military University.   As a member of the Minnesota National Guard, he was deployed to both  Afghanistan and Iraq, where he served honorably. Upon return, he found  a new home in Fargo, ND, and continued his life of service with the  Fargo Police Department.   At Officer Wallin's funeral, the people who knew him best emphasized  that more than anything, he wanted to live a life of purpose--to do  work that made a difference for people. As a servicemember and a police  officer, he did that and so much more. Time and time again, Officer  Wallin heard the call of duty and raised his hand to say, ``Count me  in.'' That level of selflessness, character, and patriotism is the mark  of a good citizen and a good man. A world where everyone lived the  values that defined Officer Wallin's life would be a better world  indeed.   My heart is with Jake's parents Jeff and Amy; his brother Brady; his  fiance Winter; and everyone who called him a grandson, a nephew, a  cousin, a colleague, or a friend. I wish them peace and comfort as they  mourn the needless, devastating loss of an exceptional young man. While  he is no longer with us, his memory will serve as an inspiration to  generations of public servants who choose to follow in his brave  footsteps.                            ____________________
