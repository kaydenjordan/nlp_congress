 Mr. President, I am very worried about people who  have preexisting conditions. I have watched two of my best friends  survive cancer this year. They have both had intensive treatments,  surgeries, and chemotherapy. They both have young daughters. I cannot  imagine how worried they are right now because they do not know what is  in this healthcare bill, and they do not know whether or not they will  actually be able to afford any insurance coverage. I am worried about  millions of Americans who may not have access to affordable insurance  under this bill because we have not read it.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order to  proceed to Calendar No. 120, otherwise known as the American Health  Care Act, until the full text of the bill is available to the public  for review and comment for a minimum of 30 days--that is the same  amount of time we give everyday regulations that come out of our  agencies--because this bill could have such a negative effect on  millions of Americans.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Massachusetts.
