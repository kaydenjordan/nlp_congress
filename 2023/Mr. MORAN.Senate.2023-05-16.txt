 Mr. President, this week our Nation observes National  Police Week. That observation began in 1962, when President Kennedy  claimed the first Police Week as a time dedicated to pay tribute to our  law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty.   President Kennedy's proclamation stated that, during this week, ``all  of our people may join in commemorating police officers, past and  present, who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their  responsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their communities  and, in so doing, have established for themselves an enviable and  enduring reputation for preserving the rights and security of all  citizens.''   This afternoon I rise with my colleagues to honor the dedication and  sacrifice of our law enforcement officers.   Over the course of this week, we pay tribute to 443 officers who gave  their lives in the line of duty in 2022.   Saturday night, just a few days ago, hundreds of police officers,  family members, and others, gathered for the annual candlelight vigil  honoring our fallen officers. Among those memorialized this week are  four brave Kansas officers.   Deputy Sheriff Sidnee Carter, with the Sedgwick County Sheriff's  Office, was tragically killed in an automobile crash while responding  to a night disturbance call.   We also lost Sheriff Robert Craft from Marion County, Officer David  Ingle from the Iola Police Department, and Sergeant Stacy Murrow from  the Linn County Sheriff's Department--all Kansans.   In fact, all Americans are grateful to those officers for their  service and honor them in making the ultimate sacrifice for the benefit  of others, for the benefit of the people they knew in their community,  but also for the benefit of people they never met.   While the purpose of Police Week is to honor the men and women who  made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, we also should  remember how those police officers' lives as husbands and wives and  mothers and fathers--as members of their communities--they were people  who happened to wear a uniform, who happened to take up a career to  serve others, to protect and defend.   From educating kids in school about the dangers of substance abuse or  providing driver safety education, coordinating neighborhood watch  associations, and speaking at business luncheons, schools and community  townhall meetings, law enforcement strive to make our community a safe  place to live and raise a family and to work to foster a more safe and  secure environment; in a sense, to provide justice.   During this National Police Week and throughout the year, we should  remember that law enforcement needs our support. We should provide them  the resources they need to do their jobs. We must also give them the  tools they need to build and strengthen the bonds of trust with those  they serve and our best efforts to address the underlying challenges  that face our communities and individuals in their lives.   I serve as the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittee with appropriations jurisdiction over the Department of  Justice. I am committed to making certain our law enforcement officers  have the resources and support they need to do their job effectively  and safely.   We honor the service and sacrifice of our Nation's fallen law  enforcement officers, remember those who departed, and acknowledge and  express our gratitude for the sacrifices all law enforcement officers  make every day they wear the badge.   During this week--and, really, every other week of the year--we  should, and we do, honor those we have lost and remember the families  they left behind. We ask God to comfort them in their time of grief and  be a source of strength for them in their lives. May God bless our  police and our local law enforcement officers. May God bless them as  they do their duties, and may God hold in His arms those we have lost  this past year.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now  stand in recess until 5:30 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:32 p.m., recessed until  5:30 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Markey).                            ____________________
