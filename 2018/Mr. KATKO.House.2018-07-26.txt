 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Special  Agent Nole Remagen.   Special Agent Remagen suffered a stroke while supporting the recent  Presidential trip to Scotland, and, sadly, passed away a few days  later, surrounded by his family.   Special Agent Remagen was a true patriot who dedicated his life to  serving his country. He began his service as a member of the United  States Marine Corps, where he served honorably for 5 years.   After leaving the Marine Corps, he yet again heeded the call to serve  his Nation, joining the Secret Service as an officer in the Uniformed  Division.   Special Agent Remagen served in the Uniformed Division for 10 years  and rose to the rank of sergeant just like his father, also a retired  sergeant in the Secret Service Uniformed Division.   He became a special agent in 2009 and served faithfully many  assignments, including the Dignitary Protection Division and the  Presidential Protective Division.   Special Agent Remagen represented the best of the United States  Secret Service, and his dedication to the agency's mission is both  admirable and inspiring.   Special Agent Remagen is survived by his wife and two young children.  I ask that you keep his family in your thoughts and prayers during this  difficult time.                        Addressing Alzheimer's Disease     Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about a disease that  touches nearly every family in our country.   There are more than 5.7 million Americans living with Alzheimer's and  more than 16.1 million unpaid caregivers who dedicate much of their  lives to caring for their loved ones struggling with this terrible  illness.   I became familiar with Alzheimer's long before I came to Congress.  You see, my father, Andy Katko, or Pop-Pop, as he became known to us,  his 7 children, his 18 grandchildren, and his 6 great-grandchildren, as  well as everyone else, began, in 2008, to show signs that his memory  was deteriorating. He was eventually diagnosed with dementia that same  year.   His condition progressed significantly each and every year after his  initial diagnosis, and he was ultimately diagnosed with Alzheimer's  disease. My mother, his wife, Mary Lou, took on the challenging role  millions of loved ones do and became his primary caretaker.   Mary Lou remained by Andy's side, helping him with everything from  cooking, bathing, dressing, and taking his medications, to offering him  love and reassurance when he would wake up in the middle of the night  confused and sometimes scared of his surroundings.   About 1\1/2\ years ago, with Andy's condition progressing  dramatically, and my mother, Mary Lou, suffering from her own health  issues, our family had to make the terrible decision that many other  families have to make and admit my father, Andy, into a nursing home,  where he could receive the 24-hour care and attention that he  desperately needed.   Although Andy and Mary Lou lived apart since then, their strong bond  of love for each other was still evident, perhaps in the hand-holding,  perhaps in the kiss on the cheek, or perhaps just giving a reassuring  look.   Andy's eyes would light up at any mention of Mary Lou, especially  when she came to visit him. In March of this year, when we had to tell  him that Mary Lou had died, his beloved wife of 64 years, it barely  registered. In fact, we can't tell whether he understands that his  wife, the love of his life, is gone.   Today, Andy still resides at our local nursing home. His condition  has worsened, and he can no longer recognize his children or  grandchildren, nor can he form coherent sentences. It is extremely  difficult for our family to see him in this condition, as he is no  longer the same talkative, strong-willed father and grandfather he once  was.   Although Alzheimer's has diminished my father, Andy's quality of  life, the disease has not diminished his spirit. Yes, Andy's sincere  appreciation for his family is still evident, and he has maintained his  distinct sense of humor and happy-go-lucky disposition, which allows  our family some temporary relief and lightness amongst such a heavy  situation.   This struggle my father and our entire family is going through is not  unique. I have heard nearly identical stories told by countless  families throughout my district--really, from throughout this country.                                time  1330    The toll this disease takes on the millions afflicted, the millions  of caregivers, and our overall economy cannot be understated.   I am proud of the actions we have taken as a Congress to begin to  address this epidemic, including the passage of the 21st Century Cures  Act, which will strengthen efforts to find a cure. And the recent  passage of the RAISE Family Caregivers Act, which is now one of the  first laws to address the needs of our Nation's family caregivers.  However, we must do more.   I will continue to support the doctors, the scientists, and the  medical professionals, who are on the front lines caring for those  suffering from Alzheimer's, working tirelessly day and night to find a  cure, looking for promising treatments.   I implore all of my colleagues to join me in supporting funding for  research to put an end to this epidemic, honoring the millions of  Americans, like my father, who have lost so much of their lives to this  disease. This is for you Pop Pop.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
