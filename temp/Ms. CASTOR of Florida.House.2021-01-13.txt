 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me the time.   I rise today to urge the impeachment of Donald Trump because the  attack on the Capitol and the Congress was the single most depraved  betrayal of the U.S. Constitution ever committed by a President. The  traitorous incitement of an insurrection demands not just impeachment  but removal from office immediately.   Violence during the transfer of power, Confederate flags, anti- Semitic paraphernalia desecrated this Capitol. Accountability must come  swiftly. We must act with the same resoluteness we showed in the early  morning hours after the insurrection, where we ensured the will of the  voters was effectuated.   Donald Trump's defilement of this Capitol will not stand. It demands  impeachment now.
