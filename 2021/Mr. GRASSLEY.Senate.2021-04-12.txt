 Madam President, I have one short issue and another  issue of about 10 minutes.   Over the Easter break, I held a Q&A in 24 counties to hear what was  on the minds of Iowans. It was my constituents' agenda, not my agenda,  that we discussed. From my cattle market transparency bill to Second  Amendment issues, COVID-19 vaccines, and the crisis at the southern  border, Iowans are always up to date on the issues most important to  them.   One prominent question: Why can't you guys in the Senate get along?  In other words, ``Why not more bipartisanship?'' is a constant question  I get.   Iowans want Congress to work in a bipartisan way to enhance our  Nation's infrastructure through increased funding for roads, bridges,  highways, waterways, and rural broadband, among many other  infrastructure issues.   Unfortunately, what I have heard so far about President Biden's plan  is that it is everything but the kitchen sink and not enough focus on  just the big, big issue and the long-term issue of infrastructure.   Iowans expect us to work in a bipartisan way, and I hope Democrats  will agree to work together with us, unlike the passage of the $1.9  trillion bill.
