 Mr. Speaker, over the past decade, Congress has  provided Israel with more than $30 billion in security assistance.  Israel's security is important, but according to UNICEF, Israel is the  only country in the world that systematically uses its military to  arrest, interrogate, and imprison children--Palestinian children--some  as young as 12 years old. Countless cases of mistreatment, solitary  confinement, and forced confessions have been documented by Amnesty  International, Human Rights Watch, and our own State Department.   We must ensure that no U.S. tax dollars are supporting the  mistreatment and abuse of Palestinian children. I urge my colleagues to  cosponsor H.R. 4391, a bill to prohibit U.S. funds from supporting  Israel's violent military detention and abuse of Palestinian children.   This abuse must stop. Peace in the Middle East can be achieved only  by ensuring Israel's security, respecting human rights, and promoting  equality and justice for all Palestinians.                            ____________________
