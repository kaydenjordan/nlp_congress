 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I want to associate my  remarks with the gentleman who just finished.   I rise in support of this bill. Among the many critical measures  included are ones that support extreme weather resiliency, public  transit, as well as provide funding for highway construction and clean  energy.   If each of us had written this bill, we would have had that many  bills before us. It is not a perfect bill, but I would ask my  colleagues to join me in voting ``yes.''                                time  1930
