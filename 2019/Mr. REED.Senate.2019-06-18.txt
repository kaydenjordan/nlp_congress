 Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Corporate  Management Accountability Act, which asks each publicly traded company  to disclose its policies on whether senior executives or shareholders  bear the costs of paying the company's fines and penalties.   In 2014, William Dudley. then the President of the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York, gave a speech on Enhancing Financial Stability by  Improving Culture in the Financial Services Industry. In this speech,  President Dudley said, ``in recent years, there have been ongoing  occurrences of serious professional misbehavior, ethical lapses and  compliance failures at financial institutions. This has resulted in a  long list of large fines and penalties, and, to a lesser degree than I  would have desired employee dismissals and punishment.  . . . The  pattern of bad behavior did not end with the financial crisis, but  continued despite the considerable public sector intervention that was  necessary to stabilize the financial system. As a consequence. the  financial industry has largely lost the public trust.''   Since 2009, banks globally have paid $372 billion in penalties,  according to the Boston Consulting Group. However, despite these fines,  financial institutions continue to engage in unacceptable behavior,  whether it is Wells Fargo betraying the trust of its customers by  opening unauthorized accounts or it is Equifax endangering millions of  consumers by compromising critical personal information. Indeed, in my  home State of Rhode Island, almost half the State may have been  impacted by the cybersecurity breach at Equifax. These and other  breaches and lapses illustrate how far financial institutions have to  go in rebuilding the trust of Rhode Islanders and the American people.   At the same time, it is evident that simply fining and penalizing  financial institutions at the corporate level is not enough to deter  bad actors. Senior executives, many of whom are all too eager to take  credit for a company's good news, must also take more responsibility  for the bad news, especially if it is true that the buck stops with  them. For example, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded  ``the financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the  collapse of Lehman Brothers,'' and yet, according to the Congressional  Research Service. not a single senior executive officer at Lehman  Brothers at the Federal level was charged, went to jail, or personally  paid a Federal fine or penalty for the damage caused at Lehman Brothers  that rippled through our economy in 2008.   According to Professor Peter J. Henning, who also writes the White  Collar Watch column in the New York Times. ``a problem in holding  individuals accountable for misconduct in an organization is the  disconnect between the actual decisions and those charged with  overseeing the company, so that executives and corporate boards usually  plead ignorance about an issue until it is too late.''   The Corporate Management Accountability Act I am reintroducing today  is one attempt at helping to solve this problem. The bill simply asks  publicly traded companies to disclose whether they expect senior  executives or shareholders to pay the cost of corporate fines or  penalties. This approach is supported by University of Minnesota Law  School Professors Claire Hill and Richard Painter, who also served as  President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer, as well as Americans  for Financial Reform.   I urge all my colleagues to join this legislative effort to hold  senior executives accountable for their actions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Corporate  Management Accountability Act, which asks each publicly traded company  to disclose its policies on whether senior executives or shareholders  bear the costs of paying the company's fines and penalties.
