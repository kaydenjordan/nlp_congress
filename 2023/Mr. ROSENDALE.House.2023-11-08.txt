 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment No. 89 will prohibit any  funds made available in this act from being used to enforce the Federal  supplier climate risks and resilience proposed rule.   This rule is part of the Biden administration's plan for the Federal  Government to reach net-zero procurement.   The rule seeks to impose impractical and overly burdensome climate  reporting standards on large- and medium-sized government contractors  of which small businesses make up 29 percent and 64 percent  respectively.   Climate and emissions standards should not be integrated into  financial reporting, especially for the small businesses who lack the  resources to meet these environmentalists' extreme standards.   These government contractors play a critical role in providing  essential goods and services such as weapons systems to our military  and the very uniforms that they wear. Wool from Montana is used in the  design and the production of our Army uniforms.   Currently, only 10 percent of medium-sized contractors and 31 percent  of large contractors disclose their GHG emissions.   These reporting requirements represent a substantial burden,  especially for contractors who lack the infrastructure to collect  emissions data. To comply with these overly burdensome regulations,  these small businesses will be required to invest significant amounts  of time, money, and manpower to establish entirely new emissions  reporting regimes. Such an endeavor will be financially crippling for  many of them.   As Congress, we should ensure that the best companies for the job are  the ones who get the contract, not just massive government contractors  who can produce time-consuming reports. We should not be imposing these  impractical emissions reporting standards on any businesses,  particularly on the family ranches that produce our military uniforms.   This amendment is about ensuring that our government remains  impartial and does not become a platform for large corporations to  stifle competition.                                time  1815    We must champion true and fair competition within the government  contract space, promoting economic fairness and a level playing field  over an environmentalist agenda.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment,  which aims to protect the interests of small businesses and uphold the  principles of fairness, competitiveness, and financial responsibility.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just so everybody understands, this  proposed rule from the Biden administration requires major contractors  to annually disclose scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and to establish  science-based target requirements.   Let me tell you what scope 1 is: greenhouse gas emissions from  sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity. If I am  raising wool, am I supposed to follow around behind each and every  sheep that runs through the pasture to check the flatulence that they  are releasing from their derrieres? This is absolutely ridiculous, and  this is the kind of thing that the other side of the aisle is  requiring.   I am not going to the south end of a northbound sheep to try to find  out how much is being emitted.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think that we have very quickly  demonstrated how ridiculous this standard is, and I hope that all of my  colleagues support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment No. 90 would prohibit any  funds made available by this act from being used for the purchase or  construction of any new Federal building in Washington, D.C.   Our Nation is over $33 trillion in debt, with an expected annual  deficit this year of nearly $2 trillion. We need to find innovative  ways to reduce this spending.   The Federal Government spends approximately $25 billion annually to  operate, maintain, or lease over 278,000 buildings. Some Realtors out  there are getting very wealthy managing these properties.   A recent GAO report found that, in early 2023, well past COVID at- home working, two-thirds of Federal agencies used a mere 25 percent or  less of  [[Page H5636]]  their space at headquarters. You cannot keep vacancy rates like that on  any commercial enterprise and stay in business.   The same report also found that, on the higher range, agencies used  an estimated 39 to 49 percent of the capacity of their headquarters.   The Federal Government wastes billions of taxpayer dollars to own and  maintain buildings and barely uses them. This is unacceptable, and  quite frankly, it is an insult to the taxpayers of Montana. Moreover,  having all of our Federal agencies in Washington, D.C., makes them less  accountable to the American people.   One of President Trump's accomplishments was moving the Bureau of  Land Management headquarters to Colorado. Agencies should be close to  the constituents where their actions have the biggest impact.  Unfortunately, Secretary Haaland reversed course and moved the BLM's  headquarters back to Washington, D.C. If the BLM was still  headquartered in Colorado, maybe Director Stone-Manning would be more  accessible to the constituents whom her disastrous rules have harmed.   Our Nation is trillions in debt and wastes billions on underutilized  Federal buildings. No organization can operate this way successfully.  The status quo must change. My commonsense amendment would simply  prohibit funds for constructing or purchasing new buildings in  Washington, D.C.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me reiterate this again: Two-thirds of  Federal agencies used 25 percent or less of their space at  headquarters. This was not during the peak of COVID when we had a lot  of people working from home. This is a report that the GAO just  produced in 2023.   We have vacant buildings. People are probably wandering around there,  wondering what the echo sound is.   In January 2023, at a meeting of the Federal Real Property Council,  more than half of the agency officials acknowledged that their  headquarters buildings had excess space prior to the pandemic.   Mr. Chair, we have too much real estate. We need to liquidate some of  these assets. We need to get some of those buildings off the books.  Then, we can have a conversation about where new construction can take  place.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment No. 91 would reduce funding to  the Commission by 50 percent, saving American taxpayers approximately  $69 million. This does not include the savings from the unnecessary  regulations on the industry and the obligation that the regulatory  state has created on them.   The Biden-appointed CPSC Commissioners began talking about banning  gas stoves this past January. After major pushback, the Chair of the  CPSC said that they weren't looking into a ban on gas stoves. However,  the Biden administration still moved forward with the Department of  Energy rule on gas stove emissions.   I was proud to vote for Representative Kelly Armstrong's Gas Stove  Protection and Freedom Act in June, and I am pleased that the base text  of this bill includes a provision to protect Americans from unserious  and invasive emissions standards.   However, this ordeal has led me to lose any confidence in the  Consumer Product Safety Commission, which should probably not exist in  the first place and should only issue recommendations.   These unelected bureaucrats get paid to work out of a beltway office  and decide what products Americans can buy. It is time to rein them in.  American people and businesses should be the ones making those  decisions. If there is a particularly egregious product, consumers have  legal recourse, and Congress can step in and make a law. It shouldn't  be done by unaccountable bureaucrats who are invested in keeping  themselves employed by continuing to overregulate products.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, besides trying to ban gas stoves, the  Consumer Product Safety Commission has also proposed other ridiculous  rules.   For example, on October 25, 2023--not the early 1900s, 2023--the  Commission proposed a rule on furnaces that states: The U.S. Consumer  Product Safety Commission has determined preliminarily that there is an  unreasonable risk of injury and death associated with residential gas- fired central furnaces, boilers, wall furnaces, and floor furnaces.   This is all gas furnaces and boilers.                                time  1830    Let's get to the crux of this. This agency is trying to put the  natural fuels that we have in our country out of business. This is  another ploy by the Biden administration to drive us all to this broken  idea of relying upon renewable energy. It is not realistic. This is  just another agency that is trying to perpetuate that, and they do not  need more money to attack the American people and American industries.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, under the legal theory espoused by the  Commission, all manufacturers and retailers would be liable for  injuries caused by consumers' negligence or even intentional misuse of  a safe product, even when the manufacturer provided warnings and  instructions on safe use. This is nothing more than a trial attorney's  dream come true. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment No. 92 would prohibit funding  for President Biden's new Office of Gun Violence Prevention.   Since President Biden took office in January of 2021, our Second  Amendment rights have been under assault. Now, with the stroke of a  pen, President Biden created the Office of Gun Violence Prevention,  allowing his administration to bypass Congress unilaterally and  implement the left's gun control agenda.   This office would be overseen by Vice President Kamala Harris and  staffed with radical former gun control lobbyists, allowing the swamp  to have total control of Biden's gun control agenda.   In Montana, 64 percent of the households have firearms. Montanans  will not go along with the White House's attempt to undermine our  Second Amendment rights.   People often say, what are they afraid of out there in Montana? Why  do they need so many firearms? I will tell you, we are not afraid of  anything, and it is because we do have our firearms.   It is unacceptable for the hard-earned tax dollars of gun owners in  Montana to fund the salaries of unelected, gun-grabbing bureaucrats who  are hell-bent on branding law-abiding, responsible gun owners as  criminals.   My amendment would throw a wrench in the gun control lobbyists' plans  and severely hamper the Biden administration's ability to impose  further restrictions on our Second Amendment rights. It is time we  drained the swamp and kicked the gun control lobby out of the White  House. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as I have referenced, Vice President Harris  possesses no special credentials to run the Office of Gun Violence  Prevention and will act as nothing more than a figurehead. The office  will rely on leftwing special interests and lobbyists to enact the  Democrats' war on the Second Amendment while also rewarding President  Biden's donors with cushy jobs at the White House.   Rob Wilcox, the Deputy Director of the Office of Gun Violence  Prevention, led Federal policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, which is  primarily financed by Michael Bloomberg. All the time my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle are trying to undermine and compromise our  Second Amendment rights, they fail to recognize the prosecutors that  they have put in place around the country that refuse to charge and  prosecute the criminals that should not have guns, that have been doing  crimes with illegal firearms. That is where the focus needs to be. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, what my colleagues fail to recognize  time and time again is the fact that we have so much crime that takes  place, criminal on criminal, or criminals committing these crimes and  an innocent victim gets tied up in the crossfire.    They also refuse to recognize that these communities and cities that  are led by Democrat leaders have had increased crime rates over the  last several years since the Biden administration has taken over, and  that is because they have prosecutors who are not charging and  prosecuting these criminals and letting them off without proper  punitive measures taking place.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, forgive me if I don't trust a Federal  agency to be policing a community and using their discretion about who  may or may not be committing a crime in the future.   My gosh, we have just witnessed the FBI conducting surveillance on  Catholics because they were attending Latin masses.   We watched them conduct surveillance on parents because they dared  attempt to attend school board meetings.   Now we are going to unleash the Federal agencies to conduct  surveillance on people who might own a firearm, who may not own a  firearm, who might commit a crime in the future, and they are going to  be the sole judge of that?   The people across Montana will not support that. They will not  tolerate that, and this amendment deems to get rid of an agency that is  trying to do those exact kinds of acts.   I ask my colleagues to please support this amendment. I yield back  the balance of my time.
