 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Luther  Eugene Rollins. Gene, as he was better known, was the son of Mr. and  Mrs. James F. Rollins of Greer, South Carolina.   Gene, like many Americans, wanted to serve his country, and he joined  the Army during the Vietnam war and was assigned to Company A in the  6th Battalion Infantry in the 9th Division.   The commander of his battalion was Captain Vernon Green, who quickly  became his lifelong friend. Gene's unit was known as the Polecats or  Bearcats and, in March of 1968, was assigned to the advance party in  Southeast Asia.                                time  1015    While serving in combat on the front lines, he quickly became known  as the ``preacher'' because of his daily reading of the Bible and  dedicated prayer life. During an attack on his battalion, Gene was  asked to lead his men in prayer, which he did on numerous occasions.  Gene credits his many prayers to God as the reason for his survival  during an attack when his M60 machine gun jammed and he was unable to  return fire to the enemy.   Gene became a radio operator during his service in Vietnam, attaining  the rank of platoon sergeant. When his best friend, Captain Green was  promoted to the battalion staff, Gene was invited to join him. He  declined to do  [[Page H4437]]  so saying, ``I want to stay with my men.'' As he later told members of  his hometown church, his service in the Vietnam war was a ``missionary  journey'' where he was doing what God wanted him to do. For Sergeant  Rollins' heroic efforts, he was awarded the Bronze Star and two Purple  Hearts.   After the war, he returned to Rock Hill, South Carolina, where he  married his wife, Brenda Faye, and had three children, a son, Wendell,  and two daughters, Tabatha and Tonya. He worked as a machinist for  several years until joining Duke Energy in June of 1973 where he was an  operator and coordinator for maintenance, working until March of 2016  at the Catawba Nuclear Station in York County, South Carolina.   Just as Gene Rollins had heeded the call of God during his service in  Vietnam, he continued to serve his Lord by joining Woodhaven Baptist  Church, where he served as Sunday school superintendent, finance  committee member, and usher. Gene and his family united with their  grandchildren by joining Calvary Baptist Church. And as said by Pastor  Reggie Hopkins, ``We love having a man of God like Gene Rollins and his  family'' in our church.   He spends his time by continuing to serve his fellow man by cutting  his neighbor's grass, giving rides to those who need medical care, and  numerous other tasks that epitomize the saying ``to live is to serve.''   Gene Rollins is a man who continues to serve his God, his country,  his family, and, just as our Savior Jesus Christ did, his fellow man.   May God continue to bless Gene Rollins for years to come.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, it is--what?--20 till 2. We have got a group  here that is willing to stay all night until we address this problem  with the supplemental.   You can talk about children, but, just like my good friend from Texas  says, go to the border. See these children who are going, who are being  drug back and forth, charged, making money for these adults.   Let's put the money--we don't have to just go to Virginia. I feel for  these children in Virginia, but I feel for those 144,000 whom they  caught, much less the ones that got by.   I further feel for the children who, according to DHS, were saying  that they are being carted back and forth, raped. They have rape trees.  Go to the border. Where is the compassion for them?   It is high time for us to debate a supplemental. And if it takes  however long on this clock, we are going to do it, because we are tired  of it.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
