 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, our Senate Education  Committee held a hearing on going back to school safely--a subject on  the minds of tens of millions of American families--since today two- thirds of married parents both work outside the home, and they have  children. The children are ready to go back to school, and the parents  are even more ready for them to go back to school.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  following my remarks this morning my opening statement from that  hearing   The commissioner of education from Tennessee--and I know that the  Presiding Officer, while he is a proud Senator from Florida, also knows  a little bit about Tennessee, having lived there--was one of our  witnesses there. She said: We want children to do things. We want them  to be safe, but we want them to thrive.   That is the sense I got from all of the witnesses yesterday, which  includes the Denver school superintendent; a national representative of  education, Dr. Benjamin; and it included the commissioner of education  for the State of Nebraska, who is also the head of the Chief State  School Officers.   Anyone who looks at the children in America today knows they need to  go back to school. They have been out for 5 to 6 months now. This is a  time when we are especially concerned in our country, and our attention  is focused on racial injustice, on problems that minority families and  minority children have. The single best thing we could do to help  minority children and minority families is to help them go back to  school safely in August and September.   Any teacher can tell you and most parents can tell you that  emotional, intellectual, and physical damage to children has been  caused by being out of school since March, and that will continue to be  the case until they reopen in August. Articles have talked about 50  percent learning deficits. We have that every summer when children are  away from school. Teachers in the fall know they have to catch back up.   It has also shown us the limits, as well as the benefits, of remote  learning. My daughter has three young sons, two of them in school. She  said they have had it about up to here with remote learning, even  though they are in a very good public school system. There are limits  as to what you can learn remotely. Teachers aren't trained to teach  remotely. In many parts of our country, broadband isn't sufficient to  allow students to learn remotely. Teachers haven't made lesson plans to  teach remotely, so they have to change the whole way they go about  teaching.   So much of the children being home affects homeschooling.  Homeschooling is a good thing for parents who are able to do that, but  homeschooling is hard. It takes a lot of time. If you are in a family,  as two-thirds of married families are, where you are both working  [[Page S2906]]  outside the home, how are you going to do the homeschooling  appropriately so that your child doesn't get far behind?   For the benefit of the children, for the benefit of the parents, and  especially for the benefit of low-income children--many of whom get one  or two meals a day at school--we need to go back to school as a  country. When we do--when 100,000 public schools and 36,000 private  schools, 55 million children go back to school and 20 million students  go back to the college--that will be the surest step toward regaining  the rhythm of American life that we can have. That would show we are  actually going back toward normal.   It will be another year before we get to normal. I think we all  understand that. We are going at warp speed to find a new vaccine. We  are building manufacturing plants for vaccines before we even know that  they work. We have never done that before. In fact, there has probably  never been a time in our history where we had more scientific  brainpower in this world devoted toward a specific target than we do  right now at trying to increase the number of fast, rapid, accurate  diagnostic tests, the number of treatments to reduce the effects of  COVID-19, and a vaccine for COVID-19. We probably have never had so  many scientists in the world working on a single project like that. We  will probably have good results, but it will take a while.   All of the plans that are being made--and we heard about them  yesterday--will take a whole year. In the next semester, we will have  more tests, we will have more treatments, we will have more contact  tracers, and there should be, hopefully, the beginning of vaccines, but  our plan should be for a year.   How do you make sure the schools are safe? The formula is pretty  simple, although it is not as simple in its application. The things  that we know work are, No. 1, staying apart some distance; No. 2,  washing your hands; and No. 3, wearing a mask.   In colleges, that will be easy because colleges have more space. In  fact, they are big wasters of space. They usually don't teach in the  morning or in the evening or on Saturday or in the summer, and colleges  can spread out and create smaller classes. There are more lectures. You  can do lectures more easily.   You can have a culture of mask-wearing--as President Mitch Daniels of  Purdue University testified the week before--at colleges. I think  colleges will have an easier time than schools.   In addition to that, we know that, unfortunately, COVID-19 affects  older people. In Tennessee, for example, 5 percent of the cases of  COVID-19 are in nursing homes, and nearly 40 percent of the deaths are  in nursing homes. The same is true in other States. COVID-19 affects  younger people a lot less. Dr. Fauci has warned us not to be cavalier  about that, but the truth is, younger people seem not to be as affected  by COVID-19.    We have a population that is not as affected. We have a population  that is in a smaller, controlled setting. You can shut a school if  someone gets infected and keep other schools open. We do that with the  flu. We have children, who are more subject to being told what to do.  So we have a setting where we should be able to create communities-- there are 100,000 public schools, as I said--little communities that  are among the safest in our country. On the other hand, little children  may have a difficult time wearing masks. They aren't the best at  hygiene. Children go home every day; they may come back and forth  bringing germs with them.   We have those basics that I talked about--plus, testing. What we know  about testing is that we have the capacity to do about 10 million tests  a month this month, according to Admiral Giroir, the Assistant  Secretary of Health. He says we will have a 40 to 50 million test  capacity by the time we go back to school in August, September. That is  four to five times as many as we have today.   What is going on now is that in Florida and in Tennessee--every State  is making its plan for the tests that it needs and sending it to the  admiral. They are working on it together. If the State has needs the  State can't deal with, the Federal Government helps with that. In our  second month of that kind of relationship, that seems to be working  pretty well.   I know that in Tennessee, which is 11th among all the States in terms  of testing per capita, the Governor's motto is, if in doubt, get a  test. You can go to the local public health department and get one in 5  minutes. It takes 2, 3 days to get the result, but there are no delays.  Anybody who wants it can get it. That has created an environment where  everybody feels more comfortable. If they are worried about COVID-19,  if they don't want to go home and see their older relatives or their  spouse, if they wonder if they are sick, they can go get a test.   So tests should be available for the schools.   We will have to be careful and recognize that the way schools open  will vary by community. There are many counties in Nebraska, the  commissioner of Nebraska said yesterday, where there is not a single  case of COVID-19. So on his dial of green to red in terms of school  opening, they would be very green and wouldn't have to do much in  response to the COVID-19 in terms of changing the way they operate. On  the other hand, in Omaha, NE, it might be different. In Nashville, it  might be different. In New York City or Phoenix, it might be different.   The Denver school superintendent talked about perhaps having children  come for 2 or 3 days a week on alternate days in order to have smaller  classes and about having extra time for disabled children or children  from homes where they have less support, more vulnerable children  needing more help in our schools.   My hope would be that we can find ways for children to come back to  as normal a school day as possible. It will take some flexibility. Some  of those that will need to be flexible are the States, the Federal  Government, and the unions with their rules and regulations. Colleges  have a lot of flexibility in rearranging class schedules, class sizes,  and class times. Schools have a lot less because they have State rules  and union rules that restrict what they can do. They need some  flexibility so they can reschedule.   Then there is the question of money. Just as we say we want children  to be safe, we want them to learn, there are two arguments on behalf of  more money from the Federal Government. One would be Federal spending  to help them learn. Generally, that is the responsibility of State and  local governments. They spend about 90 percent of that.   In our first COVID-19 bill, the Federal Government was generous with  schools, recognizing that we shut down the economy, and then that shut  down the schools, and that caused a lot of expensive problems. The  Federal Government supplied $23 billion, and Tennessee got about $260  million for just K-12 schools. There was another slug of money for  colleges, and then there was $150 billion for States. As the Presiding  Officer knows, a big part of the State budget--30 to 40 percent--goes  to education. So my thinking is that a part of that $150 billion--$23  billion we have already allocated for K-12 and the $25 billion that we  allocated to testing, which could include contact tracers, some of  which could be a part of schools--should help pay for keeping schools  safe enough to reopen.    If there is more money, we need to be open to that, I think, here in  the Federal Government, but not before we see whether it is really  needed.   The Tennessee commissioner--and I put a lot of stock in her thinking.  Because Tennessee is a conservative State, it doesn't spend a lot of  money, has no debt, a big rainy day fund, low taxes--a lot like  Florida. She estimates that it will cost about $1.5 million per school  district, with the average school district being about $3,500, in her  words, to provide the things the school districts need to reopen  safely. Those are things like more sanitizing equipment, barriers that  separate children in the lunchroom or maybe even in class, extra money  for busing because when you create a lot of new classes, a lot of new  schedules, you may have to change the bus schedules, and that will cost  more than most things. So it is about $1.5 million.   I will be very interested to see how much of the money we have  already appropriated or how much of the money that we have appropriated  that is very inflexible and might be made more flexible for Governors  to use just for opening schools safely and whether we need to add any  more.  [[Page S2907]]    I think it is in our interest to make sure that principals and school  boards know that they will have sufficient funds to open 100,000 public  schools safely, because school administrators, with all respect,  sometimes are a little bit conservative and reluctant to take risks. If  there is the excuse that ``We don't have enough money to open safely,''  they may just say ``Let's keep up with remote learning.'' I think we  are about up to here with remote learning in most places in the  country. It is especially not good for the youngest children and for  children who are from disadvantaged families or low-income families. I  think it is important to get the country going. It is good for the  children and it is good for the parents to make sure that schools have  sufficient funds to reopen safely.   It was a very good hearing yesterday. I thank the witnesses for their  participation. It was all remote, even for all of the Senators.   We will have another hearing next week on telehealth. We have had to  cram 10 years of experience into 3 months to learn about telehealth,  telework, and telelearning. While this has been a very painful way to  learn a lesson, we should take advantage of these lessons because, as  we will find out in our hearing next week on telehealth, we have gone  from almost none of it to seeing that 40 or 50 percent of the  physician-patient visits are done remotely. If that were to turn out to  be, over the long term, 15 or 20 percent, that would produce a massive  opportunity for change in the way we deliver medical services in the  country.   The one other thing I would mention is that I heard about liability  yesterday. Colleges and the schools I have talked to want to be  included in whatever the Federal Government does to make sure that  teachers and administrators and schools and universities are  appropriately protected from lawsuits as a result of the COVID-19  epidemic.   As long as they meet a standard of care that is reasonable, they  should not have to worry about being liable if a child who is 8 years  old forgets to wear a mask, coughs on another child, and that child  goes home and makes Grandma sick and Grandma sues the school.   Teachers are always worried about liability. The teachers' unions  often use liability insurance as one of the major incentives to join  the unions. Many States, like my State, provide tort liability for  teachers.   I think we need to make sure that here in the Senate, as we consider  any additional legislation that has to do with COVID-19, we include  colleges and we include schools. We received a letter from all of the  colleges from the American Council on Education specifically asking us  to do that. Otherwise, we might discourage schools and colleges from  opening. If we discourage schools from opening, that leaves children  sometimes home alone, sometimes home without being educated, some of  them being left with remote learning that doesn't help and developing a  learning gap that will leave them at a disadvantage for the rest of  their lives.   As we look at all of the issues we have to deal with, I hope we  include appropriate steps to put limits on liability, at least as a  result of the COVID-19 experience   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [June 10, 2020]                   COVID-19: Going Back to School Safely         A May 28 story in the Memphis Commercial Appeal about       schools planning for the 2020-2021 school year included a       bittersweet image--a young girl reaching her hand out to       touch a teacher, who is standing in line to welcome students       to the first day of school in 2019. As the Commercial Appeal       reporter writes: ``The first day of school in August 2019       would flunk 2020's course on social distancing.''        Today's hearing is about how we reopen schools safely this       fall--that means teachers welcoming students back without       hugs or high fives.        The opening of schools in 2020 is not going to look like       2019.        But today's witnesses will talk about their work to help 56       million students from kindergarten to 12th grade go back to       the 100,000 public schools and 34,000 private schools in the       fall as safely as possible.        In doing so, they will help our country take its surest       step toward normalcy.        Witnesses:        Dr. Penny Schwinn, Commissioner of Education, Tennessee       Department of Education, Nashville, TN        Dr. Matthew Blomstedt, Commissioner of Education, Nebraska       Department of Education, Lincoln, NE        Ms. Susana Cordova, Superintendent, Denver Public Schools,       Denver, CO        John B. King, Jr., President and CEO, The Education Trust,       Washington, DC        The question for governors, school districts, teachers and       parents is not whether schools should reopen--but how.        Any teacher can explain the risk of emotional, intellectual       and social damage if a child misses a school year.        Schools need to assess how this year's disruption has       affected our children and get student learning back on track.        At our hearing last week on the reopening of colleges, we       heard about a variety of strategies that colleges are using       to help keep classrooms and campuses safe, including keeping       class sizes small so students can stay 6 feet apart, creating       campus-wide policies for wearing masks, and rigorous hygiene       improvements.        As with colleges, k-12 schools' plans will vary for each       community and will also depend on the prevalence of the virus       in the fall.        The goals for schools working to reopen are fundamentally       the same as the colleges we heard from last week: social       distancing, aggressive hygiene practices, face masks where       appropriate, and then a system of testing and contact       tracing.        In order to accomplish those goals, it's clear that school       boards, superintendents and principals need to be focused on:        Creating an environment where students and teachers can       socially distance        Making modifications to the school year calendar and daily       schedule        Preparing to integrate more distance learning        Restructuring classrooms and extracurricular activities        Providing meal services in a safe way        Making sure the school has gloves, masks, and other       protective equipment        Protecting students and adults in the school buildings who       are at a higher risk.        To accomplish this, schools will also need to create a       strategy for testing and tracing students who may have been       exposed. You want your school's testing needs to be in your       state plan.        The availability of widespread testing will allow schools       to identify teachers and students who have the virus or have       been exposed to it and trace their contacts.        Widespread testing not only helps contain the disease; it       builds confidence that the school is safe. Fortunately, U.S.       Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir says       there will be 40-50 million tests available per month by       September. That is 4-5 times today's number--and today's       number is twice as many as any other country.        Dr. Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project, now       leads a competitive ``shark tank'' enterprise at the National       Institutes of Health to discover new ways to conduct tens of       millions of additional accurate tests with quick results.        Schools' COVID-19 plans should last for at least a year:       The government is pursuing vaccines at warp speed, but no one       expects one by August.        In the second half of the school year, schools should be       able to provide more tests, more treatments, better contact       tracing and we should have vaccines. It will likely be the       Fall of 2021 before school life approaches normal.        There are several reasons schools have an advantage in       providing a safe environment for students and faculty:        The first reason is that younger people have been less hurt       by COVID-19, although Dr. Anthony Fauci has warned against       ``cavalierly'' assuming that young people are not at risk.       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is       ``investigating reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome       in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease.''        Second, schools are generally small communities that are       closely supervised and monitored. Third, outbreaks can be       traced--if a child becomes sick, that child's classmates can       be tested. Fourth, individual schools can close to control       the spread of the virus--while other schools remain open.       Schools are not unfamiliar with outbreaks of flu and other       illnesses that have resulted in the temporary closure of       individual schools to prevent further spread.        But school environments pose challenges as well:        First, there's not much extra space in a k-12 school to       enable distancing--whereas there's a lot of extra space on       most college campuses.        Second, school administrators face more rigid rules as a       result of state and local regulations and contracts with       teachers' unions, so making changes to the academic calendar,       class times and class sizes are more difficult.        Third, creating a mask-wearing culture is harder with young       children. Seeing facial expressions is also important for       young children--they learn to socialize and self-regulate, so       obscuring faces with masks prohibits some learning for early       elementary school-aged children.        Fourth, rigorous hygiene isn't always easy with children.        Fifth, children go home at night, potentially exposing       older adults.        Sixth, even systematic testing of children is a lot of       tests.        Today 91.3 percent of families with children have at least       one parent employed, and  [[Page S2908]]       among married families with children, 64.2 percent had both       parents employed, according to the Bureau of Labor       Statistics.        And many children live in environments where the school is       the safest place they'll be all day.        It's also the place where almost 30 million students       receive a school lunch--more than 70 percent of those       students qualify for free or reduced-priced meals.        Administrators have a responsibility to make our schools       among the safest small communities this fall.        In doing so, they will help our country take its surest       steps toward normalcy.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleague  from Louisiana, one of the most diligent Members of the U.S. Senate. He  complimented the occupant of the Chair, Senator Gardner from Colorado,  for doing a great job for his State. I think Senator Cassidy did a good  job advocating for his State. But he left a little bit of perspective  out on what he offered, and I would like to add some perspective.   As he was speaking, I was thinking about the creation of the Great  Smoky Mountains National Park. This occurred in the 1930s. During the  Great Depression, when everyone was worried about a job and everyone  was worried about our country, the people of North Carolina and  Tennessee appropriated through their State legislatures $2 million  each. Then John D. Rockefeller, Jr., heard about the effort, and he  said: ``I will give $5 million if the States will match it.''   So you had four--two from North Carolina, two from Tennessee--and  then they set out to raise another $1 million. They raised that from  schoolchildren. They collected pennies and dimes and quarters in the  middle of the Depression to create the Great Smoky Mountains National  Park.   At the time they did that, what did the people of Tennessee and North  Carolina do? They gave it to the people of the United States of  America. They gave it to all of us. They didn't charge for it. In fact,  they said: ``The only way we will give it to you is if you will not put  an interest fee on it.''   They didn't say: ``Only Tennesseans, only North Carolinians can  come.'' They didn't say: ``We don't want anybody from Louisiana coming  to the national park and the Great Smokies or from Colorado or from any  other State.'' They gave it to the people of this country.   And what has happened? There are now 14 million people a year who  come to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We only have 6 or 7  million in Tennessee, so we have a lot of people. We have a lot of  interlopers, don't we? We have a lot of people who don't live where our  park is, who use it. We are happy about that. We are proud of it. We  are glad we gave it to the country, and we are glad Ken Burns includes  it among one of the great treasures that he calls America's Best Idea.  It is a park for the country given by the people of Tennessee and North  Carolina and the schoolchildren, and we didn't object to everybody  enjoying it.   I believe I voted every single time that the coastal States have been  decimated by a hurricane. The Senator from Louisiana talked about $685  billion. I didn't say, as a Senator from Tennessee: ``You know, we  don't have a coast. We don't have an ocean. It wasn't us. Hurricanes  don't come here. Don't charge me.''   We gladly paid our share of the bill because we are part of one  country. We are part of one country. That was four people, right? Six  hundred and eighty-five billion dollars for people who were hurt, not  just paid for by people who live on the coast but by people who live in  Colorado and Tennessee and Iowa and places where there is not a coast-- because we are one country.   So the idea that we should only favor those items that come just from  our State is not a very good argument for coastal resiliency because,  if the Senator from Louisiana wants to bring that bill up based on the  argument he made, why should anybody who doesn't live on a coast vote  for it? I voted for it in committee because I thought it was an  important issue, even though we don't have a coast. He is a very  skillful advocate, a very diligent Senator. He is doing a good job of  talking for his State, but he is missing the point.   His other point is, let's add it to this bill. Well, the Senate floor  is littered with bills that never made it through here because they got  loaded down with too many good ideas. People say: ``Well, there is a  train that is likely to get to the station, let's load it up.'' And  what happens? It just slows down, and after a while, it stops, and  nothing happens. Because people have said: ``If I don't get what I want  on the train, I am not for anything.''    That is why the Land and Water Conservation Fund has never been  permanently funded. This was an idea Congress passed in 1964, 60 years  ago. In 1985 and 1986, I was chairman of President Reagan's Commission  on America's Outdoors. It looked at what we should do in the great  American outdoors. We didn't say the great Tennessee outdoors or the  great Louisiana outdoors or the great Colorado outdoors. We looked at  the great American outdoors. We looked at the great American outdoors  and said: ``What can we do so our children and grandchildren can enjoy  what we have enjoyed?''   The people of Wyoming aren't the only ones who enjoy Yellowstone--or  the people of Montana. Three or four million people a year go to a  western park like that. They travel from all over the country to go  there.   When I look at the Great Smokies in football season, when we play  LSU, those Tigers arrive on Tuesday. Well, the game is not until  Saturday. Why do they come? Because they want to go to the Great Smoky  Mountains National Park. We don't put up a big sign and say: ``Sorry,  you didn't pay for it. We gave it to the country. It is not for you.''  They like it, and we like to have them there.   So the point, though, was that sometimes you have a good idea, and if  you add one more good idea to a piece of legislation, it sinks the  whole ship. That would be the case here. The Senator from Louisiana is  talking about a very big idea: What do we do about revenue sharing from  oil and gas revenues and coastal resiliency and climate change? He  didn't say too much about climate change, but if his sea level is  rising, it is probably because of climate change, so maybe we ought to  think about that too. So if we are going to bring up this whole issue  of coastal resiliency, my guess is that some Senators will say: ``All  right, let's talk about a moratorium on oil and gas drilling. Let's  talk about a fairer share.''   Ninety percent of the drilling in Alaska goes to Alaska. Fifty  percent of the drilling in Wyoming goes to Wyoming. Twenty-seven  percent of the drilling 3 miles off the coast of Louisiana goes to  Louisiana. If it is in the Federal lands beyond 3 miles, 37\1/2\  percent is split up among four States. That is the area where the oil  comes from, but that land belongs to all 46 States. So we could have a  pretty good debate about that, about the moratorium.   Then someone would say: ``What about the oceans? The oceans deserve  some of the care that comes from drilling in the oceans, drilling in  the water, so let's talk about the oceans.'' If we got into a  moratorium on oil and gas drilling, adding the oceans, changing revenue  sharing, there is no more difficult issue in the U.S. Senate than to  adjust and say: ``Well, Louisiana gets 27 percent, maybe it ought to go  to 40. Alaska gets 90, maybe Wyoming should go up to 90.'' There is no  more difficult issue than that to deal with. It sunk a lot of bills to  bring that up.   I remember the member of the congregation who was disappointed  because the preacher only preached a verse from the Gospel of Luke.  Well, you can't preach the whole Bible in one sermon, and we can't pass  every good idea in one bill. In fact, we have two bills together here  that are, by themselves, about enough to stop the train before it gets  to the station.   Everybody here knows that it has been since 1964 that people have  tried to pass the Land and Water Conservation Fund funding, even though  the idea--money from environmental burden, that is drilling offshore-- for an environmental benefit--that is to let States and the Federal  Government buy land that is treasured, as Senator Daines from Montana  says, 80 percent of the access good fishing in Montana comes with Land  and Water Conservation Fund money. So that bill has been out there a  long time.   How long have we tried to fix the national parks and the boat ramps  and the wildlife refuges and the roads and the national forests and the  Indian schools, which are in shambles in many cases? Decades. We have  been going  [[Page S2928]]  and using up our parks and our public lands, and we haven't been  maintaining them.   Again, you don't just get to go to the public land in Kansas, if you  are from Kansas, or to the Great Smokies, if you are from Tennessee or  North Carolina, or to Yellowstone, if you are from Wyoming or Montana-- all of us go to that, and we have let them run down. That is about  people. That is about people.   Here we are in this big COVID-19 crisis. What does everyone want to  do today more than anything else? Get outdoors. Get out of the house.  Here you are, cooped up with teenagers or Grandma or all of you, just a  few people sitting there for 3 months. You want a little space.   The people who go to these open spaces are the people who live on the  coast. They live in the big cities. They want a little variety in their  lives, and we are glad for them to have it. When they go, they don't  want a bathroom that doesn't work or a visitors center that is in  shambles. They don't want a pothole in the road or a trail that is worn  down. They would like to have a place they could enjoy, that is in good  shape, and they can go home.   I think about the campground on Chilhowee Mountain just outside the  Smokies. There might be a few campers from Louisiana who like to come  up there whenever we play LSU. I don't know, but probably there are.  Well, it has been closed for 2 or 3 years because the sewage system  doesn't work. That is at least 500 families who don't get to have the  opportunity to do that.   I am sympathetic to the Senator from Louisiana. I think he is one of  our most able Senators. He is making a very forceful argument for a  real problem: coastal resiliency. But I don't buy this idea that just  because this bill doesn't fix that problem we should jeopardize this  bill.   Think about it. We have the President of the United States, who  personally is interested in this bill. His Secretary of the Interior  came down to Tennessee to see me 2\1/2\ years ago. It is the  first administration that said: ``We are going to look at the money we  get from energy exploration, and after we give some to Louisiana and  after we give some to Wyoming and after we give some to Alaska and the  other coastal States, we are going to take half of what is left for 5  years, and we are going to use it to fix all of those things that need  to be fixed in our national treasures.''    I said: ``OK, if the President is going to support it and his Office  of Management and Budget is going to be the first Office of Management  and Budget to allow money to be spent in that way, I am going to get  behind it.''   Then I came up here and fell into some pretty good company; the  Senator from Colorado, the Senator from Montana, Senator Warner from  Virginia, and Senator Portman from Ohio were already working on the  subject. Senator King of Maine, Senator Heinrich, Senator Cantwell were  involved in the land and water. It became absolutely clear that, if we  didn't put these two bills together, none of them--neither of them-- would pass. If they didn't go together, neither of them would pass.   We consulted with all of the people in the Senate who were working on  this. There wasn't complete agreement. There were a number of Senators  who had other amendments that they would have liked to have, Senators  whom I greatly respect and whose amendments I would probably support by  the one. But as we looked at it and as we consulted with the more than  800 groups--the sportsmen, the anglers, the environmental groups--we  all agreed that our only chance to get both bills was to put them  together and say to the Senate: ``Let's vote on it; let's send it to  the House to see if they will vote on it; and after 60 years of trying,  maybe we can get a good result.''   I think that is why we got 80 votes. The first time, this came up on  a procedural vote, and 79 the second time it came up.   A number of Senators have gone home tonight because this is a late- night vote. The reason we are having a late-night vote is because those  who agree with Senator Cassidy have insisted on taking the maximum  amount of time. That is their right to do, so we are here. If we  succeed tonight, then we will have three votes on Monday, all of which  are very important votes. So we are close to getting this train to the  station.   Senator Cassidy has made an eloquent appeal to add an idea that is  good, but an idea that is big and complex and deserves its own day in  the Sun, just as it came to our Energy Committee, of which I sit and he  sits. I voted for it at that time, but we just can't add it to this  bill and get this train to the station. That is the fact of the matter.   As much as I respect him and his ideas, I hope that he and others who  agree with him would say: ``Look, this is our one chance to get this  kind of funding to make our national parks and all the rest of our  public lands--the boat ramps, the trails, the roads, the sewage--our  one chance to begin to fix the maintenance over a 5-year period of time  instead of 10, 15, 25 years, or never. It is our one chance to do  that.''   I am sure it is our one chance to get the Land and Water Conservation  Fund permanently funded, as Congress agreed to do in 1964 and as  President Reagan's Commission on America's Outdoors, which I chaired in  1985 and 1986, recommended as its No. 1 priority.   Let's not try to preach the whole Bible in one sermon. We have two  good big ideas. Together, they make the most important piece of  conservation legislation in a half century.   You say: ``Well, Senators are always exaggerating.'' I don't try to  exaggerate too much, and I defy anyone to point me another bill that  does more. I know we have been working on land and water since 1964.  That is more than a half century. I know that this deferred maintenance  has been building up for a long, long time. It is the single biggest  problem the national parks and our public lands have.   I think 95 percent of the American people would wonder why we can't  pass it in 5 minutes. The reason is, there are lots of good ideas here,  and if you load them all up in the same wheelbarrow or on the same  train, the wheelbarrow collapses, and the train doesn't get to the  station. That is where we are. That is where we are.   I hope that, with respect to the good ideas advocated tonight by the  Senator from Louisiana--I know he will keep at it. I am on the same  committee he is. I have voted for his idea before. I think it deserves  its day in the Sun, and I will help him do that, but I would like to  ask him to help us finish the job here on the most important piece of  conservation legislation. I want him to know that those LSU Tigers are  always welcome in the Great Smoky Mountains, even if we bought it and  paid for it and gave it to the whole country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12:01 a.m.,  Friday, June 12; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of  Calendar No. 75, H.R. 1957.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, June 12, 2020, at 12:01 a.m.                            ____________________
