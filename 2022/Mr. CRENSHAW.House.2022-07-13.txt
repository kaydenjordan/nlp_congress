 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendment No. 23 to  create a grant program for psychedelic treatment for PTSD. That may  come as a shock to many, and I say good, because to be frank, we need  new ideas because it seems we are losing the battle with veteran  suicide.   For our Active Duty servicemembers, the situation is even worse, as  they are precluded from even trying treatments such as psychedelics  that could save their lives and bring hope to their families. I aim to  change that.   First of all, this form of treatment actually isn't new. It is  proven, and it is tested. Many hear the word psychedelics, and they  think acid trips from the sixties. They believe this amendment would  legalize or deschedule psychedelics, but that is not what we are  talking about here.   What we are talking about is the proven use of psychedelics to treat  PTSD. Private-sector research shows that following MDMA treatments, 88  percent of veterans have a significant reduction in symptoms, and 67  percent no longer have PTSD.   This treatment also has a face. It is servicemembers like Jonathan  Lubecky, a veteran who made multiple suicide attempts until psychedelic  treatments saved his life. He credits his treatment as the reason that  his son, Joey, has a father instead of a folded flag.   It is a man like Marcus Capone, a SEAL Team Six operator, who credits  psychedelic therapy with treating his PTSD, saving his life, and  bringing his family back together.   It is my own friends, people I served with on the SEAL Teams who have  told me that this cost effective, often one-time treatment has  completely transformed their life. All I am asking is that we give our  servicemembers the ability to access this treatment instead of forcing  them to travel abroad to psychedelic clinics to save their own life.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to get outside of their comfort zone  and vote for this amendment. Our servicemembers deserve it.
