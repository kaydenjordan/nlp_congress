 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1244 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1244         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3884) to       decriminalize and deschedule cannabis, to provide for       reinvestment in certain persons adversely impacted by the War       on Drugs, to provide for expungement of certain cannabis       offenses, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 116-67, modified by the       amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I feel I need to respond  to the meltdown that occurred right before the vote on the Republican  side.   As the distinguished minority leader knows, House Democrats have sent  two major coronavirus relief bills over to the Senate. Sadly, those  bills have been gathering dust on Mitch McConnell's desk. He has  refused to schedule a vote and a debate on those bills.   But the good news is that today, at 12:45, we find out that Leader  McConnell and Speaker Pelosi have spoken about their shared commitment  to completing an omnibus and COVID relief package as soon as possible.  I take that as good news.   We can walk and chew gum at the same time in this Democratic- controlled House of Representatives. That means we need to deal with  not only passing an omnibus bill and a COVID relief bill, but we have  other work that needs to be done as well.   I find it curious, Mr. Speaker, that the bill the minority leader  objected to is a bill that deals with the unequal enforcement of our  drug laws where people are treated differently and more negatively  because of the color of their skin. Really?   My distinguished Republican friend did not object to any of the bills  we are bringing up today sponsored by Republicans--five different  bills--but he chose to object to a bill that is addressing the issue of  racial justice.   Now, I guess I shouldn't be surprised because it is consistent with  the attitudes that come out of this White House, but it also makes  clear to me that the Republican Party is no longer the party of  Lincoln. It is the party of some of the most intolerant voices on the  rightwing and those who dabble in conspiracy theories. It really is  sad.   The Republicans made a motion that the House do now adjourn to  highlight the fact that we are able to vote remotely in this Chamber in  the midst of a pandemic. The leader said that nearly one-third of the  Democratic Caucus didn't vote yesterday, which, by the way, they did  because we do have responsible voting rules in place in the middle of  this pandemic. Now, get this, Mr. Speaker. But then, right after saying  that, 95 percent of the Republican Conference didn't even show up to  vote. You can't make this stuff up, Mr. Speaker.   They didn't vote in person, and they didn't vote remotely--nothing.  Maybe I am missing something here, but I don't think the strategy was  very well thought through.   The distinguished minority leader is puzzled why we have passed rules  that allow people to vote remotely during this pandemic. I have a news  flash for him: Close to 275,000 people are dead. We have colleagues,  both Democratic colleagues and Republican colleagues, who have been  infected by this virus.   While many Republicans are rushing to attend maskless superspreader  Christmas parties at the White House, we in the Democratic majority are  following the guidelines by the Attending Physician in the Capitol, by  the CDC, by Dr. Fauci, and by every reputable medical expert in the  world.   Operating remotely during a pandemic, I want to tell my friend, is  not radical, it is not unique, and it is not unprecedented or lazy. It  is responsible. It is constitutional. The Supreme Court is working  remotely, as are legislators around the country and around the world.   We aren't doing this because it is convenient, Mr. Speaker. We are  doing it because it is necessary, and we are doing it because we want  to save lives.   So, we invite our Republican colleagues to join us, to be  responsible, and to understand why these rules are so incredibly  important and maybe set an example for others in this country,  especially those who operate in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.   Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 1244, providing  [[Page H6062]]  for the consideration of H.R. 3884, the Marijuana Opportunity  Reinvestment and Expungement Act, under a closed rule. The rule  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary. It self-executes  a manager's amendment by Chairman Nadler, and it provides for one  motion to recommit with or without instructions.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to continue our effort to reform our  Nation's failed approach to the war on drugs, to put racial justice at  the heart of our Nation's Federal cannabis policy, and to make  restorative justice a reality for so many Americans. This is what the  public has demanded for so long, that Congress address the broken  status quo that allows the color of someone's skin to dictate the  repercussions of their actions.   This is not hyperbole, Mr. Speaker. Cannabis accounts for almost half  of all drug arrests in our country--half. Most are arrested for  possessing small amounts, not for selling or manufacturing anything.   That is bad enough. But today in America, Mr. Speaker, you are nearly  four times more likely to be arrested for cannabis if you are Black.  Communities of color use cannabis at roughly the same rate as their  White counterparts, but if you look like me, Mr. Speaker, you are far  less likely to face the same penalties.   I am not okay with that, and nobody should be. I am not okay with a  system that treats those who have been convicted of minor cannabis  offenses like they are some kind of drug kingpin. And I am not okay  with a system that sends people to prison for cannabis-related offenses  even in States where recreational cannabis use has been legalized.   To do nothing about this is intolerable, and to pretend like this is  a problem for communities of color to solve alone is inexcusable.   America's failed war on drugs helped create this problem. It will  take a national, holistic approach to resolve it.   H.R. 3884 represents a major step forward. It complements other  bipartisan criminal justice reform bills passed in this Congress and in  the 115th Congress.   This underlying bill removes cannabis from the Controlled Substances  Act, decriminalizing it at the Federal level so States can set their  own laws.   It also puts a process in place to expunge prior convictions made in  Federal courts and establishes services to help those convicted of  cannabis-related crimes whose lives have been harmed by the war on  drugs, because no lives should be destroyed by this failed policy.   Finally, this bill also makes Small Business Administration funding  available for legitimate cannabis-related businesses while helping  ensure people of color can participate in this thriving industry.   This is what beginning to reverse the failed war on drugs looks like,  Mr. Speaker. It is a testament to all of those who have fought for a  fresh and more effective approach year after year after year.   Now, I have worked side by side with many of them in this effort  since I was first elected to Congress back in 1996. For so long, we  were told the same thing. We were told to wait, to wait, to wait. Well,  cannabis-related amendments couldn't even get a fair fight on this  floor under the prior Republican Congresses. Not a single one was ever  made in order in the 112th, 113th, or 114th Congresses--not one. We  could bring no bill to the floor related to cannabis. The only one made  in order last Congress was an amendment to eradicate illegal grow  operations on National Forest System land.   Congress has stood idly by for too long as communities of color, in  particular, were being torn apart. This majority, Mr. Speaker, is  committed to doing something about it. The House has debated more  amendments on cannabis policy last year than it did during my entire 20  years in Congress, and now we are moving forward with the most sweeping  reforms in generations. This is what a more responsive Congress looks  like.   Now, some, particularly on the other side, have wondered why we are  moving forward with these reforms now. We must soon fund the government  for the next fiscal year and pass the annual defense bill. We are also  trying to prod the Senate to get serious about a true COVID relief  bill.   Again, as I said earlier, we have a little bit of hopeful news, based  on the conversation between the Speaker and the Senate majority leader.  We have a lot to do in the waning days of this Congress, and I get  that. But the answer is simple. This is not an either-or proposition.  Congress, as I said before, can walk and chew gum at the same time.   A recent survey found that nearly 60 percent of Americans support  this underlying bill. That includes a majority of both Democrats and  Republicans. The facts are clear, and the public wants Congress to act.   The question is, what are we going to do about it?   I think it is time for us to take a stand, to stand for restorative  justice, to stand for racial justice, to stand for criminal justice  reform, and to stand with the majority of Americans demanding reforms  to our Nation's cannabis policy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of  the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished  ranking member, Mr. Cole.   We are going to miss you, Rob, and this may be my final opportunity  to be able to yield to you during a rules debate. The end of Congress  is obviously rapidly approaching, and you have decided to retire from  Congress after a very distinguished career. We have spent countless  hours not only up in the Committee on Rules, but together on this floor  debating many contentious issues. My distinguished friend from Georgia  is always very focused, and he is always right on message and he is  really quite impressive.   Mr. Speaker, every once in a while, my mother watches these  proceedings, and she will always say: You know, that Woodall guy, he is  a very good debater.   And I always say: Well, what about me? I mean, do you have anything  nice to say about your son?   But the bottom line is I have had some of my best fights with you,  and we have disagreed on a lot of issues, but we have disagreed without  being disagreeable.   The Committee on Rules has to deal with a lot of contentious issues.  We have dealt with our share of contentious issues in this last  Congress, but I have really taken great comfort and great inspiration  by the example of you, Mr. Woodall and Mr. Cole and others who  understand the incredible nature and the incredible majesty of this  institution that we get to serve in. So even among these contentious  debates, you have never, ever drawn us down. It has always been in a  way that is respectful and that honors your convictions and your  beliefs.   We have been together early in the morning; we have been together in  the middle of the afternoon, late at night. We meet a lot in the  Committee on Rules, but Mr. Woodall's good nature and his sense of  humor, whether it is intentional or unintentional, makes it a little  more interesting and, I dare say, makes it a lot more fun.   So I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the many years of  distinguished service, both your near decade of service as a Member of  Congress and before that, as Mr. Cole pointed out, your service working  for Congressman John Linder, who was also on the Committee on Rules.   You have brought with you some incredible people as well. I see your  longtime Committee on Rules staffer Janet Rossi on the floor here  today. She is here to honor your service, as well as the others who are  here today. And I just want to thank her for all of her work in the  Committee on Rules as well over these years.   I always think it is really hard to be a staff member and work for us  on the Committee on Rules because you have to listen to all of us go on  forever and ever and ever.   Mr. Speaker, let me just close with this, and that is I think you and  I come from different parts of the country and we have very different  points of view on our politics, but to me, politics should be about  conviction, not about political opportunism or flip-flopping with  whatever way the prevailing winds are going.    What I have always admired about you is that you feel strongly about  what you believe in. You know what you believe in and you fight for  your convictions, whether it is popular or not popular. And I agree  with Mr. Cole when he said that this institution would be better served  if we had more Members like you.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you, and I hope you come by the  Committee on Rules next time you come back to Washington, and maybe if  I get lost and I am in Georgia, I will stop by your firm and we can  reminisce.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my good friend from Arizona. I am  not sure she was on the floor earlier when I announced that, finally,  Mitch McConnell seems willing to want to negotiate a deal, not only on  an omnibus bill, but he seems to be interested in talking about how we  can get a COVID relief bill. This notwithstanding the fact that for the  last over six months, he has held everything up. We have actually sent  two major COVID relief bills over to the Senate. So I am hopeful. I am  going to try to be hopeful that, in fact, this is for real.   I would also say that the focus of this bill is on unfair, unequal,  and racist drug laws. I mean, as I said in my opening statement, if  people want to know what systemic racism is, look at how our drug laws  are enforced in this country.   If you look like me and you were caught with a small amount of  cannabis, you would probably get off with a very, very light sentence,  if anything. But if the color of your skin were black or brown, it is a  whole different story.   I mean, our system of drug laws is what systemic racism is in this  country. No matter what you think about, you know, States legalizing  marijuana or not legalizing marijuana, or whatever, I think we all  ought to be committed to making sure there is equal justice under our  laws.   People's lives were ruined because of the color of their skin and how  our drug laws were enforced. It is wrong. The time has long since  passed for us to do something. That is what this is all about.   So we will work on the COVID relief bill, and I hope that Mitch  McConnell is sincere in what he said to Speaker Pelosi. I believe we  will come together on an omnibus bill to keep our Government running,  but we also need to address issues like this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the gentleman from Ohio, I think we  all know what needs to happen, and that is that the Senate majority  leader needs to be willing to come to the table and sit down and work  out a deal.   We heard today that the Speaker has had a constructive conversation  with him. Hopefully we will end up with something that, quite frankly,  is going to help a lot more people than what the gentleman is  suggesting here. What we do know is that nobody has been working harder  than the Speaker of the House to try to get a COVID relief bill. She  met around the clock with Secretary Mnuchin, with anybody in this  administration who would be willing to come to the table.   Our problem has been the Senate. Now, that may be changing today. I  hope it is. But I would also say that we have sent over two major COVID  relief bills, which, unfortunately, the gentleman voted against, which  would help not just small businesses, but help our schools, help our  first responders; help with PPE for people who, quite frankly, are  running short right now as we see another surge; help support our  cities and towns that are struggling; and help support our restaurants.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his kind words. I  almost feel like I want to yield him more time to have the compliments  keep coming.   The bottom line is that even though we disagree on a lot of issues,  and sometimes in our debates you make me want to pull the remaining  last two strands of hair out of my head, the reason why I sometimes  feel that way is because you are passionate, you are smart, and you are  effective. You have served your constituency incredibly well, and you  have served this institution incredibly well.   Mr. Speaker, going back to what Mr. Cole said at the very beginning,  I think this place would benefit from more people of your caliber. And  even though you would like to demote me to ranking member instead of  chairman, I am still going to miss you, and I thank you for your  friendship. You are a good man, and we are going to miss you a lot.                                time  1500    Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill deserves to be considered and  passed. As I said earlier, nearly 60 percent of the American public  supports this bill. A majority of Democrats and a majority of  Republicans throughout the Nation want this bill passed.   Prior Republican Congresses were apparently fine with turning a deaf  ear to the will of the people. They blocked virtually all cannabis- related measures from getting a vote on the floor year after year.   But this majority is not. We believe in listening to the people we  represent. We believe in actually doing something about the war on  drugs. Its failures have been staring us in the face for a very long  time.   Americans came together in record numbers following George Floyd's  death to fight against systemic racism. Combating that means, among  other things, reforming our policies toward cannabis. These laws have  been used to disproportionately lock up people of color for decades. It  is past time we showed the moral courage to do something about it.   This is a historic moment. Let us seize this chance. Let us pass this  bill. I urge everyone to vote ``yes'' on the previous question, and I  urge a vote of ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1244         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 8265) to amend the Small Business Act and the       CARES Act to establish a program for second draw loans and       make other modifications to the paycheck protection program,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small       Business; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 8265.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.  [[Page H6068]]     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order at any time to consider a conference report to accompany H.R.  6395; that all points of order against the conference report and  against its consideration be waived; that the conference report be  considered as read; and that the previous question be considered as  ordered on the conference report to its adoption without intervening  motion except: one, 1 hour of debate; and, two, one motion to recommit  if applicable.
