 Madam President, I submit the following statement  to the Record in memory of Maury Wills, who passed away on September  19, 2022, at the age of 89.   Before there was Lou Brock and Rickey Henderson, there was Maury  Wills. When he stole 104 bases in 1962, he not only beat out Willie  Mays for the National League MVP award, he broke the single season  stolen base record held by Ty Cobb that had stood for 47 years. That  year, he was also named the first Black captain in the history of the  Dodgers organization.   A native of Washington, DC, Maury was inspired to pursue a Major  League career after attending a youth baseball clinic held by Jerry  Priddy of the Washington Senators.   Maury was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers at the age of 17. He  spent a decade in their Minor League system, honing his skills and  working his way to the Major League.   When Maury finally made it to the big league, he quickly became a  foundational part of the Dodgers teams that went to four World Series  from 1959 to 1966. During that time, he won two Gold Gloves and was  named to five All Star teams. Maury, and so many other Dodgers legends  from the era, helped Los Angeles fall in love with professional  baseball.   In the years following his playing career, Maury had stints as an  announcer, manager, and even entertainer. He was also able to overcome  addiction with the help of his future wife Angela George and support of  the Dodgers organization. Maury was open about his challenges with  addiction in hopes that others could learn from his journey to  sobriety.   Maury remained a member of the Dodgers family until his death. For  years, he served as a base stealing and bunting instructor. He even  helped mentor a young outfielder named Dave Roberts, who would go on to  have one of the most famous stolen bases in MLB history in the 2004  American League Championship Series. Maury's intensity and passion for  the game was evident when I visited Dodgers Spring Training a few years  ago; it was clear why they referred to his spot in the facility as  Maury's Pit.   I join Dodger fans across the Nation in remembering Maury and sending  our condolences to his family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  bipartisan American Music Fairness Act, which I introduced with Senator  Blackburn today.   Artists pour their heart and soul into the music we enjoy.  Unfortunately, our current copyright laws do not adequately reflect the  value of what they have produced.   Currently, the United States is the only democratic country in the  world in which artists are not compensated for the use of their music  on AM/FM radio.   By requiring broadcast radio corporations to pay performance  royalties to creators for AM/FM radio plays, the American Music  Fairness Act would close an antiquated loophole in our copyright law  which has prevented artists from receiving compensation for the use of  their music for far too long.   This royalty stream would be particularly meaningful for the  thousands of working-class artists who are a critical part of our  country's vibrant music industry, and it would also be particularly  meaningful for artists who are not readily able to tour and perform, as  has unfortunately been the case for artists during the COVID pandemic.   Additionally and importantly, when American-made music is played  overseas, other countries collect royalties for American artists and  producers but never pay those royalties to our artists because we do  not reciprocate. This inequity costs the American economy and artists  more than $200 million each year. This is a serious injustice  considering that America is the origin of so much of the music listened  to around the world.   So it is time once and for all to create a regime that is platform  neutral and which respects the hard work and dignity of our artists.   But I also want to be clear about something. I am a huge fan of and  true believer in the importance of local radio to the music industry  and to communities all across the United States that rely on radio to  receive timely and relevant news, entertainment, and emergency response  information. The American Music Fairness Act recognizes and  acknowledges the important role that locally-owned radio stations play  by including protections for small, college, and noncommercial  stations.   I want to thank Senator Blackburn for introducing this bill with me,  and I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting the thousands of  artists across this country who create the music that contributes to  the soundtrack of our lives.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Daines, and Mr.          Toomey):   S. 4939. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent  double dipping between tax credits and grants or loans for clean  vehicle manufacturers; to the Committee on Finance.
