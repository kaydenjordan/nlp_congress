 Mr. Speaker, this week we mark the sixth anniversary of  the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which left 26  dead, including 20 children ages 6 and 7. In the years since, there  have been 1,917 mass shootings, killing 2,175 men, women, and children  and wounding more than 6,000.   The worst of these shootings occurred in the heart of my district at  the Route 91 music festival when a gunman opened fire on the crowd,  killing 58 and injuring more than 800.   The list of victims grows every day, and yet on this floor there is  only silence. This past November, voters sent a strong message by  rejecting those who stand in the way of commonsense gun violence  prevention.   We can never bring back those who are lost to gun violence, but from  universal background checks to a ban on bump stocks, come January, we  can and will take action.                            ____________________
