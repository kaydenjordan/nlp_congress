 Madam Speaker, this is why the American people get  frustrated with Congress. They get frustrated when folks here play  politics. They get frustrated when there are unnecessary crises  created.   Rather than vote to pay our bills, as was done three times under the  last President, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have us on  a path to a disastrous default. That is, unless this body agrees to gut  programs that working families in my State depend on.   The American people get frustrated when these issues are treated like  a game and when our constituents are the ones who lose. There will be  4,800 kids who will lose access to preschool and childcare; 37,000  women, infants, and kids who will lose help with food; 89,000 college  students who will see their costs go up.   I don't say this in a partisan way. These are just facts. The cuts  proposed by my Republican colleagues would cut law enforcement, food  safety, and vital support to families across our State.   That is not a good idea. We can do better. We should do better.                            ____________________
