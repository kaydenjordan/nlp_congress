 Madam President, today the thoughts of the Senate are  with the people of Monterey Park, CA, as they heal from this weekend's  tragic and terrible shooting. What should have been a weekend of joy  and celebration within the AAPI community as they celebrate the Lunar  New Year, turned into another occasion of grief and mourning.   I spoke yesterday with the sheriff of Los Angeles County and assured  him that the Federal Government is ready to provide whatever assistance  they need right now. While first responders are still investigating the  causes of this incident, it is clear that the prevalence of guns in our  country have made tragedies like this one too frequent. While the  Senate passed bipartisan gun safety legislation last year--and that was  a very welcome move--more should be done.   My thoughts are with all the families and the loved ones of the  victims of this insidious attack. I thank all the first responders and  even the private citizens who responded quickly to stop the shooter and  prevent even more lives from tragically being cut short.                                118th Congress    Madam President, I want to also welcome our new colleague from  Nebraska and wish him the best.   Now, this week, for the first time in the 118th Congress, both  Chambers gavel into session to begin anew the work of serving the  American people. It is a new era here in Congress, an era of divided  government where both parties will have to demonstrate they can work  together to solve our Nation's problems. Democrats begin the 118th  Congress with an open hand of cooperation, and I urge my Republican  colleagues to respond in kind so we can hit the ground running.   We have a lot of difficult and important work ahead of us, perhaps  none more important than working together to raise the debt ceiling and  protecting the full faith and credit of the United States. In America,  when it is time to pay the bills, we have followed through on our  obligations without any exception.   In the months to come, I expect we are going to hear a lot from our  Republican colleagues about the debt ceiling. So let me begin by making  a few things perfectly clear at the onset.   First, few issues require more bipartisanship, cooperation, and  serious-mindedness than making sure that America is able to pay its  debts on time. At stake is the health of our economy and the very  stability of the global financial system. Should the U.S. default on  its debt, the consequences could be severe, and it is going to affect  just about every average American family. This is not some esoteric  issue that is just abstract and way up there in the clouds. It is going  to affect all of us.   Listen to what could happen if we default: Interest rates will go up  on mortgages, on car loans, on credit cards; pensions, the money people  have put aside, will lose billions, so will IRAs and 401Ks, in all  likelihood. Home values will decline because when mortgage interest  rates go up people are willing to pay less for homes. That is a lot of  money for lots of people. For many people, their home is their rock. It  is all they have. By playing brinksmanship, some of the MAGA  Republicans on the other side of the aisle, on the other side in the  House, are risking just that.   So, again, this is not an abstract issue. Real Americans will see  real dollars from so much of what they own disappear from their  pensions, their IRAs, their home value. Merely approaching a default  could raise costs on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit  card interest rates.   So it is going to hurt average families. This is not an abstract  argument. And as the months go on, and as we get closer and closer to  the day that we have to act, the American people will see this, and we  are going to make sure of that.   Second, raising the debt ceiling has consistently been a bipartisan  responsibility for decades. Neither party has played brinksmanship.  Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been raised approximately 80 times  under both Republican and Democratic administrations, under both  unified and divided government. I will note once again that while  President Trump was in office and Republicans had the House and Senate,  Democrats voted to raise the debt ceiling. We did it not once, not  twice, but three times, including twice under Republican majorities in  the House and Senate. Of course, we could have done what some MAGA  Republicans want, threatening to block debt ceiling extensions unless  we got our way. But we knew how badly it would hurt the American  people, and we didn't do it. This time should be no different.  Brinksmanship, hostage-taking, default on the debt should be off the  table. Both parties should work together to ensure we can continue to  pay our debt on time, and we Democrats are ready to move quickly in  order to make that happen. Indeed, we are ready to move well in advance  of default, because even brinksmanship over the debt ceiling can cause  serious damage to the economy and to individual American families.   Unfortunately, Madam President--unfortunately, House Republicans have  kicked off their new majority by saying yes to brinksmanship, yes to  hostage-taking, and yes even to risking default, all because of  draconian spending cuts pushed by the hard right. House Republicans'  approach to the debt ceiling is dangerous, destabilizing, and the only  thing it accomplishes is making a bipartisan solution less likely. If  Republicans want to show that they can govern effectively, they are off  to a pretty poor start.   If House Republicans are serious about taking the debt limit hostage  in exchange for spending cuts, the new rules that they adopted require  them to bring a proposal to the floor of the House and show the  American people precisely what kind of cuts they want to make. It is  not enough to hide behind the old GOP talking points about wasteful  spending. When you are in the majority, substance counts. If  Republicans are talking about draconian cuts, they have an obligation  to show Americans what those cuts are and let the public react. And  let's let them do it now, not 6 months from now when the danger of  default is much closer.   House Republicans: You voted for rules that require regular order for  bringing bills to the floor. So put your proposals for debt ceiling on  the floor, let the entirety of the House debate it and vote on it, and  let the American people see and assess these cuts for themselves.  Otherwise, Americans are going to be left with some pretty big  questions.   Republicans say they want spending cuts. Well, does that mean cuts to  Social Security or Medicare or childcare or Pell grants or our military  or pay raises for our troops or funding police and law enforcement?   Many House Republicans are serious about cutting national defense in  exchange for raising the debt ceiling. I hope they are not but many  seem to be--or maybe they are pushing cuts to public health and nurses  and hospitals. Whatever the case may be, Americans deserve to know what  kind of cuts Republicans want to make and why they think it is worth  forcing an unnecessary crisis that will hurt most American families.   Frankly, I expect the House Republicans themselves will struggle to  come up with a serious answer, because deep down, they know that no  matter what they propose, their cuts are likely to be deeply unpopular  with the American people.   This is the central quandary of the new majority. By yielding so much  to the whims of the MAGA hard right,  [[Page S43]]  House Republicans have boxed themselves in and now have to choose  between serving the American people or pleasing the extremists within  their ranks. We are already seeing this play out when it comes to the  debt ceiling.   I yield the floor.
