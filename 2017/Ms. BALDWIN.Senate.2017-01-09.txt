 Mr. President, I rise this evening to join my  colleagues--Democrats, Independents--to fight together to protect the  health and economic security of the American people.   In 2012, when I was elected to the Senate, I can assure you that the  people of Wisconsin did not send me here to take their health care  away.   We are barely into the second week of the new Congress, and the  Republican establishment is already wielding its power to accomplish  just one thing, making America sick again.   The budget resolution that we are considering this week will repeal  the Affordable Care Act, put insurance companies back in charge of  people's health care, strip health care away from millions of  Americans, and raise premiums. It will take us from affordable coverage  to chaos.   This is the first step toward higher costs, fewer people with health  insurance, and more uncertainty for American families. In short, the  Republicans believe they have a mandate to make America sick. By  repealing the law and taking away the health care that families already  have, Republicans are forcing 30 million Americans to lose their  insurance.   Republicans are putting the health care coverage of over 200,000  Wisconsinites at risk, and they are raising taxes on more than 190,000  Wisconsinites who rely on and receive premium tax credits to help them  afford high quality health insurance.   Instead, they are giving tax breaks to big corporations and handing  over control to the insurance companies, which will be free, once  again, to deny coverage if you have a preexisting condition, to jack up  premiums simply because you are a woman, and to drop your coverage if  you get sick or have a baby.   I could continue to list some very disturbing facts and statistics of  what this Republican repeal of health care reform will do to our  working class and what it will mean to rip away protections from  families struggling with cancer or other serious illnesses, but these  facts seem to fall flat on the other side of the aisle. So, instead, I  am demanding that my Republican colleagues listen--not to me but to the  calls from the real people who we are here to represent and fight for,  our constituents back home.   I demand that they listen to Randy. Randy is from Rhinelander, WI.  Randy told me that the Affordable Care Act has been a ``savior'' for  his wife, who was diagnosed with kidney failure more than 2 years ago  as a result of an autoimmune disease. She has to have dialysis three  times a week.   The law eliminated her lifetime maximum limit, and that helps them  afford her lifesaving care, and it prevents her from being denied  coverage because of her preexisting condition.   Randy said that repealing the law will force them to face the harsh  reality of not only losing insurance but also declaring bankruptcy.   I also heard from Sheila, from Neenah, WI. Sheila is a small business  owner who relies on the premium tax credits that helped her purchase  her health plan through the marketplace. She writes:         I just wanted to let you know how devastating it will be       for my family if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. To take       away the subsidies would pretty much turn the plan into the       Unaffordable Care Act.    Sheila has owned a small hair salon for 35 years and said that the  premium tax credits under the law have made it possible for her to buy  decent health insurance for the first time in her whole career.   I want my Republican colleagues to listen to Joel. Joel is a  physician from Milwaukee. He is on the frontlines of delivering high  quality health care, and he told me that he had witnessed tremendous  good that has occurred as a result of the health care law. He has been  able to provide his patients with better care because they have  increased coverage. He is especially aware of the positive impact of  allowing children to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26.   But Joel remembers the days before the Affordable Care Act. He said  that he has seen firsthand the insurance companies callously denying or  dropping coverage for families with preexisting conditions or those  struggling with a new diagnosis. He doesn't want to go back to the days  when insurance companies were in charge and literally dictated his  patients' health.   I want my Republican colleagues to listen to Chelsea from Shelby, WI.  When Chelsea was pregnant with her daughter Zoe, she learned that Zoe  would be born with a congenital heart defect. At just 5 days old, Zoe  had to have open heart surgery. She had it at Children's Hospital in  Wauwatosa, WI, and was fighting for her life. Thankfully, she is  recovering, and she is living a healthy life.   Chelsea wrote to me:         The Affordable Care Act protects my daughter, it allows her       to have health care access and not be denied. I'm pleading to       you as a mother to fight for that and follow through on that       promise. There are so many kids in Wisconsin with heart       defects (as well as other kids with pre-existing conditions)       that are counting on you to protect that right.    So for Zoe, I want to call on my Republican colleagues to stand with  me--with all of us--to protect these health care rights and benefits  for all of our families.   These are our families who are benefitting right now from the  protections in the law and the quality, affordable health care options  it provides. They are calling on Congress, calling on the Republican  majority to stop their plot that is going to take this all away.   I could continue to share stories of real Wisconsinites whose  coverage is at risk today, but I want to take a moment to illustrate  what life was like before the Affordable Care Act was the law of the  land, before these sweeping reforms and protections had been put in  place.   Now, during my time in the House of Representatives, Sue from Beloit,  WI, reached out to me. She told me:         My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. After treatment       began, we found out that the insurance company had a small       loophole. Under our insurance, they have a $13,000 limit per       year on radiation and chemotherapy.        That amount did not even cover the first treatment of       either radiation or chemo.  [[Page S171]]         I was not going to have my husband die for lack of       treatment, so we started to use our savings and our available       credit to pay for medical expenses.        My husband later died.    She told me:         After having completely depleted our savings and facing       insurmountable credit card debt, I had no choice but to file       bankruptcy. . . .    Sue's devastating ordeal was a common story all across our country,  almost 8 years ago, before health care reform was enacted to prohibit  lifetime caps and to restrict annual limits on care.   Before the health law, I heard from too many working Wisconsin  families that went bankrupt, sold their homes, and even spent their  entire life's savings just to get the health care that they needed.  This was when America was sick and when lawmakers prioritized the  health of insurance companies over the health of the American  people. Republicans will take us back to those days when they vote to  make America sick again.    I want to share one last story about life before the Affordable Care  Act, and that is my own. As many of you may know, I was raised by my  maternal grandparents in Madison, WI. When I was just 9 years old, I  was diagnosed with a serious childhood illness similar to spinal  meningitis, and I spent 3 months at the age of 9 years old in the  hospital. My grandparents had health insurance but learned that their  plan didn't cover me. Since their insurance didn't cover me, they made  incredible sacrifices to pay for the care that I needed. When I got  better, my grandparents did what any responsible parent or grandparent  would do: They looked for an insurance policy that would cover me into  the future, but look as they might, they discovered that because of my  previous illness, they couldn't find a policy. They couldn't find it  from any insurer at any price, and at 9 years old I had been branded  with those magic words: preexisting condition.   Well, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, children today have new  protections, and no one can be denied insurance coverage because of a  preexisting condition. My family experience helped inspire me to enter  public service and to fight to ensure that every American has quality,  affordable health care as a right, not a privilege. This is what I  fought for and will continue to fight with my colleagues to protect,  these vital benefits that the health care law guarantees to all  Wisconsinites and families across this great country.   But we cannot fight alone. Republicans are hard at work making  America sick again, taking us back from affordable care to chaos,  handing over the reins to insurance companies and driving up health  care costs for all Americans. I call on them to stand accountable to  our families. It is the American people that we are charged to  represent. I call on them to join us to fight for Sue who was forced  into medical bankruptcy. I call on them to fight to protect Zoe from  predatory insurance companies who want to deny her coverage because of  her heart condition, to fight for Sheila and other entrepreneurs like  her, and to fight for our health care professionals, nurse's aides,  occupational therapists, physical therapists like Joel, and to fight  for Randy and his wife as they battle her kidney failure.   We have been ready for over 6 years to work together to keep all that  works with the Affordable Care Act and to fix what doesn't, but instead  of working on bipartisan reforms to improve the Affordable Care Act,  this Republican plan to repeal historic health care reforms will create  nothing short of chaos. I know I speak for my colleagues, my Democratic  colleagues and Independent colleagues, in saying that we are here and  we will stay here on the floor because we are ready. We are ready to  work across the aisle to protect coverage and to improve the Affordable  Care Act, but we will not help you make America sick again and we will  not help you take away people's health care.   I yield the floor.
