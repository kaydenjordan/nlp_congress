 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3911) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with  respect to risk-based examinations of Nationally Recognized Statistical  Rating Organizations.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3911         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Risk-Based Credit       Examination Act''.       SEC. 2. RISK-BASED EXAMINATIONS OF NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED                     STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS.         Section 15E(p)(3)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934       (15 U.S.C. 78o-7(p)(3)(B)) is  [[Page H8546]]       amended in the matter preceding clause (i), by inserting ``,       as appropriate,'' after ``Each examination under subparagraph       (A) shall include''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, nationally recognized statistical rating organizations-- or NRSROs, as they are known--have been heavily criticized for the role  that they played in facilitating the financial crisis.   In the years leading up to the crisis, the government adopted a  series of policies that had the effect of conferring a ``Good  Housekeeping'' seal of approval on the rating agencies and on their  products, including designating certain agencies as nationally  recognized--a label that they had put on--and hardwiring references to  their ratings into numerous Federal statutes and regulations.   These regulatory privileges and the perception that the government  had placed its blessing on the rating agencies' assessments led to a  sense of complacency among investors and a failure of private sector  due diligence that contributed to mispriced risk and a collapse of  market confidence when ratings of certain asset-backed securities were  called into question during the credit meltdown of 2007 and 2008.   Mr. Speaker, as a result, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated myriad  regulatory requirements on these NRSROs that were aimed at enhancing  their disclosure and transparency. While some of these provisions may  have been constructive, several created new barriers to entry and  further entrenched a type of rating agency oligopoly that has not  served investors or the economy well.   The Dodd-Frank Act follows a ``registration, not regulation''  approach. While it does not require the SEC--the Securities and  Exchange Commission--to regulate or evaluate the rating agencies'  methodologies or models, it does seek to ensure that ratings are based  on an objective application of the methodologies and that commercial  considerations do not influence ratings decisions.   Specifically, section 932, creates the Office of Credit Ratings at  the Securities and Exchange Commission, which imposes more stringent  conflict-of-interest regulations on credit rating agencies and gives  the compliance officers at these rating agencies additional  responsibilities, including filing annual reports with the SEC.   While credit agencies must be held accountable, these increased  reporting requirements have given the burden to small credit rating  agencies and have hurt investors who bear the true cost of these rules.  That one-size-fits-all annual reporting requirements imposed by Dodd- Frank on all NRSROs placed unnecessary burdens and compliance costs on  small NRSROs, who in no way were a cause of the financial crisis.   As a result of the annual reporting requirements, large NRSROs that  can absorb these compliance costs have gotten bigger; and smaller  NRSROs, for whom these compliance costs really impose a  disproportionate burden, they have been prevented from entering the  marketplace and providing necessary competition.   On May 15, 2013, former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary  Jo White wrote a letter on behalf of a unanimous commission to Chairman  Hensarling of the Financial Services Committee to request the  provisions of H.R. 3911 as a legislative proposal. She said: ``Rather  than focusing every year on each of the designated eight review areas,  allowing a risk-based approach would permit the SEC staff to tailor  examinations. . . . As a result, staff could focus limited resources on  these specific risks rather than reviewing the designated eight areas,  some of which may not present a risk for a particular firm. . . . `'   Consistent with former Chair White's request, H.R. 3911, statutorily  changes the annual reporting requirements so that they are risk-based,  instead of requiring the burdensome review of all eight review areas  currently mandated.   This approach is a commonsense balance that still ensures large  NRSROs are regulated while smaller NRSROs are provided necessary relief  to enter and thrive in the marketplace.   The legislation unanimously passed the Financial Services Committee  last month, and I was pleased to be a part of that.   At this time I would like to commend the bipartisan work of  Representatives Wagner and Foster on this important bill. I encourage  all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3911.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), who is the author of this  bill and chair of the Financial Services Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee and, as I had said, sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to echo the words of my  colleague from Michigan: a bipartisan, unanimous bill coming out of the  Financial Services Committee deserves the support of this House. We are  very pleased that we have been able to strike this accommodation, this  balance, between making sure that those rating agencies that truly did  have a hand in causing our economic downturn are separated from those  smaller institutions that really had nothing to do with that.    Now, with this overregulation that has occurred due to Dodd-Frank, I  have really been put at a disadvantage and, ironically, have lowered  competition in this space. So we believe that we are restoring some  commonsense provisions back into the law. With that, I would like to  encourage all of my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3911.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2148) to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to clarify  capital requirements for certain acquisition, development, or  construction loans, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2148         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as ``Clarifying Commercial Real       Estate Loans''.       SEC. 2. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN ACQUISITION,                     DEVELOPMENT, OR CONSTRUCTION LOANS.         The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended by adding at       the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 51.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision, an organization that, frankly, most  citizens might not have any idea exists, much less the effects and the  influences on their banking lives, the Basel Committee on Banking  Supervision agreed to modify internationally negotiated bank regulatory  standards, known as the Basel Accords. This was going to increase bank  capital requirements.   On July 9, 2013, the Federal banking regulators here in the United  States--including the Federal Reserve; the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, FDIC; and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,  OCC--all issued a final rule to implement most of the so-called Basel  III recommendations, including modifications to capital requirements.   Basel III imposes new rules for high volatility commercial real  estate, also known as HVCREs.   Unfortunately, we have a lot of acronyms in the Financial Services  space, but you will be hearing a lot about these HVCREs over the course  of the next few minutes.   These HVCRE rules are those which the regulations characterize as  loans that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of  real property. Loans that finance the acquisition, development, and  construction of one- to four-family residential properties, projects  that qualify as community development investment, and loans to  businesses or farms with gross revenue exceeding $1 million are exempt  from this HVCRE classification.   In June of 2017, the Treasury Department released its first report in  response to the President's February 2017 ``Core Principles for  Regulating the United States Financial System,'' informing the  administration's perspective to regulate the financial system. The  report, entitled, ``A Financial System That Creates Economic  Opportunities--Banks and Credit Unions,'' calls on regulators to  simplify and clarify the definition of these HVCRE loans to avoid the  application of excessively stringent postcrisis capital requirements  and concentration limits related to such loans, but does not identify  specific language and changes.   Additionally, in September of this past year, the OCC, FDIC, and the  Federal Reserve proposed a rule that attempted to simplify the  regulatory capital calculations for these HVCREs. The proposal would  change the current definition of HVCRE and replace it with a new  definition related to high volatility acquisition, development, or  construction loans. HVADC is what it has been dubbed.   The complexity of the HVCRE definition and its uncertain application  are making it difficult for banks to comply.   While we appreciate the various banking agencies' attempt at  simplifying the capital treatment of acquisition, development, and  construction loans, their proposal actually broadens the number of  loans subject to higher capital charge. This actually increases the  amount capital banks will be required to carry for these ADC loans-- hardly a simplification.   Increases in risk weighting on these loans have had a significant  impact on institutions' capital ratios and, as a result, have increased  costs to borrowers. If a loan is classified as an HVCRE loan, the  lender will face a lower return on its capital as a result of the  higher capital reserve requirement, meaning they are going to have to  hold more capital. This will lead to increased pricing on the loan,  including a higher interest rate for the borrower.   H.R. 2148, Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans, introduced by my  colleagues Representatives Pittenger and Scott, helps address the  uncertainty related to the Basel capital rules and its impact on  certain acquisition, development, or construction loans. The bill  clarifies the types of loans that should and should not be classified  as HVCREs and which types of equity can be used to meet capital  requirements.   Currently, that uncertainty is creating confusion and affecting  commercial real estate ADC loans by increasing borrowing costs and  reducing credit availability, which may be contributing to a slowdown  in commercial real estate lending.   I commend the bipartisan works of Representatives Pittenger and Scott  on this important bill. Having passed the Financial Services Committee  by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 59-1, there is no reason that  we shouldn't have the same overwhelming bipartisan support for H.R.  2148 today.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of  H.R. 2148, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), the vice chairman of the Terrorism and  Illicit Finance Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee and  the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), vice chairman of the  Financial Institutions Subcommittee of Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2148. I  commend my good friend, Mr. Pittenger, for his great work on this.  Again, I point out that this bill came out of the Financial Services  Committee on a bipartisan vote of 59-1. We think that this is a  commonsense, reasonable accommodation for a problem that has been  created by Dodd-Frank, and we are glad that, on a bipartisan basis, we  can be addressing that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
