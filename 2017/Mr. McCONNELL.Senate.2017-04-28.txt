 Madam President, with cooperation from our friends  across the aisle, the Senate will pass a short-term continuing  resolution before this evening so Members of both parties can continue  to work on a longer term solution.   The legislation should pass today, and it will carry us through next  week so that a bipartisan final agreement can be reached and so the  Members will have time to review the legislation before we take it up.   Importantly, this 1-week extension will ensure that thousands of  retired coal miners and their families, including many in my home State  of Kentucky and in the home State of the Acting President pro tempore,  West Virginia, will not lose their healthcare benefits.   Protecting these miners and their families from losing their  healthcare has been a top priority of mine as well as the occupant of  the Chair. Last year, I fought for a long-term extension of healthcare  benefits, and earlier this year, I introduced my own bill to provide a  permanent fix for miners' healthcare. I will continue to fight on their  behalf to secure a permanent solution on this issue in the larger  funding bill.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.J. Res. 99, which was  received from the House today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint  resolution be considered read a third time.  [[Page S2635]]     I know of no further debate on the joint resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues,  the next vote will be on Monday at 5:30 p.m., cloture on an SEC  nomination.   We expect the House to send us an Omnibus appropriations bill  midweek, and we will consider it as soon as it arrives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 36, Jay Clayton to be a member of the  Securities and Exchange Commission.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the Clayton nomination  occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, May 1.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  May 1; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader remarks,  the Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the  Clayton nomination as under the previous order.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order, following the remarks of Senator Cantwell.
