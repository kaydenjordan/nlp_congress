 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true American  patriot, a true American hero. Ms. Mary Lou Hand just turned 100 years  old on January 15, 2022. She is from Wall, Texas.   Mary Lou served this country as a nurse in the Army in World War II.  After first being stationed in Maryland and Mississippi, she was sent  to England, where she provided critical care for the wounded; and, more  importantly, she raised soldiers' spirits by spreading laughter.   It was during her service in England that she met her husband, Bob.  The two had six children together and lived in three countries and  subsequently seven States.   Ms. Mary Lou Hand has 6 children, 13 grandchildren, 25 great- grandchildren, and 3 great-great-grandchildren. She has cultivated a  life of love and family, filled with gratitude.   Throughout her century of life, she has dedicated her time to helping  others. Her selfless dedication has played out through her commitment  to her family as well as her impressive career serving our country and  caring for others.    Mary Lou, thank you for your service and happy birthday.              Recognizing the Career of John ``J.B.'' Byers, Sr.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to tell you about another  patriot. You know, we have patriots, and we have leaders, servant  leaders throughout our entire country. This is a special one that I  would like to talk about in the community of Staten Island, Mr. John  ``J.B.'' Byers, Sr.   A New Jersey native, Mr. Byers began his remarkable 40-year career  delivering letters for the U.S. Postal Service at the USPS Mariners  Harbor Post Office and subsequently served 18 years at the Port  Richmond office.   During his four decades of exemplary service, John has become a  fixture of the community. He has become beloved by those he happily  served for so many years on his daily route.   The best measure of John's success was not how efficient he was at  his job, but it was the undeniable impact he had on his neighbors in  the communities that he served so well. He went above and beyond in his  duties, taking time to engage in the community, the lives and the  livelihoods of the people he served every single day.   His influence is evident by the meaningful and positive impact he  made on those who knew him best, his neighbors, his colleagues, and his  friends. Story after story from coworkers and community members alike  show J.B.'s generosity, kindness, and work ethic. So much so that on  John's last day at the U.S. Postal Service, those on his route threw  him a surprise party to demonstrate how much the service that he did  for them meant to them and their lives.   John dedicated his life to his community through his career, and he  became a trusted friend and familiar face to all. But even with his  tenured and successful career, I know the greatest joy for him today  stems from the beautiful family he and his wife, Kathleen, have raised.  As he enters retirement, John and Kathleen are celebrating the birth of  their first grandchild, Madison Patricia Byers, who was born on  December 23, 2021.   More than a mailman, J.B. has brought great joy and integrity to  countless families and neighborhoods, and we thank him for his service  to his community.                           Honoring Mrs. Pam Burke     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the hard work and  dedication of Mrs. Pam Burke of San Angelo, Texas.   Mrs. Burke runs the Wesley Soup Kitchen, a wonderful ministry that  has been providing meals, along with love and care, to all those in  need since 1948.   Mrs. Burke has been at the Wesley Soup Kitchen for the past 12 years,  preparing over 200 meals a day. In addition to feeding the homeless and  those less fortunate, this ministry provides holiday meals and has been  a consistent combatant of malnutrition and hunger throughout the  community.   Mrs. Burke is a wonderful example of God's calling in John, chapter  21 to feed His sheep. For no monetary gain of her own, Mrs. Burke  dedicates her time and her energy to opening her arms and caring for  the community.   I know I am not alone in saying that I am grateful for the mission of  the Wesley Soup Kitchen and am honored to know that wonderfully  impassioned individuals like Mrs. Pam Burke are working throughout each  of our communities.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, it is hard to pick the crisis to talk about because  there are so many. I would like to talk about unity.   I was at the inauguration last year. I heard the President's speech.  I heard him campaign. His message was centered on restoring unity to an  angry Nation. He promised to bring us together.   Well, he has brought the American people together, that is for sure,  because everyone now understands the full magnitude of the crises that  we are going through. He has united the country in that fact alone.   One year ago, I want everyone to remember, we were not experiencing  the inflation that we are, the highest rate in 40 years. We did not  have foreign adversaries who were treading over our policies and  looking at us as weak.   Right now, we have a border that is in complete chaos and complete  crisis. It has only been 1 year under President Biden's reign, and our  Nation is directionless from the masthead in the midst of chaos, not to  mention that our international reputation and our influence have been  squandered through policy failure after policy failure.   When you look at this poster right here, look at the energy crisis  that we are dealing with, and Ukraine right now is in the midst of not  knowing whether or not they are going to be invaded by the Russians.  What a terrible position to be in.   The President has green-lighted Nord Stream. He failed to sanction  the Nord Stream pipeline. The energy crisis that is going on in Eastern  Europe right now, the fact that we are not strong around the world in  our messaging to deter our enemies and to help our allies, is directly  leading to this issue that we see in Ukraine right now. And do you know  who is watching? China. China is watching this, and they are wondering  whether or not Taiwan is going to be next.   We have to get back to a strong, firm understanding of law and order,  the same discussion that we just had on the border crisis. We have to  reassert our leadership to make sure that our country, the greatest  Nation that this world has ever known, will choose to follow law and  order.
