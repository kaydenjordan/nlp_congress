 Mr. Speaker, I was detained this afternoon at Georgetown  University Hospital as my youngest son Blake broke his nose last  evening and I was attending to him. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 616, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 617, and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 618.                            ____________________
