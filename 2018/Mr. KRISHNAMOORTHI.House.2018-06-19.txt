 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, my family and I  spent a wonderful Sunday celebrating Father's Day, just like millions  of other families across our country.   During our time together, I couldn't help thinking about the  thousands of children who are unable to do the same because they have  been separated from their own fathers and mothers by agents of our  government. They are scared, they are lonely, and they are confused.   I am horrified by these actions, and I am determined to fight with my  colleagues to end this cruel policy. It is our moral obligation to  reunite these families, and it is imperative that we make sure this  never happens again.   Fifty years from now, how will history judge those more committed to  justifying this policy than ending it? We as a nation are better than  this, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what is  right and end this policy of separating children from their parents.                            ____________________
