 Mr. Speaker, ``Here Comes the Sun.'' It is more than a  great tune. It is about a great renewable future, but our Republican  colleagues refuse to see through the dark smoke of fossil fuels and  fossilized thinking. They just blindly follow Trump at every  opportunity to try to reduce progress on addressing the very real  climate crisis.   President Biden is both enforcing our trade laws and maintaining our  commitment for more solar power by giving American companies a  reasonable time to adjust their supply chains away from China and  without an unreasonable disruption of installing more solar panels all  across this country.                                time  0930    This temporary tariff pause ends in only about a year. That is just  not soon enough for those who are determined to disrupt our move to a  clean energy future. I must say, this is a truly anti-business move  because it penalizes companies that have relied in good faith on the  President's order. It also, as my colleague from Oregon has just shown,  will kill a number of good-paying union jobs across this country.   Despite ice mass in Greenland and Antarctica melting at an average of  about 420 billion tons every year, already raising sea levels in the  Gulf of Mexico, Republican opposition in fighting climate change  remains frozen in the past.   Trading fossil fuel and fossil power for the power of the Sun by  getting as many solar panels as soon as possible is one way that more  and more American families and American businesses can make their  contribution to their own lower energy bills. It can help us respond to  the climate crisis that is already engulfing America with wildfires and  intensified weather, like tornadoes and floods and droughts in  different places, and, of course, hotter and hotter and hotter  temperatures.   At this dawn of a new clean energy era, now is not the time to  eclipse solar. In Texas, we are already number two in the country among  the States for solar capacity, creating thousands of new jobs and  providing clean energy and lower energy bills to thousands of families.  Austinites know that solar power saves them on their energy bills and  saves them when storms disrupt the grid.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will see the light and see the  power of solar and join us in voting ``no'' on this misguided proposal.
