 I ask that the scheduled vote occur immediately.  [[Page S3349]]     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize the  outstanding career of Dr. Stephen Kress and his contributions to the  restoration of seabird colonies in Maine and around the globe. For over  50 years, Dr. Kress has dedicated his life to preserving and  reestablishing seabird colonies that had previously been decimated by  hunting. His perseverance has been a driving force in the repopulation  of Maine puffin colonies and various other seabird species throughout  the world.   Dr. Kress's restoration of seabird populations began in 1969 when he  started with the National Audubon Society's Hog Island Education Camp  on the coast of Maine. It was there that he learned of the devastation  the Atlantic Puffin had experienced at the hands of hunters. In 1973  Dr. Kress launched Project Puffin, a novel approach to translocate  puffin chicks from a colony at Great Island, Newfoundland, to  [[Page S3371]]  Eastern Egg Rock in Maine. In the early years of Project Puffin, Dr.  Kress hand-raised the chicks until they were fledglings. Under his  leadership, the project grew to incorporate Seal Island National  Wildlife Refuge in Maine, and he oversaw the translocation of over  1,000 puffin chicks over the next decade to both islands.   These efforts were an immediate success, but attracting the  fledglings back to the island to nest proved difficult. Through trial  and error, Dr. Kress discovered and adopted innovative practices using  vocalization playback, decoys, and mirrors to attract the migrating  birds to return to the island. These methods are now known collectively  as social attraction and are employed by ornithological experts  internationally.   Dr. Kress later applied social attraction techniques to seabird  restoration projects across the globe, leading the way for the  successful rehabilitation of colonies in Hawaii, Bermuda, Japan, China,  and Taiwan. As of 2012, 128 seabird restoration projects had utilized  social attraction and chick translocation techniques, for the benefit  of nearly 50 species at locations in 14 countries. His work transformed  ornithological conservation and preserved numerous species of  endangered coastal birds, redefining the possibilities for seabird  conservation. These projects are a testament to Dr. Kress's commitment  to conservation, the environment, and ornithology.   Dr. Kress's research opened new doors for conservation and his  contributions to the scientific community have saved countless seabird  colonies. As a result of his work, Maine islands are now home to some  of the largest and most diverse seabird populations in the Gulf of  Maine. His legacy will live on in the hundreds of people he has  mentored during his career and the seabird populations our State is  home to. I join with the people of Maine in commending Dr. Kress for  his extraordinary efforts to preserve and cultivate our State's  wildlife.                            ____________________
