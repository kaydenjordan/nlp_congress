 Mr. President, I rise and in a moment I will ask unanimous  consent to right a wrong that has lingered for over a century and to  call up and pass H.R. 1964, the Lumbee Recognition Act. Prior to that,  I want to say that I am honored, with my colleague Senator Tillis, to  represent the Lumbee people.   The Lumbee are the largest Native American Tribe east of the  Mississippi River, with a membership of over 60,000. They have called  the present-day counties of Robeson, Scotland, Hoke, and Cumberland  their home in North Carolina. They have been a cohesive part of the  community in North Carolina for centuries, and they have developed  unique Tribal instructions that have served their membership well in  the face of extraordinary adversity.   They have been teachers, farmers, doctors, small business owners,  sheriffs, clerks of court, State legislators, and judges. Many have  protected our Nation by serving in the Armed Forces. Their contribution  to their community, to the State of North Carolina, and to the country  is innumerable.   Their commitment to education is unparalleled. In the 1800s, the  State authorized the Tribe to run the State's school district for  Lumbee children. The State also authorized the opening of a specially  advanced Indian school known as the Normal School to train teachers to  teach in Lumbee Indian schools. Although the State provided no money  for construction for the facilities, the Lumbees pulled together and  constructed an Indian Normal School of their own. Since then, the  Indian school has been in operation continuously. Today it is the  University of North Carolina at Pembroke.   The State of North Carolina recognized the Lumbee Tribe in 1885.  Three years later, the Tribe began its quest for full recognition. Over  the next 50 years, they repeatedly petitioned the Federal Government  for assistance but to no avail.   Then, during the height of the shameful termination era, Congress  passed the Lumbee Act of 1956. This partial recognition designated the  Lumbees residing in Robeson and adjoining counties of North Carolina as  the ``Lumbee Indians of North Carolina,'' while simultaneously blocking  the Lumbees from accessing Federal services and benefits available to  other federally recognized Tribes. It is nothing short of  discrimination.   To put this in context, four other Tribes were terminated by Congress  in 1956, like the Lumbees. All have had their Federal recognition  status restored. Only the Lumbees have yet to receive the full Federal  recognition they deserve. As a matter of fact, in 2018, this Senate  recognized Indian Tribes. In 2019, seven Tribes in Virginia were  recognized by this Congress and this Senate.   It is unfortunate while the Lumbee Tribe is incredibly resilient,  decades of discrimination have caused severe economic consequences for  the people. Robeson is one of the poorest counties in the United  States. The 1956 law has put them on an unequal footing compared to  other federally recognized Tribes and has prevented them from obtaining  access to critical services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and  the Indian Health Service. This is simply unjust and it is immoral.   To correct this injustice, since 1987, members of North Carolina's  congressional delegation from both sides of the aisle have repeatedly  come together to introduce the Lumbee Recognition Act, which would  grant full Federal recognition to the Tribe.   Over the past 11 years, I have been proud to be the lead sponsor of  this legislation in the Senate, and it has always been a bipartisan  effort.   This year, the bill was led by a Democratic Member of the House of  Representatives, G. K. Butterfield, and supported by Congressman Hudson  and Congressman Bishop, both Republicans. Last month, the House passed  the Lumbee Recognition bill by voice vote unanimously. Let me say that  again--by voice vote unanimously.   You would think that this great deliberative body could process and  understand the--really the discrimination that is going on here to  these folks. People claim that the Lumbees are not a Tribe. Yet read  the statistics--it is the largest Tribe east of the Mississippi River.  I think they finally educated the House. But despite the overwhelming  support for doing the right thing, Congress has yet to actually do it.   The time for excuses is over. The time for action is now. It is time  to finally do what should have been done 130 years ago. It is time for  the Federal Government to recognize the Lumbees for the Tribe they are.   I have had a great partner in Senator Tillis, and I would yield to  him for any comments he would like to make.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I reiterate that  if for some reason there is an objection--and I think there will be  tonight--either before we swear in a new Congress or after we swear in  a new Congress, I promise my colleagues that this place will come to a  grinding halt, and we will take up through regular order the Lumbee  Recognition Act. We will debate it for as long as people want to, and  we will make the case as to why this discrimination is despicable.   So, at this time, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on Indian Affairs be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 1964 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their time  tonight, and I urge all of our colleagues to prepare. This will be back  up.   I yield the floor                            ____________________
