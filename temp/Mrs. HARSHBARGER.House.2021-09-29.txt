 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous  question so that we could immediately consider H.R. 1897, the REACT  Act. It is urgent that we pass this critical and commonsense  legislation offered by my friend and colleague from Iowa, Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   We all know that the crisis on our southern border is a national  security crisis. My colleague, Mrs. Miller-Meeks is a physician and I  am a pharmacist, so we totally understand. What is less discussed is  that it is also a public health crisis. Illegal immigrants are coming  across our southern border in record numbers and they are coming from  countries with low COVID vaccination rates.    My colleagues are right. The ERs are full of a lot of unvaccinated  people, because there are 200,000 or more coming across the southern  border every month and 209,000 were encountered in August alone. And  the Biden administration is then transporting these illegal immigrants  to communities all across our country--in most cases, without the  Governor's approval, as is in Tennessee.   Currently, there is no requirement for individuals released by CBP or  ICE to test negative for COVID before they are released. That means  that any COVID-positive migrants released by the administration are  spreading COVID throughout our communities.   Just this week, the DHS Secretary admitted that there were at least  12,000 or more Haitian migrants released into our communities who were  not subject to COVID testing mandates--and I won't even talk about the  non-SIV Afghans.   Contrast this with the Biden administration's policy of forcing  American workers to get tested or vaccinated or its policy of only  letting fully vaccinated tourists fly into our country. The lack of  COVID testing at the southern border is reckless and it is  unacceptable, and it is a detriment to our healthcare system.   But it doesn't have to be this way. There is a solution to the border  health crisis.   My friend from Iowa introduced the REACT Act to protect American  public health from the border crisis. This critical bill would require  testing for everyone crossing our border, and it would require a  negative test before CBP or ICE can release these illegal immigrants  from custody.   The ultimate solution is just to close the border, but since that is  a commonsense solution, it is not going to happen. It is time to  implement the proper health screenings for these individuals  [[Page H5522]]  entering our country and stop putting Americans at risk.   Madam Speaker, the House should immediately pass the REACT Act  because lives depend on it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4363,  the DHS Contract Reporting Act of 2021.   Improving transparency and accountability is an essential way for the  America people to gain and have confidence in their government and the  Department of Homeland Security.   Currently, there is no clear line of sight into DHS' purchasing  decisions. Even though DHS is required to report some contract awards  to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, it is not required  to report them to other committees with oversight responsibilities such  as ours, the House Committee on Homeland Security.   And most importantly, if the American people want to know where their  tax dollars are going, that information is almost impossible to find.   Today, if someone wanted to find a DHS contract award, they would  have to know how to use and navigate the cumbersome Federal data  systems, and even then they may not be successful if they don't already  know some key details about the contract.   Furthermore, DHS acquisition management is still on the Government  Accountability Office's high-risk list. GAO reports that although DHS  has taken steps to strengthen its acquisition requirements development  process, DHS continues to face challenges in effectively executing its  acquisition portfolio, with many programs not meeting the cost and  schedule goals they establish.   I want to change this. The bill I am putting forward today will  increase the transparency into these contracts. The DHS Contract  Reporting Act of 2021 requires DHS to have a public facing website  where it will report all contract awards over $4 million.   To illustrate the current opaqueness of our oversight, I want to ask:  Does anybody here know whether all the DHS contracts that should have  been awarded competitively actually were? I don't know the answer. But  I do know that competition and contract awards helps to lower the cost  of services and technologies the Department buys, and to get the best  return on investment for the American taxpayer.   To get at this type of information and to have more insight into DHS'  awards more generally, this bill also requires DHS to include key  aspects of each contract award it reports, such as the total amount it  plans to spend; what the contract is for; what type of agreement it is;  and whether the government competed the contract award.   According to the government's top 100 contractors report for 2020,  DHS alone awarded over $12 billion to its top 100 contractors. And this  is an increase in spending of $1 billion from just the previous year.                                time  1645    This includes everything from drones and IT systems to medical  services at the border. With these significant levels of increased  spending, it is crucial that Congress have better oversight of DHS  contracts.   If this requirement would have been in place last year, the American  people and Congress would have had that insight into nearly 1,000  contracts DHS awarded in 2020. We need to put this requirement in place  now so that Congress can ensure better stewardship of taxpayer dollars  next year.   With increased Federal spending across the board, it is more  important than ever that this committee does its job to ensure DHS is  being a good steward of taxpayer dollars. More accountability will make  the Department a better business partner and a better provider of  services to the public, and that is why I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.   I would like to thank Ranking Member Katko and Representatives Luria  and Slotkin for reaching across the aisle and cosponsoring this bill  with me.
