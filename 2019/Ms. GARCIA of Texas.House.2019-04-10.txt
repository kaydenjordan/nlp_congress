 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2:30 p.m. on Friday,  April 12, 2019.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the Trump  administration's new attacks on the Affordable Care Act.   Over 4.5 million non-elderly Texans have preexisting conditions that  could keep them from getting insurance if the administration gets its  wishes in Federal court. This is truly outrageous.  [[Page H3240]]    No family should have to choose between lifesaving care and going  bankrupt. And we cannot forget how important this is for Latinos, there  are many in my district, who already have the highest uninsured rate of  any group in the United States.   Regardless of the language you speak, or the color of your skin,  healthcare is a right, and we will defend it for everyone.   The well-being of our families and their health is the top priority  of House Democrats, and I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, we will do  everything in our power to make sure this administration does not strip  away the access to healthcare for our loved ones.   Yes, we can, and we will.                            ____________________
