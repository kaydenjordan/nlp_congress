 Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Huffman for his  leadership on this very, very important bill.   I would like to discuss briefly one idea, and that is the idea that  you hear around that if we are going to protect ANWR, that somehow is  going to hurt our ability to become energy independent, that we cannot  be energy independent unless we open up ANWR, and that right now, we  have to really worry because we are going to become, by not opening  ANWR, more beholden to the Russians, to Saudi Arabia.   This is all going to be whether we open up ANWR or not? This is  absolute nonsense.   Republicans and this administration no longer care about energy  independence. Let's be clear. They do not care about energy  independence, and they haven't for years, ever since they voted to lift  the oil export ban.   For so many years, we said that we care about energy independence,  and we are not going to export our oil and gas. If energy independence  was the goal, we wouldn't be letting companies send American-produced  oil all over the world, particularly when we are still importing from  other countries, yet that is exactly what is happening today.   We export over 3 million barrels a day. Yet at the same time, we are  importing 7 million barrels a day.   If oil development, what we are hearing today, is really about making  America energy independent, instead of exporting those 3 million  barrels, we could keep them here at home.   If Republicans want to put the export ban back in place, then we  should have a real discussion. I would love to have that discussion,  but they know that their friends in the oil and gas industry would  never let them have that discussion because this is all about profits.    Mr. Chair, this is all about profits. It is not about  energy independence.
