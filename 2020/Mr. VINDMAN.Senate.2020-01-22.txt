 To the best of my recollection, Ambassador       Sondland said that in order to get a White House meeting, the       Ukrainians would have to provide a deliverable, which is       investigations, specific investigations.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Volker separately confirmed this  recollection during his testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador VOLKER. I participated in the July 10 meeting       between National Security Advisor Bolton and then-Ukrainian       Chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Alex       Danyliuk. As I remember, the meeting was essentially over       when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about       investigations. I think all of us thought it was       inappropriate.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Bolton also found Ambassador  Sondland's reference to be inappropriate, and he abruptly ended the  meeting. However, Ambassador Sondland was not deterred. He convened a  second meeting where he discussed what needed to happen before an Oval  Office meeting. Apparently, Ambassador Sondland had received his  marching orders from the President, and he was determined to carry them  out.   Bolton sent Dr. Hill to join that meeting and report back. This is  what Dr. Hill had to say:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. And so when I came in, Gordon Sondland was       basically saying, well, look, we have a deal here that there       will be a meeting--I have a deal here with Chief of Staff       Mulvaney. There will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up       or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma. And I       cut it off immediately there. Because by this point,       having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the       television and all of the issues that he was asserting, by       this point it was clear that Burisma was code for the       Bidens because Giuliani was laying it out there.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. After the meeting, Dr. Hill followed up with  Ambassador Bolton and relayed what transpired. Bolton was alarmed. In  other words, Ambassador Bolton didn't want any part of it. He directed  Dr. Hill to brief the NSC's top attorney, John Eisenberg, as she  explained during her hearing.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GOLDMAN. What was that specific instruction?        Dr. HILL. The specific instruction was that I have to go to       the lawyers, to John Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the       National Security Council, to basically say, you tell       Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told me, that I am not part of       this whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are       cooking up.        GOLDMAN. What did you understand him to mean by the drug       deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?        Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.  [[Page S467]]         GOLDMAN. Did you go speak to the lawyers?        Dr. HILL. I certainly did.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. As a former chief of police, I think it is  quite interesting that Ambassador Bolton categorized the corrupt  scheme--the pressure campaign--as a ``drug deal.'' I think Ambassador  Bolton was trying to send us a very powerful message that not only  would the lawyers, the top lawyer understand, but that every person  would understand--every Member of the House, every Member of the  Senate, every member of our great country, every citizen.   And Ambassador Bolton also wanted to make clear, especially to the  top attorney, that he did not want to have anything to do with the drug  deal in progress. But we do know now, of course, that Ambassador Bolton  can testify directly about this. He can testify directly for himself  about this meeting if he appears before this body, as he has indicated  that he is prepared to do if this body is willing to issue a subpoena.  We need to hear from Ambassador Bolton, and I know the American people  want to hear from Ambassador Bolton as well.   Dr. Hill testified that she spoke to Mr. Eisenberg twice. Dr. Hill  also indicated that Mr. Eisenberg took notes of their meeting, which  we, to no surprise now, do not have. We have not received them because  of the President's obstruction.   It is clear that Ambassador Sondland was not operating a rogue  operation. He testified that everyone was in the loop. Let's listen  once again.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Everyone was in the loop. It was no       secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days       before the Presidential call. As I communicated to the team,       I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to run a       fully transparent investigation and turn over every stone       were necessary in his call with President Trump.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. In the email reference, Ambassador Sondland  wrote the following to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, and Mr.  Mulvaney regarding President Zelensky.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         He is prepared to receive POTUS' call. Will assure him that       he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will       ``turn over every stone.''    Both Mulvaney and Perry responded to the email noting that the head- of-state call would be scheduled right away. Now, you may be asking:  What did Mulvaney know about these investigations, and did he have any  conversations with President Trump about them?   Senators, this body is entitled to see all of the evidence, and do  you know what? The American people are entitled to hear all of the  evidence. And while the nature of the ``drug deal'' we have talked  about was uncontested, it is important for the country to know that  everyone was involved because we have heard that everyone was in the  loop.   Now, later this day, July 19, Ambassador Sondland texted Ambassadors  Volker and Taylor about the upcoming head-of-state telephone call, and  the text said:         Looks like Potus call tomorrow. I [spoke] directly to       Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. He's got it.    Ambassador Volker replied to Sondland's text: ``Most [important] is  for Zelensky to say that he will help investigations.''   The evidence shows that the Ukrainians understood what they needed to  do to earn a White House meeting with the President.   On July 20, the day after Ambassador Sondland's phone call with  President Zelensky, Ambassador Taylor spoke with the Ukrainian national  security advisor. Ukraine's national security advisor conveyed that the  Ukrainian President did not want to become an instrument in U.S.  politics.   Here is how Ambassador Taylor explained that concern:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GOLDMAN. What did you understand it to mean when--that       Zelensky had concerns about being an instrument in Washington       domestic reelection politics?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk understood that these       investigations were pursuant to Mr. Giuliani's request to       develop information, to find information about Burisma and       the Bidens. This was very well known in public. Mr. Giuliani       made his point clear in several instances in the beginning--      in the springtime.        And Mr. Danyliuk was aware that that was a problem.        GOLDMAN. And would you agree that, because President       Zelensky is worried about this, they understood, at least,       that there was some pressure for them to pursue these       investigations? Is that fair?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk indicated that President       Zelensky certainly understood it, that he did not want to get       involved in these types of activities.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The next day, Ambassador Taylor relayed the  Ukrainian leader's concerns to Volker and Sondland, but Ambassador  Sondland did not back down.   Specifically, Ambassador Sondland texted in response to Ambassador  Taylor's worry: ``Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation  started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext.''   Again, Ambassador Sondland had his marching orders, and he was  determined to carry them out.   A call between President Trump and President Zelensky was scheduled  for July 25.   Before the call, President Trump spoke to Sondland and reiterated his  expectation that the Ukrainian leader would commit to the  investigations.   Ambassador Sondland subsequently contacted Ambassador Volker and  relayed the message to him.   Volker then texted Zelensky's top aide with President Trump's  instruction: ``[A]ssuming President Z convinces trump he will  investigate / `get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will  nail down the date for a visit to Washington.''   Senators, in other words, even before the July 25 phone call with  President Zelensky, before it ever took place, Ukraine understood that  it needed to initiate the investigation into the debunked conspiracy  theory about the 2016 election as a condition for President Zelensky,  the newly elected Ukrainian President, to visit the White House.   Ambassador Sondland testified that acting on President Trump's direct  orders, he and Ambassador Volker prepped President Zelensky for the  telephone call.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GOLDMAN. And you would agree that the message in this--that       is expressed here is that President Zelensky needs to       convince Trump that he will do the investigations in order to       nail down the date for a visit to Washington, D.C. Is that       correct?        Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. By this time, nonpartisan career officials  involved with Ukraine policy had become aware of this quid pro quo.   Here is what three of them said during their testimony:   Ambassador Taylor: ``. . . the meeting President Zelensky wanted was  conditioned on investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian  influence in the 2016 elections . . .''   Ambassador David Holmes: ``. . . it was made clear that some action  on a Burisma/Biden investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office  visit.''   Dr. Hill: ``There seems to be an awful lot of people involved in, you  know, basically turning a White House meeting into some kind of asset''  that was ``dangled out to the Ukrainian Government.''   A White House visit--a visit to the Oval Office--was dangled out to  the Ukrainian Government.   Senators, I ask you to think about those words as we decide--as you  decide--what action you will take. Think about those words. There was  no doubt the direction came from the President of the United States.  The President was at the center of this scheme.   Ambassador Sondland testified: ``Mr. Giuliani was expressing the  desires of the President of the United States, and we knew these  investigations were important to the President.''   Ambassador Sondland added that Mr. Giuliani ``followed the direction  of the President'' and ``we followed the President's orders.''   However, as Ambassador Taylor testified, ``Ambassador Bolton was not  interested in having--did not want to have the call because he thought  it was going to be a disaster.'' He thought that there could be some  talk of investigations or even worse than that, he thought.   I ask you today, Senators: What was Ambassador Bolton so afraid that  President Trump would say to the newly elected Ukrainian President?  [[Page S468]]  What was the National Security Advisor so afraid that President Trump  would say to President Zelensky?   This is another topic we would like to ask Ambassador Bolton about if  and when he appears before this body.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, I thank you, once again, for your indulgence and for your  courtesy as we all undertake our solemn constitutional responsibilities  during this Senate trial.   George Washington once observed in his Farewell Address to the Nation  that the Constitution was sacredly obligatory upon all. That means  everyone. In fact, that is what makes our great country so distinct  from authoritarian regimes and enemies of democracy. Vladimir Putin is  above the law in Russia; Erdogan is above the law in Turkey; Kim Jong  Un is above the law in North Korea, but in the United States of  America, no one is above the law, not even the President of the United  States. That is what this moment is all about.   As we all know, Congress is a separate and coequal branch of  government. We don't work for this President or any President. We, of  course, work for the American people. We have a constitutional  responsibility to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control  executive branch. That is not from the Democratic Party's playbook, and  that is not from the Republican Party's playbook. That is from the  playbook of a democratic republic.   James Madison once observed in Federalist No. 51 that the Congress  should serve as a rival to the executive branch.   In my humble opinion, why would Madison use the word ``rival''?   It is that the Framers of the Constitution, I think, did not want a  King; they did not want a dictator; they did not want a Monarch. They  wanted a democracy. The Constitution is sacredly obligatory upon all.  It is through that lens that we proceed today.   For the next few moments, I would like to discuss President Trump's  July 25 phone call with Ukraine's newly elected leader.   The President claims that his call was perfect. Nothing can be  further from the truth. The call is direct evidence of President  Trump's solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 election as  part of a corrupt scheme. It is important, of course, to remember the  context of this call.   New Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a vulnerable  position and viewed American and diplomatic military support as  critical to his standing and to Ukraine's fragile future as a  democracy. Equally significant, as outlined by my colleagues, America  has a strong national security interest in supporting Ukraine against  Russia's continued aggression.   William Taylor, a West Point graduate, a Vietnam war hero, and  Ambassador to Ukraine, appointed by Donald Trump, testified: ``Ukraine  is a strategic partner of the United States--important for the security  of our country as well as Europe.''   LTC Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council officer, a Trump  appointee, a Purple Heart recipient, an Iraq war veteran, testified:  ``A strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our national security  interests.''   Ukraine remains under attack by Russian-backed separatists in Crimea.  It is an ongoing hot war. Ukraine is a friend. Russia is a foe. Ukraine  is a democracy. Russia is a dictatorship. The United States may very  well be one of the other things standing between Russia and Ukraine's  being completely overrun. As part of that, Vladimir Putin continues  aggression against the free world. That is why this Congress allocated  $391 million in military and security aid to a vulnerable Ukraine on a  bipartisan basis. It is that it is in America's national security  interests.   On the July 25 call, Mr. Trump could have endeavored to strengthen  the relationship with this new Ukrainian leader. Instead, President  Trump focused on securing a personal favor. He wanted Ukraine to  conduct phony investigations, designed to enhance his political  standing and solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.   On the July 25 call, President Trump maligned a highly respected  American Ambassador, known as an anti-corruption crusader. At the same  time, he praised a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor, and on multiple  occasions, President Trump directed Ukraine's new leader to speak with  his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, on an official call.   Mr. Giuliani is not a member of the Trump administration. For these  and other reasons, the July 25 call warrants our close scrutiny. It  presents significant and shocking evidence of President Trump's corrupt  intent. The call lays bare the President's willingness to do whatever  it takes to get what he wants even if his behavior undermines the  national security interests of the United States of America.   At the beginning of the call, President Zelensky mentioned U.S.  military aid, and he states: ``I would also like to thank you for your  great support in the area of defense.'' The great support in the area  of defense includes the security assistance passed by this Congress, on  a bipartisan basis, that Donald Trump held up in violation of the law.   Immediately after President Zelensky raised the issue of defense  support, President Trump responded: ``I would like you to do us a  favor, though.''   These words will live in infamy.   First, President Trump said to President Zelensky, as part of the two  demands that he requested:         I would like you to find out what happened with this whole       situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike . . . I guess       you have one of your wealthy people. . . . The server, they       say, Ukraine has it.''    President Trump continued:         I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your       people, and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As       you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor       performance by a man named Robert Mueller--    A Vietnam war hero, by the way--       a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an       incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started       with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that       you do it if that's possible.    Who is the ``they'' referred to by President Trump putting forth the  baseless conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians, not the Russians, were  behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016?   ``They'' means Russia. ``They'' means Putin. ``They'' are enemies of  the United States.   Not a single witness who testified before the House knew of any  factual basis for President Trump's belief in the CrowdStrike Ukraine  fairytale. To the contrary, the U.S. intelligence community and this  Senate Intelligence Committee assessed that Russia interfered in the  2016 election.   As Dr. Fiona Hill testified, the theory that Ukraine interfered in  the 2016 election ``is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated  and propagated by the Russian security services.''   The conspiracy theory that President Trump advanced on the July 25  phone call is stone-cold Russian propaganda.   As early as February 2017, Vladimir Putin began to promote this lie  during a press conference saying:         The Ukrainian Government adopted a unilateral position in       favor of one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs,       certainly with the approval of the political leadership,       funded this candidate, or female candidate, to be more       precise.    Those are the words of Vladimir Putin--a script apparently adopted by  President Donald John Trump.   If there was any doubt about who benefits from this unfounded,  Russian-inspired conspiracy theory advanced by Donald Trump, Vladimir  Putin made it clear when he said in November of 2019:         Thank God no one is accusing us anymore of interfering in       U.S. elections. Now they're accusing Ukrainians.    Unfortunately, this is not the first time President Trump tried to  capitalize on Russian propaganda and misinformation for his own  political benefit.   On July 24, just one day before this call, Special Counsel Robert  Mueller testified before Congress that the ``Russian government  interfered in the 2016 election in sweeping and systematic fashion'' in  order to support the Trump campaign and divide America.   Mr. Mueller also found that the Trump campaign welcomed Russian  interference in the 2016 election and utilized it as part of its  campaign messaging.   Despite the clear and overwhelming conclusion of U.S. intelligence  agencies, as well as the distinguished Senate Intelligence Committee,  that Russia, not Ukraine interfered in the 2016  [[Page S469]]  election, President Trump continued to press the new Ukrainian leader  to announce an investigation into the CrowdStrike Ukraine conspiracy  theory.   Why? President Trump sought a political favor--that is why--as part  of a scheme to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.   The second demand made by President Trump on the July 25 call related  to the campaign of Vice President Joe Biden, who announced his  intention to run for the Office of the Presidency last April.  Throughout the spring and early summer of last year, public polling  consistently showed that Biden would decisively defeat President Trump.  In fact, on June 16 of last year--June 16--a FOX News poll showed that  President Trump would lose to Joe Biden by 10 points.   The concern with Joe Biden's candidacy provides motive for President  Trump's demand that the Ukrainian Government investigate the former  Vice President and his son Hunter.   Here is what President Trump said on that call:         The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son,       that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want       to find out about that so whatever you can do with the       Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging       that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it .       . . It sounds horrible to me.    Now, the Trump administration officials who participated in the  impeachment inquiry unanimously testified that there was no factual  support for the allegation that Vice President Biden did anything wrong  or misused his authority when he pressed for the removal of Ukraine's  corrupt former prosecutor general. Joe Biden did nothing wrong. The  witnesses testified that Vice President Biden was in fact carrying out  official U.S. policy to clean up the prosecutor general's office in  Ukraine.   This policy, of course, aligned with the perspective of many in this  very distinguished body, as well as our European allies throughout the  world, as well as the International Monetary Fund.   Vice President Biden did not remove Yuriy Lutsenko, the corrupt  prosecutor. The Ukrainian Government did with the support of the free  world.   Nonetheless, on October 3, 2019, when a reporter asked President  Trump, ``What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens  after your phone call,'' President Trump responded as follows.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         News Reporter. What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do       about the Bidens after your phone? Exactly?        President TRUMP. Well, I would think that, if they were       honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the       Bidens. It's a very simple answer.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Start a major investigation into the Bidens.  The evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is hiding in plain sight.   During the July 25 call, President Trump also repeatedly pressed the  Ukrainian President to coordinate with his personal attorney, Rudolph  Giuliani.   Why was Rudolph Giuliani's name mentioned multiple times during the  July 25 phone call? Giuliani is not the Secretary of State. He is not  an ambassador. He is not a member of the diplomatic corps.   Rudolph Giuliani is a cold-blooded political operative for President  Trump's reelection campaign. That is why he was referenced multiple  times on that July 25 phone call, and it is evidence of corrupt intent  by President Trump.   By the time the call took place, President Zelensky understood  Giuliani's connection to the shakedown scheme. He recognized Giuliani's  role as the President's political operative on matters related to  Ukraine.   Zelensky informed President Trump that one of his aides spoke with  Mr. Giuliani ``just recently'' and ``we are hoping very much that Mr.  Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he  comes.''   The Ukrainian leader knew Giuliani represented President Trump's  political interests in his country and could help unlock the long- sought-after Oval Office meeting that President Zelensky desired.   The phony investigations sought by President Trump on the July 25  call were not designed to bolster the national security interests of  the United States of America--quite the contrary. President Trump  sought to benefit himself and his own reelection prospects.   On the July 25 call, President Trump also suggested that President  Zelensky speak with the Attorney General William Barr about the two  fake investigations that the President sought.   This is important to keep in mind. At no time during this entire  sordid scheme was there an ongoing American law enforcement  investigation into the phony slander related to Joe Biden or the  conspiracy theory related to Ukrainian interference in the 2016  election. At no time was there an ongoing American law enforcement  investigation.   America is the leader of the free world. We do not urge other  sovereign countries to target American citizens absent any legitimate  basis whatsoever, absent any scintilla of evidence.   Apparently, President Trump does not play by those rules. During the  July 25 call, President Trump didn't raise legitimate corruption  concerns as it relates to the Ukraine. President Trump did not mention  the word ``corruption'' once. The President did, however, viciously  malign former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a  distinguished anticorruption advocate whom he abruptly removed because  she was seen as an obstacle to his geopolitical shakedown.   Ambassador Yovanovitch joined the diplomatic corps under President  Ronald Reagan and subsequently served three other Republican  Presidents. She is a highly respected diplomat and Foreign Service  professional. Yet President Trump told the new Ukrainian leader the  former Ambassador from the United States, ``the woman,'' was bad news,  and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news. ``So  I just want to let you know that.''   He didn't stop there. Later in the call, President Trump ominously  added, ``Well, she's going to go through some things.'' These are the  words of the President of the United States of America.   Ambassador Yovanovitch did not know of President Trump's disparaging  remarks at the time. She didn't learn them until the call record became  public in September. Asked whether she felt ``threatened'' by President  Trump's statement that ``she's going to go through some things,''  Ambassador Yovanovitch answered that she did. Here is what she said.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
