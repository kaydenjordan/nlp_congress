 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today on H.R. 268, the Supplemental  Appropriations Act, 2019.   On December 20 of last year, the House considered a bill that  included a continuing resolution to keep the government open, more than  $5 billion to secure our southern borders, and a supplemental  appropriation to help disaster-affected areas. That bill passed the  House, but it was not taken up by the Senate.   As it did in December, the bill before us today also includes funding  for disaster relief. In fact, it includes $4.3 billion more for  communities recovering from national disasters, including storms and  other events that occurred in 2017 and 2018. This would help the  American people get back on their feet after these devastating events.   The bill also includes help for farmers and ranchers for crop and  commodity losses, assistance for flood and storm damage, and allows our  military and Federal agencies to repair facilities and assets.   Like it did in December, the bill we are considering today also  includes a continuing resolution to fund the government and ensure that  our hardworking Federal employees are paid.   What this bill does not include is funding for border security needs  identified by the agents and officers on the front lines. Therefore,  the bill before us today will not resolve the government shutdown. It  will not reopen the government and ensure that our TSA screeners, our  Coast Guard defenders, our Border Patrol agents, and our air traffic  controllers are paid.   We must stop wasting time voting on bills that have no chance of  becoming law. We should, instead, work with urgency to get our  government back up and running. In order to do that, we must address  border security and funding for the remaining appropriations bills.   I thank Chairwoman Lowey for her work, and I am hopeful that in the  coming days, together, we can come to an agreement with all of our  partners in the Senate, the House, and the White House to address the  remaining funding issues in 2019.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Rice).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for this colloquy.   Tyndall Air Force Base is vital to Florida and the United States. I  look forward to working with the gentleman as well as the gentlewoman  of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee to rebuild this base.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking  member for yielding.   Today, I rise in support of the Nutrition Assistance Program, or NAP,  that is included in the bill under consideration today. NAP is the sole  source of nutrition assistance and food security for over 1.3 million  American citizens on the island.   After Hurricane Maria, the 115th Congress approved an additional  $1.27 billion increase in Puerto Rico's NAP program in addition to the  annual block grant amount of about $1.8 billion, and that means that we  helped a  [[Page H638]]  lot of people who have a lot of necessities.   This disaster relief allowed an increase in the benefits for the  current beneficiaries as well as an increased enrollment to bring  assistance to close to 153,000 new participants in the program.  However, this additional assistance is currently set to be expended in  March of this year, and the program's funding would then be lowered  again to the base amounts associated with the block grants.   That is why, in May of last year, I submitted an amendment to H.R. 2,  also known as the farm bill, to increase the amount of funding allotted  to Puerto Rico's NAP.   Then, in December, we got a letter and a meeting asking for the $600  million in additional NAP funding. During the first day of Congress, we  did the same thing to both the Committees of Appropriations and Rules  with the same request. I thank the chairwoman of the committee for  including that money in this bill.   We had a meeting in December with the Governor of Puerto Rico and the  minority leader and the chairwoman asking for this $600 million  increase in Puerto Rico's NAP program, so we really need this money to  be included and to be available until fiscal year 2020.   This bill also contains an important provision for Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands as well, extending the 100 percent Federal cost  share for assistance under the Stafford Act for the disasters in the  territories to rebuild to the current standards. That was included in  the last provision last Congress.   Having this extension is important in order to maximize the  resources. This is critical since the losses caused by these disasters  left our communities in no position to cover matching fund  requirements, and, believe me, the hurricane was worse than this going  down. So this bill, especially, will be important for my constituents.   I am a little bit disappointed that the continuing resolution was  attached to the bill. I do support the reopening of the government;  however, this should be not the vehicle for it. This disaster  supplemental was intended to help people to recover and rebuild from  natural disasters.   I really appreciate the good faith effort of all involved here to  help those struck by natural disasters--not just in Puerto Rico, the  Virgin Islands, and Florida, but the fires in California as well-- especially in Puerto Rico; however, it is my hope that this becomes a  clean bill between the House and Senate that can be signed by the  President.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, the funds in this bill, especially those  funds for the Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard, are  specifically for repairing storm damage in our communities. The  agencies have identified specific projects and calculated estimates to  bring our infrastructure and agency assets back to full operation.   Not a single paragraph in the bill before us includes funds for a  wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, yet this amendment restricts funds for  this purpose.   My colleagues, this amendment walks away from all the good work  Chairwoman Lowey tried to do for the Corps and the Coast Guard and  blocks the necessary border investments required in a final compromise.   Unfortunately, this amendment will be viewed by many of my colleagues  as a poison pill. It ignores investments that those on my side of the  aisle believe are necessary to fund a way forward, that will provide  disaster funds, address the border crisis, and reopen the government.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1530     Madam Chair, I have no further speakers.    Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
