 Madam Speaker, last week, I was proud to support the  Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act. There is no better way to  honor an educator, explorer, and trailblazer like Ms. McAuliffe than to  educate the next generation of learners.   The explosion of the space shuttle Challenger was a heartbreaking  tragedy, but Ms. McAuliffe gave her life in pursuit of discovering the  next frontier. She was not afraid of dreaming big. She boldly went out  to test our knowledge of what is possible and pushed humanity forward.   The commemorative coins created through this act will inspire and  support the same passion in the young people who participate in the  FIRST Robotics Program today.   Founded by Dean Kamen--the inventor of my chair, the iBot--FIRST uses  science, technology, engineering, art, and math, or STEAM, to get young  people excited about learning and innovating.   In Ms. McAuliffe's memory, FIRST competitions are inspiring the next  generation of scientists, explorers, and leaders who we will need to  solve the problems of today and tomorrow.                            ____________________
