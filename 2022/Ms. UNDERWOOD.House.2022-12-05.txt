 In October, new data showed how maternal health  outcomes worsened during the pandemic. The number of maternal deaths in  2021 was nearly 80 percent higher than in 2018, with Black and Hispanic  Americans experiencing the largest increases.   This is a crisis--and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act is the  solution to that crisis.   The evidence-based investments in the momnibus will comprehensively  address the drivers of maternal mortality, morbidity, and disparities.   Recently, 140 Members of Congress signed on to a letter calling for  key momnibus provisions to be included in an end-of-year package, and a  new poll found that passing the momnibus is the number one legislative  priority for voters for the end of the year, with a majority of support  from Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.   We must get this done. Congress must pass the momnibus immediately.  Moms and families don't have any more time to wait.                            ____________________
