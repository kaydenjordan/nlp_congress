 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Department of  Justice to impose a moratorium on its practice of using the False  Claims Act to demand settlements from America's mortgage brokers for  perceived violations in the loans these lenders made under the Federal  Housing Authority's mortgage insurance program.   Simply put, intentional efforts to defraud the Federal Government  should be prosecuted and pursued to the fullest extent of the law.  However, as the FHA has worked to provide further clarification on the  law, the Department of Justice has, unfortunately, focused their  efforts on attacking honest mortgage brokers, lenders, and first-time  home buyers for infractions as small as a clerical error or a small  technical mistake.   The FHA, in conjunction with HUD, is close to finalizing a taxonomy  that would allow for a specific and transparent penalty to be imposed  for a specific violation of the FHA application loan process. But as  Brian Montgomery, the nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Housing,  told the Senate Banking Committee last week, the Department of Justice  has stepped in front of the FHA. We should correct this circumstance.                            ____________________
