 Madam Speaker, Israel and Ukraine may be 2,000 miles  apart, but the evils they face are connected. Hamas and Putin have  waged unprovoked wars on neighboring democracies, murdering thousands  of civilians and kidnapping innocent people, including children.   Recently, Moscow hosted Hamas and Iranian leaders. This is incredibly  concerning because Hamas is funded by Russia's military ally, Iran.   I fear the extreme ultra rightwing wants to cut and run and hand  Putin a win. It sends the wrong message to China and empowers our  adversaries.   The United States has a responsibility to support Ukraine in its  fight against a murdering dictator and provide the support Israel needs  to kill the terrorists responsible for the atrocities on October 7.  Hamas terrorists have made it clear that they will not back down and  are committed to a second, third, and fourth October 7.   We must pass a bipartisan supplemental aid package that makes sure  that we do not ever send the wrong signal about fighting against terror  and protecting global democracy and our national security.                            ____________________
