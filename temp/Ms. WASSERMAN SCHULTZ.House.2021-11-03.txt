 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership as well on human rights worldwide.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise to urge my colleagues to support H. Res.  760. I authored this bipartisan resolution co-led by my dear friend,  Mario Diaz-Balart, to send a message to the brave Cubans who are  desperately yearning for freedom and legitimate self-governance: The  American people are firmly by your side.   The passionate human cry for self-determination ringing out from the  streets of Havana has moved this Congress and achieved something  beautiful and all too rare. It has united Democrats and Republicans  behind this call for freedom.   Today, we are here to do something simple and unifying that is at the  heart of American values: support human rights and freedom of  expression and freedom from repression.   Today, this body stands arm in arm to condemn the Cuban regime's acts  of repression. Together, we proclaim the strongest possible support for  the Cuban people to take a courageous stand in the streets on November  15, as they did on July 11, and peacefully express their opposition to  the brutality and dehumanization of the Cuban regime.   As representatives of the American people, we proudly express  unyielding solidarity with the Cuban people who wish to peacefully  assemble and boldly demand their freedom from oppression.   The regime has all the tools of repression in their possession, but  the Cuban people are armed with truth, conviction, and courage.  Dictators thrive on silence, lies, and fear. That is why the resolution  before this Chamber today is so important. This body must use our  platform to shed light on the tyranny that casts a shadow over such a  beautiful island.   The Cuban regime's deception, repression, and arbitrary imprisonment  of citizens, activists, and artists cannot withstand the people's  demands for freedom, agency, and accountability.                                time  1445    By passing this resolution today, we will make sure the Cuban  people's calls for freedom are not silenced. Instead, we will amplify  them as we are here this afternoon.   And we are not alone. In adopting this resolution, we will join with  the European Parliament who adopted a resolution earlier this summer  that condemns the Cuban regime's blatant disregard for human rights.   Now we too must loudly proclaim that this Congress stands for  democracy and denounces the unaccountable corruption clinging to power  just across the Straits of Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take one moment to thank all of those,  including President Biden, and especially President Biden, for standing  with the Cuban people; for standing up for freedom, for free and fair  elections on the island, for freedom of expression, and for making sure  that we can help hold this unaccountable regime accountable.   I also want to thank those who helped deliver this message today, my  good friends: Albio Sires, Mario Diaz-Balart, and, of course, Leader  Hoyer. And I also want to thank Chairman Meeks for working with me on  this resolution as well and my colleagues from Florida. Without their  hard work and the efforts of many other allies of Cuban democracy, we  could not send this powerful, bipartisan message today.    Mr. Speaker, make no mistake. We are united  today around the Cuban people's fight for libertad and patria y vida.   I ask all Members to embrace the unifying principles in this  resolution which avoids the policy arguments and expresses our support  for basic human rights. Who could be against that?   I urge all of my colleagues to stand behind and side by side with the  Cuban people and support their pursuit of liberty and justice. I urge a  ``yes'' vote on H. Res. 760.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Libertad para Cuba. Patria y vida.   (English translation of Spanish is as follows: Freedom for Cuba.  Country and life.)
