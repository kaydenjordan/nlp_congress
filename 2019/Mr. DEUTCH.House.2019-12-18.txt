 Mr. Speaker, some say this impeachment is about eight  lines in a call transcript, but there is so much more. This was about a  scheme that lasted months and involved dozens of Trump administration  officials.   Look at the evidence, look at the direct evidence: text messages,  emails, calls, and meetings.   Way back in May, the President told his team: ``Talk to Rudy''  Giuliani. The President's message? No White House meeting unless  Ukraine helped him in the 2020 election.   Ambassador Sondland said there was a ``prerequisite of  investigations'' into the Bidens and announcement of investigations was  a ``deliverable.''   Ambassador Volker said the most important thing for the Ukrainian  President to do was commit to an investigation of the Bidens.   Just before the July 25 call, Volker told the Ukrainians: ``Assuming  President Z convinces Trump he will investigate . . . we will nail down  date for visit to Washington.''   The direct evidence kept coming after the call, more texts, more  emails, and more calls, all with the same message: If Ukraine didn't  announce an investigation into the President's political rival, then  they wouldn't get the White House meeting that they had been promised,  and they wouldn't get the aid that they needed in their war against  Russia.   American Presidential power comes from the people through elections.  The Constitution requires that we protect those elections. But when the  President abused his power to solicit foreign interference, he was  cheating American voters before they even had a chance to vote.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's actions force us to protect our  elections and the Constitution. I urge my colleagues to defend the  Constitution, support these Articles of Impeachment, and remind the  world that, in America, no one is above the law.
