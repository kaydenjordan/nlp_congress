 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Carol  Martineau Baldwin, who passed away on May 26, 2022, at the age of 92.   Carol was a beloved member of the central New York community and a  devoted philanthropist.   A Syracuse native, Carol met her husband, Alexander Baldwin, while  attending Syracuse University. They were married in 1954 and had six  children.   The family lived in Long Island, where Alexander taught at Massapequa  High School until his death from lung cancer in 1983. Carol moved back  to Syracuse and, in 1990, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She nearly  lost her battle with breast cancer but overcame it following a double  mastectomy.   Following this experience, she dedicated her life to helping others  fight breast cancer. In 1996, she founded the Carol M. Baldwin Breast  Cancer Research Fund on the campus of SUNY Stony Brook. Five years  later, in conjunction with SUNY Upstate Medical University, the Carol  M. Baldwin Fund of Central New York was established in Syracuse.   To date, the Baldwin fund has provided more than 60 grants to support  research programs and has spurred nearly $24 million in additional  grant funding. The fund supports numerous programs, including studies  of contributing factors to breast cancer, education of medical  professionals and the general public, and studies of the outcomes of  detection and treatment on patients and families.   Outside of her philanthropic work, Carol has been a prominent fixture  in our community, and many in her family are dear friends to my wife,  Robin, and me.   For the last two decades, breast cancer patients in central New York  and throughout the country have benefited from the steadfast commitment  of Carol Baldwin.   Carol is survived by her six children, 25 grandchildren, and 14  great-grandchildren. While she will be dearly missed in our community,  central New Yorkers will continue to honor her legacy.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in  honoring the life and legacy of Carol Martineau Baldwin. May she rest  in peace.                            ____________________
