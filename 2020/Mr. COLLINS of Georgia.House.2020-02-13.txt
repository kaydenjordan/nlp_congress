 Madam Speaker, three-quarters of the States  failed to ratify the equal rights amendment by the 1979 deadline set by  Congress, yet House Democrats are trying to retroactively revive the  failed constitutional amendment.   Congress does not have the power to do that. Congress set the  deadline; it was passed; it did not get approved; and now there is an  end run to go around that.   The United States Supreme Court recognized this in 1982 when it  stated that the issue was moot because the deadline for ERA  ratification expired before the requisite number of States approved it.   The next year, the Democratic leadership in the House of  Representatives,  [[Page H1130]]  acting on the same understanding, started the entire process of ERA  approval over again. But that new ERA also failed to achieve the  required two-thirds majority in the House on November 15, 1983.   But today, in defiance of historical reality and the clear acceptance  of the situation by all relevant participants in the original debate,  the Democrats have brought forward a resolution that denies the  obvious. Now, the proponents of this resolution want to convince their  base that if both Houses of Congress pass this joint resolution, and it  is signed into law, the 1972 ERA will become part of the Constitution  just because the Democrats control the Virginia State legislature and  that legislature passed the ERA this year.   Even current Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--and she is  taking a lot of heat for this--a supporter of ERA since its beginning,  has said, just a few months ago:         I hope someday we will start all over again on the ERA,       collecting the necessary States to ratify it.    On Monday of this week, Justice Ginsburg said of the ERA:         I would like to see a new beginning. I would like to see it       start over. There is too much controversy about latecomers--      Virginia, long after the deadline passed. Plus a number of       States have withdrawn their ratification. So if you count a       latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard States that       said: We have changed our minds.    Congress does not have the constitutional authority to retroactively  revive the failed constitutional amendment and to subject the citizens  of all 50 States to what may be the current political trends in just  one State.   The U.S. Supreme Court has already recognized that. Past Democratic  leaderships of the House have recognized that. Justice Ginsburg has  recognized that. But apparently, the current Democratic leadership is  intent on rewriting history.   As we have our debate today, I will show, and our speakers will show,  what the real intent about this is, and it has nothing to do with equal  rights. It has a lot to do with other issues that will be exposed  today.   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin, (Mr. Sensenbrenner).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining for  both sides?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.
