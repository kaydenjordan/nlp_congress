 Madam Speaker, I stand for patients and taxpayers in  support of empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices and to pass on  the savings to lower out-of-pocket costs. We must seize this once-in-a- generation opportunity to make healthcare affordable and to promote the  development of new cures.   Some policymakers have argued that lowering costs and sustaining  biomedical R&D are an either/or proposition, that Medicare negotiation  for all drugs in parts B and D must necessarily degrade innovation. I  disagree. Cracking down on exploitations of exclusivity with thoughtful  policy could turbocharge new therapeutics and lower the price of old  ones with the effect of lowering out-of-pocket costs for patients,  promoting high-impact science, and saving the government money that  Congress can use to expand health insurance for low-income Americans  and senior citizens.   That policy is within reach, and I strongly support meaningful  Medicare negotiation in the Build Back Better agenda.                            ____________________
