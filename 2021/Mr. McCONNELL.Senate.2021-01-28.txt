 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, normally, today and tomorrow, we  would be welcoming many thousands of Americans to the Capitol for the  annual March for Life. Every year, the march is one of the most  important things that happens here in Washington. Americans of all  ages, diverse backgrounds, and many faiths speak up peacefully and  powerfully for the most fundamental human right. They make our Nation  confront the fact that even the most modest protections for innocent  life are still not secure.   The pandemic has taken this year's march online. That is a particular  pity, given signs that the new administration may be poised to  steamroll even the most limited--limited--safeguards for conscience,  let alone for life itself.   The new Washington needs to hear the marchers more than ever. A case  in point, the word is out our new administration is planning to rescind  the Mexico City policy this very day, run over the consciences of  American taxpayers, and put them back on the hook for funding abortions  overseas. An administration that wanted to pursue unity might observe  that 77 percent of Americans--including a majority of Democrats--and 85  percent of Independents don't want taxpayer dollars to fund foreign  abortions.   This and many other commonsense pro-life policies enjoy broad support  from the American people, but the radicalism of the modern Democratic  Party seems dug in. Fortunately, political dynamics change, but the  moral truth does not. Executive orders can't alter the basic science of  human life. So I thank my fellow Kentuckians and all Americans who are  participating. We will see you in person next year                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on a totally different matter,  the country has waited to see whether the new administration would  follow a pro-job, pro-worker, pro-working family approach or give in to  the far left and put ideological concerns before kitchen table ones.  Unfortunately, we didn't have to wait long.   As recently as October, now-President Biden said: ``You can't  [legislate] by executive action unless you're a dictator.'' Well, in 1  week, he signed more than 30 unilateral actions, and working Americans  are getting short shrift.   The President abruptly canceled the Keystone Pipeline, a massive  setback for energy security in North America. The Canadian leader  called it ``a gut punch.'' I imagine the 11,000 American workers,  including 8,000 union workers who were counting on that work, feel the  same way.   We have headed back into an international pact that would have us  self-inflict serious pain on working families, has failed to curb  China's emissions, and without which our own emissions have been  dropping anyway. And yesterday, the administration slammed the brakes  on further domestic energy development on the huge swaths of land owned  by the Federal Government: no new oil, gas, or coal leases on Federal  land.   Our responsible use of these lands accounts for more than a fifth-- one-fifth--of our domestic production, about 2.8 million barrels per  day. That is almost the equivalent of Kuwait's daily oil production  from our Federal lands alone; plus, more than 10 percent of domestic  natural gas.   And 2019 marked the first time in nearly 70 years when U.S. energy  exports outpaced imports. For the first time since the 1950s, our  Nation ran an energy surplus, not a deficit. That has been great news,  but some leftwing elites are not happy. The sources of this affordable  domestic energy are not sufficiently trendy.   As John Kerry explained yesterday on behalf of the administration, he  wants the large numbers of American workers in those sectors to find  ``better choices''--better choices than their good jobs that feed their  families and strengthen our independence. Remember, with the pipeline  cancellation, the President effectively closed the door on thousands of  American jobs with the stroke of a pen.   According to one news report, one welder from Pipeliners Local 798,  who had been working in Nebraska, says he has already had to lay off  his whole  [[Page S183]]  team before losing his job himself. He said he sat down in his truck  and simply cried.   This latest new prohibition will replicate that heartbreak many times  over. According to one study, the decision on Federal lands will leave  us down nearly 1 million American jobs by next year alone--1 million  lost jobs by next year alone.   It is a heck of a way to kick off a Presidency: mass layoffs of our  own citizens, and working Americans in other sectors will pay as well.  One analysis found this decision could increase household energy costs  by almost $20 billion over the next decade, and President Biden, John  Kerry, and the whole gang appear to be just getting warmed up.   Mr. Kerry admitted yesterday that even if the United States somehow  brought our carbon emissions to zero, it wouldn't make much difference  in the global picture. That is because our competitors, including  China, have already gone roaring past us.   But there is one kind of cooling these policies will achieve. They  will ice the job market in communities all across America. In the State  of New Mexico, 65 percent of oil and gas production is tied to Federal  lands. By one estimate, 16,000 jobs will be on the chopping block in  that State alone--that State alone--next year if President Biden's ban  holds up.   In Colorado, it would cost another 3,000 jobs and more than 40  percent of the State's natural gas production.   As a Kentuckian, I am all too familiar with the way these Democratic  policies can hurt communities. Kentucky paid dearly for the first round  of these liberal policies under President Obama. We have no desire to  be subjected to a sequel, especially when John Kerry says we should  take the rate at which coal is already declining and quintuple it.   In her confirmation hearing yesterday, the President's nominee to be  Energy Secretary referenced ``jobs that might be sacrificed.'' Yeah,  that is absolutely right. Well, she gets some points for honesty. That  is what happened the last time these folks called the shots. Jobs were  sacrificed, including, ultimately, some of the jobs of the Democratic  politicians who backed these policies.   There is a concept in sports that a coach or a manager should never  make a decision that will make the opposing team happy. If they are  torn about a risky play call or if they are overthinking a pitching  change, they should ask themselves which decision their opponents would  rather see and do the opposite. Our new administration is failing that  test on domestic energy.   China, Russia, and our other competitors must be thrilled, absolutely  thrilled that our new government is essentially declaring war on some  of our own economic foundations to satisfy a craving for symbolic  gestures--willfully throwing our own people out of work, reducing our  domestic energy security, raising costs and prices for working  families--all for no meaningful impact on global temperatures, just to  buy applause at those international conferences, where the participants  all assemble by private jet.   It shouldn't be this way, not with a President who campaigned on  protecting the lunch-pail union jobs that his left flank wants to  eliminate. The President was not elected to enact policies that prompt  a certain young Congresswoman from New York City to boast online that  her radical ideas are shaping his energy policies. The last 4 years  proved that growing our prosperity, reducing emissions, and expanding  domestic energy are actually not in tension. We can achieve all three.   There is nothing green about a tsunami of pink slips for American  workers or carting Canadian crude around in trucks and trains instead  of a pipeline. This piecemeal Green New Deal is the wrong prescription,  wrong for the environment, wrong for national security, and most of all  for the working Americans who will soon be formerly working Americans  if this keeps up.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the American Printing House for the  Blind, APH, has held a special place in Gary Mudd's life since he was  in the sixth grade. Over the last three decades, he has become one of  the leading voices and most successful advocates for the world's  largest nonprofit creating educational products for people who are  blind and visually impaired. Now, Gary is closing that book and  beginning a well-deserved retirement. As he does, I would like to offer  my congratulations and recognize his many contributions to APH's  mission and its future.   As a student, Gary took classes next door to APH at the Kentucky  School for the Blind in Louisville. His textbooks prominently displayed  APH's name. His teachers spoke of the organization with the highest  esteem. And at night in his dorm room, he could hear the churn of the  braille printing presses. At this early age, Gary was surrounded by the  positive difference APH could make in a person's life.   Of course, his path to APH wasn't as easy as walking next door. Gary  got his start working in radio. After 4 years, he decided he wanted to  join the printing house. Anyone who knows Gary could tell you that once  he set his mind on the job, it was only a matter of time before a new  opportunity became available. To hear him tell it, Gary badgered APH's  then-president until he got the chance to put his skills to work as a  marketing associate in 1986.   Decades of Gary's characteristic persistence brought more  opportunities and new responsibilities. At last, he got the chance to  steer the organization as its vice president of government and  community affairs. Through books, tactile educational products, and  ever improving technologies, Gary helped APH drive inclusion and help  students and adults achieve success.   At every step, Gary has continued learning and adapting to advance  APH's mission. He has built strong relationships with educational  experts and community leaders. In 2011, he even had the chance to join  Dolly Parton on stage as they announced a partnership with the music  icon's Imagination Library.   I have had the pleasure of working closely with Gary to deliver  hundreds of millions of Federal dollars to help APH serve people  throughout the country. On Capitol Hill, Gary's loyal guide dogs,  Heathcliff and Denver, are probably as well-known and admired as he is.  With a gentle nature and a passion for his work, Gary has made friends  and allies throughout Washington who are eager to support APH's  inspiring work.   Gary has a lot of plans for his retirement, but they don't include  slowing down. He looks forward to pursuing passions like biking around  Louisville, reading the books on his shelf, and maybe even going back  to school. His first goal is to spend more time with his wife, Susan,  their daughters and their grandchildren. He has earned every minute of  it. I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking Gary for  his leadership in Kentucky and to send him into retirement with our  best wishes.                            ____________________
