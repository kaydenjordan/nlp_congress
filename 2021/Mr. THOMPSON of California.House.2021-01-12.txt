 Mr. Speaker, the President of the United  States instigated an attack against our democracy.   For months, he ginned up his supporters with lies about our election  and incited them to violence. On the 6th of January, he unleashed a mob  on the Capitol.  [[Page H145]]    The President must be held accountable for this vile attack. He knew  what he was doing, and now, five people are dead.   Congress will not be intimidated. America will not succumb to mob  rule.   The Vice President can initiate removal of a President who is unfit  for office, and this President is unfit. He must be removed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this resolution, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote on impeachment tomorrow.
