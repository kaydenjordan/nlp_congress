 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in commemoration of National Police  Week, families from across the country are gathering in Washington to  pay respect to law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the  line of duty last year.   Mississippi tragically lost four officers who are being recognized  this week at ceremonies in Mississippi and here in the Nation's  Capital.   On May 17, 2018, Officer Emmett Paul Morris, 61, of Louin, was killed  in a car crash. Having served the Raleigh and Reservoir Police  Departments, Officer Morris was described as ``a kind man who had the  spirit of service.''   Patrolman LeAnn Simpson of Philadelphia, MS, died in an automobile  crash while responding to a call on November 24, 2018. She was just 23  years old. Prior to joining the Philadelphia Police Department, Simpson  was a sergeant in the U.S. Army.   The loss of two other officers from Mississippi last year has special  significance to me because they had dedicated themselves to protecting  my hometown of Brookhaven in Lincoln County, MS.   Officers James Kevin White, 35, of Sontag, and Corporal Walter  Zachery Marshall Moak, 31, of Brookhaven, lost their lives in a  terrible standoff on September 29, 2018.   Corporal Moak served with the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office before  serving with the Wesson and Brookhaven Police Departments.   Officer White, in addition to being a police officer, served in Iraq  with the Mississippi National Guard.   I join the families and communities of these four Mississippi  officers in remembering their lives and expressing sincere gratitude  for their service.   Sadly, their sacrifice did not end our losses in Mississippi.  Mississippians just yesterday, this past Monday, paused to mourn a  veteran Biloxi police officer, Robert McKeithen, as he was laid to rest  after being gunned down outside the police station on May 5, 2019--last  Sunday.   These officers and Trooper Kenneth ``Josh'' Smith of the Mississippi  Highway Patrol, along with the more than 160 officers from around the  country who lost their lives, deserve national recognition.   Law enforcement officers risk their lives daily to help keep us safe,  and any loss of an officer deeply affects entire communities. I greatly  admire members of the law enforcement community who remain steadfast in  the  [[Page S2802]]  dangers of their noble profession. We acknowledge their brave service  and fortify our support of their work to protect our families and our  communities.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
