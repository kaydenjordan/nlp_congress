 Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Cornyn in  introducing the ``Preventing Outages With Enhanced Resilience and  Operations Nationwide (POWER ON) Act of 2021''.   This legislation would authorize the Federal government to offer  grants to States and Tribal governments to modernize the electrical  grid and better withstand extreme weather events and natural disasters.   It would also serve as a catalyst for our Nation's research and  development and deployment of new technologies that will ensure our  Nation's grid can meet the challenges of climate change and continue to  provide reliable electricity to our citizens.   The ``POWER ON Act'' is a bipartisan step-forward to combating the  devastating impact of climate change and keep the lights on for  everyone.   This legislation would help protect America's electric grid and make  it more resilient.   Climate change is real and nowhere is that fact more clear than in my  State of California. As the State continues to experience historic  wildfires, droughts, dangerous mudslides, prolonged heatwaves, and  extreme wind events that prompt sustained power shutoffs, the Federal  government can and must help. We must work with States to invest in our  electrical infrastructure and make our grids more reliable.   This legislation would establish a grant program through the  Department of Energy for States and Tribal governments to award funds  to eligible entities to deploy projects that enhance the resilience of  the electric grid.   This legislation specifically includes natural disasters, such as  wildfires, and extreme weather such as heatwaves, drought, and high  winds as threats to the resiliency of the electrical grid.  Additionally, it explicitly includes Public Safety Power Shutoffs,  which have become all too routine in California in recent years, as  eligible events.   To protect ratepayers, this legislation ensures that a utility may  not seek any cost recovery for any grant awarded through this new  program.   Lastly, this legislation would establish a grant program through the  Department of Energy for research, development, demonstration, and  commercial application of innovations to enhance resilience and  strengthen emergency response and management of the electric grid.   California has always been a leader in research and development, and  this new program would allow universities, national laboratories and  others to make our grid smarter and more resilient. This legislation  will not only work to harden our grid but it will allow our world- renowned institutions to usher in new technologies that will keep our  grid and our citizens safe.   I thank my colleague Senator Cornyn and our House partners,  Representatives Doris Matsui, Jared Huffman, Doug LaMalfa, Eddie  Bernice Johnson, Kevin Brady, and Michael Burgess for championing this  bill.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``POWER ON  Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
