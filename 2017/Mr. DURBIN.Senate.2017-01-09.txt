 I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, there was debate on the Senate floor that  went on for years. It was a personal thing, a personal issue with two  Senators--one was a Republican, the other a Democrat. The Republican  was Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico. The Democrat was Senator Paul  Wellstone of Minnesota. The two of them had teamed up with a very  simple goal in mind. They wanted to make sure every health insurance  policy in America covered mental illness.   When you think about the fact that so many Americans suffer from some  form of depression and that mental illness is something that so many  families--at some point or another--face, you wonder: Well, why didn't  the health insurance policies cover mental illness? The reason, of  course, was that it takes some extended, and oftentimes expensive, care  to help those with mental illness. In other cases, there was an  argument made that you will not find a cure.   Things have changed a lot in the world of mental illness over the  last few decades and changed for the better. There are new medications  that are available and some even better ones on the way. There is new  treatment available and more hope for people. Pete Domenici, a  Republican from New Mexico, and Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from  Minnesota, did not give up. They insisted on it, and they won.   They won with the requirement that health insurance policies cover  not just mental illness and treatment but also substance abuse  treatment. I will be honest with you. I followed that debate closely. I  did not pay that much attention, at the time, to the substance abuse  treatment part of their effort. Now I have. I think many people across  America have. There was a supplement in the Chicago Sun Times this  morning, published by USA TODAY. It is entitled ``Obamacare repeal  jeopardizes mental health, addiction coverage.''   I tore it out of the paper on the airplane to bring it to the floor  of the Senate because this a good day for us to reflect on what this  article has to say. We are now in the midst of the budget resolution  effort that is designed by the Republican majority to repeal ObamaCare.   The Republicans hate ObamaCare. They hate it almost as much as the  devil hates holy water. They have tried for 6 years to repeal it with a  singular focus. I don't know how many times they voted in the House-- some said over 60 times--to repeal it. They have said that for so many  years, and we have said to them: What will you do after you repeal it?  They said: Well, we have a plan. For 6 years, they have said: We have a  plan to replace it.   We have never seen it. No one has ever seen it. It raises the  question about whether they do have a plan. They certainly have a plan  to repeal it, but when it comes to replacing it, they don't offer  anything--but they are going to go ahead with it. They are bent on  doing this regardless of the outcome. For a lot of people across  America, this could be devastating. This article talks about a family  in Kentucky, the home State of the Republican leader. Melissa  Fleckinger of Edgewood, KY. She had to pay for heroin treatment for her  daughter Amanda before the Affordable Care Act. Her son Brian's  treatment for heroin addiction was covered by the ACA, but  unfortunately he died of an overdose in 2015.   This article goes on to talk about what it means to have children who  are addicted to drugs and parents who are desperately trying to find  treatment. Some of the things that are said in the course of this are  really worrisome because this article spells out what happens to  families without health insurance that covers substance abuse  treatment. They become helpless, unable to take care of their kids.   The Republicans have come back and said: Well, we will just do a  partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Listen to what this articles  says:   Almost any route taken on Capitol Hill leads to an unraveling of  addiction and mental health coverage for those people. Even the partial  ACA repeal Congress is considering would eliminate the tax credits that  reduce the premiums for about 85 percent of the people who buy  insurance on the exchanges. Most of those who get the tax credits pay  less than $100 a month for health insurance and have very low out-of- pocket costs that make it possible for them to afford coverage.   What they go on to say here is that putting a requirement in the  health insurance policy that it cover mental health illness and  substance abuse treatment means nothing if the people cannot afford to  pay the premiums for the health insurance policy. So the Republican  plan that would eliminate the tax credits families need to be able to  afford the policy means there is no way they are going to get coverage  for themselves and their kids.   Who is going to be affected by that? I will tell you what I found in  Illinois. What I found in Illinois is that the current opioid and  heroin epidemic is everywhere. There is no town too small, and there is  no suburb too wealthy to avoid it--story after story of teenagers and  young people addicted who have no place to turn.   If the Republicans have their way in the Senate and the House, they  will close the door for many of these young people. I see my colleague  from the State of New Hampshire. I was stunned to read--I don't know if  it is still the case, but I was stunned to read several months ago that  when you look at the average number of deaths from opioids  [[Page S139]]  and heroin across the Nation--and Illinois is, I am not making any  excuses here, we are average--the rate of death for heroin-opioid  overdoses in West Virginia is twice the national average, and the rate  in New Hampshire is three times the national average.   Listen to what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean in  New Hampshire. I might say to the Senator from New Hampshire that she  is quoted in this article.         Repealing the ACA would cause [in New Hampshire] nearly       120,000 people to lose coverage in the State, where federal       data show a nearly 200% increase in overdose deaths in the       past five years. More than 48,000 Medicaid claims were for       substance use disorder in 2015, making an ACA repeal [in the       words of Senator Shaheen] ``literally a matter of life and       death.''        Ohio. At the Cincinnati Center for Addiction Treatment, CEO       Sandra Kuehn said about 30% of Kuehn's patients are covered       for treatment because of the expansion [under ACA]. Overdose       deaths in Ohio climbed from 2,531 in 2014 to 3,050 in 2015,       up more than 20 percent.        Kentucky.    The home State of the Republican Senate leader.         Overdose deaths here totaled 1,248 in 2015, up 17% from the       previous year. Fentanyl--which is much stronger than heroin--      was involved in 420 fatal overdoses in 2015, up nearly 250%       over the previous year.    The lady who was quoted earlier who lost her son to the overdose was  not surprised. She knows several other people who have overdosed and  many others who have died, including one last week.         Chicago.    I am proud to represent it.         Up to 30% of the 9,000 inmates in the Cook County Jail have       a diagnosed mental illness. . . . ``The ACA has been a game       changer for those who were in and out of Cook County Jail,''       says Mark Ishaug, CEO of Thresholds, a Chicago treatment       provider. It costs less than $20,000 a year for Threshold's       highest level of community-based mental-health care with a       housing voucher. . . .    So $20,000 a year or less than that. Do you know what it costs to  incarcerate that same person? It costs $70,000 a year to incarcerate  them. About one-third of the patients being treated by Thresholds are  covered by the Affordable Care Act. What is the alternative, I say to  my Republican friends. They can't wait to repeal this, but they don't  have an alternative.   Meanwhile, in Illinois, in New Hampshire, in Maine, and every State  in the Nation, mental illness is still a challenge, and substance abuse  is on the rise and people are dying from heroin and opioid overdoses.  This is the height of irresponsibility, to repeal this measure with no  replacement. It is sad to say we have reached this point where a  political score has to be settled now that the Republicans are in  control of the House and the Senate.   Now that they have an incoming President, the Republicans finally get  their day. Someone said to me: Why is public sentiment starting to  change on this issue and even among Republican politicians? I said:  They have been saying irresponsible things for a long time, but now  people are taking them seriously. As they take them seriously, they  realize what a devastating impact it is going to have.   Nicholas Kristof wrote in the New York Times last week:         If the Republicans ran a home renovation business, they       would start tearing down your roof this month and promise to       return in 2019 with some options for a new one--if you       survived.    Last week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote an op-ed arguing that  repeal should not be done without simultaneously being replaced.  Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, has said that repealing  the law without replacing it is ``a flawed concept'' and that having a  replacement ready first would be a more ``prudent approach'' in the  Republican Senator's words.   Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has said she would like  to see ``detailed framework'' accompanying any repeal.   Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said: ``I don't think we  can just repeal ObamaCare and say we are going to get the answer 2  years from now.''   Over and over again, these Republican Senators are realizing how  totally irresponsible it would be if we go forward with this proposal.  I will tell you what troubles me as a representative of a State that  has the great city of Chicago and a wonderful metropolitan area. I come  from the other end of the State, the rural part of our State. I wonder  what is going to happen to our rural hospitals if the Affordable Care  Act is repealed. I think about Franklin Hospital in Benton, IL,  population, 7,300. The hospital has been there 60 years. In the past 15  years, it has been teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. It all changed  6 years ago with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the  expansion of our Medicaid Program in Illinois.   Because of those changes, Franklin Hospital found they could survive.  Expanding Medicaid cut Franklin Hospital's uncompensated care in half.  In Franklin's emergency room, they saw 600 fewer no-pay patients and  428 more Medicaid patients compared to the previous year. This,  combined with increases in Medicaid funding, allowed Franklin Hospital  to invest in much needed improvements and to consider bringing nuclear  medicine and a retail pharmacy to Benton, IL. What does that mean in  that city? Well, it means all the difference in the world. There is  something else that has to be said. If that hospital--Franklin Hospital  in Benton--closes, it will not just mean a longer drive for critical  health care, it is going to mean job losses. It will mean the loss of  4,300 jobs in the 12th congressional district, where Franklin Hospital  is located.   So when the President-elect talks about saving 6 or 800 jobs at  Carrier Corporation, good; I am glad. But then for his party to turn  around and pass a measure which could kill 84,000 to 95,000 jobs in  Illinois, that is a move in the wrong direction. I say to my Republican  friends, go home and talk to the people you represent. Listen to what  they have to say about what we are doing--addiction, mental illness,  and rural hospitals that are on the brink of closing, if you have your  way politically. This is no victory for the people of America to repeal  the Affordable Care Act without a replacement that is as good or  better.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to reflect on the 1-year  anniversary of rain and winter storms that swept across the State of  Illinois, causing widespread flooding and devastation.   In the midst of the holidays, heavy rainfall of over 7 inches a day  in some areas caused water levels on rivers in Illinois to reach  record, or near record, heights. The Mississippi River at Thebes  reached its highest crest level on record at 47.7 feet.   Flooding forced many communities to evacuate their homes for their  own safety. Damages to property in these Illinois communities totaled  more than $15 million.   Sadly, these storms were so severe that flooded roadways tragically  claimed the lives of 10 people whose vehicles were swept away by  flooding.   Alexander and Randolph counties were two areas most impacted by this  flood. I went to visit two towns in these areas--Olive Branch, IL, and  Evansville, IL--and I saw miles of flood damage to agricultural lands,  homes, and businesses. What I saw was heartbreaking.   I spoke with residents who were concerned about being able to recover  from the flood and resulting damages and who were concerned about what  could happen if levees overtop and breach again in the future.   People like Bruce Ford, from Olive Branch, IL, worked day and night  to clean out debris and move equipment back into their businesses, but  he worried about how long he would be out of business and whether or  not he would be able to rebuild in the event of another disaster. And  he is not alone--many residents in these communities worry that they  will not have the means to fix properties and businesses all over  again.   The Governor declared 23 counties State disaster areas, and State and  local emergency responders were dispatched to affected areas. I  supported his request for a Federal disaster declaration for 21  counties in the State.   The State disaster declaration allowed people in affected communities  whose homes and businesses were damaged to start repairs and receive  the help they needed.   And I want to say thanks for the hard work and dedication of James  Joseph, head of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; he was there  when his constituents and communities needed him the most.   The State provided over 997,000 sandbags, over 4,000 tons of sand,  and 117 Illinois Department of Transportation trucks for flood  mitigation and response efforts.   The Small Business Administration also made loans available to  homeowners and businesses in Christian, Iroquois, Ford, Kankakee,  Macon, Montgomery, Sangamon, Shelby, and Vermilion Counties.   I want to acknowledge the dedication of the State and Federal  employees who pitched in at every level, from the Federal Emergency  Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to the Illinois  Emergency Management Agency.   Finally, I can't overstate how proud I am of the volunteers, National  Guard members, and local law enforcement agencies who came forward to  keep our communities safe. Before flooding began, local law enforcement  and emergency responders went door-to-door to advise residents to  evacuate and move to higher ground, saving the lives of many who heeded  the call and sought out shelter with family and friends before the  flooding began.   There is still work to be done, but the people who live and work in  the damaged communities have made incredible progress rebuilding.  Thousands of volunteers have helped with the cleanup. People from all  over the State pitched in to help their neighbors and even strangers  get back on their feet. Hearing these kinds of stories make me proud to  be from Illinois.   Our thoughts remain with the many people who lost their loved ones,  their homes, and other property last year.   I want to thank everyone who has been engaged in the rescue and  cleanup.   We are rebuilding--as Illinoisans always do--and we will be stronger  for it.                            ____________________
