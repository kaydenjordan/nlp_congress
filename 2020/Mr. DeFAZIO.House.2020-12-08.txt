SEC. 335. PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE.         The Secretary shall expedite the activities required to be       carried out under section 204 of the Water Resources       Development Act of 1992 (33 U.S.C. 2326) regarding the use of       improvement dredging of the Portsmouth Federal navigation       project in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, carried out pursuant to       section 3 of the Act of August 13, 1946 (33 U.S.C. 426g), as       a source of clean beach fill material to reinforce the stone       revetment at Nantasket Beach, Hull,  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks, including extraneous material on S. 1811, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, legislation very similar to this passed the House of  Representatives unanimously earlier this year. This bill will continue  the bipartisan tradition restarted by Chairman Shuster in 2014 of doing  a Water Resources Development Act every 2 years. It is critical.   I am thankful to Ranking Member Graves, Chairwoman Grace Napolitano,  and Subcommittee Ranking Member Bruce Westerman for their hard work in  developing the House version and helping us negotiate with the Senate.  I also thank our Senate colleagues, Committee on Environment and Public  Works Chairman John Barrasso, who has pushed very hard for this bill,  and Ranking Member Tom Carper, for their collaboration.   Madam Speaker, this builds on the success of H.R. 7575, which, as I  said, passed the House of Representatives earlier this year  unanimously. It authorizes construction of 46 reports of the Chief of  the Corps of Engineers. It is a record number of Chief's Reports,  almost matching the number authorized in 2016 and 2018.   Now, that would only be made possible by the full utilization of the  harbor maintenance trust fund. For decades, since Ronald Reagan was  President, we have been assessing a tiny ad valorem tax on the value of  goods and containers flowing through the ports coming into the United  States of America.   Despite the pressing need to dredge our harbors, to authorize steps  to repair jetties before they fail totally and become much more  expensive to replace, for many years Congress refused to spend that  full amount of money. There is now around $10 billion collected in  taxes from the American people for a specific purpose for which it has  not been spent.   I started working on this with Bud Shuster--not Bill--Bud Shuster,  his dad, back in 1996 to access the full amount of the harbor  maintenance trust fund. It got out of that committee twice under  Chairman Shuster. He was quite amazed it came out unanimously,  including Freedom Caucus members and others, but Paul Ryan saw fit to  strip it from the bill because he didn't think that we should maintain  our harbors and our ports as a maritime Nation. I guess being inland,  he didn't think that was so important.   We now have finally gotten to that point where we are going to access  the funds. There is one tiny remaining problem--since the Senate seems  to be totally incapable of passing any individual pieces of legislation  and doing nothing individually except judges--we are seeking to attach  this to the Omnibus, Continuing Resolution, budget deal, whatever the  heck you want to call it.   Now, the Committee on Appropriations in the Senate has raised  concerns. Even though this does not count officially against  allocations on an annual basis, they are worried that somehow someone  might look at them and say, Well you have got all this other money, so  we are going to cut back on your regular amount of money. That is not  going to happen. This need is great.   This is a huge bipartisan success with agreement by harbors all  around the country, large and small, emerging, developed, energy ports.  It is critical to the United States of America as a maritime Nation  that we get this done and we begin to do the work on a daily basis.   Of our 58 largest harbors, 35 percent are at their authorized depths.  That means ships go around, that means ships have to pass too close to  one another in order to navigate restricted channels. It means jetties  that are beginning to fail don't get fixed, and every year that they  fail they become much, much more expensive to repair until the point of  total failure, at which point it becomes incredibly expensive.   Madam Speaker, should we access the harbor maintenance trust fund  over the next 5 years at $2 billion a year, plus the expected income,  we could bring all of our ports up to a state of good repair in 5  years. What the Senate staff is insisting on would stretch that out for  20 years--and actually, would stretch it out longer, because if you  start doing things 18 years from now, they would have deteriorated even  more and become more expensive. So they would, essentially,  indefinitely put off bringing our harbors to a state of good repair  because of unfounded concern.   Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that common sense will prevail, if there  is any such thing on the other side of Capitol Hill.   I want to go back to thanking members of our committee and the staff  who did great work on this bill. It is an excellent bill.   It also deals with inland waterways on a cost-share basis. It deals  with building in resilience to deal with climate change--even if you  don't believe in it--and will use natural systems as much as possible  for these needs.   Chairwoman Grace Napolitano, who did not travel here today, was  dogged in her support for the maintenance needs and advocacy for her  large harbors. And ultimately, we came to an agreement, as I said,  between all sizes of harbors around the country.   Madam Speaker, I also thank my ranking member, Sam Graves. He  couldn't have been a better partner in helping us deal with the other  side of Capitol Hill, and Mr. Westerman for his steadfast support and  importance to the final bill. Today's success would not have been  possible without their great work.  [[Page H6978]]    There are a number of members of the committee who were particularly  crucial: Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Abby Finkenauer, Harley Rouda, Conor  Lamb, Angie Craig, Chris Pappas, Antonio Delgado, Lizzie Fletcher,    Greg Stanton, and Sharice Davids, all members of the committee who  contributed significantly to this.   And also, we did lose the language to reauthorize the Clean Water  State Revolving Fund, which hasn't been reauthorized since 1987. I kind  of thought it was time but, apparently, that is right now not on the  radar of some people.   Madam Speaker, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is  legislation that is essential to everyday American life-supporting jobs  and our economy, protecting American lives and property, and restoring  and protecting our vital natural resources. The Water Resources  Development Act of 2020 (WRDA 2020) modernizes and invests in our water  resources infrastructure by: (1) authorizing critical, locally driven  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) projects and studies; (2)  expediting the delivery of future projects; (3) increasing water  storage and supply; (4) preventing, managing, and eradicating invasive  species that reduce and degrade our water resources infrastructure and  the environment; (5) building resiliency to increasing storm and  flooding risks: (6) increasing community and Tribal involvement and  engagement; and (7) addressing communities with affordability concerns.  WRDA 2020 strengthens our Nation's security and economic  competitiveness by deepening our ports and harbors, maintaining our  inland waterways, and providing protection from dangerous flooding,  while remaining committed to economically and environmentally  responsible development.   In WRDA bills, Congress authorizes studies and projects encompassing  the key missions of the Corps, including supporting coastal and inland  waterways infrastructure, effective and targeted flood protection,  environmental restoration, storm damage prevention, and proactive water  supply initiatives. Each of the 46 completed feasibility study reports  of the Chief of Engineers (Chiefs Reports) authorized by WRDA 2020 were  locally driven and cost-shared, rigorously studied, and determined by  the Corps to be economically justified, technically sound, and  environmentally acceptable.   Since 2014, Congress has resumed the tradition of biennial  consideration of WRDAs, and WRDA 2020 continues to deliver new  authorities on a predictable authorization cycle to meet the water  resource needs of local communities and to provide appropriate  oversight of, and policy direction to, the Administration and the  Corps. The transformative nature of the last three WRDA bills has  provided the Corps and the non-Federal interests with new opportunities  to advance projects more quickly and with greater effectiveness. WRDA  2020 builds on these changes by ensuring that future water resources  development projects are developed in a resilient and more sustainable  manner, by targeting increased Federal assistance to rural and  economically-disadvantaged communities and Tribes that have seen  challenges in implementing critical water resources infrastructure, and  by modernizing the process for project development to ensure that all  project benefits, including economical, regional, environmental, and  other societal benefits, are considered in the formulation of future  projects.   Title 1 of WRDA 2020 ensures that the Corps operates and executes  projects to meet our Nation's ever evolving 21st century needs. This  title supports our transportation infrastructure and ensures the  efficient flow of domestic and international commerce by reinstating  the Federal commitment to our ports, harbors, and inland waterways. It  builds on the CARES Act (Pub. L. 116-136) by unlocking funds that have  already been collected from shippers for the purpose of harbor  deepening and maintenance, and that have remained unspent, in the  Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) while there are unmet operation  and maintenance needs at ports and harbors. In addition, this title  establishes a new authorization framework for the allocation of harbor  maintenance funds to ensure equitable expenditures to meet the ongoing  needs of the Nation's largest ports, Commercial Strategic Seaports,  Great Lakes Harbors, and emerging harbors. Title 1 also addresses  critical needs to modernize our Federal inland waterway system by  authorizing additional funds from the General Fund of the Treasury  towards the construction of projects on the Inland Waterway System,  which handles approximately half of all inland waterway freight and  one-twelfth of all national freight.   Further, Title 1 of WRDA 2020 ensures that future water resources  development projects are designed and built with greater resiliency to  address the needs of the next century. For example, this title directs  the Corps to consider nature-based and natural features while  developing projects, and advocates for innovation that ensures the  resiliency and longevity of Corps construction. Similarly, this title  recognizes the needs of communities that are currently facing repeat  flooding events by providing critical assistance for the expedited  consideration of permanent measures to reduce local flooding risks.   Moreover, Title 1 makes policy reforms to promote stronger local- level partnerships, decisionmaking, and effective, transparent project  development and implementation that will overall improve water  infrastructure development. Other provisions within this title ensure  the protection of all communities through wider consideration of  project benefits and greater flexibility and support for populations  with affordability concerns. Title 1 also helps communities respond  faster to natural disasters, improves the safety of our dams and  levees, addresses necessary updates to aging infrastructure, and  supports critical work against invasive species and harmful algal  blooms. Lastly, this title recognizes the increasing role the Corps  plays in addressing the water supply and water conservation needs of  local and rural communities.   Title 2 of WRDA 2020 ensures continuity in addressing our water  resources development needs. It authorizes feasibility studies for the  development of future projects, while ensuring that studies currently  underway are completed expeditiously. Title 2 also makes necessary  adjustments to existing studies or projects to ensure they are forward- looking and encompass as many potential benefits to the localities as  practicable. In addition, this title authorizes the analysis of  regional or watershed-based systems which facilitates cohesive projects  and greater end results for the systems without inadvertently  segmenting out populations or sub-systems. Further, this title directs  the Corps to examine and report back on various Corps internal  processes and assets to identify additional opportunities for Corps  expertise and improvement in work efficacy.   Title 3 addresses ongoing Corps operations and opportunities to  ensure efficient project delivery as well as remove outdated or  duplicative Corps authorizations. Continuing in the tradition of the  last three WRDAs, WRDA 2020 directs the Corps to identify approximately  $10 billion in antiquated construction authorizations that can be  deauthorized, which is roughly equivalent to the cost of the new Chiefs  Reports authorized by this legislation.   In addition, the revisions and updates to projects in Title 3, on  advisement from the Corps, will keep those projects on track for  delivery and maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of these Federal  investments. This title also makes modifications to existing programs  within the Corps to include a wider range of eligible regions for those  programs and provide them with sufficient authorization levels to  achieve their central purposes.   Further, Title 3 deauthorizes or transfers, in part or in whole,  certain projects which are no longer within the mission of the Corps or  are otherwise better suited as returned to the localities. These  actions maintain Corps dependability and its relationships with non- Federal sponsors and stakeholders, while alleviating superfluous lands  or projects that should be returned to states and localities and  removed from Corps responsibilities.   Title 4 of WRDA 2020 affirms the Federal commitment to delivering  water resources projects and the continued improvement of American  water infrastructure. Again, this title authorizes 46 Corps projects to  move to construction and makes changes to projects currently underway  to guarantee their accuracy and long-term value. Projects authorized  under WRDA 2020 will sustain jobs and our economic competitiveness by  maintaining the flow of goods through our navigational channels and  protecting American lives, land, and assets from flood or storm waters.  The projects will restore and enhance our natural resources, ecosystems  and environment, and prepare communities for increasingly wet or dry  conditions. These essential projects will positively impact populations  in all regions of the country and build smarter, more resilient  infrastructure for the benefit of generations to come.   Title 5 of this bill makes several changes to Corps and other Federal  agency authorities related to the control of invasive species or for  other purposes. Invasive species have a devastating impact on our  Nation's water infrastructure, as well as on our water supply.  Increasingly, the Corps is required to partner with other Federal  agencies to control the spread of invasive species, both on land and in  the aquatic environment. The changes made by this title include the  creation of new pilot programs to address invasive species such as  Asian Carp, elodea, and quagga mussels, as well as noxious weeds. This  title also retains the traditional roles of the Corps and other Federal  agencies in controlling the spread or managing and reducing existing  invasive species.   The managers of the U.S. House of Representative and the U.S. Senate  for WRDA  [[Page H6979]]  2020 (``the Managers'') also highlight the following sections of this  legislation and other matters related to the Corps:   Section 109 addresses the critical need to modernize our Federal  Inland Waterway System. This section authorizes additional funds from  the General Fund of the Treasury towards the construction of authorized  inland waterways projects. The Managers have authorized this change to  the current 50-50 cost share for inland projects to resolve the backlog  in these critical projects, and intend that any inland project that  received construction assistance prior to fiscal year 2030 utilize the  new 75-25 cost share authorized by this section through completion of  the project. The Managers also expect that this additional support will  be prioritized for those projects identified by inland users as most  essential in the 20-year capital development plan required under  section 302(d) of WRDA 1986, including the Upper Ohio navigation  system, the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program for the  Upper Mississippi River, and the Three Rivers project in Southeast  Arkansas. It is the intention of the Managers that current  prioritization plans be followed by the Corps in its funding of inland  waterway projects.   Section 112 directs the Corps to ensure meaningful participation and  consultation by economically disadvantaged communities and Indian  Tribes in the development of future water resources projects. During  formulation of WRDA 2020, the Managers heard concerns from economically  disadvantaged communities and Indian Tribes of a lack of transparency  and meaningful communication with these communities. Managers expect  that continuous commitment to, and review of, Corps policies  surrounding community engagement and tribal consultation will minimize  adverse impacts to these populations, including detrimental impacts to  their health, property, and livelihoods. It is the Managers' intention  that the Corps complete reviews and make adjustments, if warranted, to  procedures expeditiously to ameliorate concerns and avoid conflict with  existing and future water resources projects.    Section 125 renews the Congressional commitment to beneficial use of  dredged material. While carrying out the beneficial use of dredged  material pilot program pursuant to section 1122 of WRDA 2016, the Corps  is directed to carry out at least one project utilizing thin layer  placement of dredged fine and coarse grain sediment. This demonstration  program is also authorized to be expanded to apply to recovering lost  storage capacity in reservoirs due to sediment accumulation, if the  project meets the other criteria within the program. The Corps is  directed to carry out at least one project to recover lost storage  capacity under the program as well. With this section, Managers expect  the Corps to select projects that encompass a wide range of regional  areas, economic status, and utilization methods.   Additionally, this section further encourages the Corps to coordinate  planning for the deployment of Federal and non-Federal dredges. In  sequencing dredging work to benefit multiple mission sets and providing  consistent navigational certainty, especially in areas of high maritime  traffic in our Nation's harbors and waterways, the Managers believe  proper implementation of this program will benefit the American economy  and restoration efforts alike. The Managers intend this authority to be  used in conjunction with the Gulf Coast Regional Dredge Demonstration  Program created in P.L. 116-94, the Further Consolidated Appropriations  Act, 2020.   Section 161 makes changes to the study process pursuant to section  203 of WRDA 1986. As required by this section, this new policy does not  apply to any project being authorized by this Act. Further these  changes do not apply to any feasibility study submitted to the Corps  during the one-year period prior to the date of enactment of this  section, such as the Raymondville Drain Project, Lower Rio Grande  Basin, Texas.   Subsection 201(b) states that the Corps is to consider any study  carried out by the Corps for Port Arthur and Orange County, Texas,  flood control project, to be a continuation of the study authorized  under Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay, Texas. While subsection (a)  explicitly authorizes a study for Port Arthur and Orange County, Texas,  the Managers intend that nothing in subsection 201(b) will slow down  the construction of the project for Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay,  Texas.   Section 213 directs the Corps to conduct a comprehensive study of the  Lower Mississippi River. The Managers note that the Mississippi River  has been at flood stage at record length and frequency in recent years.  The Managers intend this study to provide reconsideration of the  operations of existing assets by operating structures throughout the  Lower Mississippi River holistically and, potentially, for multiple  purposes per asset, as well as identifying new projects and utilizing  existing Federal and non-Federal assets, such as river reintroduction  projects, new or existing reservoirs, water supply projects, or other  measures. In completing the study, the Managers intend for the Corps to  collaborate with all levels of government, as well as with non- governmental entities to improve the management of one of the largest  watersheds in the world.   Section 216 includes studies for the Lower and Upper Missouri River.  With a General Investigations study of the Lower Missouri River Basin  already underway, the Managers intend this section to build off this  existing authority and to expeditiously review both a comprehensive  plan and site-specific solutions to combat flooding in communities  across the Lower Missouri River Basin. While this Act specifically and  preemptively waives 3x3x3 requirements, the Managers strongly encourage  the Corps to complete its studies as expeditiously as possible.   Section 222 requires the Corps to issue an annual report that  identifies all authorized studies or projects meeting certain criteria,  including local support and the Corps' capability for executing the  work. The Managers expect this annual report will provide greater  transparency in the Administration's development of both its annual  budget and its project selection process.   In completing this report, the Corps must describe specific benefits  for each authorized study and authorized water resources development  project included in the annual report. This section also requires the  Secretary to include an appendix in the annual report that lists any  submitted proposals that were not included in the annual report and a  description of why the Corps determined that those proposals did not  meet the criteria for inclusion. The Corps shall also make the annual  report to Congress publicly available on the internet and is directed  to submit the report to Congress along with its annual report pursuant  to section 7001 of Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014,  P.L. 113-121 (WRRDA 2014).   The Managers intend for the Corps to expeditiously develop  implementation guidance for the provisions contained in WRDA 2020, as  well as provisions from prior WRDAs that have yet to be developed.  Section 223 of WRDA 2020 directs the Corps to expeditiously complete  these actions, and consistent with section 1105 of WRDA 2018, to  involve stakeholders in the development of guidance materials. In  addition, the Managers direct the Secretary to directly engage and  consult with, and provide briefings for, the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Environment on  Public Works on these actions.   Section 229 amends section 1104(b) of WRDA 2018 to require that the  Corps provide the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the  Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the  House of Representatives an annual written update on the Corps'  implementation of non-Federal outreach requirements associated with  development of section 7001 annual reports. This section also requires  that the Corps issue guidance for the uniform implementation of the  7001 process by Corps districts and ensure annual compliance with that  guidance. The Managers continue to be concerned with the agency's  ability to consistently implement these policies nationwide.   Section 310 clarifies that any Federal funds used to carry out  construction of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System  (MKARNS) are considered as initiating construction of the project such  that future funds will not require a new start designation. With  initial construction of the MKARNS completed 50 years ago,  modernization of the entire channel was authorized by Congress in 2003  and funds were subsequently provided in 2004. Since that time, the 12- foot deepening project has stalled, but this section will allow  construction of the project to resume without the requirement to obtain  a New Start, a requirement not contemplated when the deepening project  was authorized and funded. This section will ensure the project is  formally considered as a project resumption for budgetary and  appropriations purposes.   Section 348 allows a local government entity, such as a city, with  existing water supply storage in a Federal or non-Federal hydropower  lake within the Arkansas Basin, to access that water supply at a cost  of not more than 110 percent of initial principal cost for the acre- feet sought for a new covered contract for that lake. This section  makes clear that the Managers do not expect the Corps to undertake any  formal reallocation process. Rather, the Managers expect that the Corps  will work only with a local government entity that currently holds the  rights to access water supply storage.   Section 351 allows the Corps, at the request of a non-Federal  interest, to renegotiate the terms and conditions of deferred payment  agreements under Section 103(k) of WRDA 1986 and to accept, without  interest, the pre-payment of non-Federal contributions. The Managers  anticipate that the non-Federal sponsors of the West Bank and Vicinity,  Lake  [[Page H6980]]  Pontchartrain and Vicinity, and Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Damage  Reduction Projects are expected to seek relief under this section in  order to continue large-scale investments to support resiliency in both  their infrastructure and regional ecosystems.   Section 401 authorizes 46 Chief's Reports, including a project for  navigation improvements for the Port of Nome in Nome, Alaska. Nome will  be America's first Arctic deep draft port, enhancing our strategic and  economic competitiveness in the Arctic region. The Managers note the  complementary and important role that modest improvements at Port  Clarence/Point Spencer can play relative to the project at Nome,  Alaska, and for safe Arctic transportation generally, and therefore,  the Managers encourage the Corps of Engineers to expedite its  consideration of the use of Section 107 Continuing Authorities Program  funding to help install and make operational the two 30-ton and one 60- ton industrial grade buoy systems at Port Clarence to serve maritime  safety needs for the Bering Strait as well as the greater Arctic  region. The Managers also encourage the potential use of unobligated  prior-year funds to facilitate the implementation of the mooring buoy  project as soon as possible and note that the Corps was instrumental in  completing a similar project for the placement and use of commercial- grade mooring buoys in the Columbia River.   Various sections under Title 5 of WRDA 2020 protect American assets  and resources by working to prevent the spread and promote the  eradication of certain invasive species. The Managers intend that work  conducted as a result of this Title remain within the jurisdiction of  the involved agencies and encourage a collaborative approach to  solutions that allows each agency to utilize its expertise.  Specifically, under section 508, the Managers intend that, for those  authorities which address murder hornets as an invasive species, the  Department of the Interior shall work in conjunction with the  Department of Agriculture.   The Managers believe lessees of recreational and other facilities at  water resource development projects should have more predictability and  stability with regard to their respective lease agreements with the  Corps. The Managers are, in conjunction with enactment of WRDA 2020,  requesting the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to analyze  Corps of Engineers policies related to the length of commercial  concessionaire contracts. In the interim, the Managers believe that the  Corps should consider the use of concessionaire lease agreements for a  period of not less than 25 years and not more than 50 years, unless  otherwise agreed to by the lessee. This effective tool will provide  greater predictability and stability in the use of Corps lands by the  lessee.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2020.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair DeFazio: In recognition of the goal of       expediting consideration of S. 1811, ``A bill to make       technical corrections to the America's Water Infrastructure       Act of 2018, and for other purposes'' the Committee on       Natural Resources agrees to waive formal consideration of the       bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources.        The Committee on Natural Resources takes this action with       the mutual understanding that, in doing so, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. Our Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation.

Grijalva,      Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                    U.S. House of Representatives                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2020.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chair, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Grijalva: Thank you for your letter regarding S.       1811, A bill to make technical corrections to the America's       Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, and for other purposes. I       appreciate your decision to waive formal consideration of the       bill.        I agree that the Committee on Natural Resources has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Natural Resources       is not waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject       matter. Additionally, I will support the appointment of       conferees from the Committee on Natural Resources should a       House-Senate conference be convened on this legislation.       Finally, this exchange of letters will be included in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the       floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Committee on Natural Resources on       this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chair of the Energy and Water Development, and  Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as has been said and doesn't need to be repeated, this  is a fully bipartisan bill, and it does make essential investments in  water infrastructure that will impact virtually every State and  territory of the United States of America.   As a great maritime nation, we can't afford not to make these  investments; and hopefully it will be added, without change, to the  omnibus year-end deal, or the Senate could perhaps take it up under  unanimous consent since I don't think anyone would object to it over  there. One way or another, hopefully, it will get done.   Madam Speaker, I would like to be more specific in thanking staff for  this legislation. There was quite a lengthy negotiation.   The Senate never individually passed the bill. We had to negotiate  the whole bill with the Senate, and Ryan Seiger led the team--he did a  great job--Camille Touton, Navis Bermudez, and Alexa Williams; and on  the Republican side, Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, and Victor Sarmiento.   Then the unseen heroes behind all the good work here in the House are  those who work in the Office of Legislative Counsel, and too often we  overlook how critical they are to writing good legislation.   Sometimes I am amazed at the things that are introduced and that are  gibberish, to put it mildly. Kakuti Lin and all her colleagues, thank  you very much for your tremendous work on this, and it will be a great  benefit to the Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1014) to establish the Route 66 Centennial Commission, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1014         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H6985]]            SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on S. 1014.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1014. The bill establishes the  Route 66 Centennial Commission, with the charge of developing and  planning a celebration for 2026 for the 100th anniversary of America's  ``Mother Road.''   Route 66 was established November 11, 1926. It was a 2,448-mile-long  highway that originally ran from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles,  California, and passed between numerous States in between.   This historic route has been traversed by Americans through the years  for many reasons, from hundreds of thousands of migrants escaping the  Dust Bowl in the 1930s to more recent road-trippers following in the  footsteps of Jack Kerouac.   A precursor to the interstate system, Route 66, was created out of  the need for greater connectivity after the rise in automobile  ownership. Disparate segments of roads and paths were woven into a  cohesive highway that offered unparalleled ease of mobility.   While Route 66 became largely obsolete after the completion of the  interstate system, it holds a unique place in our Nation's surface  transportation history. The story of Route 66 serves as an important  reminder of why an interconnected transportation system is vital and  why we must not devolve to a piecemeal approach to surface  transportation, as some have advocated--the first surface  transportation advisor to President Trump most notably among them-- saying we should go back to the good old days when this was done by all  the States individually, even if the roads didn't sometimes connect or  meet national needs.   For years, I carried around a poster of the interstate. It was a  turnpike at the time between Kansas and Oklahoma. Kansas built their  section.   It is an aerial photograph from Life magazine, and if you look down,  you would say: Boy, that is really odd looking. There is this big  ribbon of concrete, four lanes, two on each side, and then there are  all these kinds of angular black lines.   Then you go: What is that?   Well, that is the Oklahoma State line, and that is Amos Schweitzer's  farm field.   Until we had the Eisenhower plan and until we had a national highway  program, until we had a user fee, the State of Oklahoma said: We can't  afford to do our section, even though we said we would do it.   It was completed a number of years later with a Federal share from  the Eisenhower plan.   This kind of connectivity is critical. I have had some  environmentalists say: Why do you want to rebuild the highway system  with climate change?   Well, we are going to rebuild it in a resilient way. We are going to  build it with new materials and more climate friendly, and we are going  to electrify it.   We cannot possibly move the amount of freight necessary in this  country to feed the American people and serve myriad other needs with  our rail system. It just could not meet that task.   We have to rebuild the 47,000 bridges that are in need of replacement  or significant structural repair. We have to repair the sections of 40  percent of the national highway systems that are deteriorated to the  point where you have to rebuild it, not just resurface it. And we have  to invest in the $100 billion backlog in our transit systems.   Hopefully, under President Biden, we will have no more fake  Infrastructure Weeks, and we will move forward with an actual, real  Infrastructure Week with investment and spending.   Madam Speaker, this bill is a reminder of the past and the need for  interconnection to serve the American people, which we are going to  need again in the future.   I support S. 1014 and urge my colleagues to join me in passing this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, although I do want to visit the Pink  Elephant Antique Mall, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4902) to designate the United States courthouse located at 351  South West Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, as the ``Orrin G. Hatch  United States Courthouse''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4902         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ORRIN G. HATCH UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.         (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at       351 South West Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, shall be known       and designated as the ``Orrin G. Hatch United States       Courthouse''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall       be deemed to be a reference to the ``Orrin G. Hatch United       States Courthouse''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 4902.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4902, a bill introduced by  Senator Lee to designate the United States Courthouse located at 351  South West Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, as the Orrin G. Hatch United  States Courthouse.   Orrin Hatch was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He  received his law degree from the University of Pittsburgh and worked as  an attorney in Pittsburgh until he moved to Utah in 1969, where he  continued to practice law.   In 1976, he was elected to the United States Senate for his first run  for public office. Senator Hatch is the longest-serving Republican U.S.  Senator in history and the longest-serving U.S. Senator from Utah.   Senator Hatch is one of the only Senators to have served as chairman  of three Senate committees: Health, Education, Labor and Pensions from  1981 to 1987; the Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001 and from 2003  to 2005; and the Finance Committee from 2015 to 2019. In total, Senator  Hatch spent 32 of his 42 years in the Senate as either chairman or  ranking member of a major committee.   In 2015, Senator Hatch was sworn in as President pro tempore of the  Senate, a position he held until his retirement in 2019.   Senator Hatch credits his family as the key to his success. He and  his wife, Elaine, have been married for over 60 years. They are the  proud parents of 6 children and 23 grandchildren.   I support this legislation honoring the accomplishments and service  of Senator Hatch and I would ask my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. McAdams).    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
