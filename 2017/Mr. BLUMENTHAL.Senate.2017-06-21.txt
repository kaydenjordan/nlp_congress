 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered    Mr. President, earlier this week, on Monday morning  at 9 a.m., I held a last-minute emergency field hearing on healthcare.  With our colleagues on the other side of the aisle refusing to hold any  official hearing on the bill and refusing to even show us the bill-- what almost certainly is almost bad policy that is contained in the  bill--I wanted the people of Connecticut to know that their voices and  their faces would be heard and seen here in Washington, DC, and their  stories would be told with or without an official committee hearing.   When I say this emergency field hearing was last minute, it was truly  last minute, with many people having not even days but hours of advance  notice to come and speak and share with me and others what the  Affordable Care Act has meant to them, to their families, to their  communities, and what losing it would mean to them.   To say the room was full would be a gross understatement. Every seat  was filled, and when those seats were gone, people lined the wall two  or three deep and squeezed in through the door. They were so anxious to  be heard, and they were loud and clear. They were heard by me, and now  I want their voices to be heard here.   We are continuing this hearing. In fact, we are having a second  hearing on Friday afternoon at 1:30 in New Haven. We are sending out  notices, blasting them to the people of Connecticut. We will have a  third, if appropriate and necessary.   The people who came to this emergency field hearing in Connecticut  were no different from millions of other people around the country, and  they were speaking, in a sense, for all Americans. In my mind, they  were speaking for parents who are suffering, providers who are healing,  kids fighting back against dreaded diseases. They came because the  closed-door discussions held in secret here by a small number of  colleagues across the aisle will impact them every single day for the  rest of their lives. My constituents and the people of Connecticut and  the people of the country are unrepresented in those discussions. That  is a travesty and a betrayal of our trust and our job.   So, on Friday, we are going to do the same thing. We are holding  another emergency hearing in New Haven so people of my State can be  heard, despite this disgraceful process that has left them and so many  others on the outside looking in. They are excluded from democracy, and  that is unconscionable.   If nothing else, I hope my colleagues will realize one thing. This is  what democracy looks like. This is how we are meant to make decisions  with many opinions--much debate, diversity of viewpoint, sometimes  messy but always transparent, open, and clear to people whose lives are  affected by it. That is what this emergency field hearing was designed  to do.   Since it is becoming increasingly clear that this bedrock principle  of our democracy--the right to open and honest debate--is being denied,  I want to share some of the stories I heard on Monday, just some of  them, and I will be sharing more of these stories over the coming days.   Justice Brianna Croutch was described by her mother as a beautiful  free spirit, as you can see from this side of the photo. She was filled  with compassion and at 21 years old had a beautiful and meaningful life  ahead of her, all of her life ahead of her. She was a full-time student  in a dental program, and she had a 4.0 average.   Justice, like far too many people, particularly young people in  Connecticut and around the country, had a substance use disorder, and  she needed effective, long-term treatment to begin that road to  recovery. For Justice, this treatment came too late, and on August 23,  2015, she overdosed on heroin. It led to a brain injury. It is likely  she will never recover from that injury.   ``More likely than not,'' her mother said, ``I will have to make the  decision to bring my daughter home with hospice care. No parent should  be faced with these decisions.'' That is what Jennifer Kelly said at  the hearing on Monday.   That is a picture of Justice as she is today.   I want to read exactly what Jennifer Kelly said because her words are  far more powerful and meaningful than mine could ever be.         The American Health Care Act--    The House version of the so-called replacement for the Affordable  Care Act--       would reduce Medicaid funding by $800 million, which provides       coverage to an estimated 3 in 10 adults dealing with an       opioid addiction. This will be so devastating to those       seeking treatment for an opioid addition. In a system where       families are already seeking help, this will be a tremendous       step backwards.        So here I am, almost two years later, pleading for life,       fighting once again for families I have never met, because I       believe that no one should have to fight to get help for       addiction in this country like my daughter did. So my       question is, Mr. President and the members of the Senate,       what number of lives lost will be enough? What is the magic       number of sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, aunts and       uncles that we as a nation will have to lose before you       realize this country needs help?    I ask that same question of my colleagues today. I ask the question  that Jennifer, a brokenhearted mother, asked. What number of lives will  be enough? How many is enough? When will others in this body realize  that gutting our healthcare system and stripping millions of care will  simply make this opioid epidemic worse?   Jennifer was unfortunately not the only person who came to speak  about the opioid epidemic. For me, the most moving and powerful among  those moments came from Maria Skinner, who runs the McCall Center for  Behavioral Health in Connecticut, who was there to give her thoughts  and share the stories of two young people. I was actually lucky enough  to meet both of them. Once again, I am going to share her words  directly:         What I want to do is talk to you about two people and make       that a real, personal, granular, human story. . . . And you       know these two people very well; it's Frank and Sean.    She was speaking to me.         [You] have met Frank and Sean, who were able to access care       and get clean and sober because of the Medicaid expansion,       because they were able to have coverage.        And they've come here, to these rooms, to speak       courageously and publicly about their struggle and about       their recovery, and about how grateful they are to be able to       be clean and sober because of the access of care afforded       them through their insurance coverage.        We went to Sean's funeral on Saturday, and . . . Frank       would be here today if he wasn't as brokenhearted as I am.       Sean was 26 and had been doing really well, was on       Naltrexone, was taking a Vivitrol shot, and he had to have       surgery for a hernia, because  [[Page S3671]]       he raced motorbikes professionally and the hernia hurt him.       He wanted to go back and was doing so well, he was speaking       publicly to youth and was anxious to go back into doing what       he loved. So he had that surgery and had to come off of his       medication to do that. He was very vulnerable after his       surgery, and he slipped once, and he used.        I've been to too many funerals and seen too many mothers       and fathers brokenhearted at the coffins of their sons and       daughters. We can't make this any harder than it already is.       To me, it is unconscionable.    Maria is right, and so is Jennifer. Gutting Medicaid would be  unconscionable. Weakening the protections afforded to those with mental  health or substance use disorder would be truly unconscionable.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act and the provisions within it that  have meant more coverage, more healthcare, and more healing for those  suffering from substance use disorder and struggling to break the grip  of this opioid epidemic would be unconscionable and costly beyond  words.   Alternative funds, as some reports say Republicans have considered,  will never replace a permanent insurance program like Medicaid because  Medicaid guarantees that coverage is there when families need it. No  alternative can do that.    In Connecticut, nearly half of all medication-assisted treatment for  people with substance use disorders is paid by Medicaid. My fear is  that the Republican bill in place will mean that these people would  have no place to go. They would have no support for medications,  counseling, and help, no chance to get better, no place to go. I refuse  to let us find out the answer to what would happen to them if Medicaid  were gutted. I refuse to allow it to happen, if I have anything to do  with it.   People with substance use disorder are not the only ones who will see  their coverage threatened by a weakening of protections for those with  preexisting conditions. In Connecticut on Monday, Shawn Lang of AIDS- Connecticut expanded on what this bill would mean for the people living  with HIV in this country.         Some of us lived through the early days of the plague when       we went to funeral after funeral, memorial service after       memorial service, week after week, month after month,       watching our friends wither away and die. The healthcare bill       that is currently secretly weaving its way through Congress       would bring us back to the early days of the plague.        HIV is a preexisting condition. Over half of the people       living with HIV in the country and in this state are over the       age of 50 and rely on Medicaid as their primary source of       insurance. Most of those people also have other co-      morbidities like substance abuse disorders and mental health       disorders. What little we know about this bill would be       devastating to people with HIV and AIDS, and it essentially       would amount to a death sentence. Once again, having lived       through those early days, we don't want to go back there.    Shawn's story is one of many I heard about the fear of losing  coverage due to a preexisting condition.   Gay Hyre, a 60-year-old breast cancer survivor, has similar concerns  about what gutting the Affordable Care Act would mean not just for her  but for everyone around her. She said this about why she came to speak  at the hearing:         I'm not just worried for me about my own care, although I       will be on the receiving end of a lot of bad parts of this. I       care passionately about the other 23 million Americans who       are my fellow citizens of every age, type, and need. It's       about the future, it's about our kids, it's about our       grandkids who won't have access to treatments, who won't have       access to doctors.    I know my colleagues across the aisle don't want to hear these  stories. If they wanted to hear these stories from people in  Connecticut and around the country, millions of stories, we would have  hearings--not just emergency field hearings; we would have hearings  here in Washington before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions and before the Committee on Finance and other committees  that have jurisdiction on the House side as well as in the Senate. We  would be having a real debate, a robust discussion, and everyone of us  here would have a chance to review this bill, if there is a bill, and  comment on it and hear from the people we represent. But unfortunately  my colleagues across the aisle don't want to hear about the details of  repealing the Affordable Care Act.   One witness at my hearing, Ellen Andrews of the Connecticut Health  Policy Project, really summed up the reason. Here is what she said:         We have been working on expanding health coverage, high-      quality, affordable coverage to everyone in the state and now       everyone in the nation. I looked back, actually, at 2010, how       many people were uninsured in this state before the       Affordable Care Act, it was 397,000 people, almost 400,000.       Last year it was down by 262,000. That is 262,000 fewer       people living in our state without insurance because of the       Affordable Care Act.    I want to share one final story. It is about a little boy in  Connecticut who has a lot to lose if the Affordable Care Act is  secretly gutted behind closed doors, as is now happening in real time  right before our eyes, in secret, invisibly, in this body. I want to  tell you about Connor Curran.   Two years ago, when Connor was 5 years old, his parents noticed that  he was lagging behind his twin brother. They brought him to a doctor.  Rather than receiving a simple diagnosis, they learned that Connor has  Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degenerative terminal disease that has  no cure. Most people with the disease don't survive past their  midtwenties. Connor's family wrote that their sweet boy, who was just 5  and full of life, would slowly lose his ability to run, to walk, to  lift his arms. Eventually, they said, he would lose the ability to hug  them at all.   Connor needs complex care from multiple specialists, costing an  estimated $54,000 a year. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, he cannot  be denied coverage and has the coverage he needs to receive care. His  family also wrote that any elimination of lifetime caps or elimination  of essential health benefits will hinder his family's ability to access  the care that Conner needs.    This is Conner in a picture that has been provided by his family.   The ACA removed barriers to Conner's care, and they are concerned-- and so am I--that this reckless, reprehensible bill will put them back  to the place that they were when they first learned about Conner's  diagnosis.   Should Conner's disease progress, he will very likely need access to  Medicaid in order to offset the costs of living with a disability, but  for his family, the question now is, Will Medicaid even be there? If  that devastating day comes, will he continue to receive the care he  needs?   Conner's family is not about to give up. They have come to my office  annually since he was diagnosed in order to fight for a cure and to  fight for the Affordable Care Act--sometimes with tears in their eyes.  They raise awareness, and they fight for their little boy. I know they  would do it a million times over again if it meant that Conner could  get better and live a long and healthy life.   Conner and others like him are why I am here. Conner and others like  him are why I will continue this fight against any attempts to repeal  the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a shameful, disgraceful  bill that has been written behind closed doors--destroying lives and  degrading the quality of life for millions of Americans.   The people whom I have met in Connecticut who came to this hearing-- and countless others who have talked to me about the Affordable Care  Act--are fighting for their lives and their health and for others who  need it as well.   Those people whom I met in Connecticut and the others who will come  to our hearing on Friday and, perhaps, afterward are the reason I am  fighting for better coverage for all of the people of Connecticut and  our country.   Those people are the best of our country with their fighting spirit  and dedication to the people they love, and they deserve to be heard.  They are the voices and faces of the Affordable Care Act who have been  turned away at the door of this Capitol. I refuse to allow them to be  silenced.   As I have mentioned, we will be back at it again on Friday because  hearing from our constituents is part of our job. It is the bedrock of  democracy. It is the fundamental core of what we do--listening to the  people whom we represent. Failing to do so is unconscionable just as  destroying the Affordable Care Act would be unconscionable, just as  denying Conner what he needs would be unconscionable, just as ignoring  Justice and Sean and Frank would be unconscionable. I hope my  colleagues will listen.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed by the  secrecy that has been employed by my colleagues in their reckless  attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act. It is clear to me that, in the  absence of hearings,  [[Page S3681]]  of public debate, and of any bill text at all, my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle will go to any length to suppress the  undeniable successes associated with the Affordable Care Act.   Unfortunately, that now includes blocking a noncontroversial  resolution to promote and bring awareness to National Minority Health  Month simply because the text contains facts about the Affordable Care  Act. They have decided that concealing the reality of what the  Affordable Care Act has brought to minority communities is more  important than promoting minority health.   I am proud to help lead this resolution with Senator Cardin and my  colleagues here this afternoon because raising awareness and finding  ways to promote minority health is critically important to the future  of our Nation and should be a shared priority amongst my colleagues. As  of last year, over half of nonelderly Americans who lacked insurance  were people of color and minorities face increased barriers when trying  to access the care that is available to them.   In the past, our Republican colleagues worked with us on this  resolution, which is why it has seen bipartisan and unanimous support.  Now, however, like the secret healthcare bill they are drafting behind  closed doors, they have turned an important and commonsense resolution  into a political football, refusing to pass it unless it is stripped of  any and all facts that don't fit their false narrative on the  Affordable Care Act. The fact of the matter is that the Affordable Care  Act has worked for minority communities. The Affordable Care Act has  reduced the uninsured rate for minority communities by at least 35  percent.   It has led to a 7 percent drop in the uninsured rate amongst African  Americans and has cut the uninsured rate for Latinos, Asian Americans,  Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders in half. It has provided new  protections for American Indians and Native Alaskans while cutting the  uninsured rate amongst those communities by nearly 10 percent. The  facts show that minorities have seen some of the largest gains in  health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act and, despite  the work we still have before us, have more access to affordable  coverage than ever before.   Still, many in minority communities struggle to obtain coverage and  receive quality care, despite chronic diseases disproportionately  impacting many minority groups. That is why the Prevention and Public  Health Fund, which was created to address and prevent chronic disease  under the ACA, is so critical to minority health. That is also why  these same communities will yet again feel the brunt of these callous  and misguided cuts should the prevention fund be eliminated along with  the ACA.   African Americans are twice as likely to die from diabetes as White  Americans. Thankfully, the prevention fund has invested $291 million in  diabetes prevention. Latino women are 44 percent more likely to be  diagnosed with cervical cancer than White women. Therefore, the  prevention fund has invested $218 million in breast and cervical cancer  prevention. Overall, the prevention fund has invested $227 million to  the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Program.   But eliminating the prevention fund wouldn't just negatively impact  minority communities. In Connecticut, the Fund has invested over $27  million in our communities since 2010, improving the lives and well- being of people there every day.   This strong investment has provided more Connecticut women with  screenings for cancer. It has given our State health department the  ability to better prevent diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and fight  obesity through improved physical activity. It has allowed Connecticut  to address school health more successfully, enriching our children's  lives and inspiring a new generation of more healthy and happy  citizens. It has provided the Connecticut Immunization Program with  nearly half of its funding, with the program stating they ``don't know  how we could continue to exist without this funding.''   Should the Affordable Care Act be repealed and the Prevention Fund  eliminated, with TrumpCare cruelly and inadequately thrust upon our  Nation in its place, the consequences would be devastating, not only  for minority communities, but for the country as a whole. Bottom line:  the Affordable Care Act has improved access to quality and affordable  healthcare for all Americans and particularly for those that need it  the most.   I sincerely hope that my Republican colleagues stop denying,  ignoring, and concealing that the Affordable Care Act--and the minority  communities that benefited from it--has helped our Nation's health. I  stand ready to build upon the great strides made in improving minority  health since the Affordable Care Act, and I hope my colleagues are  ready to do the same. Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am proud and honored to follow my  colleague from Oregon who has been such a steadfast leader when it  comes to our Nation's healthcare and insurance and particularly when it  comes to women's healthcare. I have been really proud to stand side by  side with him, Senator Murray, and other colleagues who have been here  today.   I must say, sometimes on the floor of the Senate, at this hour of the  day or night, we can feel alone, as though no one is listening, but I  know millions of Americans are listening because of the voices like my  colleague Senator Wyden. I would join him in urging our fellow  Americans to make their voices heard, to be loud, and we are going to  be loud in Connecticut this Friday, at 1:30 in the afternoon, when I  continue the emergency field hearing we began on Monday, giving the  people of Connecticut an opportunity to make their voices and their  faces known, seen, and heard because, unfortunately, that opportunity  has been denied by a process that has been secretive and hasty. Secrecy  and speed are a toxic recipe for any democracy. They can disguise  deception and mistakes.   I am here to call attention to one of the profoundly mistaken courses  that this new bill is expected to take. There is no doubt in my mind  that the Republican bill will contain language to defund one of the  most respected and accessible and significant of our healthcare  providers in the United States; namely, Planned Parenthood.   I have been an advocate of women's healthcare and reproductive rights  and choice since my days as a law clerk for Justice Blackmun in the  1970s. Our Nation has made progress--halting and sometimes it steps  back--but Planned Parenthood has helped to improve, enduringly and  profoundly, women's healthcare.   In my home State of Connecticut, Planned Parenthood has 17 sites and  services for more than 60,000 women and men, and they have been covered  by the Medicaid Program. That coverage will be decimated under the  measure we expect to see. Defunding these clinics could do irreparable  damage to the communities that Planned Parenthood clinics serve.   As a nurse practitioner at Planned Parenthood in Southern Connecticut  told me, patients trust the services they receive at Planned Parenthood  because they rely on them, and they know Planned Parenthood clinics  have  [[Page S3694]]  one interest and only one interest in mind, which is the well-being of  their patients and clients. Planned Parenthood has, therefore, expanded  into primary care. Not only does Amina provide family planning services  and STI and cancer screenings, she now screens for and treats patients  for chronic medical conditions that disproportionately impact low- income patients, such as depression, diabetes, asthma, and  hypertension.   In her clinic, my friend who is a nurse practitioner there, Amina,  has seen her primary care practice grow from 8 patients initially to  112 a few months later. Her clinic offers these services, in addition  to the contraceptive services that are so important to many patients.  Patients who will simply go unseen and uncared for have this care at  Planned Parenthood, but they will not have it if Planned Parenthood is  defunded.   In Connecticut, other kinds of healthcare providers, like health  centers and hospitals, would need to increase their capacity to provide  contraceptive care, and they would have to increase it by 228 percent  to overcome the care deficit left by defunding Planned Parenthood. With  these craven attempts to immediately and completely defund Planned  Parenthood as a part of TrumpCare--really TrumpCare 2.0--it will be  even more challenging for so many women to get the healthcare they need  and deserve.   Defunding of Planned Parenthood also jeopardizes gains our Nation  made for women of color and patients who are served in areas where  there are few, if any, other options.   Planned Parenthood centers and clinics are nothing short of a  lifeline for quality healthcare in the underserved communities. The  fact is, the Affordable Care Act has worked for women and particularly  women of color. Planned Parenthood and other women's healthcare  providers are an integral part of that success story, but it isn't only  women of color, it isn't only women in underserved communities, and it  isn't only women. It is families who have benefited--men, women, and  children--because the quality of healthcare and preventive healthcare,  particularly, has been raised immeasurably.   To decimate that network of care would be profoundly destructive to  our Nation. I hope my colleagues will think again before they side with  the forces of degrading and demeaning women who seek those protections.  We need a national effort and appreciation to make sure our conscience  prevails because the repeal of these provisions would mean they are  gone, and all women--including healthy women--will see insurance costs  rise. It is absolutely clear to me that the Affordable Care Act repeal  would be cruel. It would be mean and most particularly to the women who  depend on Planned Parenthood for so many of the services that help them  and their families.   I hope my Republican colleagues will cease to ignore and deny these  benefits. We stand ready to work with them to improve the Affordable  Care Act, not to repeal it, not to decimate or destroy it, to improve  it, to mend its defects, to preserve Planned Parenthood, to make sure  the women of America and their families have the healthcare they need  and deserve.   Thank you. I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.
