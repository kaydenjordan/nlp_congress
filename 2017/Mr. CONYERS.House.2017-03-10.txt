 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 720, the so-called Lawsuit Abuse  Reduction Act.   This bill amends rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in  ways that will chill the advancement of civil rights claims and  increase exponentially the volume and costs of litigation in the  Federal courts.   These concerns are not hypothetical. H.R. 720 restores the deeply  flawed version of rule 11 in effect from 1983 to 1993 in two ways: by  requiring mandatory sanctions for even unintentional violations rather  than leaving the imposition of sanctions to the court's discretion, as  is currently the case; and secondly, by eliminating the current rule's  21-day safe harbor provision, which allows the defending party to  correct or withdraw allegedly offending submissions.   Simply put, H.R. 720 will have a disastrous impact on the  administration of justice in numerous ways. To begin with, the bill  will chill legitimate civil rights litigation, which, to me, of course,  is very important.   Civil rights cases often raise novel legal arguments, which made such  cases particularly susceptible to sanction motions under the 1983 rule.  For example, a Federal Judicial Center study found that the incidence  of rule 11 motions under the 1983 rule was ``higher in civil rights  cases than in some other types of cases.''   Another study showed that, while civil rights cases comprised about  11 percent of the cases filed, more than 22 percent of the cases in  which sanctions had been imposed were, in fact, civil rights cases.   Under the 1983 rule, civil rights cases were clearly disadvantaged.  Yet, H.R. 720 would reserve this problematic regime.   Although the bill's rule of construction is a welcome acknowledgment  of the problem, it does nothing to prevent defendants from using rule  11 as a weapon to discourage civil rights plaintiffs. Even a landmark  case like Brown v. Board of Education might not have been pursued had  H.R. 720's changes to rule 11 been in effect at that time, because the  legal arguments in the case were novel and not based on then-existing  law.   In addition, H.R. 720 will substantially increase the amount, cost,  and intensity of civil litigation and create more grounds for  unnecessary delay and harassment in the courtroom itself.   By making sanctions mandatory and having no safe harbor, the 1983  rule spawned a cottage industry of rule 11 litigation. Each party had a  financial incentive to tie up the other in rule 11 proceedings.   We heard testimony on a previous version of this bill that almost  one-third of all Federal lawsuits during the decade that the 1983 rule  was in effect were burdened by such satellite litigation, where the  parties tried the underlying case and then put each side's counsel on  trial.   Finally, H.R. 720 strips the judiciary of its discretion and  independence. H.R. 720 overrides judicial independence by removing the  discretion that rule 11 currently gives judges in determining whether  to impose sanctions and what type of sanctions would be most  appropriate. It also circumvents the painstakingly thorough Rules  Enabling Act process that Congress established more than 80 years ago.   For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing  this highly problematic legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler),  [[Page H2027]]  the senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  These constitute my closing observations on this measure.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 720 would turn back the clock to a time when rule  11 discouraged civil rights cases, restricted judicial discretion, and  engendered vast amounts of time-consuming and costly so-called  satellite litigation.   Not surprisingly, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the  principal policymaking body for the judicial branch charged with  proposing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under the  careful, deliberate process specified in the Rules Enabling Act,  opposes this measure, noting that it creates a cure worse than the  problem it is meant to solve.   Likewise, the American Bar Association opposes this legislation, as  do numerous consumer and environmental groups, including: Public  Citizen, the Alliance for Justice, the Center for Justice and  Democracy, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union,  Earthjustice, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and six  other major organizations.    Finally, last Congress, the Obama administration, strongly opposed a  substantively identical measure, noting that the bill was ``both  unnecessary and counterproductive,'' and that it ``actually increases  litigation.''   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues in this body to reject this flawed  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2030]]         Mr. Chairman, I ask that my amendment be brought forward  at this time.    Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned that H.R. 720 may have  a serious, deleterious impact on the ability of individuals to protect  their civil and constitutional rights in Federal court. This is a point  that has been emphasized on this side ever since we have started  examining, more carefully, H.R. 720. Accordingly, my amendment would  simply exempt these types of cases from the bill.   Based on a decade of experience with the 1983 version of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure, we know that the civil rights cases were, in  fact, disproportionately impacted because they often raised novel  arguments.   For example, a 1991 Federal Judicial Center study found that the  incidence of rule 11 motions was ``higher in civil rights cases than in  some other types of cases.'' Another study shows that, while civil  rights cases comprised only 11 percent of the Federal cases filed, more  than 22 percent of the cases in which sanctions had been imposed were,  in fact, civil rights cases.   The bill contains a rule of construction intended to clarify that  ``it not be construed to bar the assertion of new claims or defenses or  remedies, including those arising under civil rights laws or the  Constitution.''   The inclusion of this language is an acknowledgment of the  disproportionate impact that the 1983 rule had on civil rights cases,  and we should applaud--and I am sure we do--its intent.   Nevertheless, I fear this rule of construction, by itself, will not  prevent defendants from using rule 11 as a weapon to dissuade civil  rights plaintiffs from pursuing their claims.                                time  1015    My amendment makes an explicit exception for civil rights and  constitutional actions. As a result, litigants will be clearly aware of  its existence and will not be able to force opposing parties into  satellite litigation when the case is brought under a civil rights law.   This amendment is necessary to avoid even the possibility of a  chilling effect that the revisions made by the bill to rule 11 could  have on those advocating for civil rights and constitutional law  protections. As the late Robert Carter, a former United States judge  for the Southern District of New York, who earlier in his career  represented one of the plaintiffs in the Brown v. Board of Education  case, said of the 1983 version of rule 11:   ``I have no doubt that the Supreme Court's opportunity to pronounce  separate schools inherently unequal in Brown v. Board of Education  would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and I been  required, upon pain of potential sanctions, to plead our legal theory  explicitly from the start.''   For that reason alone, I urge the adoption of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
