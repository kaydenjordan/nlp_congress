 Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to  Mississippi Highway Patrol Trooper John Martin Harris, who was killed  in the line of duty on May 28, 2021. Harris was conducting a routine  traffic stop on Highway 16 in Madison County when a vehicle struck and  killed him. I honor Trooper Harris' service, extend my deepest  condolences to his family, and reiterate my unwavering support for our  law enforcement personnel.   A Clarksdale native, Harris knew from a young age he wanted to serve  his community as a law enforcement officer. Trooper Harris began his  law enforcement career in 1997 in Webb, MS. He earned his first Law  Enforcement Purple Heart while serving on the police force in Friars  Point and earned a second Purple Heart while serving at the Madison  County Sheriff's Office. Harris then continued his career at the  Richland Police Department. In 2018, Harris achieved his lifelong dream  of becoming a Mississippi Highway Patrolman and graduated from Trooper  School as part of Cadet Class No. 62. In addition to the Purple Heart  medals, Harris received dozens of awards, too numerous to mention here,  for valor and bravery. Several were commendations for his work on  narcotics teams and with K-9 units.   Trooper Harris is survived by his wife Katie Parker Harris of  Madison, his two children Parker and Cooper, and his parents Jean and  Jimmy Harris of Clarksdale. I send my deepest sympathies to his family  and to all who knew him. May God grant them comfort, grace, and peace  in these unspeakably difficult times.   Law enforcement officers across our Nation face many challenges in  their mission to protect and serve. Trooper Harris's death shows us  that our law enforcement officers face tremendous danger to ensure  public safety, and I greatly admire those who remain steadfast amiss  the dangers of their noble profession. Let us commemorate Trooper  Harris's life by redoubling our commitment to support and advocate for  those in law enforcement. I will continue to honor the legacy of  Trooper Harris and all of those officers who have lost their life in  the line of duty by doing all I can to support our law enforcement  officers.                            ____________________
