 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4920, the VA  Contracting Preference Consistency Act.   I thank Chairman Takano for introducing the legislation, which would  preserve employment opportunities for the blind and severely disabled  who rely on VA contracts.   This bill addresses a technical conflict between the AbilityOne  Program and the VA Veterans First program. I am sorry to say that this  conflict exists because of Congress' oversight in the drafting of the  Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006.  Whereas earlier legislation was clear about the legislation between the  AbilityOne and the service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses  contracting programs, the 2006 act was silent. The result has been a  series of lawsuits beginning in 2017.   I wish this conflict did not exist, but the fact is, it does, and it  still does. It has put the jobs of over 2,000 individuals who are blind  or severely disabled potentially at risk. These are vulnerable  populations with an unemployment rate that hovers around 70 to 80  percent.   The bill's solution is simple and equitable. It preserves only the  AbilityOne work that was being performed in VA as of December 22, 2006,  when the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act  of 2006 was enacted, creating the Veterans First Program. No new work  will go into the AbilityOne Program. Rather, it will all be reserved  for service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses under the rule of  two.   This is very similar to the VA's policy, which balanced the two  programs for nearly 10 years. While that policy was effective in  practice, it was struck down because it lacked a clear statutory basis.   Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of wrong information  circulating about this legislation. Some had alleged that it would  abolish the Vets First program or wipe away the Supreme Court's  Kingdomware decision, and that is simply not true.   The Vets First program is a success story. The volume of VA  contracting with veteran-owned small businesses  [[Page H10271]]  now exceeds $5 billion annually. This legislation in no way, shape, or  form erodes that.   On the other hand, the VA spending in the AbilityOne Program  fluctuates between $100 million and $200 million in a typical year.  This legislation would preserve only a portion of that, the portion  that exists before Vets First was created.   At the end of the day, this issue is about preserving jobs for the  blind and disabled individuals, and these jobs are extremely scarce. I  want to see these jobs multiply and become higher paying with more  opportunities for advancement. The first step to do that is to make  sure jobs continue to exist.   There have already been a significant number of furloughs at  AbilityOne nonprofits. It is vital that we act before those furloughs  turn into full-time layoffs.   Last week, 497 veterans who are employed by the AbilityOne nonprofits  or supporters of the program sent a letter urging passage of this bill.  The committee has received many other letters from business owners  praising or opposing the bill, depending on which program they are  associated with. I do not for a minute want to fall into that false  choice between opportunities for veterans and opportunities for blind  and disabled individuals. They can coexist. They have coexisted in the  past, and I want to make sure that they coexist in the future.    Madam Speaker, to that end, I thank all the cosponsors of this  broadly bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, as has been testified today from both sides of the  aisle, both of these programs are vitally important. We believe this  legislation would move forward in making sure that both veterans and  the blind and disabled who are working in our VA system will be taken  care of.   I appreciate everyone who is a sponsor of this bill, and I encourage  all Members involved to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4183, the Identifying  Barriers and Best Practices Study Act.   H.R. 4183, as amended, would require the Government Accountability  Office to complete a study that compares the utilization of disability  and pension benefits between veterans of the National Guard, Reserve,  and Active-Duty components.   Some National Guard and Reserve veterans believe that it is more  challenging for them to successfully apply for VA benefits compared to  veterans of regular components. According to a Statement for the Record  provided by The American Legion during the Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs Subcommittee hearing on H.R. 4183: ``Guard and Reserve  veterans have historically been at a disadvantage when seeking VA  compensation and disability benefits due to poor reporting and  documentation of injuries which occur during a period of Reserve or  Active Duty for training.''   We must ensure that all of our veterans who have been injured as a  result of their service receive the benefits they have earned. This  legislation would shed additional insight into the barriers our  National Guard and Reserve veterans could face when seeking VA  benefits. This may, in turn, inform how VA could improve its claims  process for National Guard and Reserve veterans.   I encourage all Members to support H.R. 4183, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, as mentioned here, this is a problem we have been  dealing with concerning our Reserve and National Guard. We want to make  sure that they are provided with these benefits. I want to encourage  all of our Members to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3530, as amended, the  Improving Confidence in Veterans' Care Act.   This bill is sponsored by Congressman   Michael Cloud from Texas. I  thank him for his leadership in introducing this bill to improve the  safety and quality of the care that is provided to our Nation's  veterans throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs' healthcare  system.   This bill would make several changes to current VA processes and  procedures to improve the credentialing and privileging of the  healthcare providers who are treating our veterans. For example, it  would require VA to ensure that each VA medical center complies,  verifies, reviews, and continuously monitors certain documentation,  including licensure and certifications, related to the qualifications  and clinical abilities of the VA healthcare professionals.                                time  1515    It would also require VA to ensure that each VA medical center  reviews concerns relating to quality of care delivered by VA healthcare  professionals and, when a concern is verified, that entities like State  licensing boards, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the National  Practitioner Data Bank are notified in a timely manner so that  corrective actions can be taken to ensure patient safety and  accountability.   In general, VA provides an excellent level of care to the veterans  who are enrolled in the VA healthcare system. However, several recent  patient safety incidents across this country have called into question  the way the VA oversees provider credentialing, monitors the quality of  the care that veterans receive, and responds to patient safety  concerns. Many of the provisions in this bill are based on  recommendations made by the VA inspector general and the Government  Accountability Office for improving VA's standard operating procedures  in each of these areas.   The brave men and women who have served in the Armed Forces deserve  to know that the care they are receiving from the VA meets the highest  quality and patient safety standards. This bill will help give them  that assurance, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud), who has taken the lead on this.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As given witness here today, this is simply making sure that our  veterans receive the quality care that they expect and should expect  and that we should be giving them. There has been a failure in the  keeping of records and making sure by our VA that the doctors remain  qualified and that the specialists remain qualified in their  specialties.   What this bill does is it makes sure that our veterans continue to  receive quality care and that records are kept. That is why we are  joining in a bipartisan manner to move this bill forward.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to vote in support of this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.  [[Page H10275]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2726, the Banning Smoking on Amtrak Act of 2019, is  commonsense legislation. I thank the gentlewoman from the District of  Columbia (Ms. Norton) for her leadership on this bill.   Current Amtrak policy prohibits smoking on Amtrak trains, Thruway  buses, and in stations. This prohibition includes smoking tobacco  products and electronic smoking devices such as e-cigarettes.   H.R. 2726 seeks to codify Amtrak's internal policies prohibiting  smoking, including electronic cigarettes, on its trains.   The bill is modeled after Congresswoman Norton's prior bill enacted  into law in 2018 as part of the FAA Reauthorization Act that clarified  the smoking ban on airplanes includes electronic cigarettes.   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure passed this bill  by voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, obviously, from the conversations we have had  here today, this is commonsense legislation.   You know, we have banned smoking and also know the problems we faced  this last year with e-cigarettes, the reasons and concerns that are out  there.   This is commonsense legislation that I believe a majority of our  constituents are in agreement with. This just codifies into law the  past practices of Amtrak.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4719 restores the Federal cost-share for the  Fishing Safety Training Grant Program and the Fishing Safety Research  Grant Program to 75 percent.   In 2010, Congress imposed additional safety requirements on U.S.  commercial fishing vessels and created these grant programs to assist  the fishing industry and fishermen in meeting the additional costs of  these requirements.   The grant programs were first funded in 2018. In 2018, Congress also  transferred responsibility for the programs to the Department of Health  and Human Services.   H.R. 4719 sets the Federal share of the grants to 75 percent and  extends the authorization for the grants through fiscal year 2021. The  Senate Commerce Committee reported a provision similar to H.R. 4719 in  its Coast Guard Authorization Act.   The bill also repeals and updates sections of the law dealing with  the former United States Lighthouse Service. The service became part of  the United States Coast Guard in 1939.   I commend Congressman Golden and the dean of the House,   Don Young,  for introducing this bipartisan legislation. Of the 9 leading fishing  ports in the United States by volume, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr.  Young) represents 5 of them. Of the top 10 fishing ports by value, he  represents 6.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this, too, will likely be dealt with as  commonsense legislation, making sure that the grants are delivered and  that the proper amount of grants are delivered to make sure proper  safety occurs not only in the fishing industry, but we should move  forward to try to do that in all of our industries.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage the support of all of my colleagues, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3362, the Small Airport  Mothers' Rooms Act of 2019. This bill passed unanimously out of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in June, and I am  pleased it is finally being brought to the floor.   While a growing number of airports have designated mothers' rooms,  many  [[Page H10281]]  nursing mothers still end up in a restroom or on the airport floor.  When delays happen, passengers often have no control over how long they  will be at the airport. For nursing mothers, these delays can make a  difficult trip even more stressful. Making certain accommodations  within the airport terminal is essential.   The bill extends the requirements of the bipartisan FAA  Reauthorization Act of 2018 by requiring small hub airports to provide  clean facilities for mothers to nurse their children. The law requires  that the area be located outside of a restroom and include a place to  sit, a table, a sink or sanitizing equipment, and an electrical outlet.  Importantly, the room must also be fully accessible to passengers with  disabilities.   When fully enacted, this bill will ensure that 97 percent of airline  passengers will have access to clean, sanitary, and accessible mothers'  rooms.   The bill before us today also contains a provision recommended by the  Federal Aviation Administration that will give airports that grow into  small hubs sufficient time to comply with the law.   The bill has been endorsed by nearly 60 international, national,  regional, State, and Tribal organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from these  organizations.                                     Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.        Dear Congresswoman Miller: We, the undersigned       organizations, thank you for introducing the Small Airports       Mothers' Rooms Act of 2019. By leading Congress to protect       and support breastfeeding, you demonstrate a commitment to       our nation's families. Breastfeeding is a proven primary       prevention strategy, building a foundation for life-long       health and wellness. Breastfeeding parents who choose or need       to travel should not have to struggle to find lactation       spaces--no matter the size of the airport, risking their milk       supply and thereby their ultimate breastfeeding success.        Building on the success of the Friendly Airports for       Mothers (FAM) Act, already being implemented in airports       across the nation well ahead of the required 2021       implementation date, the Small Airport Mothers' Room Act of       2019 (H.R. 3362) would extend these provisions to small       airports. Small airports would have two additional years to       come into compliance, and would be able to use Airport       Improvement Program funds for the purpose of complying with       the new requirement.        Small hub airports would be required to provide a private,       non-bathroom space in each terminal for breastfeeding people       to express breast milk. The space must be accessible to       persons with disabilities, available in each terminal       building after the security checkpoint, and include a place       to sit, a table or other flat surface, and an electrical       outlet.        Human milk is the preferred and most appropriate ``First       Food,'' adapting over time to meet the changing needs of the       growing child. The United States Breastfeeding Committee       joins the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and       all major medical authorities in recommending that infants       get no food or drink other than human milk for their first       six months and continue to receive human milk for at least       the first 1-2 years of life.        The evidence for the value of breastfeeding to children's       and mother's health is scientific, solid, and continually       being reaffirmed by new research. Compared with formula-fed       children, those who are breastfed have a reduced risk of ear,       skin, stomach, and respiratory infections; diarrhea; sudden       infant death syndrome; and necrotizing enterocolitis. In the       longer term, breastfed children have a reduced risk of       obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, asthma, and childhood       leukemia. Women who breastfed their children have a reduced       long-term risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and       breast and ovarian cancers.        Breastfeeding also provides a range of benefits for       employers and society. A 2016 study of both maternal &       pediatric health outcomes and associated costs based on 2012       breastfeeding rates showed that, if 90% of infants were       breastfed according to medical recommendations, 3,340 deaths,       $3 billion in medical costs, and $14.2 billion in costs of       premature death would be prevented, annually!        For all of these reasons, The Surgeon General's Call to       Action to Support Breastfeeding; the Institute of Medicine       report, Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention; and the       National Prevention Strategy each call for promotion of       breastfeeding-friendly environments. Yet in spite of this       tremendous recognition--and laws in 50 states that       specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or       private location--lactating people continue to face barriers,       even harassment, when breastfeeding in public. And when away       from their babies, airports are just one of many public       places where they face challenges finding a clean, private       space to pump.        We know that 80% of mothers intend to breastfeed, and 82.5%       actually do breastfeed at birth. Yet only 25% of U.S. infants       are still exclusively breastfed at six months of age. Most       families today choose to breastfeed, but a range of obstacles       can make it difficult to fit breastfeeding into parents'       lives.        No matter what they're doing or where they are,       breastfeeding people need to express milk every few hours in       order to keep up their supply. Missing even one needed       pumping session can have several undesirable consequences,       including discomfort, leaking, inflammation and infection,       decreased supply, and ultimately, breastfeeding cessation. As       a result, returning to work often presents a significant       barrier to breastfeeding.        Current federal law requires employers to provide nursing       mothers who are nonexempt employees a private, non-bathroom       location to express breast milk. Airport lactation spaces are       therefore an important step to support employers that need to       accommodate lactating travelers as well as lactating       employees of the airport.        A growing number of airports have designated lactation       spaces, yet many lactating people still end up in restrooms       or on airport floors. Travelers rarely have control over how       long they are in transit, making accessible accommodations       within airports a critical priority. We are heartened to see       the implementation of the FAM Act in large and medium hub       airports and look forward to expanding similar requirements       to small airports. This expansion supports, promotes, and       protects breastfeeding in rural areas, further contributing       to national public health goals.        The Small Airports Mothers' Rooms Act would help keep our       nation's families healthy by ensuring that breastfeeding       travelers and airport employees (in airports of all sizes)       have access to appropriate facilities. This is an important       step toward ensuring all families have the opportunity to       reach their personal breastfeeding goals.        Again, we applaud your leadership in introducing the Small       Airports Mothers' Rooms Act and stand ready to help you       achieve its passage.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3362 is a good bill and will make it  easier for mothers traveling by air.   I want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, Mrs. Miller, for her  leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman DeFazio and  Chairman Larsen of the Aviation Subcommittee for their bipartisan  effort to bring this legislation to the floor.   I urge all Members to support H.R. 3362.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Representative Miller for  introducing  [[Page H10282]]  this important bill that ensures mothers are accommodated, whether they  are traveling to or from large, medium, or small hub airports.   As a father of two daughters and a grandfather of seven  granddaughters, I believe it is vitally important that, when traveling,  the stress level can be reduced tremendously if these rooms are  available.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
