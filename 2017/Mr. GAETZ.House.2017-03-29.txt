 Madam Speaker, I come from the State of Florida, where we  have many of our citizens who live in nursing homes. Despite the views  of some, those residents can live remarkable, productive, and  fulfilling lives.   One such resident is Angelina Steiner. Mrs. Steiner lives in the  Plant City Senior Center. She shares her talents in weekly poetry  readings. She became a member of the Florida Writers Association. In  2014, she published her first book: ``Chasing Dreams.'' Now, her second  book: ``Beautiful Words Coming My Way'' is being published and archived  in the Library of Congress.   A loving wife and a mother of four children, Mrs. Steiner is inspired  by everyday events. She has the talent to paint beautiful pictures  through her poetry, and I am incredibly proud of her.                            ____________________
