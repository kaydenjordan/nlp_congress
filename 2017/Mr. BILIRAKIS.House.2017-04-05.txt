 Mr. Speaker, while the Veterans Choice Program is by  no means perfect--the chairman said this, as well as the ranking  member--many of our men and women who wore our Nation's uniform rely on  it for increased access to quality health care.   I strongly support S. 544 because veterans should have certainty that  their care will continue, and I am optimistic that our efforts to  reform and build upon the Choice Program will yield positive results  going forward. The intentions and goals of the Choice Program are good,  giving our true American heroes more choices and more focused care;  but, clearly, some areas of the program need improvement. I hear that  from my veterans.   We have already taken some solid steps to make the program work  better for veterans, but not enough. We will have the opportunity to  fix this in a bipartisan fashion; for example, one positive step: The  eligibility rules initially stated that a veteran had to live 40 miles  as the crow flies from the nearest VA facility. We changed it to 40  miles driving distance. That is just common sense; isn't it? I think it  is. We have also made reforms to increase the number of non-VA  providers who are allowed to participate in the program and expand  eligibility to all enrolled veterans.   There is much work to be done, there is no question. The only way we  can continue improving the Veterans Choice Program and ensure that  veterans see no interruption to their health care is to eliminate the  sunset date.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 544.
