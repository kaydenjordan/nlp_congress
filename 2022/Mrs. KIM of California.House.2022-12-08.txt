 Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the Whelan family  to urge the Biden administration to get United States Marine veteran,  Paul Whelan, safely home from being held hostage and wrongfully  detained by Russia.   While we are glad to welcome Brittney Griner safely home to her  family, to make it happen, the Biden administration ceded leverage and  released a dangerous, convicted arms dealer who was in prison for  conspiring to kill Americans.   This poses tremendous national security risks and will embolden  Vladimir Putin to take more Americans hostage in the future.   Meanwhile, Paul Whelan and other wrongfully detained Americans remain  imprisoned. I will continue to fight for their safe return home.                            ____________________
