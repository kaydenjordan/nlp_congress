 Mr. Speaker, think about the most iconic images from 9/ 11: Just after the attacks, people running away from the towers as our  first responders were running toward the flames. It was a generational  event.   Today, as so many stay home, those who are running toward the crisis  are our healthcare workers, our first responders. They are on the front  lines--our supermarket workers, our truck drivers, our border agents  and TSA agents. Right now, we are sending them into the fight without  the gear that they need.   We owe them our passion. We owe them to work together, Democrats and  Republicans. Above all, we owe them a plan.   Meanwhile, Americans are doing their best. Michiganders are coming  together in ways that I could hardly imagine, from the Big Three autos  to our smallest manufacturers, trying to fill the gaps.   Today, here, we must do our part. We must pass the CARES Act. It is  imperfect. It is the third appropriation. I hope there will be a  fourth. But it is our duty to come together and pass it.
