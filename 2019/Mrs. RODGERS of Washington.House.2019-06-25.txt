 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share a  story of power, people power.   This story doesn't take place in the Halls of Congress, in the  department of such and such, or in D.C., which is too often called  ``the most powerful city in the world.'' This story takes place at Hope  House, a women's homeless shelter in Spokane, Washington.   Hope House, which is expanding because of a grant made possible  because of tax reform, helps women find a second chance.   Heather Thomas-Taylor is the director. As The Spokesman-Review  reported, she knows everyone staying at the house by name. She feeds  them from donations from restaurants and churches.   Once, a bride and groom, still in their dress and tux, donated 2  weeks' worth of food left over from their reception. Around the  holidays, Hope House fridges are so full they can't even ``fit a slice  of bologna'' in them.   Mr. Speaker, this is what an empowered community looks like, and it  has provided more than mandates and centralized bureaucratic power can  ever provide.  [[Page H5087]]    Why is that? Because people like the employees at Hope House, the  director leading its expansion, the bride and groom, and our church  congregations have the power to improve the world around them.   I have another story to share, but it isn't one of hope. It is one of  people losing their ability to serve their community.   Nearly 14,000 people live in Pend Oreille County in my district. Many  work in timber, mining, the hospital, or elsewhere. However, in the  entire county, we are down to one childcare center, just one, which is  run by the local Tribe, and they have a long waiting list.   Statewide regulations are making it too difficult for local providers  to comply with licensing requirements. As one provider said in  Washington, ``There's a rule for a rule for a rule.''   Even the public hospital in Pend Oreille County, with its resources  and lawyers, couldn't comply to open a daycare center.   Just imagine if these one-size-fits-all rules were coming from the  Federal Government for every single neighborhood in America. It is not  that far from reality.   I hear every day from local officials, schools, farmers, and people  who are overwhelmed by costly mandates forced on them by the Federal  Government. This is not what a government of the people, by the people,  and for the people should look like.   I rise to share these stories so that we will protect the people's  voices and, ultimately, their power to create those solutions that will  work in their lives and their communities.   By design and common sense, the institutions closest to the people  yield the best results as well as build trust. If you were suddenly in  need, who would you trust, Hope House, which you can look in the eye  and know by name, or a phone number that directs you to someone sitting  in a cubicle in Washington, D.C.?   Losing that trust in community solutions is what we risk when we  start embracing socialism. Socialism will diminish our individual  liberties, isolating us from the institutions that empower us to make a  difference in the world around us. It will concentrate power, where the  people's voices don't stand a chance against corruption.   That is why power doesn't belong behind an unelected bureaucrat's  desk, where scandals like we have seen at the IRS, the VA, and the FBI  can run rampant.   The promise of America is where people, not the government, is  trusted with the potential to achieve our dreams. We have a voice. We  have that power in our community.   The promise that socialism can provide these things is a false one.  It never happens.   Mr. Speaker, I will say it again: We are a government of the people,  by the people, and for the people. For those words to be true, the  people's House must recognize where the people have the most power and  freedom to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families. It  isn't in the Federal Government.   Like in Pend Oreille County, it is in the community. It is our  community, our neighborhoods, our homes, our schools, PTA meetings,  churches, local governments, and, yes, at Hope House and daycare  centers, too. It is neighbor helping neighbor. We all need each other  at different times in our lives.   Mr. Speaker, it is community that we must stand for, for the American  Dream to flourish.                            ____________________
