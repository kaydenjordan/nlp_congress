 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Charter Schools Week,  and I rise to recognize Arizona's leadership amongst the charter school  community.   Over this past school year, a record number of students attended 547  charter schools in Arizona; and last week, a new survey found that five  of the country's top seven high schools were Arizona charter schools,  including one from my own district, Arizona's Fifth Congressional  District. I am extremely proud of our charter schools.   Arizona charter schools are thriving because of two decades of  tireless work from advocates to give thousands of students more  educational choices and opportunities to succeed. These leaders have  fostered a culture that balances autonomy and accountability to prepare  their students for higher education and the workforce.   As the rankings prove, Arizona's policies are drastically improving  student achievement and should be emulated by the rest of the Nation.                            ____________________
