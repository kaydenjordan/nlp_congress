 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor  the life and service of a truly exceptional young man whom I had the  great fortune of meeting and working with, Patrick Henry Beauregard,  who was taken from us far too soon on September 6, 2020, after a  courageous and awe-inspiring battle with colorectal cancer.   Many of you know that my own faith has been greatly influenced by the  teachings of the Jesuits, and in particular, the idea that we ought to  live our lives as men and women for others.   Mr. Speaker, Patrick Beauregard embodied this idea in every way.  Patrick was born in Portland, Maine, and grew up in Medfield,  Massachusetts. He attended Thayer Academy in Braintree, Massachusetts,  and Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island, where he met the  love of his life, Amanda.   After graduating from college, Patrick decided to serve our country  by enlisting in the United States Marine Corps where he was an  intelligence analyst. And during his service, Patrick received  commendations for exceptional leadership, initiative, loyalty, and  dedication to duty.   Patrick's stage 4 colorectal cancer diagnosis in September 2017 at  the age of 29--a month after marrying his beloved wife, Amanda--changed  everything. I think some of us would be tempted to give in to the  uncertainty and doubt. But Patrick remained positive through surgeries,  immunotherapy, and over 40 rounds of chemotherapy.   But what inspires me most about Patrick is that in the midst of this  awful situation, he saw an opportunity to do good. Even as he fought  his own disease with incredible grace and resilience, he used his voice  to speak out and to bring the issue of colorectal cancer to the  attention of researchers, donors, elected officials, and other young  people at risk for the disease. He appeared on the news, advocated for  patients, and worked with groups like the Prevent Cancer Foundation, to  educate the public about the alarming increase of young onset  colorectal cancer.   Mr. Speaker, Patrick Beauregard truly lived his life in service to  others. From serving on the Alumni Association Board at Thayer Academy,  to serving in the United States Marine Corps, to serving as an advocate  so that we can prevent this terrible disease, Patrick is an inspiration  to all of us, and he embodies the ideas of service and self-sacrifice  this Nation was built on.   His incredible strength and tenacity allowed him to accomplish his  final goal of meeting his son, Noah Patrick, on July 10, 2020. Noah,  your dad was a great man, but more importantly, he was a very good man,  who did his very best to serve those around him and made our world a  better place.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Massachusetts, cancer  patients and survivors around the world, and the entire United States  Congress, please join me in honoring the life and service of Patrick  Henry Beauregard and praying for his family and friends and all those  who hold him in their heart.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished member of the  Rules Committee, Ms. Scanlon, for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of good things included in this rule. I  want to discuss one in particular today: H. Res. 908--condemning all  forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19.  [[Page H4396]]    This resolution is about our values; not our Democratic values, not  our Republican values, it is about our American values.   Look, I understand that politics can be contentious. The rhetoric can  get heated. But what we are talking about here is something else  altogether. Anti-Asian rhetoric crosses a line that should never be  crossed.   The Asian-American community is an integral part of our society. It  is an important part of my community in Massachusetts. These are our  neighbors, our friends, and our family. And the hateful rhetoric that  we are hearing directed towards them during this pandemic is  unacceptable. It has led to an uptick in physical attacks, verbal  assaults, and online harassment. Hate crimes against Asian Americans  are on the rise.   Mr. Speaker, this is the antithesis of what the United States of  America stands for. During difficult times, our Nation comes together.  We don't allow offensive rhetoric to tear us apart, no matter who says  it. We are nearing 200,000 lives lost in this country because of the  coronavirus. Countless more are sick. Businesses have closed, our  economy is struggling.   Mr. Speaker, the world has changed. But one thing that is not and  will not change is our obligation to be there for each other, to treat  others as we would want to be treated. To show those around us the  dignity and respect and the basic human decency that we would want them  to show us--pandemic or no pandemic.   To pretend that these hateful words about Asian Americans don't  matter is to kid yourself. Just ask those who have been on the  receiving end. Or ask the groups that monitor hate-inspired  discrimination. They tell us that there were more than 2,100 anti- Asian-American hate incidents in this country related to this pandemic  between March and June. I shudder to think what the number has grown to  today.   No one should be forced to endure such hate and violence. Asian  Americans are struggling under the weight of this pandemic, just like  everyone else. They are doctors and nurses and first responders--just  like everyone else. I know that in politics our values don't always  align, but on this, Democrats and Republicans should agree. Some things  go beyond partisanship. They speak to who we are as a Nation and what  we are willing to tolerate.   Mr. Speaker, I am hoping for a strong bipartisan vote on this  resolution because this country should always stand as an inclusive and  just society. And as elected officials, that starts with us. We must  lead by example.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides to support this  rule and the underlying measures.
