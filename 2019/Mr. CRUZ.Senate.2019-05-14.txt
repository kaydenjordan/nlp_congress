 Mr. President, I rise today to give voice to a town in  Texas. It is a small town of about 14,000 people. In that town there is  a high school, a school of about 1,500 students. One year ago, on May  18, a deeply disturbed and deranged student committed an unspeakable  act of evil which shook Santa Fe, shook Texas, and shook the entire  country. It left our Nation weeping.   Just before 8 in the morning, the shooter began firing weapons into  classrooms and through doors where his fellow students were taking  shelter.   Within minutes, the attacker senselessly murdered 8 students and 2  teachers. Their names are the following: Jared Conard Black, Christian  Riley Garcia, Shana Fisher, Aaron Kyle McLeod, Glenda Ann Perkins,  [[Page S2806]]  Angelique Ramirez, Sabika Sheikh, Christopher Stone, Cynthia Tisdale,  and Kimberly Vaughan.   I would like us to pause for a moment of silence as we remember these  brave souls.   Their names will live on. Their killer's name will not. His name is  never worth mentioning again.   Thirteen others were also brutally wounded, including three  substitute teachers. Flo Rice, one of the substitute teachers at the  high school that day, was shot five times. I have gotten to know Flo  and her husband Scott well in the weeks and months since the shooting.   But that day was not merely a day of great tragedy. It was also a day  of incredible bravery. Santa Fe police officers did their duty and  swiftly engaged the shooter. One of those police officers, John Barnes,  was critically wounded in the process. They shot back, and, ultimately,  they took the coward into custody.   Santa Fe students also proved themselves to be heroes. One of them,  Riley Garcia, made the ultimate sacrifice. He held a door shut to give  other students time to escape, and he was killed in the process. Other  students tended to the wounded and to each other.   In the wake of the shooting, Texans grieved with the families and  friends of those we lost. We heard stories of terror and stories of  hope.   I was at my home in Houston that morning. Santa Fe High School is  about 45 minutes away from my house. When I got the call as to what was  happening, I jumped into a truck and headed down there. I spent the  entire day with families who had lost their children, with first  responders, with teachers, with school leaders, with a community that  was grieving mightily. But in Santa Fe, I also saw a boundless spirit  and hope and unity.   I remember that afternoon, traveling to the hospital and visiting  with a number of the students who had been shot and wounded that day. I  remember meeting Clayton, a young man who had been shot just that  morning. He had pins in his arm from being shot twice. Clayton  described how he jumped over the fence, even after having been shot,  and his friends helped to carry him to safety. This young man described  how he is a bull rider and a pole vaulter. I asked him if he is a lefty  or righty. He said he is a lefty, and that was the arm that was  wounded. But he said with a smile: ``You know, now I gotta learn to  ride a bull with my right arm.'' That is the toughness and the spirit  of these students and their entire community.   All across Texas and all across the country, millions of Americans  lifted those children and lifted those families up in prayer. You know,  it has become politically fashionable now to deride thoughts and  prayers. To suggest that thoughts and prayers are not appropriate, I  will say this: We should always lift up in prayer those who are  victimized by violence, by brutality, by terrorism, by murder. I  believe in the power of prayer, and I will tell you that the community  of Santa Fe leaned on the power of prayer in the wake of that tragedy.   Now, thoughts and prayers are not themselves a substitute for action.  In the days and the weeks that followed, I met with mothers and fathers  and teachers and students. I hosted Santa Fe students here in the  Senate Dining Room. We talked with law enforcement and with first  responders. I sat down with the President, and he traveled down to meet  with the Santa Fe families. I participated in a roundtable with  Governor Abbott, families from Santa Fe and other communities  victimized by violence, and officials at the Federal, State, and local  levels. We discussed how we could do a better job of protecting our  schools and protecting our children. We have lost too many kids to  homicidal action, and it has to stop.   We have to do much more to keep guns out of the hands of violent  criminals and to better treat the mentally ill--all while preserving  and protecting our constitutional rights.   There was a universal agreement in the wake of Santa Fe that, as a  State and as a Nation, we had to see justice done and to take every  step to try to ensure that such an attack never occurs again.   Soon after, I was gratified to hear that the Department of Education  announced $1 million in Federal funds for the Santa Fe Independent  School District through Project School Emergency Response to Violence,  or Project SERV. It is a crucial first step in Federal funding to help  the Santa Fe school community to recover and protect all its students,  but the story doesn't end there.   In addition to a State prosecution, most of us assumed there would be  a Federal case against the Santa Fe shooter, as well, because his  massive assault was on students and teachers in a public school, and,  crucially, because authorities found explosive devices on the school  grounds and off campus, including pipe bombs and a Molotov cocktail. To  any reasonable observer, this would open the case to Federal explosives  and terrorism charges.   All of us were committed to seeing the attacker prosecuted to the  fullest extent of the law. Early press reports, however, indicated that  Federal authorities were not going to proceed with the Federal case.  Those press reports dismayed me--dismayed many--in particular because  the shooter was under 18 at the time of the massacre, which means it is  likely that the maximum State sentence he would receive is 40 years,  which means that, if only State charges were brought, the shooter would  be potentially eligible for release at 57 years old. Releasing this  mass murderer into society would not be just, and it would not be  right.   Thankfully, Attorney General Barr agreed, and it has been publicly  reported now that Federal charges have come forward to ensure that this  attacker is brought to justice and faces the full consequences for the  horrific acts of that morning.   (The remarks of Senator Cruz pertaining to the submission of S. 1442  are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as we pause this week to remember the 10  people who lost their lives and the 13 people who were wounded 1 year  ago, we should reflect on what has changed but also on what still needs  to be done to stop this epidemic of mass shootings and school  shootings, in particular.   Last year I was very proud that Congress authorized nearly $1 billion  in school safety funding--legislation that I was a cosponsor of. That  is nearly $1 billion that schools can use to improve school safety,  including hardening doors so that shooters can't shoot through the  school doors anymore, shrinking the number of entrances and exits,  installing metal detectors, and hiring armed police officers to keep  our kids safe. That was an important first step, but we need to do  more.   That is why I am reintroducing this week two important bills. First,  I am reintroducing legislation to authorize more funding for school  safety and to enable greater targeting of the felons and fugitives who  try to buy firearms illegally. If a felon or fugitive tries to purchase  a firearm illegally, that felon or fugitive should be prosecuted and  they should be put in Federal jail.   In 2013, my first year in the Senate, I introduced legislation with  my friend Senator Grassley from Iowa to create a gun crime task force  at the Federal Department of Justice to ensure that Federal convictions  are in the national database and to direct the Department of Justice to  prosecute the felons and fugitives who try to illegally buy guns and to  put them in jail before they can take the lives of more innocents.  Sadly, cynically, Senate Democrats filibustered that legislation. They  prevented it from passing into law by demanding a 60-vote threshold.   In light of the tragedies of Santa Fe, Parkland, and Highlands Ranch  High School, just last week, I urge my colleagues to join me in making  this commonsense bill law in this Congress. Let's direct law  enforcement resources to stop violent criminals before they commit more  heinous murders.   I am also reintroducing the bipartisan School Security Enhancement  Act with Democratic Senator Doug Jones, which would allow local  communities to utilize student support and academic enrichment grants  to reinforce school safety infrastructure and technology. Installing  metal detectors, bulletproof doors and windows, and establishing an  efficient system for communicating important information to law  enforcement and to parents are all important steps in improving school  safety.   I hope we can join together and pass these bills so that our students  are safer, and so we can do more to prevent future mass shootings.   What happened in Santa Fe a year ago was a tragedy. On the night of  the shooting, there was a candlelight prayer vigil in the community at  a public park in downtown Santa Fe. Even as you saw families grieving  and in unspeakable agony, and their hearts breaking, you also saw  people coming together. When I was at the vigil that night, as you wept  and mourned with students and parents experiencing the ultimate agony,  you saw at the same time students and parents in the community leaning  on each other, holding each other, holding each other up, praying  alongside each other, praying with each other, and giving thanks for  the heroism and strength. I think that is the only way a community  makes it out of a tragedy like that.   The last year has been an extremely difficult year for the Santa Fe  families and the community. That morning is indelibly marked onto that  community. At the same time, they have been able to lean on each other,  to rely on each other, to support each other, and to lift each other up  in prayer.  [[Page S2820]]    I want to conclude by saying to the families in Santa Fe: We are with  you. We support you. We love you, and we are there for you.   To my colleagues in Congress, we need to unite together to make our  schools safer, to prosecute felons and fugitives before they commit  acts of murder, and to do everything to stop this horrific mass  shooting epidemic. We need to do it now. End the partisan battles.  Focus on the bad guys, and stop them before more lives and innocents  are taken.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr.          Menendez, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Carper, Ms. Baldwin, Mr.          Schatz, Ms. Smith, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Murphy, Mr.          Bennet, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Reed, Ms. Warren, Ms. Duckworth, Ms.          Rosen, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr. Kaine, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Booker,          Ms. Hassan, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Udall, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Van          Hollen, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Harris,          Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Heinrich, and Mr. King):   S. 1445.
