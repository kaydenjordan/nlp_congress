 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in a moment, I am going to propound a  unanimous consent request. Before I do, I want to make some brief  remarks. Right now, we have an administration that is killing oil  pipelines, slow-walking natural gas licensing, illegally halting lease  sales, and writing rules that Congress never gave the executive branch  the authority to write.   This is how President Biden regulates our energy industry. In the  morning, he complains that gas prices are too high, and he chastises  oil and gas companies to produce more. Then he takes a nap, wakes up,  and says the very existence of oil and gas companies offends him, and  it is our duty to put them out of business. It is absurd.   But today I want to focus on the Biden administration's reckless  release of our emergency crude oil stockpile, the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve. The President's energy policy has been a failure so much so  that today the United States produces 1\1/2\ million fewer barrels a  day of oil than it did in November 2019.   That is why oil and gas prices are high. It is no mystery, and it is  not principally because of the war in Ukraine, as much as Joe Biden and  the Democrats want to blame it on that.   At the same time that President Biden has tried to strangle U.S.  energy production, he has simultaneously groveled to Saudi Arabia and  to Venezuela, asking them to increase their production. And he has  attacked small business gas stations around the country and told them:  Just lower your prices. Then he has taken the unprecedented step of  releasing an arbitrary amount of our emergency crude oil stockpile in  order to try to lower gas prices before the midterm elections.   The Biden administration has even sold at least 2 million barrels of  oil to the Chinese Communist Party's state-owned oil and gas company,  Sinopec. One million barrels in April of this year, another million  barrels in July sold to communist China. China, at this very moment,  has created the world's largest stockpile of crude oil, which according  to Bloomberg totals 926 million barrels.   In comparison, under Joe Biden, our own reserves have fallen to 492  million  [[Page S3722]]  barrels of oil. That is the lowest level since December of 1985,  according to the U.S. Department of Energy.   Of course, no mention of China and the administration would be  complete without noting that Hunter Biden's private equity firm, BHR,  has a major stake in Sinopec.   But there is something we can do. I am calling on this body to pass  the No Emergency Crude Oil For Foreign Adversaries Act, which is  cosponsored by 11 of my colleagues.   This bill takes the commonsense step of prohibiting the Secretary of  Energy from selling our emergency crude oil stockpile--there to protect  the national security of the United States--to communist China and also  to other foreign adversaries, including Iran, North Korea, and Russia.   It would also require a full accounting of where our crude oil has  been sent for refining since the Biden administration began releasing  the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last November.   It is important to note we have no issue with exports in general. In  fact, we want to continue to help our European allies remove themselves  from their reliance on Russian oil.   A recent study found that since 2015, U.S. oil exports increased oil  and natural gas development in the United States, reduced global oil  prices by $1.93 per barrel over a 6-year period, added $161 billion to  our GDP, and added nearly 50,000 jobs here in America.   But under no circumstances should we be giving our emergency  stockpile to our enemies, particularly at a time when they are  benefiting from stockpiling cheap Russian oil and gas. This poses a  direct threat to American national security, and the Biden  administration shows zero interest in stopping it. That is why Congress  needs to act.   This should be a simple and easy bipartisan measure to say we are not  going to sell our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to communist China to use  it against America.   Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be discharged from further  consideration of S. 4515, and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    I do not. Reserving the right to object.   Debates on the Senate floor sometimes can be clarifying. Over the  course of the day, my office and I engaged in good-faith negotiations  with a number of Democratic Senators. We engaged in extensive  negotiation with Senator Manchin, the chair of the relevant committee.  Senator Manchin proposed minor alterations to this bill and agreed to  support it if we made those alterations. I agreed to accept Senator  Manchin's alterations, and we then had what was going to be a  bipartisan bill.   Senator Cantwell, likewise, we negotiated with her office today and  had reached what we thought was an agreement.   And then at the last moment, the Senator from Connecticut raised this  objection. And I think what he is asking this body to pass really  clarifies where the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party is, which  is the Green New Deal Democrats want to destroy American energy jobs.  They want to destroy the American oil and gas industry. They want to  destroy our own production, and, bizarrely, they simultaneously want to  benefit energy jobs of our enemies.   There is some irony that the Senator from Connecticut is leading this  objection because it was earlier this year when the Senator from  Connecticut led the effort in this body to block sanctions on Russia  and Vladimir Putin on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, sanctions that I had  authored and passed into law, not once but twice; sanctions that had  stopped that pipeline; sanctions that had prevented Putin from invading  Ukraine; sanctions that hurt Russia and hurt Putin until Joe Biden  became President and decided to waive the sanctions on Russia and Putin  to capitulate to Russia and Putin.   When Biden did so, when Biden waived those sanctions, the Government  of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, said: If you waive these sanctions,  Russia will invade Ukraine. The Government of Poland said: If you waive  these sanctions, Russia will invade Ukraine.   And in January of this year, I forced a vote on imposing the  sanctions. At the time, the Government of Ukraine begged us--there were  tanks on the border of Ukraine, the invasion hadn't  [[Page S3723]]  happened--and the government of Ukraine begged us: Please pass these  sanctions.   Now, every Democrat in this body had voted for my sanctions not once  but twice. They had supported it when the President's name was Donald  J. Trump.   But then they had a Democrat in the White House, and a Democrat, Joe  Biden, who, on the day of the vote, came to Capitol Hill--it is the  only time I know of that he has done this--to personally lobby  Democrats to vote against sanctions on Russia, against sanctions on  Putin, to vote to green-light a natural gas pipeline for Putin and  Russia.   And the Senator from Connecticut led the fight on the Senate floor,  urging his Democratic colleagues: Flip your votes. Give an enormous  present to Russia and Putin, and sacrifice Ukraine in the process.   I stood on this floor and said: If you do this--the 44 Democrats who  cast the vote--we will see Russian tanks in the streets of Kyiv.   I wish that prediction had proven wrong, but it did not.   What the Senator from Connecticut just came back with is: We should  prohibit all energy exports from America.   And, in fact, I will read from the bill he called up. It is:         The President . . . may restrict exports of . . . coal,       petroleum products, natural gas, or petrochemical feedstocks.    Shut down all exports.   So I want you to understand the difference between my bill and the  bill the Senator from Connecticut is asking us to pass.   My bill says: Don't sell our oil to our enemies. Communist China is  our enemy. Russia is our enemy. Iran is our enemy. North Korea is our  enemy. Let's not sell our oil to our enemies.   This is a reasonable, commonsense proposition. I am confident any one  of us at home with our constituents, if you asked your constituents,  ``Should the President of the United States be selling oil that the  American taxpayer has paid for, that is kept as a strategic reserve to  keep America safe, should we be selling it to communist China,'' the  overwhelming majority of your constituents and mine, whether Democrat  or Republican, would say: Absolutely not. That is idiotic.   My bill says: Don't sell our oil to our enemies.   The Senator from Connecticut has responded with: Don't sell our oil  to anybody. Don't sell our natural gas to anybody. Don't sell it to our  friends.   Now, let's be clear. There have been a lot of Democrats in this  Chamber who, once the war in Ukraine started, stood up and said the key  to defeating Putin is exporting our liquid natural gas to Europe so  they can get off of dependency on Russian oil and gas.   I can't count how many Democrat speeches I have heard saying what is  absolutely true: We want our friends and allies purchasing energy  produced here in America and not purchasing energy from our enemy.   And what the Senator from Connecticut has just said is that we should  abandon our friends in Europe. We should abandon our friends that want  our energy. We should tell them: You know what. You are better off  buying oil from Russia. You are better off buying oil from Iran. You  are better off buying oil from Venezuela, which I guess makes sense  because Joe Biden's State Department was asking Venezuela, led by an  illegitimate Nicolas Maduro, an enemy of America--the Biden  administration is asking our enemies to produce more oil.   So the effect of the Senator from Connecticut's proposition would be  to hurt jobs in America, hurt energy prices in America. By the way, it  would drive up gasoline prices. If the extremes in the Democratic Party  have their way, we won't just see $5-, $6-, $7-a-gallon gasoline, we  are going to see $10-a-gallon gasoline. That is where they want to go.   And, by the way, the Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, said  publicly: This is the cost of transition. We have got to make gasoline  expensive.   In politics, that is called saying the quiet part out loud--that for  too many of the extreme Democrats, they want working men and women to  pay 100 bucks, 150 bucks at the gas pump. Why? Because they don't like  that some moms choose to drive minivans. They don't like that some  Americans choose to drive a pickup truck or an SUV, and they want to  force you to sell your Suburban and buy a Prius. And their strategy is:  We are going to make it so expensive, so miserable that you can't  afford your bills until you comply with what they want.   It is cynical, and it is misguided, but it does at least make  transparent that the little stickers on the gas pump with Joe Biden  pointing at the price saying ``I did this''--that is what they intend.   We should not be selling oil to communist China. Everyone in this  body knows this. But that doesn't mean it is a good idea to abandon our  friends and send our friends and allies to become customers of Vladimir  Putin. That is spectacularly ill conceived.   And, therefore, I decline to accept the modification.    Madam President, you know, John Adams famously said:  ``Facts are stubborn things.'' So let's clarify a couple of facts.   No. 1, the bill that the Senator from Connecticut was pushing is a  bill that is entitled the BAN Oil Exports Act. In  [[Page S3724]]  his remarks a moment ago, he suggested it was about China. This bill is  not about China. This bill is about banning oil exports, natural gas  exports, coal exports--energy exports across the board to anybody.   By the way, the bill is authored by Senator Markey. It is cosponsored  by Senators Wyden, Merkley, Sanders, and Warren. The Senator from  Connecticut is not a cosponsor of the bill.   This is an extreme bill.   As I pointed out in my remarks, what the Senator from Connecticut was  asking is: Let's refuse to sell oil or natural gas to our friends, and  let's make our friends buy them from Russia instead.   In response to that, he said precisely nothing, nada. He said:  ExxonMobil is bad. He said: Don't sell to China.   My bill says: Don't sell to China.   His bill says: Don't sell to anybody.   And as for his revisionist history on Nord Stream 2, he is right that  the pipeline was over 90 percent completed by the time the Senate and  the House took up my sanctions legislation, and the Russian  disinformation that was put out was: It is over 90 percent completed;  so there is no way to stop it.   Putin stopped building Nord Stream 2 the day that President Trump  signed my sanctions legislation into law. Literally, that day they  halted construction. A 90-percent complete pipeline is zero percent  complete. It is a hunk of metal on the bottom of the ocean. The  pipeline lay dormant--it was dead--for over a year.   He complains that I didn't hold Donald Trump's nominations? I didn't  need to. The sanctions worked. We had stopped the pipeline.   Then Joe Biden became President. He immediately began signaling  weakness to Russia. He began foreshadowing what he actually did in May,  which is to waive the sanctions.   Joe Biden was sworn into office on January 20, 2021. Putin  recommenced building Nord Stream 2 on January 24, 2021, 4 days after  Joe Biden put his hands on the Bible.   I find it very curious that Democrats, No. 1, ignored the pleas from  our allies and stood with Russia and Putin to help Putin build a  pipeline to generate billions for his war machine but at the same time  are willing to stand up and say: We like Russian oil and gas jobs, but  we don't like American oil and gas jobs.   We should not be selling oil or natural gas to our enemies. This is  an obvious proposition. It ought to be bipartisan. It was bipartisan  until this last-minute objection.   But the fact that we shouldn't sell to our enemies doesn't mean we  shouldn't supply energy to our friends. Our friends are desperately  asking for it, and sending them to buy from Russia is spectacularly  foolish.   I yield the floor.
