 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. I am proud to have  authored this bipartisan piece of legislation, and I thank Chairman  Royce for his leadership in bringing it to the floor. I also want to  thank Congressmen Poe, McCaul, Keating, and Adam Smith for joining me  as original cosponsors.   Around the world, levels of violence are at a 25-year high, driving  massive instability. This is a global security threat, as fragile,  unstable states are breeding grounds for criminals and terrorists.   There is a significant economic toll as well. Violence and  instability undercut American investment and development efforts, and  cost the global economy nearly $15 trillion a year.   But probably worst of all, this violence and instability has created  a humanitarian catastrophe. The world now faces an unprecedented  refugee crisis: 68.5 million people have left their homes. This is the  highest level ever recorded.   Naturally, we need to do more to end this violence and instability,  and prevent it from happening in the first place. Over the years, we  have learned a lot about what works to stabilize conflicts and prevent  violence from breaking out. We need to update our government policies  to implement those lessons.   This bill does just that by establishing an initiative to reduce  fragility and violence, and to align American policy and programs with  best practices. It will require the State Department, USAID, and the  Department of Defense to coordinate their diplomatic, development, and  security activities, with a focus on at least six priority countries or  regions. It also requires innovative approaches to coordinate our work  with partners, measure results, and adapt to changing conditions.  Finally, it mandates robust oversight to ensure our efforts are  implemented effectively.                                time  1645    The Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act is an important step  in thwarting many of the most devastating crises facing the world right  [[Page H9590]]  now and preventing new ones from emerging in the future. I am very  happy to have authored this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in passing it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) who just  spoke, I think it is very appropriate now, as the Congress is moving to  an end, to thank him for his hard work and for his good friendship. He  really is a Member's Member and is really indicative of the bipartisan  showing that we had for many, many years on the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   We are going to miss the gentleman on the committee, and we hope he  will continue to watch us and call us and keep in touch with us because  he truly is a fine Member and someone whom I am really proud to call my  friend. And if I may so say, and that is just the way it is.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the bipartisan group  of lawmakers who worked with me on this bill--Mr. Poe, Mr. McCaul--and  I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership, as always.   After 17 years of war with no end in sight, we should all be able to  understand the value of preventing conflicts before they start. We have  learned a lot about what works and what doesn't when it comes to  stabilizing conflicts and preventing violence from breaking out. This  bill applies those lessons to American policy. By addressing the root  causes of violence, we get closer to a safer and more stable,  prosperous world.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the passage of this measure. I  encourage my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. This is a good  bill. I  [[Page H9592]]  thank its authors and Chairman Royce for bringing it forward.   I will discuss its merits in a moment because I can't, in good  conscience, stand on the House floor and talk about our economic  partnership with Mexico and not speak for a moment on what is happening  right now on our southern border.   The President tweeted that the migrants seeking asylum in our country  are stone-cold criminals. I have seen the images, and I don't see  stone-cold criminals. I see children with bare feet. I see hungry  mothers. I see toddlers in diapers. I see desperate fathers. And I see  tear gas being lobbed from the United States into Mexico.   The President says not to worry. He says it is a very safe sort of  tear gas. The American people aren't stupid. The American people know  what this country stands for. They know we are a nation of immigrants.  They know that America doesn't kick people when they are down or slam  the door on those fleeing poverty and violence.   I hope the President gets the message.   Now, the measure before us deals with our incredibly important  relationship with our neighbor to the south, Mexico. Mexico is our  close friend and ally, our third largest trading partner, and a country  with which we share extraordinarily close cultural and person-to-person  ties.   This bill builds on the Obama administration's 100,000 Strong in the  Americas initiative by requiring the Secretary of State to expand the  exchange programs that allow our students and business leaders to share  and learn from each other.   There is no better way to advance the future of our bilateral ties  than by allowing young people and professionals to experience what  makes each of our countries unique.   It is also critical that we send a strong message to the Mexican  people that the United States Congress will not walk away from them,  despite any damage done to our relationship over the past several  years.   As I have said many times in the Foreign Affairs Committee and on the  House floor, the United States should be in the business of building  bridges, not walls, to our friends in Mexico. The timing of this  legislation could not be more ideal.                                time  1700    Mr. Speaker, 4 days from now, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be  sworn in as President of Mexico. By passing this measure today, the  House of Representatives is recommitting itself to our bilateral  relationship. We are sending a loud and clear message that the  prosperity of our countries' futures depends on an enduring U.S.-Mexico  relationship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cuellar), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I close by again emphasizing the importance of the U.S.- Mexico relationship. For so many years, this relationship was  characterized by mistrust. That has changed over the past two decades.   As just one example, bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics is now  the norm and led to the extradition of drug kingpin El Chapo Guzman to  the United States in the last hours of the Obama administration. He is  on trial now in an American court.   Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago, it would have been hard to imagine coming  to the House floor in support of a bipartisan bill on educational  exchanges with Mexico. Now a bill like this will glide through the  House with little opposition.   But we cannot take this cooperation for granted. Far too much is at  stake to allow the bilateral relationship between the United States and  Mexico to deteriorate. There is a new government, a new leader of  Mexico coming in, and I hope we can very swiftly establish the good  relationship that our two countries have and not dwell on some of the  recent discussions and problems involving a wall or anything else.  [[Page H9593]]    So I thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting this  legislation to double down on the successes in the U.S.-Mexico  partnership. I thank Chairman Royce, I thank the sponsors of this bill,  I thank Mr. Cuellar, and I thank all our colleagues for supporting this  bill. I urge its immediate passage.   The U.S.-Mexico partnership is one of our most important  partnerships, and the House of Representatives ought to be doing  everything it can to enhance that relationship, and that is one of the  things we are doing by passing this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, and I thank  Representatives Kinzinger, Poe, and Suozzi for their bipartisan  leadership on this legislation. And, of course, I thank Chairman Royce  for working with me to get this legislation into shape for the floor.   The vision that Democrats and Republicans have for Iraq is very  similar. We all want to see Iraqis work together to provide for a more  prosperous future for their country. We want the greatest number of  Iraqis to access the wealth of their country's natural resources. We  want to see Iraqis focus more on what unites them than what divides  them. We want to prevent the resurgence of ISIS and the next generation  of ISIS or al-Qaida. We want to protect religious minorities.   That is why it is so important to bring this legislation to the floor  today. That is why Republicans and Democrats worked together to find  common ground on American policies in Iraq. Especially after the Iraqi  election, when it remains unclear which path Iraq will choose, we want  to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that we support their efforts to  build a better country.   This bill penalizes those who want to exploit Iraq's sectarian  differences and those who use violence toward those ends. It also  establishes a separate watch list to help keep track of proxy groups in  Iraq that are doing the bidding of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps.   It sends the message that those in power must prioritize answering to  the Iraqi people and not to Iran. We hope that this legislation will  empower those who seek a better future for Iraq and its people.   I am glad to support H.R. 4591, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi), an original cosponsor of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is both a happy and sad moment for me. I am happy because, in  the new Congress, I will be in the majority. But I am sad because so  many of my friends are retiring, not coming back.   I mentioned my good friend Mr. Poe before, and I just want to mention  our now Speaker up here, my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. We have  been working together for more than 25 years in passing all kinds of  important legislation involving people's support around the world,  making lives a little bit better for people, and working here to  promote democracy at home.   I want to have the opportunity to say that this Congress will be  missing you. I know I will be missing you, and I know we will be in  touch. You are the kind of Member that we need more of, someone who  always reached across the aisle, someone who always worked in a  bipartisan manner, and someone who was effective and intelligent. I am  just proud to call you my friend. I had to say that.   So I am going to close and say that Iraq is at a crossroads.   We have another speaker? I am sorry. I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Madam Speaker, it seems like we are playing revolving or musical  chairs, but it is so good, because I get to see all my friends from  different angles.   Madam Speaker, Iraq is at a crossroads. And as someone who wants to  see Iraq succeed in promoting pluralism and tolerance, I support this  legislation because it will help Iraqis build a better future.   This bill makes it clear that the United States will not side with  those who continue to foment sectarian strife. No matter where you are  from, if you undermine the democratic process in Iraq, if you threaten  peace and stability there, if you prevent the delivery of humanitarian  assistance to the Iraqi people, you will be penalized. That is why this  bill is so important.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 4591 and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Bass), the lead Democrat on this bill and the ranking member of  the Africa Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our staff members who made this bill  possible, particularly Lesley Warner of my staff. We traveled to the  Congo in 2016 with Chairman Royce and had very important meetings  there, frustrating but important meetings.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this measure.   The Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, borders nine other  countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and positive or negative events there  often impact the entire region. This is why stability in the DRC is a  priority not for that country's people, but for many other countries,  including the United States. That is why Chairman Royce and I led a  codel there and why so many of our other members on the Foreign Affairs  Committee--Mr. Smith and Ms. Bass--have been there and have really  cared about the region.   For years, the DRC has been on the brink of crisis. More than 13  million people need humanitarian support, including 7.8 million  children. Across the country, violent conflicts have intensified,  including near the city of Beni, where health workers are battling a  deadly Ebola outbreak.   The current government, as my colleagues mentioned before, has shown  a concerning disregard for democracy and the country's constitution,  with troubling restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly and  disturbing reports of Congolese security forces violating the human  rights of peaceful protestors.   Next month, the DRC will hold elections, as my colleagues have  mentioned, that were supposed to be held back in December of 2016. It  is a critical time for the United States to show that we are committed  to the DRC having a peaceful political transition and moving toward  accountable, democratic governance.   The Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability  Act, this bill, asks the administration to continue providing robust  humanitarian and development assistance to the people of the DRC. It  also requires the President to submit a report to Congress detailing  the extent to which Congolese Government officials are involved in  human rights abuses against civilians and codifies previous executive  orders that target the property and interests of any persons  responsible for actions that threaten the stability of the DRC.   It is important that we continue leading the international community  to address the many challenges in the DRC. That is why this bill asks  the administration to keep the DRC on the U.N. Security Council agenda  and work to ensure the U.N. peacekeeping mission there has sufficient  means to operate effectively.   After decades of conflict and instability, the people of the  Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve a peaceful democratic  transition. By passing this bill today, we show that the House is  committed to supporting that process.   Mr. Speaker, it is in the national security interest of the United  States to support a peaceful political transition and accountable  governance in the DRC. With elections scheduled for next month, this  bill comes at a critical time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this measure. A huge amount of work  has gone into this bill. I especially thank Representative Smith of New  Jersey, who has been a tireless advocate on behalf of victims of  genocide. He always has been, and he always will be.   His efforts have helped to ensure that religious minorities still  have a place in Iraq and Syria, that their presence remains part of the  fabric of the Middle East.   ISIS sought to eliminate religious minorities. That is why Congress  fought to designate the crimes against them genocide.   The House Foreign Affairs Committee has heard hours upon hours of  testimony from genocide victims: a Yazidi man recounting the beheading  of thousands of Yazidi fighters, women who detailed gang rape and sex  slavery. We heard from a number of survivors that international  assistance was not moving quickly enough to get people resettled in  their homes and communities of origin.   This bill would help to ease those people's suffering and bring to  justice those who are responsible. It would authorize assistance for  groups investigating and prosecuting crimes against humanity and war  crimes. And it would require our government to identify those who are  vulnerable to genocide and war crimes, to help with their recovery and  stability in the future.   This bill will be an important tool in reaching our goal in Iraq and  Syria, preventing the resurgence of ISIS. We cannot allow this barbaric  group to take over territory or control people ever again.   In Iraq, this means addressing the root causes of conflict that  motivated people to join an extremist organization like ISIS in the  first place.   It also means pushing back on Iranian influence because Iran  envisions an Iraq overcome by sectarian strife and intolerance.   In Syria, that means finding a political solution that does not  include Assad.   Bashar al-Assad is a magnet for extremism, and he continues to employ  the worst violence against his own people. Since Assad's thugs took the  life of the first protester in Syria, more than half a million more  Syrians have been killed, and more than 11 million people have lost  their homes.   I remain convinced and concerned about what our military is doing in  Syria. In the waning days of ISIS in Syria, how do we intend to justify  the presence of our military? This is a slippery slope to perpetual  American boots on the ground, and we have to be careful.   In addition, if my legislation, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection  Act, becomes law, we can provide the administration the leverage it  needs to  [[Page H9603]]  push for a political solution to provide justice to Assad's many  victims and to prevent the United States from getting further mired  into another war in the Middle East.   The only solution to the crisis in Syria is a political solution, and  the Caesar Act would help pave a path toward that sustainable,  political solution.   I urge the other body to pass the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection  Act so we can get it to the President's desk. I believe the other body  would pass my bill, but for a single member of that body who is holding  it up for reasons which members of both parties don't understand. I  urge him to lift that hold so that this bill can become law.   Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to pass the bill before us  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Mr. Smith and Chairman  Royce for their hard work and leadership. The violence and suffering  that has overtaken Syria and Iraq in recent years is heartbreaking, and  it is infuriating, but we cannot allow the magnitude of the problem to  discourage us from trying to work toward a solution step by step.   This bill puts a focus on some of the most vulnerable groups caught  up in this crisis. It will help to ease their plight, and it will help  to provide them a measure of justice.   Before I close, Mr. Speaker, I again thank you, Mr. Poe, for your  friendship and for your hard work, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for her  friendship and her hard work.   Chairman Royce just stepped out, but I want to say that we always  talk about the bipartisan work that we have done on the Foreign Affairs  Committee. We always say that the Foreign Affairs Committee is the most  bipartisan committee in Congress, and it should be. It has to be  because partisanship really should stop at the water's edge. When we  are talking about global interests, we have the same interests.   That is one of the wonderful things about the Foreign Affairs  Committee. I don't know if I will have a chance to say this again in  this Congress, so that is why I want to say it now: Ed Royce has been a  magnificent chairman and a magnificent friend. He has led this  committee into bipartisanship on virtually all matters involving the  global stage, and we have become a more effective committee because of  his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for a job well done. It has been  a pleasure serving with him and all the members on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
