 Madam Speaker, I represent a southern State. Many of my  constituents are responsible, law-abiding gun owners, and I support  their ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights.   Contrary to what opponents of this legislation continue to claim,  this bill will allow current, law-abiding gun owners to keep all of  their guns. It simply prevents future sales of assault rifles.   Let's be clear: Assault weapons are designed to kill as many people  as possible as quickly as possible. They are not designed for  recreation. They are designed for combat.   It is incredibly irresponsible to allow people without specialized  training to possess these weapons.   Madam Speaker, when assault weapons are used in mass shootings, on  average, six times as many people are shot as in other mass shootings.   In 2022, there have already been 24 school shootings. The deadliest,  in Uvalde, Texas, involved an assault weapon.   But if my friends across the aisle are not convinced of the need to  protect our children, perhaps they will be convinced of the need to  protect the police. According to Violence Policy Center, one quarter of  law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2016 were killed  by an assault weapon.   After the assault weapons ban expired, the proportion of large- capacity-magazine-equipped guns used in murders of police increased by  30 percent. These weapons belong with our military, not on our streets  or in our schools.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the bill.
