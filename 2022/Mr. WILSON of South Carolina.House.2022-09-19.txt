 Mr. Speaker, inflation has outpaced  workers' wages for 17 months in a row under Biden. This has cost the  average American worker over $3,000 in lost income with the price of  everyday costs, such as gas, utility bills, and food, reducing  pocketbooks of families.   Food costs alone are up over 11 percent, the largest 1-year increase  in prices in 43 years. More specifically, a trip to the grocery store  will feature cost increases such as: Flour up 23 percent; roasted  coffee up 19 percent; lunch meats up 18 percent; milk up 17 percent.   According to a new Fox poll, the inflation is the largest issue  facing Americans voters, along with murderous crime, preferring  Republicans to handle these issues. Biden inflation is a tax on all  Americans.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from a safe haven in Afghanistan to America.   Happy birthday, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.                            ____________________
