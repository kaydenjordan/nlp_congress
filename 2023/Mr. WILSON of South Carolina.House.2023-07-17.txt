 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Madam Speaker, last Friday, I was  grateful the House passed the 63rd annual National Defense  Authorization Act, led by Chairman   Mike Rogers and Speaker Kevin  McCarthy. This is legislation that advances national security with  peace through strength, supporting servicemembers, veterans, and their  families.   Congress has a duty to support the Armed Forces of America as a  primary function of the Federal Government, to provide for the common  defense, which we cannot do for ourselves.   Highlights in this particular bill include: Promoting missions of the  Savannah River Site for nuclear capability and deterrence, advancing  the defense research projects at universities across the country,  increasing servicemember pay by 5.2 percent, and supporting National  Guard operations with border deployment.   As a 31-year veteran and father of four sons who have served overseas  in the military, I am committed to work for the security of our  country, its servicemembers, and their families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.   Our sympathy to Dr. Eddie Floyd of Florence, South Carolina, upon the  death of his beloved wife, Kay. They are champions of the University of  South Carolina.                            ____________________
