 Madam Speaker, the United States  Constitution is explicit: Bribery is an impeachable offense.   Bribery involves the abuse of power, and the President of the United  States abused the power of his office by soliciting a bribe of a  foreign leader to interfere in an election that he was afraid he could  not win honorably, fairly, or freely: You, President of Ukraine, open  and announce an investigation of my political rival, and I, President  of the United States, will release $391 million in military aid and  give you the stature-amplifying White House meeting that you need.   This is a this-for-that, something-for-something transaction.  Soliciting a bribe from a foreign leader is an abuse of power and a  Federal crime.
