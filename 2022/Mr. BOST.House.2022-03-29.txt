 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   You know, a lot of people are saying a lot of things here about Don  tonight as we are talking about his life and his service.   Now, let's put it in perspective. Many of the people in this House,  whenever he first came in, many weren't even born. In my case, I was in  seventh grade, never knowing that I would meet somebody like Don Young.   When I first came into this great assembly, there was a gruff, noisy  person that sat back in that chair that we have talked about all along,  yelling about this and talking about that, and I just wondered who he  was.   After serving with him on the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee, getting to know him, I realized that that gruff and that  noise, let me explain something to you, has a heart that was bigger  than the noise ever could be. The kindness that he didn't want to show  when you were around him for just a little bit, you understood.   But, also, what is so great is the amount of us that were able to tap  into his knowledge of the institution, of the things that he has seen;  ten Presidents, nine Speakers, someone said over 2,000 Members that  have come through that have served with Don Young.   Anytime someone has been in a position that long, the knowledge that  they gain and the way that they can deliver for their district is  amazing.   This last week when we found out Don passed--unfortunately, in the  world of social media, you put things out, and you put it out as  positive as possible. But there was one person that responded in a  statement, when I said he was there 50 years, well, that is why we  should have term limits.    Really? Don Young had term limits. Every 2 years. He went back to the  people of Alaska, and the people of Alaska spoke every 2 years.   Why did they do that? They did that because they had a great  Representative that knew and understood and loved the State that he  represented.   Now, think about this. He sat in this House when he could have moved  on to the Senate. It was the same run. He could have been Governor, but  he chose to stay in this House because he believed in this House and  the job he was doing for the people of Alaska. He served them well.   I was blessed by the fact that I got to go and participate in the  fundraiser that his first wife had put together, and that is a fishing  tournament that allows for that money to be given to the native  children of Alaska that are in need.   After that, he married Anne. And to Anne and the family, his first  love was his family, and we thank them for giving him to us, not only  the ones that serve here today but the ones that have served over the  past 50 years, and to this Nation that will be forever grateful for a  man who stood up, told the truth, and used this institution to make  this Nation better.                                time  1900
