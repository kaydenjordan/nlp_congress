 Madam Speaker, Webster's dictionary defines the star  chamber as ``characterized by secrecy and often being irresponsibly  arbitrary and oppressive.''   Sadly, my Democratic friends have turned this Chamber, the people's  Chamber, into the star chamber of the people.   One great example is the most important thing we can do as Members is  declare war. The next one is to impeach a President.   We are hoping Republicans can have every Member stand up and vote,  like for Speaker, and say their vote loudly.
