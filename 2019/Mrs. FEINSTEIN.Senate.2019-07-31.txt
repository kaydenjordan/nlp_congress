 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  introduction of the Protection from Robocalling Act of 2019. This bill  would address the problem of illegal robocalls and spam calls. I thank  Senators Klobuchar and Blumenthal for cosponsoring this legislation.   Last year, I introduced this legislation to address the nuisance of  illegal robocalling.   Since then, these calls have become even more prevalent. For example,  last month alone, an estimated 4.7 billion robocalls were placed in the  United States--nearly one billion more than the year prior. That  amounts to 153 million calls per day, or nearly 2,000 robocalls placed  each second. Some of these calls are organized scams.   In one case, one robocall company called people offering to help  lower their credit card interest rates. Instead, it tricked them into  giving up sensitive personal information, including their Social  Security numbers.   Another company dialed millions of phone numbers on the Do Not Call  registry trying to find new customers for a third-party service,  contacting a single number more than 1,000 times in the same year.  Robocall companies are also engaged in credit card and loan scams.   What's worse, robocalling is now endangering the health and safety of  Americans by tying up emergency service lines. Tufts Medical Center in  Boston received more than 4,500 illegal robocalls in the span of two  hours last April. Each time the medical staff had to answer one of  those robocalls could have been an instance when someone who needed  life-saving help was unable to get through to a medical professional.   One reason the problem is increasing is because the cost of making  and deploying these calls is decreasing. Advances in software make it  possible for one person to send out thousands of identical prerecorded  messages every second, more quickly and more cheaply than employing  scores of human telemarketing agents.   In addition, technology is making it even easier for illegal  robocallers to hide their true identity and location. Voice over  Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology enables robocallers to launch their  call campaigns from anywhere in the world. And new technology allows  illegal robocallers to disguise where they are actually calling from.  This technique, known as ``spoofing,'' tricks consumers into thinking  they are receiving a local call.   The Federal Trade Commission now receives nearly 10,000 robocall  complaints every day. With its broad consumer protection authority, the  Commission plays a critical role in stopping illegal robocalling. But  due to an historic exemption, the Commission has no enforcement  authority over telecoms.   When the FTC Act was enacted in 1914, this exemption was put in place  because telecoms were monopolies and subject to heavy regulation so FTC  enforcement was not needed. In the decades that followed, that  regulatory oversight was rolled back, while the exemption remained in  place. This created an uneven playing field. A set of federal rules and  regulations protecting consumers applied to most industries, but not  all.   We must give the Commission the authority they need to pursue  complete relief for American consumers. The Protection from Robocalling  Act of 2019 removes telecoms from the common carrier exemption in the  law. By eliminating this special exemption, telecoms will now have to  abide by the same consumer protection standards in areas such as  privacy and advertising that apply to other sectors already subject to  the FTC's jurisdiction.   It's a matter of fairness, as well as common sense. There's no reason  that consumer data held by a broadband service should have more  protection under the law than the same data held by their wireless  service.   Robocalls are a problem for everyone with a cell phone. It is a  problem that is only going to get worse. And we can't expect our law  enforcement agencies to keep up with today's technologies if their  hands are tied.   We need to be smarter about how we approach this problem. Going after  the robocallers and installing call blocking technology on phones is  fine; but we need to strike at the systems that they use to perpetrate  their scams if we want to see a real difference.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation that  will help consumers fight back against illegal robocalling.   I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 2360. A bill to establish an Office of Emerging Markets within the  Small Business Administration that will strengthen the development of  small business concerns in emerging markets, including those owned by  women, minorities, veterans, and those located in rural areas, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship.
