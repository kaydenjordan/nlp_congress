 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the CARES Act.   Yesterday, the United States became the country with the most known  COVID-19 cases in the world. We are all concerned for our families, for  our friends, for our farmers, for our futures.   But today, we have the opportunity to take a step forward to come  together, even as we must stand apart, to help our fellow Americans, to  strengthen our communities, and to face this threat as one.   Illinois workers are afraid they will lose their jobs, if they have  not already. Small businesses are making hard decisions between keeping  staff or closing their doors. And our farmers, who have already endured  so much pain, are worried sick about what is ahead this year, not only  because of this worldwide pandemic, but also because of the threats of  more flooding.   That is why I join my colleagues on the floor today to cast my vote  for the most significant relief package in American history. This vital  legislation will help struggling Americans make ends meet. It will  expand unemployment insurance to help those who lose their jobs through  no fault of their own.   It will help small businesses secure precious dollars to keep their  employees and communities afloat. It will help our farmers, who have  always stood with us, to provide much-needed resources to feed the  world.   This bill is not perfect. No bill ever is. But it is the strong  medicine we need to defeat this invisible enemy.   Let us come together today to pass this bill and declare that no  virus will ever tear apart this country.
