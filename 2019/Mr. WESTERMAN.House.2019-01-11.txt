 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding and for his hard work in putting together an appropriations  product of the House, which is a far cry from what this bill is. It is  not a product of the House. It is more like something you would get  from the bill of the month club. It has none of the House priorities  that have been debated here.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to think about the number 85. Eighty-five  people perished in the Camp fire last year in California. The blaze  destroyed an entire community, burned 14,000 homes, and left hundreds  of other Americans injured or homeless. Adding to that, the Camp fire  was just one of thousands of blazes that burned 9 million acres across  the country last year.   Let's face the facts. More and more Americans are living closer to  our Nation's forests. These forests are becoming sicker, drier, and  overstocked with flammable materials. When the temperatures rise and  the arid winds blow, we have seen firsthand how these unhealthy forests  become objects of mass destruction.   The U.S. Forest Service now estimates that there are at least 43  million homes in the wildland-urban interface. That is the part of our  country where forests and communities intersect. This is a major  increase from the 31 million homes that were located there less than 20  years ago.   Meanwhile, millions of acres of public land are at a high or severe  risk of wildfire. Like Paradise, California, some of these acres  directly threaten the communities and the Americans who live nearby.   Mr. Speaker, the notion that Congress would lower the level of  hazardous fuels reduction in the wake of all this is outrageous. At a  base level, the government must protect its citizens, and hazardous  fuels reduction is designed to remove the tinder that fuels these  deadly blazes. However, this version of the Interior appropriations  bill drops $21 million out of the hazardous fuels reduction account.   Mr. Speaker, we should be investing more on hazardous fuels reduction  and sound forest management, not less. Forest management is the  essential component in protecting Americans who live next to our  Nation's forests,  [[Page H495]]  again, forests that are getting drier and deadlier with each passing  year.   Further hazardous fuels reduction leads to all sorts of environmental  and economic benefits. In addition to protecting American lives, proper  forest management leads to cleaner water, more rural jobs, and less  carbon in the atmosphere.                                time  1030    I am all for fiscal soundness, but, Mr. Speaker, cutting the  hazardous fuels money is illogical. It is like saying we prefer a pound  of cure over an ounce of prevention. While we may save money up front,  the American people are going to have to pay more over the long term as  taxpayers foot the bill to put out these blazes and property owners  have their homes and assets incinerated.   In closing, we should be investing in protecting lives and property  and being good stewards of our environment. Lowering the hazardous  reduction fuels account accomplishes the exact opposite, failing the  thousands of Americans who live in and around our forests.
