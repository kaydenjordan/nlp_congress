 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment is simple and  straightforward. My amendment simply requires notification to parents  if their child's school operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic  programs or activities to permit a person whose biological sex is male  to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated  for biological females.   Madam Chair, women's sports are under attack. Woke policies backed by  far-left extremists who demand male participation in female sports are  completely delusional and contradict  [[Page H1377]]  science. This allows men who identify as women to undermine legitimate  women's accomplishments. American women and girls deserve to compete  against biological women in sports, opportunities for athletic  scholarships, and their rightful places on the winner's podium without  the fear of being sidelined and beat out by a biological male.   This was on complete display when William Thomas, a biological man  who previously competed in men's swimming, stole Emma Weyant's first- place trophy at the 2022 NCAA Division I Women's 500-Yard Freestyle  Final.                                time  1645    As a competitor in men's swimming from 2018 through 2019, Mr. Thomas  ranked 554th in the 200-yard freestyle and 65th in the 500-yard  freestyle. After deciding to compete against women, this mediocre male  athlete, Mr. Thomas, ranked fifth in the 200-yard freestyle and won the  500-yard freestyle.   Mr. Thomas stole Emma's championship trophy and took former Olympic  swimmer Reka Gyorgy's spot in the 2022 NCAA Division I swim meet.   Last Congress, I led a couple of dozen Members in introducing a  resolution honoring Emma Weyant as the rightful winner of the 2022 NCAA  Division I women's 500-yard freestyle race.   I am also a cosponsor of Representative Steube's bill, H.R. 734, the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023.   Madam Chair, I refuse to allow our children and grandchildren to be  groomed by big corporations, schools, and politicians and to think it  is okay for men to compete in women's sports.   Again, my amendment simply requires notification to parents if their  child's school allows males to participate in female-designated sports.  I hope that we could all come to agree that parents have the right to  know this before it occurs.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, we have so many people who see the idiocy in men  pretending to be women and stealing opportunities from females. These  girls practice their whole lives and sacrifice their bodies with  strains and other injuries in sports at times only to be outpaced by a  biological male. I think it is very common sense for parents to simply  be notified that this is taking place.   There is Federal funding going to our public schools. If we are going  to see this extremism take place in our public schools, I believe we  have some sort of nexus with that to at least say parents have a right  to know what is going on and that it is not being taken from them.   Other than this very simple, commonsense amendment, I am more in  favor of abolishing the Federal Department of Education and getting the  Federal Government completely out of public schools, but we are not  there right now. We do fund public schools, and there is a mess going  on there. Our children are hurting and suffering because of it.   Madam Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to support this simple,  commonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in favor of my amendment, which  will require schools to notify parents if they allow biological males  to use restrooms or changing rooms designated for biological females.   Throughout our debate today, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have continued to mischaracterize this bill as extreme. They harp  on the same talking points, saying that this bill is looking to ban  books, censor curriculums, and punish teachers. I would like any  child's pornographic books to be banned, but that is not exactly what  we are talking about here in this amendment.   All the while, under Democrat control, we have seen public K-12  schools promote: critical race theory, teaching our children to hate  their country and to hate their fellow classmates simply because of the  color of their skin; radical gender ideology; and even drag shows to  impressionable young children. That is what is extreme.   A school in my home State of Colorado has even changed a child's  gender pronouns and preferred names and kept that information from the  child's parents.   Speaking as the mother of four boys and a soon-to-be grandma, enough  is enough. I don't send my boys to school to receive indoctrination  from the woke mob or be sexualized by groomers. If they are, I sure as  heck want to know about it and have the right to speak up, and so do  these parents.   Let me set the record straight. House Republicans want parents to be  involved in their child's education. We want to take control back as  parents of our children's education rather than leaving it to partisan  politicians or unelected bureaucrats. We don't want to send the FBI  after them as domestic terrorists.   We want to foster an active learning environment, not shut schools  down and enforce outdated and unnecessary mask and vaccine mandates on  our children. We want children to feel safe at school and not pave the  way for school administrative staff to hide a sexual assault from  parents, like we saw in Loudoun County.   Less than 2 years ago, about 30 miles from here, a ninth-grade girl  was sexually assaulted by a man wearing a skirt in the women's restroom  at school. This male was allowed to follow the victim into the restroom  because of Loudoun County Public Schools' inclusive transgender  bathroom policies.   When the father of the victim came to a school board meeting to  protest these policies that caused his teenage daughter to be raped, he  was arrested after an altercation with a woman who  [[Page H1378]]  said that she didn't believe his daughter was raped. The superintendent  also defended the school's transgender bathroom policy at that meeting.   The man in the skirt was found guilty of two counts of forcible  sodomy, a count of anal sodomy, and a count of forcible fellatio. He  was also charged with the sexual assault of another student that  occurred months later at a different Loudoun County school.   The left's ideology is far more delusional, and it is dangerous.  These inclusive policies have paved the way for sexual predators to use  the left's definition of gender to take advantage of their victims.  Unfortunately, this is just one example of many biological males using  bathrooms to assault women and children.   Madam Chair, my amendment would grant parents the right to know if  schools that their children are attending are forcing their children to  share vulnerable spaces with potential predators.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
