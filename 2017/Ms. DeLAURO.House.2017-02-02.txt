 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.   What does this rule do? It enables the repeal of protections for  American workers. These are regulations that ensure that Federal  contractors must disclose labor violations across 14 basic labor laws.                                time  1245    Our Federal contractors employ approximately 28 million workers, and  while the vast majority of contractors are in compliance,  unfortunately, every year American workers are denied their overtime  wages, they are discriminated against for their gender, or their age,  or had their health and their safety put at risk.   Why is this Republican majority working so hard to ensure that  billions of taxpayer dollars continue to go to contractors that cheat  their workers? This executive order targets those bad actors and the  most egregious cases.   The intention of the executive order was to encourage compliance with  the law and level the playing field for contractors who are playing by  the rules. If there are no violations, bidders simply check a box.   What should we be doing here in this body? We should be increasing  worker protections, not demeaning them or decreasing them. The more  than one in five Americans who would be affected should be protected by  our labor laws.
