 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able  to finish my remarks before the vote.    On September 23, 2021, November 30, 2021, and again on  February 15, 2022, I spoke on this floor about the fake Russia Alfa- Bank narrative. That narrative started in 2016. It took on a new life  when Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann met with FBI General  Counsel James Baker.   In that meeting, Sussmann provided information and data files that  allegedly contained evidence of a secret communication channel between  the Trump organization and a Russian bank, Alfa-Bank. The evidence was  fabricated by the Clinton campaign. The allegations about the Trump  organization being linked with a Russian bank were false. Of note,  Sussmann also provided Baker information Fusion GPS gave him as part of  their work for the Clinton campaign. This was an all-hands-on-deck  strategy to destroy the Trump Presidency and the campaign.   With the ongoing Sussmann trial now underway here in DC, the false  Alfa-Bank narrative is more relevant now than ever before. I want to  tell you why.   A mere several days after the meeting with James Baker, the FBI  opened a full investigation on September 23, 2016. Around that time, an  FBI agent working on cyber matters reviewed the information provided by  Sussmann. That agent said:         We did not agree with the conclusion . . . that this       represented a secret communication channel.    He also stated that ``whoever had written that paper had jumped to  some conclusions that were not supported by the data'' and that ``the  methodology they chose was questionable to me.''   Here is the kicker:         I did not feel that they were objective in the conclusions       that they came to. The assumption that you would have to make       was so far-reaching that it just didn't make sense.    So last Friday, in a courtroom, Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's  campaign manager, testified that Hillary Clinton was asked about the  plan to share this fake information with the media. Hillary Clinton  approved that plan. Jake Sullivan was involved in that decision as  well. He is, of course, as we know, President Biden's National Security  Advisor.   The Clinton campaign fabricated evidence trying to connect Trump to  Russia. They fed it to the media to start a yearslong wildfire of false  allegations. They fed it to the FBI to trigger a Federal investigation  into their opposing candidate.   I said it before and will say it again: The Clinton campaign was the  conspiracy, and it was a big bag of dirty tricks.   This false Alfa-Bank information eventually landed with the media  outlet Slate, which ran an article on October 31, 2016. After that  article, Sullivan, the now National Security Advisor, issued his now- infamous tweet: ``This could be the most direct link yet between Donald  Trump and Moscow.'' Hillary Clinton also tweeted: ``Computer scientists  have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump  Organization to a Russian-based bank.''   Now, they weren't the only ones pleased with this fake news. On  October 13, 2020, Senator Johnson and I wrote a letter to the FBI where  we made public texts between Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page.   Page says to McCabe:         And the Alfa-Bank story is in Slate.    McCabe's reply:         Awesome.    The FBI's excitement didn't end there. This week, Durham's  prosecutors introduced a message between FBI agents that said:         People on the 7th floor to include Director are fired up       about this server.    Now, they--meaning the FBI seventh floor people--were ``fired up''  about fake information, which is just terrible. The FBI's job is really  to get fired up about fake information? It is more than that, however;  it is a gut-wrenching attack on our system of government.   Now, there is another data point that I want to share. Durham  recently released notes from a March 6, 2017, meeting between the  Justice Department and FBI officials. In that meeting, they discussed  predication and Crossfire Hurricane issues. This meeting was 2 weeks  before then-Director Comey publicly announced his investigation into  Trump.   On that very day, March 6, 2017, I wrote a letter to Comey asking  questions about the Steele dossier. My press release for that letter is  titled ``FBI plan to pay ex-spy for Trump intel during campaign sparks  questions of Obama administration's use of federal authorities for  political gain.'' That was from March 6, 2017. Now, in May of 2022,  that title just about sums up Crossfire Hurricane as best as it can be  described.   Now, in closing, I would like to make a few notes with respect to  predication.  [[Page S2648]]    The September 23, 2016, FBI electronic communication opened a full  investigation into the Alfa-Bank allegations, but let's unpack the  first few lines from that document.         The FBI received a referral of information from the US       Department of Justice.        The Department of Justice provided the FBI with a white       paper that was produced by an anonymous third party.    Well, the information didn't come from the Department of Justice; it  came from Sussmann and the Clinton campaign--hardly an anonymous third  party since Sussmann himself showed up at the door. By wording it this  way, the document almost blesses this so-called white paper. Mind you,  the white paper is the false Alfa-Bank information. By the looks of it,  this FBI document contains false information.    I fear these recent developments are just the tip of the iceberg. The  FBI's exposure to false information and actually using that false  information for investigative purposes wreaks of a political vendetta.  It points to a ``get Trump at all costs'' attitude.   Whether Sussmann is convicted or not, the evidence introduced by  Durham shows serious government misconduct--misconduct by the Federal  Government of the United States of America. Special Counsel Durham  can't let government misconduct go unpunished.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
