 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart, as the  city of Kennewick and the greater Tri-Cities community mourns the loss  of Councilman and former Mayor Steve Young.   Steve held the distinction as the second longest-serving mayor in the  long history of the city of Kennewick, serving the people for nearly a  decade in that role. But his service went far beyond those years.   Outside of his continued service as a councilman, Steve's footprint  stretched far and wide, across not only the city of Kennewick and the  Tri-Cities but the entire State of Washington.   His vision, his advocacy, and his passion for serving the community  will continue on through the many contributions he provided for the  Tri-Cities.   The long list of community organizations, nonprofits, and local and  State boards on which Steve served rightly demonstrate just how  passionate he was about serving his community.   My deepest condolences go out to Steve's wife, Anita. My thoughts and  prayers go out to her and the entire Young family.   May my friend rest in peace. We will miss him.                            ____________________
