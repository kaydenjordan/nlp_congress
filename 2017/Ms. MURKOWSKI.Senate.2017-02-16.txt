 Mr. President, I wish to recognize the  accomplishments of an exceptional Alaskan, Brig. Gen. Timothy J.  Cathcart, U.S. Air Force, currently serving as director, Office of  Legislative Liaison, National Guard Bureau. He will retire on May 31,  2017, after more than 32 years of honorable service. A master  navigator, Brigadier General Cathcart has executed more than 75  operational rescue missions, has over 2,000 flight hours, and has  served in a variety of operational, training, command, Air Staff, and  joint positions.   Brigadier General Cathcart enlisted in the Alaska Air National Guard  in 1985 and received his commission in 1990 through the Academy of  Military Science. Upon completion of navigator training in 1992, he  returned to the Alaska Air National Guard as a rescue navigator on the  HC-130 aircraft and then served as senior controller at the Alaska  Rescue Coordination Center. While serving, Brigadier General Cathcart  earned a master of business administration and a master of science in  computer science from the University of Alaska. In 2000, he was  selected as the mobility forces action officer in the Air and Space  Operations Directorate at the National Guard Bureau. After 2 years,  Brigadier General Cathcart was promoted to mobility forces branch chief  and later went on to serve as the operations support branch chief.   In 2005, Brigadier General Cathcart was selected to attend the  Industrial College of the Armed Forces, National Defense University,  earning a master of science in National Resource Strategy. Following  graduation, he served at the Pentagon as the National Guard readiness  adviser, Operations Directorate, Joint Staff, while concurrently  earning a doctor of philosophy, Ph.D., in Science and Technology  Studies from Virginia Tech. From 2008 to 2011, Brigadier General  Cathcart served as chief, Joint Training and Education Division, Joint  Doctrine, Training, and Force Development Directorate, followed by a  position as deputy director for Force Development, Domestic Operations  and Force Development Directorate on the National Guard Bureau Joint  Staff. From 2011 to 2014, he served as commander of the I.G. Brown  Training and Education Center at McGee Tyson ANGB, TN, followed by the  General Officer Homeland Security Executive Seminar at the Kennedy  School of Government at Harvard University.   Prior to his current position as director of legislative liaison,  Brigadier General Cathcart was a special assistant to the director, Air  National Guard, assigned to the Air Staff's total force-continuum  office. In this role, on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force and  Chief of Staff of the Air Force, he worked to identify the appropriate  balance of active and reserve components across missions and platforms  and helped reduce legal, organizational, policy, and cultural barriers  to a more fully integrated Air Force.   As director, Office of Legislative Liaison, Brigadier General  Cathcart is the primary adviser to the chief, National Guard Bureau, on  all matters of congressional interest and provides guidance and  direction in the development of the National Guard Bureau legislative  strategy. He ceaselessly and effectively supported all Air and Army  National Guard roles and missions both State and Federal. Brigadier  General Cathcart's efforts advanced an unprecedented level of  integration and collaboration within the Department of Defense, as well  as with State, interagency, and non-Federal entity partners. He  educated and informed decisionmakers within the executive as well as  legislative branches of U.S. Government to support National Guard  priorities, personnel, and resource requirements, resulting in support  and funding for core programs in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017  legislation.   Brigadier General Cathcart's extraordinary career of visionary  leadership and highly successful implementation of innovative cutting- edge concepts leaves behind a remarkable legacy of success. His years  of dedicated service in the U.S. Air Force and the National Guard  represent lifelong dedication and commitment to the defense of our  great Nation.   I wish to express my gratitude to Brig. Gen. Timothy J. Cathcart for  his many years of distinguished service to this country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, when I am home in Anchorage this  weekend, I plan to attend the grand opening of Roscoe's Food for the  Soul Restaurant at the Aviator Hotel. Last December, the Alaska  Dispatch News noted that the name Roscoe's has been synonymous in  Anchorage with soul food for decades. The original Roscoe's was a  father and son enterprise. Roscoe Wyche, Jr., opened the restaurant on  Government Hill with his son Roscoe Wyche III in 1988. Roscoe's Food  for the Soul continues the family tradition. It is a partnership of  Roscoe Wyche III, now 56, and his son, Roscoe Wyche IV, who goes by the  moniker ``Roc.'' Roscoe III told the Alaska Dispatch News that he was  passing the torch just like his dad did--a very sweet story.   But this weekend's opening will be a tad bittersweet. The matriarch  of the  [[Page S1302]]  family, Annie Carroll Wyche, Roscoe's mother and Roc's grandmother,  passed away on January 18, 2017. Ms. Carol, as she was known, was an  entrepreneur in her own right. A native of Thomasville, GA, Ms. Carol  came to Anchorage with her late husband, Roscoe Wyche, Jr., who served  in the Air Force. Shortly after his retirement, they formed two beauty  businesses. Top of the Hill Beauty Salon and Top of the Line Beauty  Supply. That was Ms. Carol's domain. Ms. Carol was also a partner in  her husband's restaurants. Ms. Carol is remembered for a beautiful  spirit, which showed in her smile. She leaves behind a large family.  There is no doubt that her entrepreneurial spirit lives on in Roscoe's  Food for the Soul.                            ____________________
