 Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition to  the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This blatant attempt to  ban later abortion undermines decades of legal precedent and directly  challenges the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. The Supreme  Court made clear that women in this country have a constitutional right  to autonomy over their individual health and well-being. If passed,  this bill would impose burdensome and medically unnecessary limitations  on women, particularly those in low-income, medically underserved  areas.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 99  percent of abortions are performed before 21 weeks of pregnancy. Many  of the abortions that are performed after 20 weeks are medically  necessary because the mother's health is at risk or because of a fetal  anomaly. This bill has no exception to protect a woman's health and no  exception for cases where there is a fetal anomaly.   This bill harms women who are victims of sexual assault and minors  who are the victims of incest. It requires rape victims to provide  written proof that the victim obtained counseling or medical treatment  from a specified list of locations, and it requires the minor to  provide written proof that she reported the crime to law enforcement or  a government agency.   These provisions are designed to perpetuate a culture of not  believing women and trying to discredit the victims of sexual assault.   To make matters even worse, this bill punishes doctors by threatening  them with 5 years of jail time for violating the ban. This bill, if  passed, will take women back to the days of back-alley abortions, where  doctors were in fear of providing lifesaving, medically necessary  procedures to women and where women were forced to take drastic and  dangerous measures in order to have the procedure performed.   Many of my Republican colleagues talk about keeping Big Government  out of people's lives, but when it comes to one of the hardest and most  intimate decisions a woman can make--a decision that she wishes to make  between herself, her family, and her doctor--these same colleagues  believe that the government, and not the woman, knows better. They  believe that the government, and not the woman, should dictate what a  woman should do with her body. They believe that the government should  have the power to force a woman to forgo a medically necessary  procedure. They believe that a woman should be stripped of that power,  stripped of the choice of what is best for herself.   Empowering women is one of the most important things we can do for  the future of our country. Core to women's constitutional liberties is  autonomy over their own health and well-being. In order to truly  support women, we need to safeguard and improve, not limit, access to  comprehensive healthcare, including abortion.   For all of these reasons, I will be opposing S. 2311.    Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's  attention to the bipartisan Preserving Teacher Loan Forgiveness for  Military Spouses Act of 2018, which I am introducing with the Senior  Senator from Texas today. This legislation eliminates a barrier for  teachers in military families to earn Federal student loan forgiveness  for their years of public service.   The Department of Education's Teacher Loan Forgiveness program  incentivizes teachers to commit to students in our lowest income school  districts in exchange for up to $17,500 in Federal Student loan  forgiveness. Teachers qualify for the program once they have taught  full-time for at least 5 consecutive years at a low income school or  educational service agency. Teachers who are forced to move in the  middle of the school year to follow their spouse lose eligibility for  the program and must restart their 5 years of service under current  law.   Last summer, a Maryland constituent brought to my attention the  barriers her daughter faced when seeking Federal student loan  forgiveness despite her commitment to public service. Her daughter, a  teacher married to a member of the military, was in the middle of her  fifth consecutive year teaching at one of Maryland's lower income  schools. As any military spouse knows, relocation or reassignment  orders can come at any time, upending the lives of the service member  and their family. Rather than being able to complete a 5th year of  teaching in a Maryland school, this family had to relocate with 3  months left in the school year. Despite this family's double commitment  to service for our military and our schoolchildren, this military  spouse missed the opportunity to have a portion of her Federal student  loans  [[Page S551]]  forgiven. No military spouse should be punished for following his or  her spouse's relocation or reassignment.   The legislation that the Senior Senator from Texas and I have  introduced is a common sense proposal to allow military spouses to earn  the benefits that they have dutifully worked towards and continue to  incentivize individuals to teach our hardest to educate children. Our  legislation provides a waiver from the Department of Education's  Teacher Loan Forgiveness program's 5 consecutive years of service  requirement for qualified military spouses if their spouse is relocated  during the school year pursuant to military orders from the Armed  Forces. This waiver will allow individuals to remain eligible for the  Teacher Loan Forgiveness program should they resume teaching full-time  at a qualifying low-income school district within one year of their  relocation. In addition, this legislation requires the Department of  Education to provide a report to Congress every two years on the number  of military spouses who remained eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness  due to this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to help families who are  wholly committed to public service by supporting the Preserving Teacher  Loan Forgiveness for Military Spouses Act. No family in service of our  Nation should lose out on earned benefits due to a technicality.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2351           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
