 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Dr. Jonathan L. Bingham for his service in  providing quality dermatologic surgery care to the folks in Great Falls  and his military service in the Montana Air National Guard.   Dr. Bingham graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. Following the  Naval Academy, he went on to medical school at Pennsylvania State  University and the Air War College. Dr. Bingham then served with  distinction as a flight surgeon and Mohs Surgeon-Dermatologist in the  U.S. Navy.   Throughout the course of his career, he has served his country and  his fellow citizens with great honor. During his time in the Navy, he  deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as a flight surgeon, and  he also served as faculty dermatologist and Mohs Surgeon at the  National Naval Medical Center and the Walter Reed National Military  Medical Center to support the White House Medical Unit and the Office  of the Attending Physician.   In Great Falls, Dr. Bingham is one of the leading experts on  dermatologic care. Despite his successful career as a civilian and  servicemember, Dr. Bingham continues his service to our country in the  Air National Guard.   Dr. Bingham is an inspiration to any young Montanans seeking to live  out a life in service to his or her country. I congratulate Dr. Bingham  for his exemplary record of excellence, and I thank him for his  continued service to the people of Montana and our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize and  congratulate Clara Harmon from Helena for winning the 2019 Treasure  State Spelling Bee. Clara is an exceptional young woman who attends  school through the Helena Area Christian Home Educators.   Clara endured 19 rounds of tough competition which amounted to 3 1/2  hours before she was crowned the victor. Clara is a shining example of  the best and the brightest Montana has to offer. This May, Clara will  be travelling to National Harbor, MD, to represent Montana at the  Scripps National Spelling Bee. I also want to thank Clara's parents,  Charles and Dianna Harmon for raising such a talented and passionate  daughter.   All of Montana will be rooting for Clara as she represents us on the  national stage in May.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Phillip South of Sheridan, MT, for his 100 years of  determination, bravery, and service.   At 100, Philip South has lived through 18 presidents, two World Wars,  the Great Depression, and was born when there were only 48 States in  the United States. Mr. South served his country heroically in World War  II as a rifleman and scout in the U.S. Marine Corps with the renowned  First Marine Division.   In the Guadalcanal, Phillips survived sniper fire and his small  regiment of rifleman and scouts found themselves in the heart of the  battle for Henderson Field. He held a position not too far from Medal  of Honor recipient John Basilone, to hold the line against an onslaught  of Japanese troops. Despite being outnumbered, his small group  prevailed.   I would like to thank Mr. South for his service to our Nation. He is  an inspiration to all young Montanans wishing to serve their  country.                            ____________________
