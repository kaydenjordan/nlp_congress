 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Karen O'Neil  and to thank her for her service as director of the Green Bank  Observatory for the past 15 years.   Dr. O'Neil received her Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in  physics, with a specialty in astrophysics. In addition to her work at  Green Bank, she has worked as a professor of physics at the University  of Oregon. She was also a staff astronomer at the National Ionosphere  and Astronomy Center's Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, PR, where she  worked on the commissioning and testing of a wide variety of  instruments and software for the 300m telescope. I am proud to join all  of West Virginia in thanking Dr. Karen O'Neil for bringing her vast  expertise to the Mountain State.   For more than 60 years, the National Science Foundation, Pocahontas  County, and the State of West Virginia have supported the ability of  innumerable national and international scientists to make discoveries  about our universe using the capabilities located at the observatory  within the National Quiet Zone. Scientists at the Green Bank  Observatory have made significant discoveries that have helped us  better understand our universe. Among the many achievements during Dr.  O'Neil's tenure, researchers helped discover a massive star that  strains the limits of physics, a discovery that wouldn't have been  possible without the research made possible at Green Bank. It is a  testament to the tremendous amount of research and data the observatory  provides to the global scientific community.   For the past several years, I have been committed to ensuring Green  Bank stays open for the next generation of young West Virginia  scientists. Dr. Karen O'Neil has been a tremendous part of this effort.  Not long ago, we were fighting to keep the observatory open, and thanks  to Dr. O'Neil's efforts, we are now discussing Green Bank's integral  role in the next generation of astrophysics. Once again, I am truly  grateful for her service as director. Fortunately, she is not going  far, and will continue to be a vital part of the continued growth of  the observatory. I am also proud to join her in welcoming the incoming  Green Bank Director, Dr. James M. Jackson, who recognizes the  observatory's role as an essential facility in the Nation's  astrophysics portfolio, and I know he will continue this legacy of  excellence.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of college football coaching legend and my very good longtime  friend, Bobby Bowden.   Gayle and I offer our deepest condolences to the members of the  Bowden family, as well as to the entire extended Bulldogs,  Mountaineers, and Seminoles families. We have lost a shining star in  the college athletics community, but everything he stood for and  represented lives on in the hearts and minds of all who had the  privilege of knowing him, myself included.   I will never forget the first time I met Bobby. It was 1966, and he  and Ann pulled up in a station wagon with six kids in the back. He made  an impression, to say the least. I have never met a more humble and  kind person, and he was always such a positive influence in my life and  the lives of all the players he coached. Bobby was also a deeply  devoted man of faith. It didn't matter what your faith was, as long as  you believed in something greater than yourself.   He holds a special place in the hearts of West Virginians in  particular because of his tribute to the Marshall University team who  perished in a plane crash in 1970. Our entire statewide community felt  this loss. Friendly rivalries were set aside, and Bobby, who was head  coach, led the way to tell the Nation ``We are Marshall.'' West  Virginia University players wore Marshall's initials on their helmets,  and the next season, Bobby gave Marshall's new coaches access to film  and gamebooks to help them rebuild their program. His selflessness  toward Marshall during that devastating time has been cherished in the  decades that have followed. He was really something special.   Bobby had a gift for teaching the game and motivating you to be the  best you could be in all aspects of your life. And it wasn't all for  the athletes; he treated everyone the very same. No one was more  important than anyone else. It didn't matter who your family was or  where you came from, what mattered is what you made of yourself with  the circumstances the Lord gave  [[Page S6454]]  you. He earned the legacy we know him for and expected no less from  anyone else.   With 377 wins and two national titles during his 40 years as a major  college coach, he was the winningest coach in Division One history. But  when the game was over, no matter the score, Bobby showed us the man he  has always been--a leader, a fierce competitor, and despite his  humility, a man completely deserving of the prestige his legacy brought  to himself and to the teams he coached.   Good coaches certainly win games, but great coaches, like Bobby, have  a profound impact on your life. They are models for how to handle  perseverance, leadership, success, and failure and how to take what you  learn from athletics and utilize it to build the rest of your life. He  knew sports can make you into so much more than a good athlete if you  have the right attitude, and I know there are many former student- athletes who have Coach Bowden to thank in great part for their  success. I had the honor of knowing him not only as one of the greatest  coaches but also as a true friend and a man I have the greatest respect  for.   The relationships he forged with the players, his colleagues, and the  communities he called home had a profound impact, bringing both  national attention and respect to the teams he coached. If he lost a  game, he was the first to go congratulate his opponent. Put simply,  even though he wasn't born in the Mountain State, he represented the  very best of West Virginia, which is saying quite a lot.   Again, I extend my condolences to his loving wife Ann; their  children, Terry, Tommy, Jeff, Steve, Robyn, and Ginger; and their many  grandchildren. May God Bless you and your family, my dear  friend.                            ____________________
