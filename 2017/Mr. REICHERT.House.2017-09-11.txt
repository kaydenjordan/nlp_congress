 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Ways and Means and the Committee on the Budget be discharged from  further consideration of the bill (H.R. 3732) to amend section 1113 of  the Social Security Act to provide authority for increased fiscal year  2017 and 2018 payments for temporary assistance to United States  citizens returned from foreign countries, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 26 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, September 12, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
