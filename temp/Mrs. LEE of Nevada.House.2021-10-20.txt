 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the water in Lake  Mead has fallen to record-breaking lows not seen since the Hoover Dam  was constructed.   Already, Lake Mead has fallen to just 35 percent of its capacity. And  as you can see behind me, a bathtub ring taller than the Statue of  Liberty surrounds the lake as a reminder of the water that was once  there.   This is a crisis that we can fix only with new investment and  innovative solutions, and that is why I am supporting the bipartisan  infrastructure package and the climate and water investment provisions  of the Build Back Better Act. It could not be more clear. Nevada is  ground zero for the effects of climate change, but we also are ground  zero for the benefits of this historic legislation.   The bipartisan infrastructure package includes more than $8 billion  for water infrastructure. This also includes my water recycling  legislation that will invest in large-scale water recycling projects to  help keep more water in Lake Mead for Nevadans.   There is not a moment to lose.   The opportunity is here and the time to act on climate and act for  Nevada's water and future is now.                            ____________________
