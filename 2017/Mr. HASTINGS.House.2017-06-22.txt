 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for yielding to me  the customary 30 minutes for debate.   This measure is a bipartisan bill that will help Americans receiving  support from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families find good- paying jobs.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are more than 6  million job openings in our country. That is the highest level recorded  since we started tracking this data, yet the share of Americans  participating in the workforce is at a four-decade low. Clearly, there  are underlying issues  [[Page H5060]]  that need to be addressed to get more people plugged into the  workforce.   For people looking for jobs, TANF serves as a lifeline. TANF is  administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and is  designed to help in-need families achieve self-sufficiency. Under the  program, States receive block grants to design and operate their own  programs to fulfill the goals of the TANF program.   It is important to note that States are at risk of financial penalty  if TANF participants receive more than a year of education or if States  have more than 30 percent of the State TANF caseload in education and  training programs. Due to these limits, States have largely abandoned  efforts to promote or support work in their TANF programs. This is  important to understand because one of the most effective ways to get  more people employed is through employer-driven on-the-job training.   Research has shown that, properly structured, these programs result  in better and more stable employment, especially for individuals who  are otherwise unlikely to find work.   Although the measure we are debating today does not address this  issue, this bill will help tip the scale back toward job-training  programs. H.R. 2842 establishes demonstration projects that combine  work, training, and support for hard-to-employ TANF recipients.   This bill provides a onetime appropriation of $100 million to  subsidize these programs. After the 12-month period, States are going  to be required to report to Congress on the effectiveness of  subsidizing wages in moving individuals receiving TANF into full-time  jobs.   Since we are talking about jobs, we need to recognize that we as an  institution have not provided the necessary resources to get people  back to work. If you were to ask any Member of this body to outline his  or her top priorities, I guarantee you that job creation would be  mentioned every single time. We all agree on the need, but from there,  the conversation stops. There are lots of proposals in Congress to  create jobs, but we have been unable to pass a large-scale, bipartisan  bill for quite some time. This really needs to change.    Given the legislation we are debating today, it is interesting to me  that President Donald John Trump's budget proposal cut workforce  training programs by 39 percent. Rather than present a jobs bill, he  has presented a plan that would actually stop helping people looking  for jobs. That, in my judgment, is penny-wise and pound-foolish. In  bringing forward this legislation, I think it is being made clear that  this body does not share that approach, but we need to do more than a  single, targeted bill.   Five months into the Trump administration, Republican leadership  still has not put forward a single large-scale piece of legislation to  create good-paying jobs or raise the wages of hardworking Americans,  but its leadership has rejected Democratic proposals out of hand.   We should be working every day on creating jobs and raising wages for  everyone everywhere in America. But instead of focusing on job  creation, Donald John Trump's budget request would destroy  approximately 1.4 million jobs.   His budget would eviscerate billions of dollars from critical job- creating investments in infrastructure and innovation, dismantle skills  training programs like the one we are discussing here today, ransack  education benefits, and leave our country in a weakened state. Instead  of bringing jobs back to communities that have fallen on hard times,  the budget walks away from them.   So, Mr. Speaker, I will leave it at this. The underlying measure we  are debating today is a good step forward. But one step is not nearly  enough. We need to do more, not less, to strengthen our communities and  help working families.   Just as I urge Donald John Trump to move past the campaign rhetoric  and get serious, I also urge this body to lead with more bipartisan  measures that will provide for necessary resources for those who need  them most.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is a distinguished member of the  Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   President Donald John Trump campaigned on the promise of job  creation; however, his budget paints a very different picture. It cuts  job training programs by 39 percent, and its radical spending cuts  would lead to massive job losses.   In this body, we talk a lot about jobs, but we are 6 months into this  Congress and have failed to pass any major job creation bills. While  the bipartisan legislation before us today is, indeed, as my good  friend points out, a step in the right direction, we can and we must do  more.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say that I have an amendment in my  hand that will generate thousands of American jobs. If we defeat the  previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to  bring up Representative DeFazio's bipartisan bill, H.R. 2510, the Water  Quality Protection and Job Creation Act. This bill will create  thousands of new American jobs through increased investment in our  Nation's wastewater infrastructure. Here is a chance to take today's  momentum a step further and consider Mr. DeFazio's bill in addition to  the bipartisan TANF bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my very good friend, the distinguished ranking  member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee who will  discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I first want to address my good friend about the previous question  and the fact that it has not gone through the process. I will just  remind him that the chatter in Washington today is about a healthcare  measure that hasn't gone through the process, at least to the extent  that most of us would all want.   I also have great respect for my good friend from Oklahoma, and I  know he will see and get a chance to talk with President Donald John  Trump. I am not likely to.                                time  1300    But I would ask him to tell him when he sees him for me that I came  here in 1993, and there were 14,000 bridges in need of repair in  America, and last year the statistics from the society that does that  analysis showed that there are 54,000 bridges in need of repair in this  country. The point that I wish to make is that we need a serious  substantial infrastructure measure.   Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about jobs in this Chamber. I was at a  forum on Saturday, and someone mentioned: My governor's mantra is  ``jobs, jobs, jobs.'' And that person said: Well, he must mean that you  have to have three jobs in order to get by.   I am glad that we are here today considering a bill that will help  Americans in search of work to find a good-paying position that will  help them support themselves and their families. We have a lot of  issues facing us, and this bipartisan legislation is just one tiny step  forward in the right direction. I hope this measure translates into  more bipartisan bills.   Too often, from healthcare reform, tax reform--footnote right there.  My friend mentions that we will likely see a tax reform measure  sometime soon. I hope that it doesn't revert to trickle down. We have  seen trickle down. It did not work, and I hope we don't do that again.   We have an opportunity on other issues, and in many respects the  majority has shut out the minority from the process, just like what has  happened until today, at least, in the other body with reference to  healthcare.   The bills we have debated and even passed are projected to eliminate  millions of jobs. Even as we talk about job creation, my friends across  the aisle too frequently turn around and champion measures that would  do just the opposite. There is so much room for cooperation in this  area, yet time and time again we are kept out of the process, and the  results speak for themselves. For the sake of our country, this needs  to change.   Even though this is a bipartisan bill, it also serves as an example  of what I mean. I was disappointed that my Republican colleagues in the  Rules Committee blocked yesterday six germane amendments to this bill.  It is a sympton of the closed process. When we prevent germane  amendments from even being debated by the House, it does us all a  disservice, yet my friends across the aisle do it again and again.   Mr. Speaker, I will close with this: President Obama is credited for  creating 11.3 million jobs in our country. The economy added jobs for  75 straight months, and very fortunately that carryover for the last 5  months has continued.   While President Donald John Trump makes untenable pledge after  pledge, I watched every word of his speech last night in Iowa, and all  I heard was platitudes. I didn't hear anything about substance. And it  seemed like a road test for some new ideas. He makes these untenable  pledges, including a very humble promise to be--and I quote him--``the  greatest jobs producer that God ever created.''   The record is clear, the Democratic Party is, has been, and will be  the party of job creation, and is ready to work with my Republican  colleagues to continue significant job creation in this country.   So I will ask my friends across the aisle, let us continue the trend  of the past few years and work together to produce bipartisan measures  that will benefit the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
