 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a true  public servant. We use that term frequently and often too casually, but  the individual I am speaking about unquestionably defines the term and  sets an example we should all strive to achieve.   Elizabeth Jean Beck Vuna has served as my district office casework  manager for 20 years. She has served the Congress and the American  people for over 33 years. Prior to serving my constituents, she worked  for Congressman Glenn Anderson and Congressman Stephen Horn from Long  Beach, California.   It is worth noting that the bitter partisan politics of today have  never touched Elizabeth's commitment to service. She has worked for  Democrats and Republicans without concern for political philosophy. It  is that dedication, that determination to help people, and that  diligence that truly makes her irreplaceable.   Elizabeth will be retiring on September 30. When she does, we will be  losing one of the most effective and compassionate caseworkers in the  history of the Congress. Yes, I know that sounds boastful, but it is  quite simply the truth.   Little did I know when I hired Elizabeth in 2002 what a profound  impact she would have on the lives of so many of my constituents and on  me.   Elizabeth began her career in public service because, when her  brother returned home from the Vietnam war, he could find no assistance  for his PTSD and Agent Orange-related illnesses. She decided it would  be her mission to ensure that other veterans would not face a similar  fate and often focused her efforts in helping veterans obtain the  benefits they so richly deserved.   She also felt an affinity for immigrants since she and her husband  adopted five orphaned children from Tonga. That experience led her to  become a local expert in international adoption.   Her compassion for all immigrants also led her to become a recognized  expert in the field, and she diligently advocated for all immigrants to  be afforded all the benefits legally available to them.   The number of constituents Elizabeth has helped in a substantive  manner are in the tens of thousands, and I am probably undercounting.   She has mentored other congressional staff and given guidance and  direction to everyone who was lucky enough to ask her to do so.   Not a week goes by that I do not hear from some of my constituents  about this miracle or feat that she accomplished on their behalf,  whether it is large or small.   As her retirement became known, my office received dozens of emails  thanking her for her service and asking if she couldn't stay just a  little longer.                                time  1015    She has assisted the many studios in my district as well as the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, but  perhaps  [[Page H5511]]  more importantly, she has helped individual constituents, who needed a  fierce champion for their cause, help navigate a bureaucracy that can  seem arcane and senseless at times.   Elizabeth is a native Californian, the daughter of Wilbert and Ellen  Beck.   Her large family is comprised of her husband, Steve; sons, Jesse and  Sean, who tragically prematurely passed away; adopted Tongan children,  Malia, Angela, Michelle, Joshua, and Jacob; and over a dozen  grandchildren.   She will be missed in our office and by our constituents beyond  measure, and I cannot thank her enough for her service.   I ask all Members to join me in thanking Elizabeth Jean Beck Vuna for  her unwavering dedication to public service and wish her good health  and prosperity in retirement.                            ____________________
