 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas (Mr.  McCaul) and my friend from New York (Mr. Engel) for their leadership on  this issue and the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: I did not support the failed Obama- Kerry policy in Syria. During 2017 and 2018, I was proud to see  President Trump hold Assad accountable for his use of chemical weapons.   However, I have not supported the United States disengaging from  Syria without a strategy since such was first proposed by the President  in December.   So I rise in disappointment today over this policy change and  Turkey's violations of all of its ``promises.''   A small group of American Forces in northeast Syria advising and  assisting local forces in order to prevent instability from coming to  power does not constitute an ``endless war.''  [[Page H8160]]    Despite being in NATO, Turkey is not acting as an ally. By our  actions in this House today, Turkey will pay a steep price for its  provocation.   I have been told by experts with contacts on the ground that American  lives are at risk directly because of Turkish actions. U.S. Forces have  been shelled by Turkish artillery. Our NATO ally since 1952, Turkey,  which we allowed to conduct this mission, has thanked us by shelling  American positions.   What a sad day for the Atlantic alliance that has shouldered so many  burdens and shared so much loss in men and treasure.   Syrian Kurds also announced that they had come to an agreement with  the Assad regime's forces to help against the Turkish invasion, which  further entrenches Russia, Mr. Speaker, in this conflict. So now Assad  and his Russian backers will bring their bloodbath over the Euphrates.   We also put all the gains we have made against Daesh at risk of  reversal.   This all could have been avoided. Mr. Speaker, when critical American  leadership disengages, America's global adversaries fill the void.   Turkey must cease its military invasion of Syria. The United States  must support the Kurdish communities that have been our allies against  ISIS. And the White House must present a clear and specific plan for  ensuring the defeat of ISIS and border integrity with Turkey.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly enjoyed my colleague's  dissertation there, much of which was a criticism of the Chief  Executive of our country, when many of the same comments she made could  be directed at this House and its investigation of the President--not  following the precedents set, not following the precedents set in the  Nixon impeachment or in the Clinton impeachment.   The Speaker has not had a vote of this House to commence an  impeachment inquiry. That is an open system. That is the transparency  my friend was talking about. That is the kind of accountability the  American people would like to see. That should be the policy of this  House. Sadly, it is not.   She talks about contacts with Russia by political campaigns. Many of  us look forward to the investigation by the Attorney General and by the  U.S. attorney in Connecticut on exactly that in the 2016 campaign and  how the opposition party, the Clinton campaign, was, in fact, the one  digging up activities about the Trump campaign.   So, anyway, I enjoyed that comment about Ukraine, the importance of  Ukraine, and the importance of democracy in Ukraine. But all throughout  that presentation, one had to endure a lot of supposition and fiction.   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk, not talk about Ukraine,  not talk about Syria, but talk about China and where we are in this  very important, critical bilateral negotiation between the United  States and the People's Republic of China to end China's mercantilistic  trade environment, their lack of openness, their failure to police the  terrible intellectual property theft that has gone on for over two  decades there that has hurt not only American businesses but those  elsewhere in Asia and also in Europe.   I commend the President for calling out the challenge that we have  had and faced in the West on how to obtain China as a better player for  trade. President Trump has worked for nearly 3 years now to change  China's outlook, to end its mercantilistic protectionism and join the  world trading system truly, not just on paper, Mr. Speaker, but, in  fact, completely, and be one with the developed world as it has grown  its economy so mightily over those two decades.   I commend the President's point men on this issue: Larry Kudlow at  the National Economic Council; Secretary Mnuchin, the Secretary of the  Treasury; and Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, who is his U.S. Trade  Representative who has the point on trying to work out something that  is a major change in that relationship between the U.S. and China, but  also China and the rest of the developed world.   At the heart of this trade dispute is the fact that we live in an  integrated global economy with deeply connected, multicontinental  supply chains. This integrated global economy is based on the  extraordinary foundation of the post-World War II reductions in trade  barriers, the expansion of the rule of law, and the extraordinary  success of the free-market capitalist system that has lifted so many  out of poverty around the world since World War II and enlivened the  capitalist spirit throughout the world.   Beginning slowly in the 1970s and 1980s, the People's Republic of  China was encouraged to open its domestic market, increase economic  freedom, better respect human rights and religious tolerance, and join  the global family of nations.   Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of  Germany, as that freedom breeze finally blew away the shroud of the  Iron Curtain, reform in China remained the next great touchstone of the  post-World War II agenda.    The 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square sidetracked this progress, but  China's integration into this world economy began in earnest in the  1990s. That is where this story gets complicated, and that is where the  concern of President Trump really begins.   European and American leaders who shared values of economic freedom,  religious tolerance, and common national security goals witnessed the  historic and extraordinary transition of post-war Japan and the Asian  Tigers, those countries of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South  Korea.   Over the decades, the Asian Tigers had been authoritarian, condemned  for their rampant theft of intellectual property and spurning of  democracy, so much so that, in 1976, when Jimmy Carter was elected  President of the United States, he campaigned on pulling American  troops out of South Korea, ending aid to South Korea and writing off  South Korea as a failed experiment, that it was going to be an  authoritarian dictatorship and never adapt to democracy, never stop  stealing intellectual property. Basically, write it off as a failure.                                time  1730    Fortunately, this initiative was shelved and, instead, we witnessed  Japan and the Asian Tigers expand their economies, really begin to open  their markets, fully embrace democracy and the rule of law, and join in  the world global progress.   Policymakers considered China to be next, and they believed that,  while a much larger country, under a much more authoritative communist  regime, the economic benefits of greater freedom and global  transparency would penetrate even the Middle Kingdom.   In 1996, in a column in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette offering  suggestions to the Clinton administration on how to have a more  directed China policy, I argued that China, too, must change. I said:  ``China, as a world power, for her part must recognize that bilateral  and multilateral treaties are to be enforced. Lack of compliance with  international treaty obligations must produce a known and delivered set  of sanctions by the world community. China must clearly understand the  consequences of noncompliance.''   So, Mr. Speaker, that is what I wrote back in 1996 as a private  citizen, former Bush administration official, thinking about what  needed to change in America and Chinese relations, China's multilateral  relations.   So, despite encouragement and best intentions, China has not changed,  Mr. Speaker, but, instead, has grown more  [[Page H8188]]  aggressive; hence, the challenge of one world, two systems is market- based capitalism versus state-controlled communism. They are not  compatible when it comes to this complex, integrated global capital  market I described.   In the 1990s, the epicenter of the fight was to reign in rampant  theft of intellectual property. At the time I uttered those words in  1996, the U.S. computer software industry, music CDs, and Hollywood  videos all were being ripped off by the People's Republic of China. In  1992, the Business Software Alliance testified before the U.S. Senate  that Chinese piracy was costing the U.S. an estimated $225 million in  software sales.   The reality is, despite efforts in 1992 at the end of the Bush 41  administration and vigorous efforts by President Clinton's negotiators  Charlene Barshefsky and Mickey Kantor, essentially nothing happened.  President Clinton threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on select  imports if Beijing didn't enforce Mr. Clinton's new 1995 intellectual  property rights deal.   So, what happened? Does this sound familiar? Is this not the exact  conversation we are having today in 2019?   What happened in 1995? Meeting after meeting was held, agreement  after agreement was signed, and still the piracy continued. And to my  point about the world delivering a known set of sanctions that China  must clearly understand the consequences of noncompliance, instead,  China was rewarded and admitted to the World Trade Organization, the  WTO, in December 2001.   Sadly, pirated goods have only increased. Recently, the Business  Software Alliance, the same folks I quoted back in 1992, now estimate  that 70 percent of PC software installed in China in 2015 was  unlicensed, and the U.S. trade representative estimates that  intellectual property theft costs between $225 billion and $600  billion, annually.   Thus, the world has not banded together and offered clear and known  sanctions for not following the global trade rules. In fact, global  trading partners have rewarded such behavior with the admission to the  WTO and continue to tolerate IP theft, closed domestic markets, and  dependency on frequently dominant Chinese supply chain participants.   This is why President Trump has elected to go forward with a more  aggressive, direct manner and deliver the message that lack of  compliance with international treaty obligations must produce a known  and delivered set of sanctions by the world community. However, the  President's success in this endeavor may well be diluted by the opening  up of trade disputes all over the world simultaneously, including  disputes with America's allies.   Specifically, I am talking about across-the-board unilateral steel  and aluminum tariffs, for example, or trying to renegotiate every trade  treaty that we have all at the same time, while we are trying to press  China.   Now, that is not to take anything away from the extraordinary work of  the President and Ambassador Lighthizer to update the North American  Free Trade Agreement with the new USMCA, updating the U.S.-South Korea  Free Trade Agreement, and initiating and completing an agricultural  agreement with Japan. But I have to say that doing all that at once and  not engaging our allies fully and publicly to be at our side impressing  China, I think, makes it more difficult, because, as I have traced over  the past 25 years the lack of success with China, the one thing that I  would argue that will make it different this time--always dangerous  words to utter--would be if we had the European Union, Japan, Malaysia,  Vietnam, the Philippines, South American countries all at our side as  we tried to get a concrete change in China's mercantilistic behavior.   In my view, the President would be more successful if he focused on  this Chinese challenge and rallied the world to a common purpose of  focusing China on that important point to clearly understand the  consequences of noncompliance. We have done many things in this country  that are improving that relationship and fighting, but we must have  full global support in order, I think and I believe, to ultimately  lever China into compliance.   Not successful in Bush 41, not successful with President Clinton, not  successful with President George W. Bush, little effort by President  Obama, so I admire President Trump for identifying this challenge that  benefits the whole world, not just the United States; but it is going  to take a sustained multiyear, multilateral effort to do that, and I  wish him well, and those of us in this House stand by him as he tries  to get a quality, substantive deal to bring China truly into  compliance.                          Congratulating Carl Carter     Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize some Arkansans  who have done extraordinary things in my home district in central  Arkansas.   I rise today to recognize Carl Carter for being awarded the 2019  Community Service Award by the Real Estate Educators of America for  exceptional spirit of service.   Carl is a second-year student attending the University of Arkansas  Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock. Carl credits his  strong community service to his mom, Beverly Carter, who lost her life  at the hands of two people posing as real estate clients.   Carl founded the Beverly Carter Foundation in her memory, an  organization dedicated to the cause of helping real estate agent  safety.   Through the Beverly Carter Foundation, Carl works to improve agent  safety through traveling and talking to escrow agents, lenders, agents,  and brokers all over the United States on how to avoid being the  victims of crime.   I know this is only the beginning for Carl, and I am excited to see  where his ambition and his kind heart take him, and I congratulate him  on this good work.                      Recognizing Searcy Fire Department     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Searcy Fire Department and the firefighters from Station 1 for going  above and beyond the call of duty.   Earlier this summer, firefighters responded to a call for a fire  alarm at a resident's home in Searcy, Arkansas. Fortunately, the  resident was not in immediate danger, but they did notice one issue:  The resident could not leave his home without assistance, as there was  not a wheelchair ramp.   The firefighters at Station 1 took it upon themselves to fix this  situation. They reached out to the community for help, including the  local Lowe's Home Improvement store. They got discounted supplies. The  Searcy Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary provided funding, and these  firefighters were able to build a ramp for this resident.   This is just a small example of how the Searcy Fire Department and  central Arkansas law enforcement officers go above and beyond the call  when keeping Arkansans safe. I thank them for their continued hard work  and service.                          Congratulating Ryan Davis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ryan  Davis for receiving the Arkansas Emergency Medical Technician  Association Air Medical Award of Excellence. This award honors those  who help the air medical industry continue to see growth.   Ryan grew up in Quitman, Arkansas, and is currently the fire chief  for this community. Ryan is a nationally registered emergency medical  technician and paramedic and is flight paramedic certified.   Ryan has served his community since 2003 and also works for Air Evac  Lifeteam 30 in Morrilton. Ryan has served on numerous State-level  boards and committees, including the American Heart Association, the  National Association of EMTs, and also the Arkansas Air Medical  Society, where he serves as president.   I would like to extend my congratulations to Ryan Davis for receiving  this prestigious award.                           Recognizing Jamie Cheney     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jamie Cheney  of Greenbrier, Arkansas, for her outstanding service to our community  and the State of Arkansas.   Jamie serves as a local medical technician and also as a volunteer  firefighter on her day off. She gained her EMT skills at the University  of Arkansas Community College at Morrilton, where she juggled school  while working at the Greenbrier Nursing and Rehab Center.   Jamie received the Phoenix Award while serving as an EMT in North  Little Rock. This award is bestowed onto  [[Page H8189]]  first responders who successfully revive a patient who has suffered  from cardiac arrest.   I am proud to have such a dedicated member of my district  volunteering and assisting those in need, and I join all Arkansans in  thanking Jamie Cheney for her selflessness and wish her continued  success.                        Recognizing Lindsay Henderson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate an emerging leader from the Conway Area Chamber of  Commerce, Lindsay Henderson.   Lindsay is a Bald Knob resident and serves as the chief revenue  officer for the Conway Area Chamber of Commerce. Lindsay was awarded  the Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives' 40 Under 40 award.   The 40 Under 40 award honors young professionals who have  demonstrated significant success in their career, as well as having  made noteworthy accomplishments in their community.   The Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives recognizes emerging  leaders from chambers across the country and honors 40 such chamber  professionals who exemplify creativity, dedication, and innovation in  their work towards their chamber's mission.   I congratulate Lindsay on achieving this 40 Under 40 award and wish  her continued success.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
