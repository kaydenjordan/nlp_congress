 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from Maine in  discussing the Retirement Security Act.   I first just want to start by thanking Senator Collins for her work  on this bipartisan bill, the other bill she discussed, and for her  leadership as chairman of the Aging Committee, to help ensure that  older Americans can thrive. That includes, of course, making it easier  to save for retirement.   By the time they reach retirement, every hard-working American should  have the peace of mind of knowing they can live comfortably and without  having to worry about how to make ends meet. While Social Security is a  critical safety net--one we have to protect for all--it was only  designed, as Senator Collins pointed out, as part of the retirement  equation.   It is clear we are on the verge of a retirement crisis, as more and  more Americans are retiring without the economic security they need.  According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  approximately 25 percent of working Americans have reported having no  retirement savings or pension. AARP estimates that 55 million  Americans--including roughly 230,000 Granite Staters--do not have  access to a retirement plan at their workplace, and participation in  retirement plans has dropped over the past several years.   We know there is a significant gap between what people need in order  to maintain their standard of living after retirement and what they  actually have. It is essential we do more to help workers close that  gap. That is why I am pleased to join with Senator Collins today in  introducing the bipartisan Retirement Security Act.   This commonsense legislation makes it easier for small businesses to  provide retirement plans for their employees, something I hear from  small business people all the time, something they want to do, but  there are technical and financial challenges to doing it. This bill  would encourage people in the workforce as well to save more for  retirement, and it would help reduce the costs and complexities of  maintaining a retirement plan.   We have more work to do to help people in New Hampshire, in Maine,  and all across our country plan and save for retirement, and the  Retirement Savings Act is a strong step forward. I again thank Senator  Collins for her leadership on this issue, and I look forward to  continuing to work with her to pass the bipartisan legislation, as well  as other shared priorities for retirees, small businesses, and more.   Additionally, as a new member of the Finance Committee, I look  forward to working with my colleagues to tackle this and other critical  issues.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Warner):   S. 322. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote  retirement savings on behalf of small business employees by making  improvements to SIMPLE retirement accounts and easing the transition  from a SIMPLE plan to a 401(k) plan, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Finance.
