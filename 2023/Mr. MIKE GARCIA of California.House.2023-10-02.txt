 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  attribute to a friend, a hero, and a great American.   Jason Rooney passed on June 11 this year, just shy of his 51st  birthday. He is survived by his parents, Dudley and Cathy; his  daughter, Skyler; and his three brothers, Christopher, Michael, and  Brian.   Growing up, Jason always put others first. He had a heart for serving  others that ultimately led him to serve as a Los Angeles County deputy  for over 15 years. He took great pride in being a deputy and he  performed all of his positions with honor and with distinction. However  his true purpose in life came on January 31, 2008, when he welcomed his  daughter Skyler Marie into the world. Skyler is a beautiful and  intelligent young lady and Jay's world revolved around her.   Jason Dudley Rooney was a great brother, great son, and a great  father. He will be missed by his family, friends, and the good people  of Los Angeles County whom he served so well.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless Jay Rooney, who is now by His side, and  may God bless all of our peacekeepers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Comer  and Ranking Member Raskin for their support on this very special bill  for a real, true American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 292, to name the post  office in Valencia, California, after a true American patriot, Mr. Bill  Reynolds.   This is a fitting tribute for someone who gave so much over the  course of his life to this beautiful Nation. While his military service  and heroism in the jungles of Vietnam with the famous Charlie Company  warrant this honor alone, it was his tireless commitment to recognizing  his fellow brothers and sisters in arms that cemented him as a lion in  the veterans' community.   A lifelong resident of Southern California, Bill was drafted for  service shortly after graduating from high school and went on to join  the Army's Charlie Company, 9th Division, 4th Battalion, 47th Infantry  Regiment. The ``Boys of `67'' is what they were known as.   Bill was a part of the only division to be raised, drafted, and  trained for service in the Vietnam war. Despite being wounded in action  in June of 1967, he continued fighting alongside his friends, defending  his friends in the Mekong Delta, and was ultimately awarded the Purple  Heart and Bronze Star for his bravery.   After his service, he embraced his proud identity of being a U.S.  veteran and took every opportunity to advocate and support his brothers  and sisters who served. He was one of the very  [[Page H4942]]  first ambassadors for the Greatest Generations Foundation, he served as  a member of the local American Legion Post, and he was a member of the  Santa Clarita Veterans' Day Committee.   During the last decade of his life, Bill cemented his legacy as the  most passionate and high-profile veterans advocate in the Santa Clarita  Valley. He was single-handedly responsible for the installment of a  memorial wall at the Veterans Plaza in Newhall, California. He  accompanied the President and fellow veterans to Da Nang to commemorate  the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war. He also worked as the director  of veterans affairs for the two largest news publications in Santa  Clarita.   As director of veterans affairs for both the Santa Clarita Signal and  KHTS Radio, Bill Reynolds served as the historian for local veterans,  writing more than 100 profiles in courage of hometown heroes; something  that they could share with their families and relive their legacies.   Bill was also a devoted husband to the love of his life, Meg, and was  a loving father and grandfather to his children and grandchildren.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, our Nation is simply better because of  Bill Reynolds. He embodied the very values that America was founded on  and continues to hold to this day: love of country, grit, and service  above all else.   Patriots like Bill Reynolds make the United States the greatest  country in history. A small tribute like naming a post office after him  is the least we can do. The debt of gratitude Americans owe to Bill  Reynolds can never fully be paid.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and pass this very  special bill to honor a true American hero.
