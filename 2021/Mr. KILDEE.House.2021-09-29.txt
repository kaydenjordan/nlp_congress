 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and chairman for  yielding time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to protect  the American economy, to save it from catastrophe, and to prevent a  default on the obligations of the United States of America. The full  faith and credit of the United States can't be questioned. The full  faith and credit of the United States should never be a partisan  question.   We have passed action to address the debt limit 78 times--29 times  with a Democrat in White House and 49 times with a Republican in the  White House. In fact, when President Trump was in office, Democrats  helped. We cooperated, and we helped to address this issue three times.   Yet now they are refusing to vote and refusing to support, meeting  obligations that we already have. A robust debate about the future is  fine, and we should have that, and we will have disagreements. But we  should never, ever, ever question, let anyone question the promises  made by the United States Government.
