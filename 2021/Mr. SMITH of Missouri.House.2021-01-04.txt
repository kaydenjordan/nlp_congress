 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on only day two of the 117th Congress, House Democrats  are already attempting to strip Americans of the transparency that they  deserve in order to push through an expensive progressive wish list.   The House rules package includes three main provisions that will  allow Democrats to hide their plans to irresponsibly spend taxpayer  dollars in an effort to satisfy their liberal base: a deeming  resolution, signaling they do not plan on doing a budget; two, new,  broad exemptions to budget rules, such as paygo, to allow passage of  socialist policies with large price tags; and, three, they want the  repeal of a House rule prohibiting reconciliation from increasing net  direct spending, making it easier to advance a costly radical agenda.   It has been 733 days since Democrats took control of the House of  Representatives, and they have yet to produce one single budget. These  rules will continue to let Democrats shirk their duty to write and pass  a budget.   Don't forget, Speaker Pelosi is the one who stated the budget is a  statement of values. I couldn't agree more. I must ask: Have Democrats  not done a budget because they know revealing their true plans, their  true colors, will let the American people know how unpopular their  ideas are?   The people deserve to know, and they deserve a transparent budget to  know how House Democrats plan to spend their hard-earned tax dollars  and how Democrats want to increase their taxes.   Furthermore, by weakening fiscal restraint rules, Democrats clearly  intend to drastically increase the size of the Federal Government. This  will only continue to drive up the unsustainable Federal debt while  decreasing Americans' liberties and freedoms.    Specifically, it includes a budgetary exemption for measures to  prevent, prepare, or respond to economic, environmental, or public  health consequences resulting from climate change. This exemption is  irresponsible, since, arguably, it could apply to any radical,  progressive, out-of-touch legislation dreamed up next by House  Democrats. Clearly, this exemption was designed as a mechanism to ram  through socialist policies like the Green New Deal and other ideas  aimed at hurting American workers, families, and farmers.    Madam Speaker, this past November, the voters  rejected a socialist agenda. If this rules package is any indication  for how Democrats plan to run the 117th Congress, I cannot wait for the  midterm elections. These rules allow Democrats to continue deceiving  the American people.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this Soviet-style rules package.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
