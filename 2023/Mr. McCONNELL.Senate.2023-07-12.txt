 Madam President, earlier this year, I had the  opportunity to deliver an important message directed to our European  allies in Munich. I told our friends that leading Republicans are as  committed as ever to American leadership and a robust transatlantic  alliance.   I emphasized our resolve for helping Ukraine to defeat Russian  aggression, not because of some vague moral obligation but because of  what it means for America's own core national interests.   Letting Putin's brutality succeed would mean putting some of  America's closest trading partners one border closer to a violent and  revanchist authoritarian regime. It would mean emboldening Putin's  ``friend without limits'' President Xi in Beijing to assert even more  aggressive influence over on the other side of the world.   I spoke yesterday about how our allies recognized what is at stake in  Ukraine and about how Europe's biggest economies have woken up from  holidays from history and made serious commitments to helping Ukraine  actually win.   For some perspective on this important progress, more than half of  the Javelin anti-tank weapons Ukraine has received have come from  countries other than the United States. In fact, we now rank 13th in  terms of assistance as a percentage of GDP.   Even as America continues to provide critical assistance to Ukraine,  some nations are digging even deeper into their own arsenals and making  a much greater relative investment of support. Russian aggression has  spurred our European allies to heightened vigilance and greater  resolve. Here at home, the American people overwhelmingly share that  resolve.   According to a recent survey, three in four Americans--three in four  Americans--including big majorities in each party, think it is  important to us, to the United States, that Ukraine win the war. A  clear majority also supports sending U.S. military aid to Ukraine. And  more generally, 85 percent of Americans say a strong U.S. military is  essential to maintain peace and prosperity.   So the American people's view of our national security is really  quite clear, but here in Washington, providing for the common defense  remains our biggest and most pressing piece of unfinished business.  President Biden's defense budget request is woefully inadequate,  especially as we look at the growing military requirements to deter or  defend against Chinese aggression.   Folks in Washington are using the threat of China to justify all  sorts of other policies and initiatives, but the reality is, the  primary area of geopolitical competition is part power.  [[Page S2332]]    This growing threat makes our work on funding America's Armed Forces  especially important, but the process of setting the Senate's national  security priorities begins with a long-overdue annual Defense  authorization.   I am hopeful that the Democratic leader is taking the necessary steps  to bringing the NDAA to the Senate floor next week. I am hopeful this  legislation will receive the thorough amendment process that it  deserves.   The sooner we deliver on the NDAA, the sooner we can deliver the  robust hard-power investments our Armed Forces need to replenish  stocks, support our allies and partners, and deter growing threats to  American security all around the world.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, last month, the  Supreme Court included in its most consequential rulings of the term a  major blow to the Biden administration's sprawling conception of  executive branch power.   For years, the administration grasped for a way to deliver a big dose  of catnip to Washington Democrats' wealthy blue-State base in the form  of student loan socialism. They had dreamed up a reverse Robin Hood  system of taking from working families to pay off the student loans of  highly educated professionals, moving hundreds of billions of dollars  in outstanding debt from high-earning doctors and lawyers onto the  taxpayers' tab.   The median college graduate earns 55 percent more than the median  worker who holds a high school diploma. And the wealthiest households  in the country owe a disproportionate share of America's student debt.   But Democrats are hellbent on forgiving that debt at the expense of  folks who carefully saved, paid off their debt, or avoided it  altogether.   Of all the ways Washington Democrats have dreamed up to waste  taxpayer dollars and betray the trust of working Americans, this one  may well have taken the cake. But when the Biden administration picked  an especially outlandish deal for enacting this particular scheme, the  Supreme Court ended up being involved.   Just a couple of weeks ago, the Court ruled that 20-year-old  emergency authorities designed during the War on Terror did not permit  the President to ignore Congress and unilaterally cancel debt from his  party's most reliable supporters.   As Chief Justice Roberts put it in the opinion of the Court, the  administration's plan `` `modified' the cited provisions'' of existing  authorities ``only in the same sense that the French Revolution  `modified' the status of the French nobility.''   Washington Democrats tried to serve working families a raw deal. And  by all accounts, they will probably try it again. But Senate  Republicans continue to stand against radical student loan socialism-- in whatever form it may take.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.
