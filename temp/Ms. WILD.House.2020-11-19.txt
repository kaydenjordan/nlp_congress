 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated  November 17, 2020, from the International Union of Operating Engineers  in support of this bill, addressed to the Honorable Robert C. Scott,  chair of the Committee on Education and Labor.                                              International Union of                                             Operating Engineers,                                  Washington, DC, November 17, 2020.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Chair, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: The International Union of Operating       Engineers supports H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act       of 2020, and we appreciate your work to strengthen and expand       opportunities in America's most successful training model for       blue-collar workers: apprenticeship.        The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE)       represents 400,000 operating and stationary engineers who       build the transportation, water systems, and energy networks       that comprise the nation's core infrastructure. In       partnership with construction contractors and employers of       stationary engineers, the IUOE dedicates resources to develop       and implement nearly 100 registered apprenticeship programs.       The programs possess over 550 instructors. and they train       tens of thousands of apprentices and journey-level workers       every year. This focus on training is reflected in the       safety, skills. and productivity of members of the Operating       Engineers. Labor-management apprenticeship program of the       IUOE and our employers are widely recognized as the gold       standard of our industries and our occupations.        Since the National Apprenticeship Act was first authorized       in 1937, the Registered Apprenticeship system has served as a       model for delivering industry-driven training in the       construction sector and beyond. According to the Department       of Labor, 94 percent of apprentices who complete Registered       Apprenticeships are employed upon completion, earning an       average starting wage of above $70,000 annually. Apprentice       wages are connected to experience, skill development, and       productivity. The increase annually and include benefits like       health insurance and a pension plan. The Registered       Apprenticeship system remains a highly successful path for       thousands of workers, providing a stable and predictable       career path with economic security.        H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 expands       the limited framework of the existing Registered       Apprenticeship program to reinforce quality standards that       safeguard the welfare of apprentices. The legislation       codifies and streamlines the existing regulations and       includes important reporting and  [[Page H5973]]       evaluation requirements to guarantee program effectiveness       and accountability. The legislation strengthens the       connections to the career ladder for apprentices, more       closely linking pre-apprenticeship and youth apprenticeship       programs with the system of registered apprenticeship. The       enhanced technical assistance in the legislation will help       expand Registered Apprenticeship opportunities into new       sectors. That technical assistance will also support more       opportunities to improve diversity, bringing more women,       people of color, and veterans into the system of       apprenticeship.        The value of this proven on-the-job training model is even       more evident today as we navigate the unprecedented       challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response       to this extraordinary crisis will require extensive public       investment to rebuild America's infrastructure and its       workforce. The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 provides       historic investments in workforce training, laying the       foundation for economic recovery and preparing the skilled       and qualified workforce to rebuild our country. While the       nation continues to experience staggering levels of       unemployment, the reauthorization of the National       Apprenticeship Act, will expand job opportunities and       increase access to high-paying careers for millions of hard-      working Americans.        The International Union of Operating Engineers proudly       endorses H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020,       and we look forward to working with you to enact it into law       during this session of Congress.            Sincerely,                                                 James T. Callahan,                                                 General President.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2020.   COVID-19 has exposed shortcomings in our workforce infrastructure,  but those shortcomings are the result of a long history of making only  marginal investments in our national apprenticeship model. It seems we  are always reacting to crisis rather than planning in advance.   In response to the Great Recession of 2008, Congress invested  significant funding in our workforce systems. In this Congress, we made  investments through the CARES Act, but only as this COVID crisis  spiraled.                                time  1600    It should not take a recession or a pandemic to invest in workers in  communities like mine. Lehigh, Northampton, and Monroe Counties are  replete with potential, but it is critical that we invest in times of  prosperity, too. For every dollar invested in our registered  apprenticeship program, we see a return of $28 in benefits, but the  U.S. invests just $195 in public money per apprentice while a system  like Canada spends $1,300 per apprentice.   This bill would reset our approach. It makes long-term investments  regardless of our economic fortunes or misfortunes. It provides grants  for employers to incentivize the hiring of apprentices. At the same  time, it provides workers with the opportunity to earn while they learn  and obtain portable credentials without incurring significant debt.  This bill emphasizes the importance of apprenticeship programs' high- need social service occupations, like apprenticeship programs for early  childhood educators, something Congressman Guthrie and I have sought to  do with our Early Educators Apprenticeship Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Susan Davis, for her  leadership on this bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a native son of my  community, Amtrak Vice-President Joe McHugh, from Allentown,  Pennsylvania, who is retiring after a storied career with our National  Railroad Corporation, which he has proudly served for 26 years.   Joe served in various leadership roles for the railroad, and many  here in the House of Representatives will remember him as one of  Amtrak's most effective advocates in its 50-year history.   Joe helped lead Amtrak through an era of transformation and growth.  He also has a unique firsthand understanding of the railroad. Over his  26 years, he accomplished the rare feat of traveling over every mile of  Amtrak's more than 21,000-mile route network. Of his many  accomplishments, the many people he mentored and whose careers he  helped foster may well be his most important contribution to the  railroad.   The House of Representatives and the Nation owe Joe McHugh a debt of  gratitude for his dedication and contributions. On behalf of the House  of Representatives and my community, I congratulate him on his  retirement and extend our very best wishes to him as he embarks on the  next chapter in his life.                            ____________________
