 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, our Constitution starts with those three  beautiful and powerful words: ``We the People.'' Our Founders  envisioned a nation with a form of government that wouldn't result in a  government by the powerful and the privileged but instead would really  deliver for the American people a form of government that is the  foundation for every American to thrive. What a contrast that is to  many of the governments of Europe that they had seen function on behalf  of the privileged and the powerful.   Well, we have an issue before us that certainly is about government  of, by, and for the people. It is the issue of the Children's Health  Insurance Program, often referred to as CHIP. This program has been  expired for 46 days--46 days--putting children's healthcare at risk  throughout our country.   Why isn't this bill on the floor right now? Why isn't it being passed  by unanimous consent right now, or at least being debated and amended  and passed? We have five States--five States--that are running out of  money in this quarter. Oregon, my home State, is one of them. We are  going to be out of money next month. We have another 25 States that are  going to be running out of money in the first 3 months of 2018,  disrupting the continuity of essential services for our little ones.  [[Page S7248]]    For 20 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has ensured  that no children fall through the cracks of our healthcare system. It  has covered checkups, immunizations, dental visits, and doctors'  visits, assisting our struggling and low-income families who make too  much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to be able to actually  purchase health services or healthcare for their children. Every single  State in America--50 States out of 50--has a program. Now, they tend to  operate at different levels. Forty-six States cover children up to or  above 200 percent of poverty. We have 24 States that cover families up  to incomes of 215 percent of poverty. So 24 States go a little further.  We have a handful of States that expand coverage up to 300 percent of  coverage. In my home State of Oregon, 140,000 children rely on the  Children's Health Insurance Program.   It is just not acceptable that Members of this body come to this  floor to talk about how to do trillions of dollars of tax benefits for  the very wealthiest of Americans while we are failing to get a bill on  the floor for health insurance for America's poor and struggling  children. There is a lot I could say about that tax bill. It is really  a bank heist. It is designed to deliver trillions of dollars to the  richest 1 percent of Americans, while doing virtually nothing for the  middle class and absolutely nothing for the bottom third of Americans.  But doesn't there seem to be something wrong in a ``we the People''  democratic republic when we have a bill on the floor that is a bank  heist on the Federal Treasury to deliver benefits--trillions of  dollars--to the richest Americans and we can't have a debate on this  floor on healthcare for the poorest children in America? Well,  certainly, I think it is a perversion of the principle of a government  that serves the people to put the privileged and powerful ahead in  line.   We have seen, certainly, many renditions of this. We have seen a  broader bill, a set of bills, including the TrumpCare, zombie  healthcare bill that came to this floor. It was going to wipe out  healthcare for 22 million Americans. Then it came back in a different  form that was kind of the fake insurance form, and it was defeated  again. Then it came back as the skinny bill, and it was defeated again.  All of these bills wiped out healthcare for millions and millions of  America's families.   Well, now we have a tax bill coming to the floor that, once again,  has a provision put in it to wipe out healthcare for millions of  American families. That is why we call it the zombie bill--the fact  that we kill this thing, try to put a stake through its heart, knowing  that we are supposed to be here serving the people--not the most  privileged, the people. That is what is in our Constitution. That is  the vision of this Nation, but apparently it is not the vision for  those who control the bills that come to this floor because this bill  has been waiting for 46 days to be addressed.    There is a bipartisan bill ready and waiting to be brought to the  floor right now. Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden have worked together.  They passed this bill out of their committee. It would extend the  Children's Health Insurance Program through 2022. We could take up that  bill right now and pass it. It had the full support of the committee.  The Republicans and the Democrats were on board. So why isn't it here?  Why are we disrupting healthcare for America's children?   To my colleagues: Set aside your ambition of ripping off the Federal  Government to deliver benefits to the top 1 percent of Americans and  pay some attention to America's children. That is our responsibility.  That should be our mission. That is the purpose of our Constitution.  Let's get it done. Nine million American children are waiting.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, climate disruption is the seminal  challenge of our generation. It affects everything from our farms to  our forests, to our fisheries. We are seeing huge impacts around the  world: disappearing ice in the Arctic, melting permafrost, dying coral,  raging fires, more powerful storms. Everywhere you look it is having an  impact, and it is certainly an impact we need to pay a great deal of  attention to because it is hurting human civilization, and the impacts  are just beginning. They are going to become worse over time.   In response, communities across the globe are transforming their  energy economies. They are certainly making their energy economies more  efficient, from increasing insulation in buildings to improving vehicle  mileage, to greater efficiency in appliances and in replacing fossil  fuel energy with clean renewable energy.   How much do you know about the changes underway, about the dramatic  modifications of our energy economy and the impacts of climate  disruption? Let's find out. Welcome to episode 8 of the Senate Climate  Disruption Quiz. Here we go.   First question. Researchers predict there will be an ice-free Arctic  by the summer of what year?   Will it be the year 2020, 3 years from now; the year 2030, the year  2075, or will it be 2100, the end of the century?   Lock in your answers.   Here is the correct answer. That is B, the year 2030. Researchers say  that as early as 2030, the Arctic Ocean could lose all of its ice  during the year's warmest months.   We see here a map of what has been happening in the past. The red  outlines, in addition to the white, represents where the ice was in  1980. In 1998, less area is covered; in 2012, even less area is  covered; and in the last two summers, the Northwest Passage has been  free of ice, and that has enabled a ship called the Crystal Serenity to  move up and essentially take tourists through the Northwest Passage,  where you can see it was ice-covered in 1980. So that is a big change.   If we have an effort to address the improvements made in Paris, then,  yes, there would still be ice here in that year of 2030, in an area  about the size of India, but you can see it is really shrinking  quickly.   OK. On to our second question. Over the next decade, the number of  U.S. wind energy technicians is expected to decline by 10 percent; grow  by over 100 percent, which is to double; remain about stable; or  disappear entirely?   Lock in your answers.   The correct answer is B, grow by over 100 percent. In other words, it  will double. These are good jobs. Last year, less  [[Page S7268]]  than 100,000 people were employed in some manner by the wind industry,  and the median pay was about $51,000 a year--a good middle-class job.  We are seeing the jobs grow as the demand for wind energy grows  throughout the country. The American Wind Energy Association says that  in just the first 3 months of 2017, 2,000 megawatts of wind power were  added, which is almost a fourfold increase over what happened in the  first 3 months of 2016. So big changes are happening quickly.   Question No. 3. President Trump's administration released a study in  November, the National Climate Assessment. Did President's Trump's  study attribute the major cause of climate disruption to volcanic  activity, or did his study say that the major cause was natural cycle,  human activity, or solar activity?   Lock in your answers.   The answer is, on this study from President Trump's team, not  volcanic activities, not solar activity, and not a natural cycle. It  was, in fact, human activity.   This is a study from the Trump administration. They produced a chart  that looked at the temperature increase and measured how much can be  attributed to human-caused activity. You can see the chart here, how  much was attributed to solar--very little impact--and how much can be  attributed to volcanic activity, and that was actually negative. So the  Trump administration has produced a huge statement that human activity  is causing the increase of the temperature of our planet.   Question No. 4. Why did India shut down New Delhi's schools--that is  4,000 schools--why did they shut down New Delhi's schools for several  days in November? Was it, A, lead in the water; B, religious tensions;  C, record air pollution; or, D, population explosion?   Lock in your answers.   The correct answer is, in fact, record air pollution. This can be  measured, but you can also see it. I will put up a picture of that  pollution in New Delhi. Now we can barely see these people from a short  distance away riding a motorcycle. The father is clamping his hand over  his son's face to help reduce the impact of the air pollution on the  children.   This air pollution was considered to be equivalent to smoking 50  cigarettes a day. The doctors are saying kids coming in who should have  pink lungs have dark lungs--gray, black lungs. So it is having a huge  health impact.   The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi measures the air quality by a category  that is known as particulate matter, PM2.5. It refers to miniscule  particulate matter of diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less. These are  the very tiny particles that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause all  kinds of problems in the lungs as they are absorbed into the  bloodstream.   The EPA standard--the Environmental Protection Agency standard-- considers anything between 151 and 200 as unhealthy. What they  registered on this day was 1,000. It topped the 1,000 mark. You can  understand then how dangerous that is. This is from burning fossil  fuels causing this pollution and specifically burning coal.   That brings us to our final question, Question No. 5. What percent of  American voters support staying in the Paris Agreement? This, of  course, is the international agreement in which every country in the  world is now involved. Recently, there were two countries that had not  signed up, and that was Nicaragua and Syria, but they now have both  signed up. President Trump has said he plans to leave. Technically, we  are still signed up because he can't leave under the agreement until  November 2020. Still, because he said we are planning to leave, it has  produced a lot of reaction by American citizens and those for and  against.   What percent of American voters support staying in? Is it zero; 15  percent, a little more than one out of eight; or 45 percent, just shy  of half; or 70 percent?   Lock in your answers.   Well, the Yale Program on Climate Communication did a poll which was  released earlier this year, and the answer is that 70 percent, 7 out of  10 Americans, say stay in. Now this support for the Paris Agreement is  more than half for every party, including the unaffiliated or  independent voters. It is very high among Democrats, 86 percent; among  Independents it is 61 percent; but 51 percent, more than one out of  every two Republicans say, yes, stay in. They also took a look at self- identified voters for President Trump, and, there again, more than one  out of two, a majority of them, said to stay in.   So there you have it, folks. Episode 8 of the Climate Disruption  Quiz, issues ripped from the headlines on the most important issue  facing the survival of humankind on this planet.   Carbon dioxide levels are accelerating and running through the roof.  The temperature of our planet is accelerating. Our planet has caught a  fever, and there is no doctor for the planet. We have to address it. We  have to act. We are the first generation to experience the impacts and  the last generation that can head off catastrophic consequences.   We are racing with the clock. There is no time to spare. So stay  engaged, and in the future, I will bring you episode 9 of the Senate  Climate Disruption Quiz.   Thank you.                            ____________________
