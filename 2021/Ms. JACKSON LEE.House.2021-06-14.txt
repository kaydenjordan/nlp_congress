 Madam Speaker, I rise as a fellow Texan to offer my  deepest sympathy to my fellow congressional colleagues in the Austin  area, to the local officials, and to all of those who suffered the  brutality of the mass shooting in the last couple of days--14--and my  deepest sympathy to the family of the deceased loved one, who mourns  today.   Out of respect for his family, I will just simply say we mourn him,  and we are saddened by his loss.   Madam Speaker, in Texas, the Governor just signed a permitless gun  bill. All statistics suggest that this provides for a shopping spree of  guns.   It is important for three things to happen for our Nation to raise  its voices against gun violence and to begin to pass sensible gun  safety laws, including my legislation for gun storage, universal  background checks, closing the Charleston loophole, to prevent ghost  guns, and banning assault weapons.   At the same time, we must raise up the specter of mental health  services. But most of all, as I chair the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, we must raise our voice against  violence and actually deal with it and try to cease it. I believe  America must do this.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise this evening for the  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour that deals with, of  course, Juneteenth, a very special time that I am delighted--with the  leadership of our chair, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty; and, of course, my  coanchor, Congressman Torres of New York--that we stand here to provide  this kind of leadership for this Congress and for this Nation.   Let me extend my heartfelt appreciation for all of the leadership  that have given us this time, including Speaker Pelosi and, of course,  Leader Hoyer, and to acknowledge the significance to African Americans  as it relates to Juneteenth.   Coming from Texas, let me tell you that Juneteenth, a couple days  from today, will be an amazing commemoration. We will be unveiling a  mural in Galveston, where General Granger first came. I believe  thousands will come. And if there will not be thousands, let you hear  my voice: Thousands should come because what a historic moment.   What does Juneteenth mean?   It means an acknowledgment of those who were in bondage for over 200  years. The Emancipation Proclamation--which, by the way, for the 150th  commemoration, because we had not finished our congressional work, I  was actually here at midnight--which is when President Abraham Lincoln  signed it at the National Archives. Looking at the original  Emancipation Proclamation, what a sense of emotion.   But then to let you know that that did not free all of the slaves.  Two years in bondage continued for those west of the Mississippi and  many States until General Granger reached the shores of Galveston,  still marked today in Texas, that said that you were free.   Can you imagine? Two extra years of bondage. Couldn't get out.  Couldn't read a newspaper or hold up a message that had come from your  relative that lived in Georgia. Couldn't do anything.   General Granger read these words of General Order Number 3, set off a  joyous celebration of the freed men and women of Texas. I have no shame  that it was called Jubilee. And there were a lot of picnics and what we  called in the later years ``red punch.''  [[Page H2729]]    Don't diminish our celebration. Don't diminish that joy in the midst  of sorrow.   How many died who could not see freedom?   Here are the words: ``The people of Texas are informed that, in  accordance with the Proclamation from the Executive of the United  States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of  rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and  the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between  employer and hired laborer.''   Now, the word was said that they were offered, the slaves: Don't  worry about it, just stay on the plantations, and we will pay you.   I am grateful, but those courageous, but impoverished, without  insight, without resources, without compensation, without recognition,  they said in their own power: We are leaving the plantations.   And they migrated up this road called Emancipation Trail.   I am gratified that I was able to introduce such legislation where my  Senate colleague, Senator Cornyn, joined me and now an Emancipation  Trail has been established as law. It is now under study. It will be  only the second commemoration of African-American history in this  Nation. The Selma to Montgomery is the first, and now the Emancipation  Trail that says: No, I was not going stay on the plantation; however, I  was going to survive; whatever I had to place together, I was going to  do it.   Then, of course, lo and behold, they found themselves--eight of them,  freed slaves, put their money together and purchased the first park  bought in the State of Texas by freed slaves or anyone. They called it  Emancipation Park.   So that is why we are here to celebrate and to educate this idea of  what it means to celebrate Juneteenth. I am delighted that we have  introduced a resolution that is bipartisan. But the most exciting part  about this is that I have introduced a bill that establishes Juneteenth  as a national Federal holiday. Not removing any other holiday, but  adding it to the list. Cosponsored by Senator Markey and Senator  Cornyn, and bipartisan. Over 160 cosponsors in the House.   I think it is worthy to have a holiday--a Federal holiday  established, and I am very proud to have been the Congressperson for  Representative Al Edwards, who is called the father of Juneteenth,  establishing the first paid State holiday in the State of Texas  highlighting, honoring, revering Juneteenth.   You will hear many of us continue our discussions about Juneteenth,  its significance in terms of freedom. And I am delighted, as I said, to  be coanchoring with my colleague. It is important to express our  appreciation to our chair, the Honorable Barbara Lee, a Californian but  born in Texas with a grandfather born in Galveston. She knows what  Juneteenth, the significance, the power of it is, and her legislative  legacy speaks to freedom.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the Honorable Barbara Lee.                                time  1945     She would have been part of it at a later time, but  that trail, since we know for sure there were no other ways of moving,  she had to walk along that semi-developed trail of little cities from  Galveston--walk along, drive along, in whatever capacity, and when I  say ``drive along,'' horse and buggy and otherwise.   That was a trail that the freed slaves, the ex-slaves, went from  Galveston all the way. There was the Reedy A.M.E., if I am correct, one  of the historic A.M.E. churches where they stopped for refuge. Then  they came on up, and they sought their way to freedom. They were not  going to stay on the plantation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back to the gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able to have  a Californian with deep roots in Texas on the floor because what this  says to our body is that this issue of slavery permeated all aspects of  this Nation. We can see that from the work, the commitment, and the  compassion of the Honorable Barbara Lee, followed by, of course, a  native daughter of Wisconsin who saw it in a different form and is  compelled to be on the floor today and who has championed for the  impoverished as well and particularly championed for those who  are experiencing modern-day impacts of slavery through inequities,  through poverty, through welfare, and that has been treated unfairly.  That is the Honorable Gwen Moore from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, what a rich and enriching discussion.  Thank you to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. That is why we gathered  here, to say to America, we come from the Midwest, the South, the East,  and we still find a common bond around the question of Juneteenth,  reparations, and of course, voting rights that are so important.   But as I yield, let me be very clear, these are American values.  These are values that my friends on the other side of the aisle could  adopt, just like I could adopt.   Why? Because I don't know anyone that would extinguish freedom and  deny that where there is bondage and where freedom comes, we should  celebrate it, but we should tell the story about it, and we should  respond to it.   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), who has a number of historical  monuments in Florida that indicates her knowledge and understanding of  freedom.    Madam Speaker, I can't imagine with the recounting  of the story by Val Demings that we are not securing, how should I say  it, multiple numbers of Members to join in the holiday pronouncement  and resolution, and bill, rather, of Juneteenth, to support H.R. 40,  and to recognize the value of commemorating and teaching about the  history of African Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a  person who has great knowledge and is a great storyteller, a fighter  for justice, and a fellow member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, as I get ready to yield to the  distinguished gentleman from Las Vegas, Nevada, I want to make sure he  lets me know my pronunciation is correct, it is a very sensitive  question.   But as the gentleman from Georgia leaves, let me at least acknowledge  that critical race theory. Here is the question I ask: Should I not  know about Italians and how they came and were treated? Should I not  know about the Irish who left in the midst of the potato famine and  faced discrimination? Should I not know about Native Americans?   So we are the American experiment. Does everybody realize that? No  one thought that we would ever survive, and we have come together with  a multitude of groups. Our strength is in the recognition of our  differences, and in our unity.   This came out of Texas. This Representative is all over. He  misinterprets the teaching by teachers. He has never sat in the class  to know that teachers are not condemning, they are just educating.  Isn't it wonderful in little babies' minds to not put condemnation but  to put understanding so that we can appreciate each other's condition?   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Horsford), who is the first vice chair of the Congressional Black  Caucus but sits on the Ways and Means Committee. And if he will allow  me, I just want to make this point.   You are seeing Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and I can  tell you our agenda is as wide and varied as America, from taxation to  agriculture to tech to criminal justice to the issues that American is  facing, job creation.   But we also understand that we would be remiss if we did not stand on  the floor to be able to give our own life experiences and to share with  America what the value of our diversity is all about.   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr.  Horsford).    May I ask the Speaker the time remaining, please.    Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to a  gentleman with a storied and layered history entrenched in one of the  States that suffered the extension of slavery and faces its challenges  today, of which this gentleman has been in the mix and in the gap of  fighting for justice. We are excited about his presence here. I am so  honored and privileged that he has chosen, with all of the work he has  to do because he was elected in a special election, this moment in  history to present his first speech on the floor of the House.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Louisiana  (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, let me congratulate the gentleman for  the new law in Louisiana and for his leadership and his powerful  message on this floor on the freedom, really, of all people. My freedom  is your freedom, your freedom is my freedom, and our freedom is  America's freedom.   Let me express my appreciation to my co-anchor, the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Torres). I thank him for his leadership. Let me be very  clear that both his history and his State as well have a vested history  in liberty and freedom, but, yes, no place did escape the vestiges of  slavery.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres).    Madam Speaker, I say to the gentleman from New York,  it is an esteemed pleasure to be able to draw upon both his knowledge  and scholarship--might I stand on his shoulders--an activist Federal  Government.   For some reason, as we face these trials and tribulations of 2021,  there is a hesitancy to realize that the Federal Government is, in  simplistic terms, an umbrella on a rainy day. It is, in fact, the  concrete barrier in the time of a storm. And that is why we are on the  floor today.   Let me acknowledge that an activist Federal Government, in the  positive way, would be the government that would say that Italian  history and Irish history, Latinx, Hispanic history, and Caribbean  history, and African history, and the Pilgrim Pride history, and  European history, and Asian-Pacific history, and Southeast Asian- Pacific, and any others that I have left out, is valuable to be heard  by our children's ears. It is valuable to be taught.   Then they would be able to understand the gentleman's entreat, his  request, which is H.R. 1320, which is bipartisan, that declares  Juneteenth a national Federal holiday.   And to the wrong representation of right-wing radio, it doesn't  substitute any holiday. It adds it to the list of Federal holidays. It  does not subtract any holiday; does not take any holiday away. Yet it  acknowledges the importance of that day and, as well, it is led by  Senators Markey and Cornyn, a Republican and Democrat in the United  States Senate, and it is a bipartisan bill in the House.   Is there any reason not to move this bill along as quickly as  possible?   And if there is a basis for not understanding what freedom meant,  look at this slave that was symbolic of the life that slave led; but  that is the light of being beat.   What about those who were beaten to death or burned to death?   It is no shame for our children to be taught this history. I know no  teacher who would stand in the classroom and condemn children. I know  teachers who are loving, and will give understanding, and let a child  come out and say, I want a better America.   Isn't that the kind of soldier and doctor and lawyer and teacher we  want to build up? Isn't that the kind of citizen we want to grow?   And then, if we want to make it realistic and home for our moment, as  my colleagues have said, we spent 4 days in Tulsa, Greenwood, that was  burned to the ground; 300 in an unmarked grave. This is what 1921  looked like; not 1865, not 1810, not 1799, not 1724, when slavery was  raging, if you will, 250 years. This is what it looked like in 1921; a  black body burned on the streets of Greenwood.   So when we talk about jubilee and freedom, we do it in a way that we  can, as Americans, be free. And then I want to say that matches the  Emancipation Trail that is now law in the State of Texas, that march  from victory, when General Granger said you are free. It matches H.R.  40, which is a non-offensive repair and reconciliation that speaks to  the language that Justice Hughes said about Black Americans, the  discrete and insular minority excluded from those political processes  ordinarily to be relied upon to protect them. All throughout tenure  here there were denials of our freedom.   And then, of course, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., talked about an  insufficient check; not of money, but he talked about that we have  never been given justice and equality.   So when we speak of the Emancipation Trail, only the second  commemoration of the history of African Americans 250 years in bondage,  when we speak of Juneteenth, it is for all to celebrate, when General  Granger landed on the shores of Galveston.   We will be in Galveston celebrating. We will see Naomi Carrier. We  will see Eileen Lawal and Jackie Bostic, Ramon Manning and, of course,  the Emancipation Conservatory. We will get to see Opal Lee, almost 100  years old, fighting for this holiday, or Al Edwards. We will get to see  Senator Cornyn, a Republican who joins us in this commemoration, and  all others. We will get to see the Nation be able to understand in its  finality that it must be clear, it must be our birthright.   It is a reminder, this day, on Juneteenth, that liberty and freedom  are precious birthrights of all Americans, which must be jealously  guarded and preserved for future generations.   That is why we are on the floor today. We are not in anger. We are  not in anguish. We are here, in fact, for liberation, freedom, and the  empowerment of all Americans.   Let stories be told, no matter who you are. And let the story be told  of those uniquely held in bondage, through H.R. 40, the Commission to  Study and Develop Reparation Proposals, which we seek to put on the  floor in this great month. And, of course, the national holiday of  Juneteenth, along with the historic gift that we give to America, the  Emancipation Trail, that all the world will be able to come.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to thank my chair, the Honorable Joyce  Beatty, for her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. And  because  [[Page H2734]]  of freedom, it is a wonderment to stand here, free, with my colleague  from New York, my co-chair, the Honorable Congressman Torres, and all  others.   Isn't it precious?   In God we trust that we stand here in freedom. Let us not ever lose  it, and let us fight for it and let us keep it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise to anchor the Congressional  Black Caucus's Special Order tonight on Juneteenth Independence Day.   I am pleased to be joined by Congresswoman Beatty, the Chair of the  CBC; Congressman Torres of New York, the co-anchor for this Special  Order, and so many of our CBC colleagues to commemorate a historically  significant day for all Americans, but especially African Americans.   Let me extend on behalf of the CBC its heartfelt thanks to the House  leadership, particularly Majority Leader Hoyer, for their support which  paved the way for the House last year to pass by unanimous consent H.  Res. 1001, the resolution I introduced recognizing Juneteenth  Independence Day.   Madam Speaker, Juneteenth is as significant to African Americans as  July 4 is to all Americans because on that day, June 19, 155 years ago,  General Gordon Granger, the Commanding Officer of the District of  Texas, rode into Galveston, Texas and announced the freedom of the last  American slaves; belatedly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly two  and a half years after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation  Proclamation.   When General Granger read these words of General Order No. 3 set off  joyous celebrations of the freedmen and woman of Texas:   ``The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a  Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are  free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of  property between former masters and slaves, and the connection  therefore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired  laborer.''   Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas state capital in 1867  under the direction of the Freedmen's Bureau.   Juneteenth remains the oldest known celebration of slavery's demise,  commemorating freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices and  contributions made by courageous African Americans towards making our  great nation the more conscious and accepting country that it has  become.   As the nation prepares to celebrate July 4th, our national day of  independence, it is a time to reflect on the accomplishments of our  nation and its people.   I want to thank the Members of the House for their bipartisan support  of this annual Juneteenth Resolution, which has 214 cosponsors, of  which 202 are original sponsors.   General Granger's reading of General Order No. 3 ended chattel  slavery, a form of perpetual servitude that held generations of  Africans in bondage in the United States for two-hundred and fortyeight  years and opened a new chapter in American history.   Recognizing the importance of this date, former slaves coined the  word ``Juneteenth'' to mark the occasion with a celebration the first  of which occurred in the Texas state capital in 1867 under the  direction of the Freedmen's Bureau.   Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of freedom for people who did  not have it.   Juneteenth remains the oldest known celebration of slavery's demise.   It commemorates freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices and  contributions made by courageous African Americans towards making our  great nation the more conscious and accepting country that it has  become.   The celebration of Juneteenth followed the most devastating conflict  in our country's history, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted  brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor and threatened to  tear the fabric of our union apart forever that America truly became  the land of the free and the home of the brave.   The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``Freedom is never  free,'' and African American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph often  said ``Freedom is never given. It is won.''   Truer words were never spoken.   We should all recognize the power and the ironic truth of those  statements, and we should pause to remember the enormous price paid by  all Americans in our country's quest to realize its promise.   Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years of suffering African  Americans endured under slavery and celebrates the legacy of  perseverance that has become the hallmark of the African American  experience in the struggle for equality.   But Madam Speaker, as the poet Langston Hughes reminds us in his  famous poem, ''Mother to Son,'' life in America for African Americans  ``ain't been no crystal stair.''   The post-bellum period in America was marked by violence and  terrorism against African Americans as they sought to make real the  promises of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.   Nowhere was the reign of terror to which they were subjected to more  horrific than the 1921 Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre, which occurred a  century ago this past May 31-June 1.   Tulsa's Greenwood District, was known as ``Black Wall Street,'' and  was the most prosperous African American community in the United  States.   The Greenwood community with a population of over 10,000 Black people  had stores that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 grocery stores, a  hospital, a savings and loan bank, a post office, three hotels, jewelry  and clothing stores, two movie theaters, a library, pool halls, a bus  and cab service, a nationally recognized school system, six private  airplanes, and two black newspapers.   But on May 31st of that year, the 35 city blocks of Greenwood went up  in flames, at least 300 Black persons were murdered and more than 800  were injured; it is estimated that not less than 9,000 were left  homeless and destitute.   The message of the Tulsa Race Massacre was clear to Black America:  ``Stay in your place. Do not attempt to accumulate and bequeath wealth  or own property. Remember your history in America is as chattel  property.''   Madam Speaker, were they still alive, the domestic terrorists of the  mob in Greenwood would see their evil reenacted--and then followed by a  similar attempt to cover-up it and foster collective amnesia--a century  later in the siege and desecration of the hallowed halls of the U.S.  Capitol, the 'Citadel of Democracy'.   It should not be overlooked that the source of the January 6 white  mob's irrational anger, hatred, and violent reaction was that Black  Americans voted in overwhelming numbers in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee,  Philadelphia, and other enclaves to oust the most proWhite supremacy  President since the Civil War.   Some might ask ``Why dwell on the past? Let us forget unpleasant  things and move on into the future.''   My answer is to quote the great southern writer William Faulkner:  ``The past is never dead. It is not even the past.''   The hatreds, prejudices, resentments, and white supremacy that Black  Americans witnessed and suffered in Greenwood a century ago are not  dead; they are not even past.   So my message to the descendants of the survivors and victims of  slavery, America's Original Sin, is to keep fighting for justice, to  never be silent, to affirm the truth, and seek accountability.   In his famous Second Inaugural Address, President Lincoln spoke of  the profound moral debt owed for ``all the wealth piled by the  bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil,'' and that  the Civil War was the judgment of the Lord, which was ``true and  righteous altogether.''   That debt remains to be paid, which is why African Americans have  always peacefully petitioned the government for the redress of its  grievances.   As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King said at the 1963 March on  Washington:   ``In a sense, we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check.  When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the  Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a  promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.   ``This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as  white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.   ``It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory  note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of  honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a  bad check, a check which has come back marked `insufficient funds.' But  we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to  believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of  opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check--a check  that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of  justice.''   Madam Speaker, H.R. 40, legislation I have introduced, continues this  proud legacy of demanding reparative justice and accountability for  injuries inflicted.   H.R. 40, which establishes a national commission to examine slavery  and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to  the present and recommend appropriate remedies.   Among other requirements, the commission shall identify (1) the role  of federal and state governments in supporting the institution of  slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the public and private sectors  against freed slaves and their descendants; and (3) lingering negative  effects of slavery on living African-Americans and society.   The goal of the historical investigations H.R. 40 mandates is to  bring American society to a new reckoning with how our past affects the  [[Page H2735]]  current conditions of African Americans and to make America a better  place by helping the truly disadvantaged.   Consequently, the reparations movement does not focus on payments to  individuals, but to remedies that can be created in as many forms  necessary to equitably address the many kinds of injuries sustained  from chattel slavery and its continuing vestiges.   To merely focus on finance is an empty gesture and betrays a lack of  understanding of the depth of the unaddressed moral issues that  continue to haunt this nation.   While it might be convenient to assume that we can address the  current divisive racial and political climate in our nation through  race neutral means, experience shows that we have not escaped our  history.   Though the Civil Rights Movement challenged many of the most racist  practices and structures that subjugated the African American  community, it was not followed by a commitment to truth and  reconciliation.   For that reason, the legacy of racial inequality has persisted, and  left the nation vulnerable to a range of problems that continue to  yield division, racial disparities, and injustice.   By passing H.R. 40, Congress can start a movement toward the national  reckoning we need to bridge racial divides.   Reparations are ultimately about respect and reconciliation--and the  hope that one day, all Americans can walk together toward a more just  future.   Official slavery ended with the Civil War and ratification of the  Thirteenth Amendment.   But unofficial slavery was continued with the new institution of  share-crop farming, a criminal justice system that would press convicts  into work once done by slaves, and labor policies that dictated income  for work done based upon skin color.   And, of course, all of this was reinforced by the systematic  disenfranchisement of black Americans, the ``discrete and insular  minority'' excluded from ``those political processes ordinarily to be  relied upon to protect'' them, to quote Chief Justice Hughes' famous  Footnote 4 in United States v. Carolene Products Company, 304 U.S. 144  (1938).   These are just some of the many reasons that the history of the  United States is intertwined with the history of enslaved Africans in  the Americas.   ``There is blood and there are tears, but there is also redemption  and reconciliation.   But to get there, we must have the complete truth and lay our history  bare. It is the light that sheds the way to the more perfect union all  Americans want.   ``The Commission created and empowered by H.R. 40 is a necessary  first step in that effort to get to truth and reconciliation about the  'Original Sin of American Slavery' that is necessary to light the way  to the beloved community we all seek.''   So, Madam Speaker, this is where we are.   In recent years, a number of National Juneteenth Organizations have  arisen to take their place alongside older organizations--all with the  mission to promote and cultivate knowledge and appreciation of African  American history and culture.   Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom while encouraging  self-development and respect for all cultures .   But it must always remain a reminder to us all that liberty and  freedom are precious birthrights of all Americans, which must be  jealously guarded and preserved for future generations.                              Press Statement   Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee Introduces H.R. 1320 the Bipartisan  Juneteenth National Independence Day Act--Currently Has 159 Sponsors in                                 the House         As the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee       on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, I am committed to       affording members of this committee to uncover the facts and       shine light into darkness to reveal the threats posed by `The       Rise of Domestic Terrorism in America.' On January 6, 2021,       the nation and the world witnessed the damage caused by       divisions acerbated by lies and hate.''        Washington, DC--``Today I re-introduced in the House of       Representatives the bipartisan Juneteenth National       Independence Day Act, H.R. 1320, with 102 co-sponsors. The       House re-introduction coincides with the reintroduction of a       Senate companion bill by Senators Markey, Smith, and Booker.       Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, legislation when       enacted would make Juneteenth a federal holiday.       ``Juneteenth,'' is observed on June 19, and commemorates the       end of slavery in the United States and is also known as       ``Emancipation Day,'' ``Jubilee Day,'' and ``Juneteenth       Independence Day.''        ``On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, Texas, Major General       Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3, which announced       that, in accordance with the Emancipation Proclamation, ``all       slaves are free. Juneteenth is currently recognized by 47       states and the District of Columbia as an official state       holiday or observance. In 1980, Texas was the first state to       recognize Juneteenth as a paid state holiday.''        ``Juneteenth honors the end of the years of suffering that       African Americans endured under slavery and celebrates the       legacy of perseverance that has become the hallmark of the       African American experience in the struggle for equality.       These values are shared by millions of Americans who over       generations have held fast to the promise of this nation       while struggling fore basic human rights.''        ``Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom while       encouraging selfdevelopment and respect for all cultures. But       it must always remain a reminder to us all that liberty and       freedom are the precious birthright of all Americans which       must be jealously guarded and preserved for future       generations. As it takes on a more national and even global       perspective, the events of 1865 in Texas are not forgotten,       for all our roots tie back to this fertile soil from which a       national day of pride is growing. This is why we must       establish the Juneteenth Independence Day, as a national       holiday. And today we also pay special tribute to Opal Lee,       the Grandmother of Juneteenth!''

Notes: This table includes the first instance of a state's recognition   of Juneteenth or the first legislation that established Juneteenth as   a state holiday. It excludes legislation adopted by states after the   initial observation year. For example, Kansas adopted multiple   resolutions, such as S. Res. 1866 (2007), S. Res. 1888 (2009), S. Res.   1865 (2011 ), and S. Res. 1754 (2015), subsequent to the original   commemoration. Bolded legislation citations denote that the legislation established   Juneteenth as a state holiday. This includes days of observance and   does not necessarily mean that they are legal holidays. Non-bolded   legislation citations are commemorations or recognitions of the day's   significance. States without links do not have publicly available versions of the bill   or resolution online. Copies can be found on Lexis Advanced or   requested from CRS. a. S. B. 169, 2013-2014 Leg. Sess.

Presidential Proclamations and Remarks         One of the many uses of a presidential proclamation is to       ceremoniously honor a group or call attention to certain       issues or events. Some proclamations and remarks       commemorating Juneteenth from the Compilation of Presidential       Documents include the following:        Statement of the Observance of Juneteenth--President Donald       Trump, June 19, 2019        Statement on the Observance of Juneteenth--President Barack       Obama, June 19, 2016        Message on the Observance of Juneteenth--President George       W.

Clinton,       June 19, 2000        Other presidential proclamations are available through       https://www.govinfo.gov/, a portal for free public access to       official publications from all three branches of the       government, maintained by the Government Publishing Office       (GPO).                     Historical and Cultural Resources         Numerous resources provide information on the history and       culture of the holiday. Some of these include the following:        Smithsonian, ``Juneteenth: Our Other Independence Day.''
