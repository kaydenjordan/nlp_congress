 Mr. Speaker, when the matter of impeaching President  Trump comes to the House floor tomorrow, the House will vote on its  most solemn matter, except for matters of war and peace. Yet, more than  700,000 Americans who reside in our Nation's Capital cannot be  recorded.   It is un-American to deny any Americans who pay Federal taxes the  vote on any bill. That denial is even more unconscionable, considering  that D.C. residents pay the highest Federal taxes per capita in the  United States.   The 23rd Amendment of our Constitution gave D.C. residents the right  to vote for President and Vice President. It should follow, as day  follows night, that D.C. residents should have the vote to remove the  President, as well.   Yet another reason, Mr. Speaker, the House will pass our D.C.  statehood bill this session.                            ____________________
