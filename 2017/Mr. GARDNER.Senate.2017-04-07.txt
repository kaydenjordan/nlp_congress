 Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee for the work he carried out over the past several  months as this nomination proceeded.   Mostly, I want to congratulate Judge Neil Gorsuch on his confirmation  to the U.S. Supreme Court.   While people in this Chamber voted yea or nay--some voted yes and  some voted no--we all recognize the heavy obligation that now falls on  the shoulders of Judge Gorsuch as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   We will lean on Judge Gorsuch to make sure our Constitution is  enforced. The American people will lean on Judge Gorsuch to make sure  justice is dispensed impartially, with equality--that justice is indeed  blind.   To Judge Gorsuch and his family, congratulations.   To the people of this Chamber who worked so hard over the past  several weeks and months to assure this moment happened, thank you.   To the great State of Colorado, it is an honor to have a fourth- generation Coloradan--a man of the West, with grit and determination-- join the Nation's High Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
