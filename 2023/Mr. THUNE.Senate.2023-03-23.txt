 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, the U.S. Trade Representative  is testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on President Biden's  2023 trade policy agenda, and I look forward to asking her about the  details of the Biden administration's plans--or lack thereof--to boost  trade opportunities for American workers, farmers and ranchers, and  businesses.   Trade has been a very low priority on the President's list throughout  the first 2 years of his administration. To name just one example, it  took the President a year and a half to nominate a confirmable chief  agricultural negotiator at the U.S. Trade Representative's office even  though agriculture is a U.S. industry that depends upon trade.   If the President has deemphasized trade, he has really deemphasized  trade--that is, removing trade and tariff barriers and increasing  market access for American producers. The administration is currently  negotiating exactly zero comprehensive free trade agreements; and its  so-called trade initiative frameworks are, largely, flowery rhetoric  with little to nothing in the way of tangible and durable benefits for  American workers.   Tariff reduction and increased market access--the hallmarks of free  trade agreements--are notably missing in action from the Biden  administration's trade initiatives. In fact, President Biden's Trade  Representative has openly said that the Indo-Pacific economic  framework--perhaps the President's signature trade initiative--was  designed not--not--to include tariff reduction.   So why is this a problem?   Well, first of all, it is a problem because trade is essential to our  economy. More than 41 million U.S. jobs depend on trade, and that  includes a lot of jobs at small businesses. In fact, 98 percent of U.S.  exporters are small businesses--a stat that includes many farmers and  ranchers in South Dakota and around the country--and ignoring or  deemphasizing trade puts those jobs in jeopardy.   But it is not just that our economy already depends on trade, it is  that trade, specifically free trade--trade characterized by low or no  tariffs and fewer market barriers--is a powerful engine of prosperity  and economic growth. To name just one example, U.S. farm and food  product exports grew from $46.1 billion in 1994 to more than $177  billion in 2021, largely due to greater market access opportunities for  American exporters.   Free trade helps create economic prosperity. It opens new jobs and  opportunities for American workers. It helps grow U.S. businesses and,  by extension, our economy. President Biden has tended to deemphasize  the benefits of trade for our economy and for American workers and has  suggested that trade and a robust U.S. manufacturing footprint are  somehow in competition. But increased trade actually helps domestic  manufacturing. Sixty percent of U.S. imports are intermediary goods or  [[Page S919]]  materials for use in American manufacturing. Removing unnecessary  barriers to trade in those goods would generally lower the prices for  those materials, which would help and not hurt manufacturing.   And while we are talking about lowering prices, I should note that  expanding U.S. free trade would promote lower prices for a lot of the  goods that Americans buy and would help ease some of the supply chain  problems we have been experiencing. That could help alleviate the  historic inflation crisis that the President and Democrats have helped  to create and improve the economic outlook for Americans. But while  economic benefits are a leading reason to prioritize increased trade,  they are far from the only reason.   Free trade agreements don't just provide an opportunity for economic  growth; they also provide an opportunity to develop important strategic  relationships and foster ties with our allies. Free trade agreements  don't just cement economic ties between countries; they cement  friendships. They also provide an opportunity to advance U.S.  priorities abroad--security priorities, economic priorities, diplomatic  priorities, and more.    As I said, the President has deemphasized trade during the first 2  years of his administration; but while the U.S. has been inactive in  the trade space, the rest of the world has not. For example, China  recently joined the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership--a  trade agreement that eventually will eliminate more than 90 percent of  tariffs on commerce in 15 member countries. China is also negotiating  or implementing a number of new trade agreements to add to those of  which it is currently a part.   And China is far from the only country pushing ahead with free trade  agreements while the United States is sitting on the sidelines. We may  be a world superpower, but we have just 14 free trade agreements  currently in effect with 20 countries, meaning that many of our goods  and services face significant tariff barriers in most places around the  globe. Now, by comparison, the European Union has 46 trade agreements  with 78 countries, meaning that European goods often have a leg up on  the global stage.   Under the Biden administration, the United States is getting left  behind when it comes to global trade, and if we don't meaningfully  reenter the trade arena, we are going to slip further and further  behind. I believe that an excellent way to reenter the trade arena  would be to conclude a free trade agreement with one of our closest  friends and allies, the United Kingdom--something that is long overdue.   Earlier this month, I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Chris  Coons. It is called the Undertaking Negotiations on Investment and  Trade for Economic Dynamism Act, or the UNITED Act--the acronym. The  legislation is designed to advance a free trade agreement with the  United Kingdom. Our legislation would authorize the administration to  negotiate and conclude a trade agreement with the United Kingdom to  open export opportunities for businesses of all sizes, increase the  resilience of critical supply chains, and advance economic prosperity  for people in both of our countries.   At a time of financial and geopolitical turbulence, cementing our  relationships with our allies should be a top priority; and an  agreement with the United Kingdom--our Nation's fifth largest export  market and our largest services trading partner in the entire world-- would further strengthen the ties that bind our two nations while  resulting in economic gains for both British and American citizens.   Important groundwork toward a comprehensive free trade agreement has  already been laid, including the bilateral negotiations initiated by  President Trump's and President Biden's attempts to strengthen economic  cooperation through the U.S./UK Dialogue on the Future of Atlantic  Trade; and with the recently announced Windsor Framework, which  provides a pathway on post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern  Ireland, the timing is right to kick-start negotiations.   An agreement with the United Kingdom would further strengthen the  ties that bind our two nations while resulting in economic gains for  both American and British citizens.   While the administration may have put trade at the bottom of its  priority list over the past 2 years, the President's Trade  Representative, Katherine Tai, seems to have at least kept the door  open to working on increased market access--that is, tariff reduction-- and real trade agreements. For the sake of our country, I hope the  administration will follow through.   The Biden administration may have gotten off to a very slow start on  the trade front, but it is not too late to turn things around. I  strongly urge the President to turn his focus to a more ambitious trade  agenda, one that will provide durable economic and security benefits to  American workers and businesses and advance American leadership in the  world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr.  McConnell).

Mr. President, today I recognize the life and leadership  of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, a global spiritual leader known  universally as the Rebbe, and head of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.   The Rebbe was born in 1902 and lived through the darkest periods of  history, escaping the evils of Russian communism and the horrors of  Nazi Germany. In 1941, the Rebbe and his wife Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka  arrived safely on the shores of the United States, where he worked  tirelessly to resuscitate, rebuild, and guide world Jewry after the  holocaust.   The Rebbe exemplified an ideal and value we need today: to give of  ourselves selflessly for the betterment of those around us. The Rebbe  urged us all to become ambassadors for goodness and kindness and  explained that education must not be limited to the academics necessary  for making a good living, but rather focus on the ethics, morals, and  values that serve as the bedrock of civilization.   One result of the Rebbe's leadership is the Chabad-Lubavitch movement  which, by following his teachings and example, became the world's  largest Jewish educational organization. Today, there are more than  3,500 permanent Chabad-Lubavitch centers providing educational,  religious, and humanitarian programming in all 50 States, including in  my home State of South Dakota, and in 109 countries. The Rebbe's  teachings and scholarship are published in more than 400 volumes and  are translated in dozens of languages.   The Rebbe recognized America's unique role as a force for good and  had meaningful relationships with several of our Nation's leaders, who  saw him as the moral guide of so many. For the Rebbe, America was a  beacon of light of historic proportions to be utilized in influencing  the moral betterment of all humanity, and he often pointed to the words  ``In God We Trust'' enshrined on our currency as a defining element of  the great American story.  [[Page S930]]    For more than four decades, every U.S. President has declared the  annual observance of Education and Sharing Day in honor of the  anniversary of the Rebbe's birth and in recognition of his  contributions to the betterment of education for all people. In 1995,  he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his contributions  toward education, morality, and acts of charity.   Education and Sharing Day represents an excellent opportunity for us  to reflect on the Rebbe's vision and leadership. May we take his  teachings to heart.                            ____________________
