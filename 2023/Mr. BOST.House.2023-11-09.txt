 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the impact our veteran  community has made on the United States' economy. Our Nation owes our  veterans a debt of gratitude.   As a Marine Corps veteran, I am proud to lead a resolution with my  friend and the VA Committee Ranking Member, Mark Takano, to designate  this week as Veterans Employment Week.   Military service provides a unique and valuable experience that  equips veterans with a range of skills and qualities that can easily  transfer into the workforce.   Through their service, veterans learn discipline, leadership,  teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, and resilience, among other  skills.   These skills are highly sought after by employers across various  industries and can be leveraged to excel in a wide range of careers.   Additionally, veterans often bring a strong work ethic and a sense of  duty that can contribute to a positive and productive work environment.  Hiring veterans not only benefits the individual, but also  organizations as a whole.   Without veterans in the workforce, America would not be a world  leader in innovation and economic growth.   I am so grateful to the men and women who have served our country and  continue to serve with their participation in the economy.                            ____________________
