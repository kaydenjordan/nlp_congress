 Mr. President, I am proud to follow my colleagues who  [[Page S5497]]  have spoken on the floor, particularly Senators Carper and Duckworth,  and to join them today, for they are in the great tradition of this  body--Bob Dole, Daniel Inouye, Tammy Duckworth, Tom Carper, and John  McCain. We have known our share of heroes, and I am here to say thank  you to them and to the others among us who have served.   I am proud to be here as a dad of two veterans--one a combat infantry  officer in the Marine Corps, another a special operator in the Navy.  Both are deployed. I myself served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. I  am here to say to the other moms and dads and loved ones that Donald  Trump does not speak for me; that Donald Trump does not speak for us;  and that Donald Trump does not speak for America.   When he called those brave heroes who laid down their lives  ``suckers'' or ``losers,'' my first reaction was disbelief. Then, in an  instant, it was totally to believe that he had said it because it was  so much in character for Donald Trump. For him, it is all about Donald  Trump. If somebody else can serve and take his place without there  being sacrifice on his part, so much the better. Donald Trump does not  speak for the America I know and love or for those who have given of  themselves or risked their lives, like my colleagues who have spoken  today.   When Donald Trump talked about the heroes of Belleau Wood, he could  have used a history lesson because, clearly, the marines at Belleau  Wood were not suckers. In fact, the relentless tenacity of their  fighting earned them a nickname from the German soldiers who were their  adversaries. The Germans called them ``Teufelshunde,'' meaning ``devil  dog.'' This proud moniker has stuck with them all of these years, and  they use it when addressing each other--``devil dog.'' That is what  they were.   One of their commanding officers, Maj. Thomas Holcomb, wrote a letter  to his wife 2 days into battle, which reads:         The regiment has carried itself with undying glory, but the       price was heavy. . . . There never was such self-sacrifice,       courage, and spirit shown.    In the 3 weeks of fighting, the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade  suffered a 55-percent casualty rate--55 percent. His battalion alone  suffered 764 casualties out of 900 men. He became the 17th Commandant  of the Marine Corps and Belleau Wood became part of Marine Corps  history. That battle was one of hundreds, even thousands of battles,  where soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines distinguished themselves  with uncommon valor. For every Belleau Wood, there are other battles  for each of those services. None of them fought like suckers or losers.    The cost of war is unspeakably high, and we know that from our own  work on the Armed Services Committee and on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee. I had just come from a hearing of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee where we were discussing the problem of veteran suicide.  Twenty of our heroes take their own lives every day. Yet we in this  body have failed to provide effective solutions to those invisible  wounds that caused those deaths. That is a national disgrace.   So, to the loved ones of those who have risked and given their lives,  we are here to make a point. This resolution makes that point  eloquently and powerfully. Donald Trump speaks for no one in this body,  as far as I know, and it is a shame that our Republican colleagues are  literally absent. They are absent without leave. They are AWOL from  this moment in history that calls upon them to stand up and be heard in  the name of our Nation's heroes. Thank you.   I yield the floor.
