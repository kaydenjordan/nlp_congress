 I think we are a little beyond our time on this side, but  I am grateful for my friend from Rhode Island who is willing to let me  have a chance to make the points I wanted to make. And I think, as is  often the case here, many of them have already been made and were just  made pretty well by Senator Portman, certainly, in the spending bill he  was talking about and the tax bill that he was talking about.   We keep hearing that a majority of all Americans like these programs;  that if they could just know what was in the bill, they would like the  bill. We are going to have some time now over the next few weeks, I am  confident, to talk about what is in the bill. These are programs that  are supposed to make life better for everyday Americans. Things like  paid family leave, I am sure would be helpful in many, many cases.   But what the Senator from Ohio was just talking about, you know, four  times what this bill would spend on paid family leave it pays on tax  cuts for the wealthiest families.   When people begin to look at that, they are going to have to wonder,  how is that priority established to where  [[Page S9071]]  the second biggest spending item in the entire bill would be tax cuts  for the wealthiest families in America--$230 billion of that $1.7  trillion is tax cuts for those families. The deductibility of State and  local taxes goes from $10,000 as a cap to $80,000 as a cap.   Let me just repeat what I think I just heard, which was that 70  percent of this tax break--70 percent of that entire $230 billion--goes  to the top 5 percent of all taxpayers; 94 percent goes to the top 20  percent; and 85 percent goes to the top 10 percent.   Those are pretty big numbers in a bill that is supposed to make life  easier for everyday American challenges.   Now, I am sure the top 5 percent of all taxpayers have their own  challenges. I am also sure they are different than my challenges, but  they are not the challenges that everyday Americans face. It is pretty  amazing, I think, in all the discussion of what this bill is designed  to do, that that is what would happen.                               Vaccine Mandate    Madam President, let me talk about one other topic as I make way here  for the Senator from Rhode Island. I want to talk a little bit about  the vaccine mandate and what I am hearing about that.   Yesterday, in a vote in the Senate on the Congressional Review Act,  which is when we have an opportunity to look at regulations proposed by  the administration, 52 Senators from both parties--Senators from both  parties made up that 52--voted not to go forward with this mandate.   It is very possible to be pro-vaccine and not pro-mandate. I am pro- vaccine. Over and over again, I have recommended to my friends and my  family that you get the first shot and, now, if you are available for  the booster shot after you have had either one or two of the other  shots, to get that one too. The vaccines have made a big difference.  Frankly, my advice would be, unless your doctor tells you you shouldn't  do this, I think you ought to do it.   The mandate just appears not to be working. I am not even going to  assume it was designed in a way that the administration thought it  would have the impact it appears to be having, but it is clear and it  is out there. You know it, and I know it.   I have visited with Missouri hospital administrators, and they may  have been at a place where, just a few days ago, if that mandate had  gone into effect, you couldn't have gotten Medicare or Medicaid  patients paid for at your hospital if you weren't 100-percent  vaccinated.   Now, fortunately, a Federal court said: No, we are not sure the  President has the authority to do that, so we are going to postpone  that.   But as we approached that deadline, I kept hearing more and more  hospital administrators say: We think we can get almost all of our  professional staff vaccinated, but we are not even sure about that. We  are absolutely sure we can't get 100 percent of the people--those who  work in the cafeteria, who mop the floors, and who provide security for  the building--vaccinated. So we wouldn't be able to participate in  those programs, and that would create a serious problem, particularly  in small, rural hospitals.   There is the next mandate, the one for every group that has more than  100 employees in it. All kinds of police officers, for whatever reason,  either don't want to get vaccinated or don't want to be told they have  to be vaccinated. You know, we have enough problems right now in  finding police officers and firemen and first responders that, if you  delete those forces, our current problems will be even bigger. That is  what will happen.   If you have got that 100-person force but you still want to be a  police officer, in all likelihood, within driving distance, there is a  20-person police force or a 5-person police force. It may be a little  easier, safer job anyway, and you will not have to be told by the  government what you have to do.   I am hearing that from schools. We have schools where the National  Guard is driving school buses. By the way, a lot of the people in the  National Guard are thinking about leaving the National Guard if they  have to do something like this.   You know, what people really, I think, resent is when government  tells them: You have to do this, and you have to do it for your own  good.   If it is for your own good, that is probably a decision that you  should be allowed to make.   Whether you are allowed to make it or not, this is the response to  all of these mandates, whether it is the Health and Human Services  mandate on hospitals; the mandate on Federal contractors--and, by the  way, we need those Federal contractors or we wouldn't have contracted  with them--or the mandate on policemen and firemen and grocery store  workers.   I saw a number the other day of 50-some percent--I think it was 56  percent--of the people who work in a grocery store would rather work  somewhere else after what they have gone through in the last year:  shorthanded; more people getting food at the grocery store than ever  before. They are looking for a reason to say: OK. I am done with this.   We need our grocery store workers. We need our healthcare providers.  We need our policemen. We need our firemen. We need our school bus  drivers. We need our schoolteachers.   This is not working. Fortunately, up to now, Federal judge after  Federal judge has said: We don't think you have the authority to do  this, and we are going to suspend the implementation of these mandates.   I think this gives the Biden administration a chance to look at this  again and realize that the unintended consequences of what they were  trying to do might be more significant than the consequences of what  would happen if you forced compliance.   I thank my friend for giving us a few extra minutes.   I yield the floor.
