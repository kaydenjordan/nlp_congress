 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this is another unserious amendment. We have  had over 50 of these. Every one that has been put to a roll call vote  has lost, and this one will, as well, I hope.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this seems to be the substance of the  Republican response to all the issues that the gentlewoman raises.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I don't want to prolong this debate, but to  hear about election denial from the other side of the aisle is  extraordinary, and it is extraordinarily inconsistent with the  performance of the former President who lied regularly.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from  Connecticut, and I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Cartwright), who is the distinguished ranking member of the  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0930                   Amendment No. 101 Offered by Ms. Tenney     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the proposed rule promotes transparency by  requiring Federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas  emissions and climate-related financial risks. This transparency  enhances accountability and helps the government and the American  people make informed decisions regarding its contracts.   By addressing climate-related financial risk, the rule encourages  businesses to assess and mitigate their exposure to climate-related  challenges. This proactive approach is critical in addressing the  financial implications of climate change and fosters sustainability.   Access to data on greenhouse gas emissions and climate risk enables  the government to make more informed procurement decisions. This means  selecting contractors that are actively addressing climate change and  demonstrating environmental responsibility.   Mr. Chair, for all those reasons, I strongly oppose the adoption of  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will not characterize it as rightwing or  leftwing, but what the gentlewoman does not talk about, of course, is  the donor base of the Republican Party and the interests that exist  that do not want this transparency.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have great respect for my friend from  Missouri, and it seems to me that this is a very serious matter that  she has raised.  [[Page H5660]]    It is also my belief that it ought to be considered in the context of  the Financial Services Committee and legislation propounded and offered  to this House for careful consideration of the serious assertions that  the gentlewoman makes. We ought to have the time to debate and fully  understand the ramifications of the actions that the gentlewoman speaks  of. However, in the context of this bill, we don't have the opportunity  to really make that kind of assertion or analysis.   The authority granted to the Financial Stability Oversight Council,  FSOC, to require supervision and regulation of certain nonbank  financial companies helps mitigate systemic risks in the financial  system. I was here in 2008, and we saw that. We saw it at great cost to  the economy and to individuals. By identifying and regulating  systemically important nonbank entities, FSOC can prevent potential  destabilizing events that could harm the broader economy.   The 2008 financial crisis highlighted, Mr. Chairman, the need to  monitor and regulate nonbank financial firms that can pose very  significant risks. The FSOC's authority fosters a coordinated  regulatory approach, ensuring that nonbank financial companies are  subject to appropriate oversight without duplicating efforts across  different regulatory agencies.   Mr. Chair, this may well be something that ought to be the subject of  greater discussion by the committee of jurisdiction and expertise, but  I strongly oppose the amendment and urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I thank the gentlewoman for her  observations and concern because, obviously, the conclusion that she  makes would be of concern to all of us. I simply suggest that this is  not the proper place for us to give the analysis and assess the  correctness of the assertion that has been made in terms of cost.   We have experienced a time where a failure to deal with nonbanks cost  this economy one of its deepest recessions since I have been in the  Congress of the United States.   I have no reason to believe one way or the other whether the  gentlewoman's assertion is correct because I just don't know. She is a  member of the Financial Services Committee, to my understanding, and if  her assertion is correct, then I think a bipartisan bill ought to be  brought to the floor and considered.   However, I think at this juncture this amendment ought to be  rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its defeat, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman indicates that he came from  the private sector. I am sure he was very successful in the private  sector, as he has been in public life. In the private sector, one of  the things that we admire is the ability to innovate, adjust, and to  make changes when those are demanded by the marketplace.   This amendment undermines the ability of the Small Business  Administration to do exactly that: to innovate and reach more small  businesses by taking away the agency's pilot loan authority.   The gentleman is the chairman of the committee and knows better than  I, but pilot loan authority is the flexibility to assess the market,  assess the need, and take action. If they don't have that authority,  then, as some have argued in numerous amendments here, the Congress  ought to take that responsibility. Congress has not taken  responsibility very well, Mr. Chairman. We are not doing things we  ought to do.   If the private sector or the SBA were as inefficient and ineffective  as the Congress of the United States, we would shut it down, but of  course we can't shut down the Congress. We can just lament the fact  that we can't do  [[Page H5661]]  our work, that we don't respond in a timely fashion.   I am particularly concerned about Ukraine, under assault by a  despotic power. They need resources from the United States. By the way,  I read a report today that the United States is not the biggest  contributor to Ukraine. We are certainly the major partner. The EU and  others, including Japan, are the major partners because they want to  defend freedom. I am concerned about the fact that we haven't acted to  send a message to Putin, to Iran, to other despots that we will not  shrink from the responsibility of defending freedom here and around the  world.   This authority, in a microcosm, is to try to give the SBA the  opportunity to respond in a timely and effective fashion to  opportunities that it sees on behalf of small businesses. Pilot 7(a)  loans are provided by SBA to address the development of a specific  sector or geographical region based on the agency's identified needs.   We can shut everybody down in government, and unfortunately, frankly,  government is very risk averse, not as nimble as the private sector.   Why? It is because the administrators of all these agencies know that  they have got us looking over their shoulder, and if they make a slight  mistake, they have an amendment or they have a hearing or they have  some Congressman or Congresswoman who says: A-ha, gotcha.   If the private sector had that, it would be immobilized. It wouldn't  help because in the private sector, we understand that mistakes happen  because you are taking risks. By definition, risks sometimes result in  not succeeding or they wouldn't be a risk.   When we have an amendment like this--and we have had a number of  amendments like this, and concerns expressed--I get that. However, it  seems to me in this instance when my friend starts by saying he is in  the private sector, I welcome his experience. It is critically  important. We are the most successful economy on Earth because we allow  people to take risks. By definition, some fail. Obviously, most fail,  as a matter of fact. However, some are extraordinarily successful  because they took that risk. Now, what needs to happen, of course, in  the course of risking is when you find a failure, you stop it.   Mr. Chair, I urge that we reject this amendment because it precludes  the SBA from taking chances when they are available and can be  successful.
