 Mr. Speaker, there aren't too many of us here on the  floor today who were here in 1996, when I supported a balanced budget  amendment. It did pass the House. It failed by one vote in the Senate.    Had it become law, George Bush could not have invaded Iraq and  simultaneously cut taxes and blown the projected surplus into a huge  deficit and debt.   But here we are today.   Now, this debate was actually scheduled for April 1. You know, April  Fools' Day. But the House was on its Easter recess, so this is as soon  as they could bring it up on the floor.   But it is an April fool. This is an April fool.   Now, we had one colleague call it chutzpah. I was trying to think of  ways to describe it: dissimulation, insincerity, false piousness,  hypocrisy.   Not this balanced budget amendment; not at this time.   They have just cut revenues by $3 trillion. We are projecting a  deficit of $1 trillion in 2 years, and they are saying they want to cut  taxes more.   Well, then that means something else has got to go. And Speaker Ryan  has already talked about what the something else is. It is Medicare,  Social Security, and Medicaid. Those are the things that have got to  go.   Well, there is a dirty, little secret about Social Security. I was  actually using this on 9/11. I will have to get an updated version.   But there actually is a Social Security trust fund, and this is a  depository instrument for the Social Security trust fund, and it is  here backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the  United States of America to be paid to the Federal Old-age and  Survivors Insurance Fund.   There are $3 trillion that have been collected from every working  American in the Social Security trust fund.   Now, we have an aging population. There is a problem, but it could be  fixed. But the point is, under this amendment, if it was law today,  Social Security benefits would be cut today because, under this  amendment, Social Security could only spend its income, which this year  was $40 billion less than its outlays.                                time  1415    What did it do? It cashed in some of its $3 trillion of assets and  they paid full Social Security benefits.   So if this little dream that they have here going passed, every  American would have seen their Social Security reduced by $643 this  year, and every year that number would grow, while the $3 trillion  already collected from the American people to pay benefits would never  be paid out. Talk about false promises to the American people. That is  one heck of a false promise.   I have introduced a balanced budget amendment that makes a little  more sense. It can't have these OCO, overseas contingency operation,  funds where we shower $50 billion, $100 billion on the Pentagon, and it  doesn't count. We are borrowing the money. It is creating debt, but it  doesn't count. It is off budget. Don't worry about it.   Under my amendment, unless you had a declared war, unless Congress  had the guts to declare a war when we have to fight someone overseas,  you couldn't have that kind of overseas contingency operation fund and  do money off the books.   My balanced budget amendment also would protect the Social Security  and Medicare trust funds from those who would rob from that trust fund  and begin to immediately reduce benefits for Social Security and  Medicare.   This is a ruse. Talk about the most drunken sailor spending money and  then, whoa, I have got a wicked headache. Let's pass a balanced budget  amendment. Maybe that will cure it. It ain't going to cure it. We need  fiscal responsibility around here, and it has got to be a balance of  rescinding some of their obscene tax cuts--$3 trillion worth--which  would go a long way toward helping move us toward a balanced budget,  and imposing a little fiscal discipline on the Pentagon.   The Pentagon has yet to be audited. The only agency of the Federal  Government that cannot be audited happens to get the largest, single  discretionary grant of money every year. Once, I did manage to pass an  amendment on the floor with Representative Frelinghuysen to require an  audit. Guess what? That disappeared in the conference committee because  the Pentagon can't be audited, doesn't want to be audited, and they  just need more money. Don't worry, they will spend it wisely.   So let's talk about real fiscal discipline around here, real balance,  and a real balanced budget amendment that protects the assets of the  Social Security trust fund and Medicare.   The people don't care about that. They want to kill it.
