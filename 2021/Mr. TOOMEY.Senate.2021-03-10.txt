 Mr. President, I rise this morning to oppose the  nomination of Representative Fudge to serve as the Secretary of the  Department of Housing and Urban Development.   The confirmation of Cabinet Secretaries is one of the most important  constitutional functions we have here in the Senate. I think most of my  colleagues would agree that one of the important considerations is that  Cabinet officials can be relied on to coordinate and work productively  with Congress as they implement the policies of the legislation that we  pass.   I am concerned that Representative Fudge's past rhetoric makes clear  that she lacks the temperament to collaborate with Congress,  particularly across the aisle with Republican Members, and her comments  cast doubt on whether she even wants to.   Congresswoman Fudge has made multiple statements throughout the years  attacking and disparaging the integrity and motives of Republicans with  whom she has policy disagreements. Policy disagreements are entirely  understandable. It is reasonable. They happen every day. They are  expected, especially in a legislative body. But consistently attacking  the integrity and motives of people with whom you have these  disagreements is another thing all together.   In September 2020, during a speech on the House floor, Congresswoman  Fudge attacked efforts to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on  the Supreme Court. In her speech, she said, among other insults, that  Senate Republicans had ``no decency,'' ``no honor,'' ``no integrity.''  She went on to say, referring to Republican Senators, that we ``are a  disgrace to the Nation.''   In June 2020, during a virtual townhall, Congresswoman Fudge admitted  believing that Republicans did not care about minorities. She said that  if Republicans ``want to save face and let this country know that they  care even a little bit about people of color, which I don't believe  they do, but if they want to try, I want to listen.''   Back in a January of 2013 PBS forum with Tavis Smiley, Congresswoman  Fudge harshly questioned the motives and character of Republicans  again, this time Republicans who supported cuts to the food stamps  program.   Congresswoman Fudge said:         If we continue to send people to Congress who don't even       understand what their job is--who don't understand that       government's job is to take care of its people--then we are       never going anywhere as a country because we deal with nuts       every single day. These people are evil and mean. They care       nothing about anybody but themselves. And so if you think you       are going to have something bipartisan, you need to think       again. It's not happening.    Overtly partisan attacks on integrity and motive simply have a toxic  and detrimental impact on the working relationship that ought to be a  constructive relationship between Members of Congress and members of  the administration. The Senate should really only confirm officers who  are willing to cooperate with legislators, especially now when we have  rapid expansion of many government programs--we just passed a $2  trillion bill that is probably going to pass the House and be signed by  the President--and it is especially true for the administrator of HUD.   In addition to her recent statements impugning the integrity and  motives of Republicans, Congresswoman Fudge has very little or no  housing experience. Except for her service as a smalltown mayor,  Congresswoman Fudge never worked in a capacity where she would be  familiar with any of HUD's many programs. Even traditionally liberal  media outlets criticized  [[Page S1443]]  Congresswoman Fudge's nomination for HUD Secretary on the grounds that  she lacked knowledge and experience in housing policy.   She did not show an interest in developing housing policy expertise  as a Member of Congress, introducing or cosponsoring very few housing- related bills and choosing instead to serve on unrelated committees. I  acknowledge that not all Cabinet nominees are experts in the policy  areas that their Agencies cover. That is not unusual. But when they  don't have that expertise, it is especially important that their  temperament and their policy views--and their willingness to listen to  Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, especially the other  side of the aisle, is all the more important.   Congresswoman Fudge's views as reflected in her response to questions  for the record are also a matter of concern. When she was asked whether  HUD should better target its programs so that they are actually helping  the low-income Americans they are supposed to help, she responded by  saying, ``The challenge for HUD programs isn't that they aren't  targeted, it is that funding levels are inadequate to meet the need.''   The fact is, funding for HUD spending has grown dramatically in  recent years. That is not even including the $15 billion for COVID  assistance that the Senate appropriated and worked on, and it is not  including the $56 billion for housing assistance passed in the December  omnibus and the reconciliation bill.    The Congresswoman's answer ignores the fact that HUD programs  certainly can be better targeted to help those in need. For example,  families with disqualifying high incomes nevertheless participate in a  number of HUD-assisted rental programs, and that makes housing  unavailable for lower income families for whom it is meant. FHA insures  mortgages for home buyers who could access mortgage credit through  private capital, also thereby making it less available for people who  really need it.   So I worry that Congresswoman Fudge's approach will simply be to ask  Congress for ever more money without being willing to do the hard work  of making the reforms that are necessary and working with Republican  Senators to achieve those reforms. Those reforms are going to be  necessary if we are going to ensure that HUD programs are improved so  they actually better serve the low-income Americans they are meant for.   For these reasons, I cannot support Congresswoman Fudge's nomination.   I yield the floor.
