 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise for this big and bold For the People legislation.   We have been called back again into this great Chamber because we  can't quit living, because the world placed us here in unprecedented  times, not in control of this virus and events happening to us, but to  bring bold and big legislation for the people to speak to the human  conditions by creating a heroes fund to give frontline workers the  hazard pay they deserve, to make significant investments in State and  local governments, direct payments to families, fair elections,  housing, testing, contact tracing, and other priorities I proudly  support.   The bill also includes language that I have championed to put a  moratorium on consumer debt collection, to open up forgivable loans to  more nonprofits, ban the box for small business loans, and to make sure  that the smallest businesses can get a PPP loan, only to name a few.   I challenge my colleagues to join us and vote for this big and bold  bill. Americans deserve every penny of it.
