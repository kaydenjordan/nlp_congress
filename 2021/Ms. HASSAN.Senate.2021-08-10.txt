 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3278 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I rise today to offer a bipartisan  amendment to promote U.S. competitiveness and support American  innovation.   The R&D tax credit provides critical support and tax relief to the  small businesses and startups that power our economy. These businesses  are job creators, helping spur innovation in New Hampshire and across  the country.   This bipartisan amendment with Senator Young would build on efforts  to expand the R&D tax credit for startups, while protecting the tax  incentives that allow U.S. companies, startups, and small businesses to  stay competitive in our global marketplace and out compete China.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield my time to  the Senator from Indiana.    Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Tyler  Blanchette of Hudson as August's Granite Stater of the Month. Tyler has  helped run an annual fundraiser outside his family's home in the middle  of the winter to raise money for the Alzheimer's Association and has  continued this effort even as he faces his own brain cancer diagnosis.   The yearly fundraiser began on a chilly day in the winter of 2009  when Tyler's older brother Brandon decided to sell hot chocolate on his  front lawn to raise money to support Alzheimer's research. The  inspiration behind the fundraiser stemmed from their great-grandfather,  nicknamed ``Big Papa,'' who was diagnosed with the disease and died  from it when Brandon and Tyler were young.   Once Brandon grew older and moved out of the Blanchette's home, Tyler  eagerly took over running the event--making the signs, brewing the hot  chocolate, and getting the word out to the community.   The fundraiser, named Big Papa's Cocoa Stand in honor of Tyler's  great-grandfather, sells hot chocolate for $1 to friends, neighbors,  and community members who come by for a hot drink and a good cause. All  of the sales go to the Massachusetts/New Hampshire chapter of the  Alzheimer's Association, and since its founding, Tyler's family has  raised approximately $30,000 for the organization.   Four years ago, Tyler was diagnosed with brain cancer, a diagnosis he  is living with today. Yet he was determined to continue helping others  by running the cocoa stand. Tyler never let his diagnosis stand in the  way of his goal to raise money for the organization that is working to  find a cure for the disease that took his great-grandfather's life.   Despite incredible adversity, Tyler has exemplified the spirit of the  Granite State by forging on and serving his community no matter the  circumstances. It is a mark of Tyler's compassion and grit that he  continues to operate this fundraiser as he battles his own health  challenges. I am proud to honor Tyler for his efforts and will pray for  him and his family during this difficult time.                            ____________________
