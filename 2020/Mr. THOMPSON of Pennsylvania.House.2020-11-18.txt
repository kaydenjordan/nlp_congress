 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Marilyn Black of Oil City, Pennsylvania, and congratulate her on her  retirement.   I cannot possibly overstate Marilyn's impact on Oil City and the  surrounding area. Marilyn served as the vice president for Heritage  Development of the Oil Region Alliance of Business, Industry & Tourism  for 15 years.   In those 15 years, Marilyn worked tirelessly to preserve the region's  heritage in some of the region's most precious historical sites,  including: the Tarbell House, Neilltown Church, and Coal Oil Johnny  House, just to name a few.   Marilyn's hard work and dedication has not gone unnoticed. Earlier  this year, Bill Moon, the mayor of Oil City, Pennsylvania, declared  June 13 to be Marilyn Black Day.   I think Betsy Kellner, secretary of the Oil Region Alliance's board  of directors, summed it up best: ``When you look around the community  at the many accomplishments that have happened, you can see Marilyn's  touch.''   When Marilyn is not hard at work for the oil region, she enjoys the  outdoors, spending time fishing, boating, kayaking, hiking, and more.   I would like to send my very best wishes to Marilyn as she begins her  much-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
