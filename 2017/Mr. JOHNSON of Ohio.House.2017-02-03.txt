 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a  stalwart public servant. Dan Halliburton started his public service  career as a law enforcement officer, eventually retiring in 2009 from  the Ohio State Highway Patrol with over 32 years of service.   But he didn't stop there. He felt the call to serve more, and in  2010, Dan joined my team, tasked with representing the largest  geographical and most rural district in the State of Ohio.   Very quickly, Dan distinguished himself as a man of and for the  people. He expertly managed my transportation so that we could be out  amongst the people I represent. He built lasting relationships with  local elected officials, law enforcement, and business owners. But what  set Dan apart, was his genuine care and concern for the people of  Appalachia. It was reflected in the high level of service he provided  them.   So on behalf of the hardworking people of eastern and southeastern  Ohio, Godspeed to Dan Halliburton and his family as he begins his well- deserved retirement.                            ____________________
