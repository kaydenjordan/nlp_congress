 Madam President, as chairman of the Veterans Committee,  for the last 4 years I have had the privilege of working with Dean  Heller from Nevada.   In his opening remarks in his farewell speech, he spoke about his  compassion for veterans. I have seen it up close and personal. His  value as a member of that committee to me is invaluable. I could not  have had a better member.   We had a lot of tough votes that had to be taken. A lot of times I  had to count noses, and I knew I could count on him when it got to  committee. This is a guy you could count on 100 percent of the time,  every day.   He cares about what he is doing. He knows what he is doing. He is an  affable person who is fun to be with, even if you disagree on things.  Dean is one of a kind, in my opinion, and someone I am very proud to  have served with on the committee. I wish he were going to be there for  my last 2 years as chairman so that I could count on him a little bit  more.   Dean is the real deal. He is the guy you can put money in the bank  on. He has helped a lot.   I wish him the very best. His service to the country is invaluable. I  served with him in the House and in the Senate. For the whole 20 years  he has been here, I have been here too. I have seen him in countless  tough votes. Whether it is Part D of Medicare or whatever it might be,  he has always been there to be counted on.   He has stood up for the State of Nevada, whether the issue was  nuclear energy, nuclear storage, nuclear waste, or nuclear bombs.   Nevada is a great State. This is a great Senate, and we have a great  country. One of the reason we do is we have great individuals like Dean  Heller.   God bless you, and I wish you the best.
