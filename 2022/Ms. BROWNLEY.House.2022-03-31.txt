 Mr. Speaker, from day one, House Democrats have been  working with the Biden administration to build a stronger and more  secure future for the American people. That is why we recently passed  the COMPETES Act to fix our national supply chains, boost competition,  and strengthen U.S. manufacturing.   Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Haas Automation in my  district in Oxnard, California. Haas manufactures over 90 percent of  all American-made precision manufacturing tools and is the last  standing major American manufacturer of the machines  [[Page H4056]]  that are essential to most manufacturing in America.   We are working to ensure American manufacturing companies like Haas  can continue to compete globally and continue to thrive.   That includes ensuring a level playing field with foreign competitors  and ensuring U.S. manufacturers have access to adequate supplies of  essential semiconductor chips.   That is why we must get the America COMPETES Act across the finish  line, because the success of American manufacturing will lead to the  success of American working families.                            ____________________
