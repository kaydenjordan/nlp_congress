 Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Ruth  Samuelson, a long-time leader in the North Carolina House of  Representatives and a former member of the Mecklenburg County  Commission. Ruth is now in Heaven following a courageous battle with  ovarian cancer.   Ruth infused her faith in God in all aspects of her family,  political, personal, and civic life. Because of her vibrant faith and  commitment to focusing on what truly matters, Ruth was known as a  thoughtful mediator throughout her tenure in the North Carolina House,  someone who approached tense, partisan issues with grace, yet never  backed away from her convictions.   In 2013, Ruth was in line for a top leadership role, but instead, she  walked away, choosing instead to focus on her passions for family,  faith, and philanthropy. Ruth's last public statement was: ``I want  people to know that God is my good friend.''   May the Lord bring comfort to her husband, Ken; to her children,  Bobby, David, Joy, and Alex; her four grandchildren; and the countless  lives that she touched.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, just a few weeks ago, my family was  blessed with the arrival of a beautiful baby girl, our 10th grandchild.  If you have ever held a newborn, so defenseless and completely  dependent on you, you will understand why the idea that some people  advocate for the murder of little babies is unconscionable.   Since 1975, the Hyde amendment has saved an estimated 2 million  innocent babies by prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used for  abortions. Unfortunately, ObamaCare ignores the Hyde amendment and uses  your tax dollars as subsidies for insurance policies which offer  abortion services.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  Act, which will make the Hyde amendment governmentwide policy and  ensure future government programs don't support abortion with your tax  dollars.   God tells us that He knew us in our mother's womb. His gift of life  is precious, unalienable, and must be protected.                                time  1515    Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), another one of our excellent new Members.
