 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Adult and Teen  Challenge, or ATC, a faith-based organization serving on the front  lines to combat our Nation's spiking drug and alcohol addiction crisis.   I am really proud that ATC, headquartered in the great State of  Missouri, is providing lifesaving services to thousands of people  afflicted by substance abuse disorders.   Daily, more than a dozen people reach out to ATC looking for help for  themselves or a loved one, and ATC is always answering the call.   ATC has provided recovery care through Christ-centered solutions for  more than 14,000 persons per month in the last year.   It is really time that we recognize the importance of faith in the  addiction recovery and support process for those working to see  addiction numbers decrease instead of increase.                            ____________________
