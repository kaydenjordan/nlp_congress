 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for  yielding. And I want to welcome our new colleague to the Chamber. This  isn't usually the way that it is, and nothing about the path you took  to get here is usually the way that it is.   But so often, on this floor, we talk about giving a voice to the  voiceless, and sometimes it seems as if it is a simple cliche. I wonder  how many of my colleagues would put in the kind of time and effort that  we all put in to get reelected to provide a voice, not for 2 years, not  even for 12 months, but for the remainder of a cycle.   It speaks to the character of Mr. Hall, and it speaks to his  commitment to the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia that he put  himself out there and committed himself, as he did throughout that  campaign cycle, to be that voice and to make sure that there was not a  day that went by that the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia could  have been represented but was not.   You are joining, certainly a very special seat, but you are joining a  very special delegation here, and I want to, on behalf of all of the  Republicans in the Georgia delegation, congratulate you and welcome you  here today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate my friend from Massachusetts yielding me the customary  30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this may very well be the last rule I do down here on  the floor of the House, and I was sad when Susan was reading from the  rule because I have gotten to do some humdingers. We have done some  serious legislating in the 10 years I have been in Congress. We have  done some serious rulemaking in the 2 years Mr. McGovern has been  chairman of the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, you can always tell when we have been burning the  midnight oil in the Rules Committee because the rule will take a good  7, 8, or 9 minutes to read here on the floor of the House. Why? Because  getting good legislation done is a complicated, difficult thing to do.  It involves a lot of give and take; it involves a lot of voices at the  table; and it involves a lot of time in the Rules Committee to make  that happen.   Mr. Speaker, we are down here today surrounded by Purell wipes, hand  sanitizer, and social distancing, and we are not here to talk about  that COVID package that my friend from Massachusetts referenced. We are  here to, sadly, participate in what has become a theme in this  Congress, and that is folks will have the germ of a wonderful idea on  the Democratic side of the aisle. They will nurture that idea in their  Democratic Caucus, and they will put together all the parts of that  idea they believe need to come together in their Democratic Caucus.  Then, we will come to the House floor, and we will pass that idea with  Democratic votes. Then, we will be vexed, truly vexed, about why that  idea goes to the United States Senate and dies.   I say truly vexed, Mr. Speaker. I have been here a long time. We have  seen this happen. Leadership of both parties knows, when you put  together an idea all by yourself, when you don't take the time to get  all the voices in the room together, and when you don't take the time  to build the strategic partnerships, then good ideas do die. Sometimes  it is on the way to the other Chamber; sometimes it is in conference;  and sometimes it is on the President's desk.    We had numerous amendments offered to this bill. None but the  manager's amendment was made in order. We had Republican advocates for  many of the provisions in this bill speak of the opportunity to do  something together but that those opportunities were missed along the  road in the Judiciary Committee.   I take my friend from Massachusetts' comments to heart when he is so  enthusiastic by a conversation that our Speaker has had with the  majority leader in the Senate. I, too, am excited about that because  talking about what we have done all by ourselves in a partisan way  doesn't lead to positive outcomes for my constituency. Our leadership  in the Democratic-led House getting together with the leadership in the  Senate, the Republican-led Senate, that kind of bipartisan partnership  does lead to good outcomes for our constituents back home. I am hopeful  that we will be able to see that come to fruition.  [[Page H6063]]    Today, however, we do not have the COVID package. We have the  Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act. Mr. Speaker, I  have long said that we needed to have a bill like this on the floor of  the House. My friend from Massachusetts tells me we have debated more  marijuana amendments in the past 2 years than we have in the past 20  years. I take him at his word that that is true. I don't think this is  a topic that we have not been spending enough time on. I think it is a  topic that has received more than its fair share of attention in this  Congress.   The racial equities that my friend talks about deserve better than to  be part of a partisan package that goes nowhere. The generational  disparities that my friend from Massachusetts talks about deserve  better than to be part of a package that has been cobbled together for  the floor rather than built together for the President's desk.                                time  1415    I agree with absolutely every heartfelt comment my friend from  Massachusetts shared, from the time being now, to the opportunities  that have been wasted, to the inability to have these discussions when  we need to and the ability that we have had recently to have them more.   So to have all of that truth there to be wasted on a December 3  package that will not be moving anywhere, I would say to my friend, I  believe hurts me as much as I know it will hurt him. He does not go  through these efforts to simply be a part of the motion; he goes  through these efforts because he believes in the goal. I regret that  this appears to be another messaging exercise in front of us today.   NDAA, Mr. Speaker, National Defense Authorization Act, a bill that we  have come together as Republicans and Democrats to speak with one voice  on for over 60 years, still hangs out there, needs to be done by this  year; funding of the Federal Government, not just because of all the  healthcare items, but because of those more mundane items, from  transportation to education to our veterans--all of those dollars need  to be provided.   Reauthorization of program after program, like the United States  Coast Guard, for example, we have priority after priority after  priority that this House still has left to accomplish, not in a  partisan way, but in a unified way that can move through the United  States Senate and on to the President's desk. I know we are going to  get to these priorities, but it is not without some frustration that I  find myself on the floor here again talking about bills that will not  be on their way to the President's desk.   I find myself talking in a disappointed tone with my friend from  Massachusetts about opportunities that we have to make a difference for  families, but opportunities that are going to be missed because of the  way we have crafted it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and give us a  chance to do better. In the absence of that, I also will have an  opportunity to defeat the previous question and bring up some of those  COVID packages that really can make a difference for our friends back  home.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), one of our  former colleagues on the House Budget Committee, currently the leader  of the Republican side of the House Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  amend the rule to allow for consideration of a bill that will assist  our struggling small businesses as we enter the winter months and folks  are anticipating increased risks of having to shut their doors.  [[Page H6066]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Congressional Record immediately prior to the vote on  the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the ranking Republican on the Small Business  Committee, a gentleman who has had great experience bringing together  bipartisan groups in an effort to make a difference for families back  home.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I think about how many times the gentleman from Ohio has  been down here to do exactly what he has just done, which is to say: I  have a bill that is ready to go, a bill that I know will get bipartisan  support here on the floor of the House, a bill my friends in the Senate  will be anxious to move, and a bill that I know the President will put  his signature on.   I appreciate his efforts in that, and I know it is not a Johnny-come- lately commitment to these struggling businesses. I remember when we  were sitting down trying to work out that very first package in the  spring, and the very productive role that the gentleman from Ohio  played in bringing people together to get that done.   You remember that, Mr. Speaker.   We didn't have a bunch of debates on the floor of the House, a bunch  of previous questions to defeat, a bunch of amendments designed to  confuse or distract. No. We worked it all out together, both sides.  Both sides, politically here in the House, both sides bicamerally here  in the Congress, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Why?   Because we all felt that sense of urgency to get something done, and  we did it.   Mr. Speaker, I tell constituents back home that the thing most  freshmen are going to learn in the first 6 months that they didn't know  when they got here is how hardworking and conscientious all of their  colleagues turn out to be. All you see are these faces on FOX News or  MSNBC fussing with one another, but the truth is that behind the scenes  it is a very powerful orchestra of men and women trying to get the  people's business done.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friend from Massachusetts, first and  probably most importantly, I wish he was not chairman of the Rules  Committee. I wish a Republican was chairman of the Rules Committee  because the American people felt in their wisdom that Republicans  should be running this institution. There are a lot of reasons why it  didn't happen. I am not here to place blame on that today.   But I will say to the gentleman that if it cannot be a Republican who  leads the Rules Committee, how pleased I am that the gentleman has led  the Rules Committee, because his love for this institution far  transcends whatever the political passions of the day are.   The Rules Committee has had to do a lot of difficult decisionmaking  in this Congress, Mr. Speaker. I wish we did not have proxy voting in  this institution today. We do. That is the product of a Rules Committee  effort. In many  [[Page H6067]]  cases, the effort of the wisdom of Solomon trying to figure out how to  protect an institution and all of its practices, where we are just  caretakers of this institution, going to pass it on to the next  generation, while we have had to grapple with some challenges that we  never anticipated grappling with, and hopefully will never have to  grapple with again.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts has brought an  incredible amount of not just leadership, but a great amount of love  for this institution, and for the members of his committee. And I don't  want to embarrass the gentleman by pointing out some of these  circumstances, but I can go through a list of times this year where the  gentleman from Massachusetts stood not on behalf of the Democratic  Caucus, but on behalf of the Rules Committee against some other  undercurrents in the United States Congress, to stand up on behalf of  his 13 members and the work that we have to get done there together.  That's never an easy thing to do, and I want to tell the gentleman how  much I appreciate and notice those efforts.   Mr. Speaker, to do the really big things that we all know need to get  done, not the least of which are on the committee you and I serve on,  the Budget Committee, it takes strong men and women, men and women of  conviction, but also men and women of faith, not just faith in their  Lord, but faith in this institution that we can bring out the very best  in one another as opposed to bringing out the very worst.   Far too often we have bills like the one before us today that could  be bills that we were talking about with one voice.   When is the right time to decide that edible marijuana for our  children should be banned at the Federal level? Is it after 50 States  have grappled with these decisions? Is it before?   Well, we have made that decision in terms of alcohol. We have made  that decision in terms of tobacco. It seems like the easy time to make  that would be now. But we have not made that decision in the underlying  bill. We have not made those amendments in order.   Mr. Speaker, I said at the beginning, and I will say here at the end:  I am glad we are taking up this legislation.   It offends me, as one who loves the law, that we ask Federal law  enforcement officers to enforce one set of rules while the State and  local law enforcement officers may be enforcing a completely different  set of rules. It offends me that we would put Federal law enforcement  officers in harm's way for an industry that, as my friend from  Massachusetts pointed out, is a multibillion-dollar cash cow legalized  by State jurisdictions across the country.   I am troubled by having two sets of laws in this country. Laws we  choose to follow and laws we choose not to follow. This is the  institution to solve that. Having this discussion for the first time is  a step in the right direction. Having this conversation end today,  because it is a partisan package that is not well thought through  serves none of us.   Mr. Speaker, I would again encourage my colleagues to defeat the rule  so we don't go down that road.   Mr. Speaker, my friend from Massachusetts mentioned Janet Rossi on my  team. I have Nick Scoufaras on my team, sitting beside me. We all are  surrounded by great people that we get to work with day in and day out.   When you go to work for a member on the Rules Committee, that means  you will work early, and you will work late, and you can work often. It  is an amazing opportunity that we have to serve in this institution. It  is also an amazing opportunity that folks that we get to surround  ourselves with have to serve in this institution.   There is no more humbling space than having someone who can do  anything they want to with his or her life say, Rob, I will join you; I  will sit here with you; we will work side by side and we will  accomplish things together.   While I appreciate the very heartfelt comments from my friend from  Massachusetts and my friend from Oklahoma, one thing that occurs to me  on my way out the door is how much less one would be able to do without  all the greatness that folks are surrounded by.   Mr. Speaker, I get to thank Nick because he is here. I can thank  Janet because she is here. But I would just say to each of my  colleagues who are here, we are all so lucky folks are surrounding us  in order to help us all lift this great Nation up. We often get sucked  into the drumbeat of whatever the activity of the day is if you have  not had an opportunity to recognize the greatness of those staffers  around you, and occasionally even the Members around you, even those  who sit on the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, there is a lot to be concerned about in America today,  but a lot of opportunities for optimism. And many of those  opportunities sit here, and sit here, and sit there, and sit here. I am  grateful to be a part of that.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to defeat the previous  question so that we can bring the Chabot legislation to the floor. If  we can't defeat the previous question, defeat the rule so that we can  go back and make sure all voices are heard.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
