 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Womack for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today frustrated and dismayed because Congress  continues to act as the Speaker's House rather than the people's House.  Debate has been silenced and bipartisan amendments have been rejected  for political reasons.   I, myself, submitted 80 amendments to this bill, and not a single one  was made in order. This includes three amendments redirecting Federal  funds from bureaucrats to fight wildfires that are burning down the  West. Forget voting on these commonsense amendments, Democrats won't  even allow debate on them.   I also filed three amendments to reallocate resources to help combat  drought in the West--all ignored and all debate was refused. How about  the amendments redirecting resources to improve veterans' mental  health? Ignored.   Do you know why the American people like Congress less than  cockroaches, root canals, and Nickelback? Because of political garbage  like this.   Speaker Pelosi has silenced my constituents and the American people  once again.
