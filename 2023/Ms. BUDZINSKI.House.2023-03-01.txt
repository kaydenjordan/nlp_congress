 Madam Speaker, I rise today, at the close of Black  History Month and the beginning of Women's History Month, to recognize  an incredible athlete and role model from Illinois' 13th Congressional  District, Jackie Joyner-Kersee. I also wish her a happy birthday today.   Born and raised in East St. Louis, Jackie Joyner-Kersee is one of the  best track athletes of all time, winning six Olympic medals and four  World Championship track titles.   Over the course of her 12-year Olympic career, Jackie broke countless  records, including the world record in the heptathlon that still stands  today. She was also the first African-American woman to win gold medals  in long jump and the heptathlon.   Jackie's legacy extends far beyond her athletic achievements. Just  last week, I visited the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation, which  provides educational and athletic opportunities for young people in  East St. Louis. I was truly inspired by what I saw in Jackie's  commitment and work. Throughout her life, she has used her platform to  be a tireless advocate for children's education, racial equity, and  women's rights.   As we celebrate Black history and women's history, let's recognize  incredible folks like Jackie Joyner-Kersee.                            ____________________
