 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Build  Back Better agenda. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  address climate change, and we must pass the clean electricity  performance program, which uses a novel carrot-and-stick approach to  reduce emissions by State utilities.   I further support instituting a carbon tax, which would make  corporations pay for their harmful pollution and ensure our planet  remains habitable for our children.   Furthermore, as we invest in clean energy infrastructure to replace  harmful fossil fuels, we must end the Trump tariffs on $360 billion  worth of Chinese goods. These tariffs artificially increase the cost of  materials in solar panels, wind turbines, and other products we need to  power our economy with clean energy.   Together, we can enact President Biden's agenda to turbocharge the  clean energy economy and create good jobs.                            ____________________
