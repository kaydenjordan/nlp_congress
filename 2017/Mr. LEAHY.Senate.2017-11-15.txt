 Mr. President, for 25 years, Earl ``Rusty'' Powell has  served as the director of the National Gallery of Art, making him the  longest serving director in its history. Rusty will retire in early  2019, concluding a tenure that has marked growth and development at one  of our Nation's great galleries.   Rusty's life of public service began with 3 years of service in the  Navy, during which he served as a navigator in Vietnam. Upon his  return, Rusty embarked on what would become a decades-long career as a  curator, historian, and aficionado, earning a doctorate from Harvard  before beginning his first assignment at the National Gallery of Art.   His experience there led to a 12-year tenure as the director of the  Los Angeles County Museum of Art, after which he returned to the  National Gallery for what would become the longest tenure of a director  in its 75-year history. He has worked tirelessly at the National  Gallery of Art to increase the accessibility of the arts by expanding  the National Gallery's projects, exhibitions, and endowment.   Rusty's approach to expanding and enriching the National Gallery has  been as collaborative as it has been visionary. Rather than govern with  a singular vision, he included his staff and board in moving the museum  forward. From the construction of the stunning sculpture garden, to the  renovation of the gallery's west wing, no detail has been overlooked  throughout his tenure. He has also overseen several other projects that  received less attention but are of no lesser value to the current  success of the gallery. All these improvements have enhanced the  experience of the more than 5 million visitors that pass through the  gallery every year.   Rusty's great passion for the mission of the National Gallery and his  unwavering efforts to bring storied art collections to its millions of  visitors each year are unparalleled. With his retirement next year, he  will leave a legacy at the gallery that will never be forgotten.   Marcelle and I have treasured the evenings we have spent with Rusty  and his wife, Nancy, at exhibits and events we will always remember.   I ask unanimous consent that the November 7, 2017, Washington Post  article detailing Rusty's time and accomplishments at the National  Gallery of Art be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S7257]]                       [From the Washington Post, Nov. 7, 2017]       The Quiet, Productive Tenure of Rusty Powell To Come to an End                             (By Geoff Edgers)         National Gallery of Art Director Earl ``Rusty'' Powell,       whose tenure has been marked by the collection's growth, the       renovation of nearly every space and a startling lack of       controversy, will retire in early 2019 after more than 25       years in charge.        Powell, 74, planned to tell the National Gallery's staff       Tuesday during informal meetings. Next year, the trustees       will begin the process of finding a successor for the       longest-serving director in its 76-year history.        ``I think I have run a pretty good race here, and it seems       sort of a logical time,'' Powell said in explaining the       decision. ``I turn 75 next year. And this will be after that.       I still have some gas in the tank. I'm not particularly       interested in sitting on the porch looking at sunsets.''        What he'll do, he said, is not clear. But what he has       accomplished at the National Gallery is easy to chart. Over       Powell's tenure, the institution, with a $200 million       operating budget and 5 million visitors a year, has been       reshaped, from the addition of a sculpture garden in 1999 to       the dramatic renovation of the East Building, completed last       year to add stunning galleries devoted to Mark Rothko and to       Barnett Newman's ``Stations of the Cross.'' Powell has also       overseen projects less buzzworthy but just as essential.        Six years and $19.3 million were spent renovating more than       three acres of leaky skylights in the West Building, part of       a deferred maintenance disaster once considered so dire it       inspired a local TV news series titled ``Gallery of Shame.''        Powell's tenure has also been notable for something it       lacked: controversy.        ``He's had that balance between being able to make       decisions and yet not offend everybody,'' said John       Wilmerding, the former National Gallery deputy director who       later served as chairman of its board of trustees.        Powell would never use words such as ``consummate       leadership,'' as his supporters do, to describe himself. He       can be witty, have strong opinions, but these often come as       asides, spoken softly and without naming names. He is not one       to call out other museum directors, even though he does note       that he doesn't agree with everyone in the field. About what?       With whom? He won't say.        This is in contrast with J. Carter Brown, the blue-eyed       impresario he replaced in 1992. Brown loved blockbusters,       mingling with royals--he brought Prince Charles and Princess       Diana to the National Gallery in 1985--and tended to spend       less time on issues such as infrastructure. Wilmerding       remembered that when Powell started, he noticed a stiffness       when Powell had to speak in front of groups.        ``He relied too much on his notes,'' Wilmerding said. ``I       remember saying to him, `You've got the personality--do more.       Wing it. Tell jokes. Be yourself.' That awkwardness rapidly       began to change.''        Born in South Carolina, Powell was just 4 when his father       died of injuries sustained during World War II. The family       moved to Rhode Island, and his mother eventually remarried.       Powell went to Williams College, where he played linebacker       and, after struggling to conquer chemistry class, found       himself studying art history.        As a boy, he had fond memories of hanging around his       grandfather's lithography business. In college, he found       inspiration in S. Lane Faison Jr., a legendary professor who       would help train many members of the ``Williams mafia,'' a       group of graduates that included future museum directors       Glenn D. Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art; James Wood of the       Art Institute of Chicago; and Powell's onetime roommate, John       Lane, who led the Dallas Museum of Art and San Francisco       Museum of Modern Art. Other Williams graduates to become       directors include Michael Govan of the Los Angeles County       Museum of Art and Joseph Thompson of the Massachusetts Museum       of Contemporary Art.        Powell credits his next stop--three years in the Navy, from       1966 to 1969--with helping him develop the skills to become a       leader. Lane also went from Williams to the Navy. The time       served helped them step into directorships while only in       their mid-30s.        ``We had already had the happy burden of being responsible       for a huge piece of machinery and a lot of fellow       shipmates,'' Lane said. ``And in what were particularly       dangerous circumstances. You were well equipped to take on       responsibility.''        The service also, unexpectedly, led Powell to Harvard. One       afternoon, Powell stopped by the art history department at       Harvard to ask for a course catalogue. Professor Seymour       Slive, a World War II veteran, noticed he was wearing his       Navy whites, struck up a conversation, and then urged him to       attend graduate school in Cambridge. This started a long list       of opportunities that opened up for Powell, who noted that       ``I've never had to apply for a job.''        In 1976, not long after Powell earned his PhD, Brown hired       him for his first stint at the National Gallery as a curator       and special assistant.        And in 1980, Powell took his first trip to California to       interview for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's top job.       At 36, he began a 12-year tenure marked by tremendous growth,       with the museum's budget jumping from $8.5 million to $31       million and attendance more than doubling to close to a       million visitors a year.        Comedian Steve Martin, who served on the Los Angeles County       Museum of Art's board of trustees, marveled at Powell's       ability to embrace a wide range of art, his cordial nature       and his ability to understand how to manage the many       perspectives on the board. What's more, Martin found it       notable that Powell's tenure was conflict-free.        ``I never heard anybody say an unkind word about him,''       said Martin, an art collector.        Powell, when asked about his leadership style, gives credit       to others--curators, other administrators, staff--for making       him feel comfortable delegating authority. He uses email but       says many of his meetings are informal, taking place as he       walks from his car to his office in the morning.        ``I've always believed in a collegial, organizational       structure,'' he said. ``I think communication is a really       important thing. I learned to look at the big things. Not get       bogged down with the little things. We make collective       decisions about most of the things we do here. Our       exhibitions program. It's not `Rusty says we'll do this,       we'll do that.' We talk about it. We meet and discuss things       rather than do things from the top of it.''        Powell can be so understated, it's hard to know when he's       asking for anything. Even millions. That's what longtime       board president Victoria Sant found when the National Gallery       was raising money for the renovation of the East Building.        ``You sort of don't know when Rusty's put the touch on       you,'' she said. ``He's not an aggressive fundraiser. He       tries to bring things to people that they want, that was in       their interest area. And I think one of the things that Rusty       has stressed is that when you give a gift to the National       Gallery, you're really giving a gift to the nation.''        Sant and her husband, Roger, ultimately gave $10 million to       the East Building project, which added more than 12,000       square feet of gallery space and an outdoor sculpture terrace       overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue.        That was just one of the most recent accomplishments during       Powell's tenure. The list of art acquisitions, exhibitions       and building projects that have taken place since 1992 runs       for pages, from the construction of Dutch cabinet galleries       in 1995 to the endowment campaign launched last year after a       $30 million matching grant from the Andrew W. Mellon       Foundation.        Powell's announcement means there will no longer be a       director who spent time with Paul Mellon, the late       philanthropist who stood next to President Franklin D.       Roosevelt when the family's money and art collection sparked       the National Gallery's opening in 1941.        It was in Powell's first week as director that Mellon       invited him for lunch. Later, the philanthropist shared his       passion for a proposed sculpture garden. Powell remembers       showing Mellon the plans.        ``How big are the trees?'' Mellon asked.        ``We're going to have them as big as we can get them,''       Powell said.        ``Good, because I don't have that much time left and I'd       really like to see this,'' Mellon said.        ``Mr. Mellon, we're not going to give you a starter kit for       the sculpture garden,'' Powell said.        The garden, in fact, opened in May 1999, four months after       Mellon's death at the age of 91.        Powell said he never considered leaving the National       Gallery, even when headhunting firms called to see whether he       might be interested in other jobs. (Powell's total       compensation was comparable to those at other major       institutions. He earned $1.17 million in the most recent       public filing available, compared with the $1.44 million       earned by then-Met Director Thomas Campbell.) He appreciated       not having to spend so much time trying to raise money, as is       the case when you're running the Metropolitan Museum of Art       or Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. Nearly three-quarters of the       National Gallery's $200 million annual operating budget comes       from the federal government.        He also feels a deep connection to the District.        ``If you do what I do, it's the best job in the field,'' he       said. ``The standards are very high. The collections are       exemplary. The programs are great. You're not out with a tin       cup raising money to keep the building open. The federal       funding obligations are to keep it maintained. It's got a       center for advanced study. I came out of the academic side,       and this is the most academic place that can exist. It's a       unique place in the context of American museums.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize  the moving work of Ron Powers of Castleton, VT--a Pulitzer Prize- winning author who has written about everything from Mark Twain to the  soldiers of Iwo Jima to broadcast news and sports.   Ron's latest book, ``No One Cares About Crazy People,'' concentrates  on a topic that he promised himself he would never write about: the  social history of mental illness in America. This story is poignantly  told through his own deeply personal story of his two  [[Page S7258]]  sons' struggles with schizophrenia, which tragically claimed the life  of one of them.   The book's informative yet intimate approach raises awareness about a  subject that most are too uncomfortable to broach. When reading it, you  can hardly hold back tears.   I cannot imagine the pain Ron and Honoree went through while working  on this book. It is a truly personal journey and a triumph. I am proud  of him for publishing this important work. He understands that mental  illness is not an issue that will simply go away if pushed into the  darkness of neglect and denial. One cannot lock it up in an institution  and expect to be rid of the problem. Mental illness in America needs to  be discussed openly, by those who suffer from it, the friends and  families of those affected, medical experts, and those of us Senators.  We must all follow the footsteps of Ron and continue to shine a light  on this extremely sensitive issue.   I ask unanimous consent that the October 8, 2017, Vermont Digger  article honoring Ron Powers and his family and recognizing his great  work be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Vermont Digger, Oct. 8, 2017]              A Vermonter Questions the Nation's Mental Health                            (By Kevin O'Connor)         Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Powers' past works have       eagerly explored everything from the 1800s literary lion Mark       Twain to the flag-raising World War II soldiers at Iwo Jima       and the present-day pioneers of broadcast news and sports.        The Vermonter's current focus is different.        ``This is the book I promised myself I would never write,''       Powers begins its preface. ``I have kept that promise for a       decade--since our younger son, Kevin, hanged himself in our       basement, a week before his 21st birthday in July 2005, after       struggling for three years with schizophrenia.''        The author, born 75 years ago in Twain's hometown of       Hannibal, Missouri, can boast of a prolific career that has       seen him in a columnist's chair at the Chicago Sun-Times and       a commentator's seat on the CBS News program ``Sunday       Morning,'' as well as on the best-seller list for more than a       dozen books that include collaborating on the late U.S. Sen.       Edward Kennedy's memoir ``True Compass.''        But after the death of one of his two boys, the Castleton       resident could barely think about, let alone tackle, another       project. He and his wife, Honoree Fleming, were finally       starting to heal (``adaptation, really,'' he says) when they       saw their surviving son, experiencing a psychotic break one       Christmas, tell neighbors he was the messiah before police       took him to a hospital.        And so Powers began to research mental illness--not just       the schizophrenia his family has faced but also all the other       issues the World Health Organization estimates will affect       one-fourth of the world's people at some point in their       lives.        ``I realized that my 10 years of silence on the subject,''       he says, ``silence that I had justified as insulation against       an exercise in self-indulgence, was itself an exercise in       self-indulgence.''        And so Powers is talking up his new book, ``No One Cares       About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health       in America.'' The 384-page Hachette hardcover shares his       family's story alongside a historic and often horrific survey       of mental illness in larger society.        ``Studies by the National Institute of Mental Health show       that among Americans age 18 or older, more than 62 million       (26 percent of the population) require (but are not always       given) counseling and medical treatment,'' he writes.        Powers could cite too many reasons for not wanting to       tackle the topic: What about his family's privacy? The       appearance of exploitation? The fact he isn't an expert?        ``Book writing is hard work,'' he continues. ``And, really,       end of the day, who the hell wants to read about       schizophrenia anyway?''        Plenty of people, the author would discover. Nearly a       decade after their son's death, Powers and his wife accepted       an invitation to testify at a 2014 Vermont legislative       hearing on whether acutely mentally ill patients should be       medicated against their will.        ``At first glance, speedy `involuntary treatment' might       seem the least objectionable of measures, given that people       in psychosis are virtually never capable of making rational       decisions,'' he writes in his book. ``And yet opponents of       the process bring passionate counterarguments to the debate.       Among the most formidable is that `involuntary treatment' is       by definition a violation of one's civil liberties.''        Powers testified in support of shorter waits on decisions       about involuntary intervention, which the Legislature went on       to adopt as law. But the author was moved by opponents of the       measure.        ``They were there: the faces and souls of the mentally ill,       emerging from their prevailing invisibility to declare       themselves,'' he writes. ``The sheer presence of them, their       actualization in the room, had affected me in the gut, not       because I hadn't expected them, but because of the profound,       elemental humanity of them.''        Three weeks later, Powers read news of a Wisconsin       political aide who, responding to headlines of state mental       health mismanagement, emailed a colleague: ``No one cares       about crazy people.''        That's when the author started writing--for himself, his       household, other families, friends, neighbors and psychiatric       professionals.        ``My aim with this book is not to replace or argue with the       existing vast inventory of important books on mental       illness,'' he writes. ``Rather, I hope to reamplify a simple       and self-evident and morally insupportable truth: Too many of       the mentally ill in our country live under conditions of       atrocity.''        Powers has taken his message to National Public Radio's       ``Fresh Air'' program and is seeing it shared in publications       nationwide.        ``He writes with fierce hope and fierce purpose to persuade       the world to pay attention,'' fellow Pulitzer Prize-winning       journalist Ron Suskind wrote in a review for The New York       Times. ``I'm not sure I've ever read anything that handles       the decline of one's children with such openness and searing,       stumbling honesty.''        Readers can learn for themselves when Powers speaks at the       Brattleboro Literary Festival on Saturday at 11 a.m. at the       downtown Centre Congregational Church. If similar appearances       are any indication, he'll share a few of the book's humorous       family stories, too.        ``Why do I include these?'' he told an audience in       Manchester. ``Because they make me smile and bring the two       boys to life. I wanted to avoid a kind of cliche--the       afflicted loved ones described only in the context of their       victimhood. It's hard to feel compassion for an abstract. My       sons were wonderful spirited boys before this affliction       struck.''        That said, Powers isn't seeking to entertain.        ``I hope you do not `enjoy' this book,'' he writes. ``I       hope you are wounded by it; wounded as I have been in writing       it. Wounded to act, to intervene.''        ``America must turn its immense resources and energy and       conciliatory goodwill to a final assault on mental illness,''       he concludes. ``My sons, and your afflicted children and       brothers and sisters and parents and friends, deserve nothing       less.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, long before his confirmation as the 10th  Archivist of the United States, David Ferriero proudly served our  Nation in a different capacity, as a Navy corpsman in Vietnam. Today,  with the help of Mr. Ferreiro's unique personal perspective and  professionally informed guidance, the Lawrence F. O'Brien Gallery at  the National Archives Museum in Washington, DC, is currently exhibiting  a new collection of remarkable documents that illustrate some of the  Vietnam war's biggest controversies.   Mr. Ferriero and his team are to be thanked for painstakingly  determining which of the countless relevant texts housed in the  National Archives best told this often misunderstood story. We can be  sure, however, that few if any archivists are better suited with  experience and vision for this task than Mr. Ferriero.   With this exhibit, Mr. Ferriero and his team honor the memory of  those who served in Vietnam, while also fulfilling a sacred obligation  to accurately preserve even our most contentious history so that we may  strive to avoid repeating past mistakes. Today I would like to pay  tribute to the Archivist of the United States, David Ferriero, and his  team and ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post article titled,  ``A Veteran's View of Vietnam,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 8, 2017]                        A Veteran's View of Vietnam                           (By Michael E. Ruane)         At night, after Navy corpsman David Ferriero finished his       clerical duties aboard the hospital ship off Vietnam, he       would volunteer to help triage the wounded being helicoptered       from the battlefield.        Some had been shot. Others were missing limbs. Some needed       treatment right away. Others were dead when they arrived.        It was 1970, and Ferriero was a 25-yearold college dropout       from Beverly, Mass., who suffered from seasickness and was a       dedicated, if at times inexpert, corpsman.        Today he is the archivist of the United States and the       impetus behind the sweeping new exhibit, ``Remembering       Vietnam,'' that opens Friday in the Archives' flagship       building in the District.        The free exhibit, which runs through Jan. 6, includes some       of the most striking documents relating to the war:  [[Page S7259]]         A 1944 memo from President Franklin D. Roosevelt stating       that Vietnam, formerly ruled by France, should not be       returned to the French after World War II.        ``France has milked it for one hundred years,'' Roosevelt       wrote. ``The people of Indo-China deserve something better       than that.''        A 1946 telegram from Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi       Minh to President Harry Truman begging for U.S. support on       Vietnamese independence and opposition to the reintroduction       of French control. (The CIA withheld it from Truman, Ferriero       said.)        The last page of President Lyndon B. Johnson's stunning       1968 speech announcing that, as a result of the war, he would       not run for reelection. ``Accordingly,'' the president       concluded, ``I shall not seek--and will not accept--the       nomination . . . for another term as your President.''        He had crossed out ``would'' and replaced it with ``will.''        The exhibit also includes three Vietnam-era helicopters       courtesy of the North Carolina Vietnam Helicopter Pilots       Association. The aircraft were installed Monday night on the       lawn outside the Archives on Constitution Avenue.        Ferriero, 71, said he wanted the institution to mount a       Vietnam exhibit in part because so many of the war's issues       remain sensitive and unresolved.        In a long career that took him to big jobs at major       universities and libraries, ``no one--no one--wanted to talk       about it,'' he said.        ``No one asked me any questions,'' he said. ``No one       acknowledged it. . . . Never was it the topic of       conversation.''        Ferriero, in a recent interview in his office, said he also       knew that the Archives had ``incredible material in the       records--photographs and all of the military records, the       unit records. We have a lot of stuff.''        ``And for me it was important to tell the story from both       sides,'' he said.        One fascinating document in the exhibit is a Viet Cong       propaganda poster that echoes, from the enemy's point of       view, the notorious U.S. obsession with numbers and body       counts.        The poster claims, among other things, that the Viet Cong       in 1962 and part of 1963 killed 28,108 South Vietnamese and       222 Americans--double the actual figures. ``So that inflated       body count was happening on both sides,'' said curator Alice       Kamps, who assembled ``Remembering Vietnam.''        The exhibit includes CIA models of what appear to be an       interrogation room and cell in the North Vietnamese prison       known as the Hanoi Hilton, which held many American POWs.        There are transcripts of once secret American helicopter       communications as Saigon, the chaotic capital of South       Vietnam, was evacuated by the Americans in 1975.        ``Bring ur personnel up thru th building,'' reads one       communication. ``Do not let them (the South Viets) follow too       closely. Use mace if necessary but do not fire on them.''        Although the exhibit covers the war from Ho Chi Minh's       appearance at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 to architect       Maya Lin's 1981 design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,       Ferriero's war had a single goal.        ``We were all under the impression that the threat of       communism was the biggest challenge,'' he said. ``We were all       playing a part in protecting us against communism.''        Near the end of Ferriero's enlistment, he was shipped to       Vietnam as a corpsman in a psychiatric ward.        ``There were a lot of what we called at that point       'character disorders'--kids who were having trouble with       authority,'' he said. ``Then there were other folks who had       more serious psychotic kinds of things . . . awaiting       transfer back to the States.''        Eventually, he was transferred to the 700-bed hospital ship       USS Sanctuary, only to find the ``psych'' ward had been       closed because too many patients had been jumping overboard.        But Ferriero could type, and he became an administrative       clerk. After hours, though, he would help sort and treat the       wounded who were transported from the battlefield to a kind       of emergency room on the ship.        The helicopters came and went. Sometimes one would crash       into the ocean. ``In my time, no lives were lost,'' he said.        The ship would spend the day in the harbor at Da Nang, then       cruise off the coast at night. Ferriero, who still has his       dog tag on his key chain, said the injured included Americans       and Vietnamese, soldiers, Marines and civilians. One case       stood out. He was trying to start an intravenous line in an       injured patient and couldn't find a good vein. Each time he       failed, he discarded the needle and got a fresh one.        ``Kept throwing down these needles,'' he recalled. ``And at       one point he just screamed.'' ``I thought, 'Oh, Jesus, I'm       losing him,'' he said. ``This is it.''        ``It turned out that I had thrown one of those needles down       on the gurney and he had rolled over on it,'' he said.        Ferriero was embarrassed. His patient ``wasn't in that       great distress,'' he said, ``but I never followed up to see       what had happened to him.''        One day earlier this week, as Ferriero checked the exhibit,       he joked that there was one thing missing: a Zippo cigarette       lighter like those carried by many an American serving in       Vietnam.        Later, in his office, he produced the one he kept for many       years. It was in pristine condition. ``USS Sanctuary'' was       etched in the side, and on the inside of its box was the       famous Zippo slogan:        ``It works or we fix it free.''                            ____________________
