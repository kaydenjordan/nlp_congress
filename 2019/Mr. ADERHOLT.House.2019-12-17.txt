 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, and I also  rise today in support of H.R. 1158, as the majority leader did, the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020.   While this bill is not perfect, as it was also mentioned--and, quite  honestly, I have concerns that there is an ongoing trend toward  increased spending--I will say that division B of this legislation, the  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,  includes assistance that is critical to law enforcement, the Census,  and NASA, among other things.   I would like to thank Chairman Serrano, and I thank Chairwoman Lowey,  Ranking Member Granger, as well as our Senate counterparts for their  leadership, their diligence, and their willingness to come together to  form this meeting of the minds to bring this FY 2020 bill to the floor  and to fruition.   I also want to thank Mr. Serrano's staff--Mr. Bob Bonner, Jeff  Ashford, Trisha Castaneda, TJ Lowdermilk, Shannon McCully, Matt Smith,  and B.G. Wright--for their hard work and the many long days that were,  no doubt, dedicated to helping produce this legislation. I appreciate  their cooperative spirit in which they worked with my staff to address  so many of the issues that are in this bill.   And, of course, I also want to thank my staff for their outstanding  work.                                time  1130    I want to thank our CJS subcommittee staff, Stephanie Gadbois and  Kristin Clarkson, for their hard work, their long hours, and their  dedication over the last year, and especially the hard work of the last  few weeks in finalizing this bill.   Let me just briefly recap. The bill has $22.6 billion for NASA. The  funding will help support the President's Artemis initiative, which  includes completion and further development of the Space Launch System  to ensure that it is the United States and not our adversaries that  will control future access to space.   In addition to NASA, the bill includes $7.3 billion to support the  2020 Decennial Census which will be necessary to get an accurate count  of all Americans, including those in hard-to-count communities. It also  includes critical funding for the Federal law enforcement components of  the Department of Justice, including the FBI, the United States  Marshals Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives. I am pleased to say that these funds will also support  Attorney General Barr's efforts to fight the scourge of violent crimes  and acts of mass violence.   In support of the valuable efforts of our local law enforcement  partners back home, this bill also includes $547 million for the Byrne  Justice Assistance grants, along with increased resources to eliminate  the sexual assault kit backlog, also fund drug court programs, and  support other vital initiatives that fight the opioid epidemic.    Madam Speaker, this bill provides funding increases for  the agencies that ensure compliance with our trade laws, along with  programs that foster American innovation and competitiveness, not only  in our communities and in each of our States but around the world.   Finally, I am pleased that this bill also contains longstanding  Second Amendment protections that were targeted for elimination earlier  this year.   So, in closing, I would like to thank, again, Chairman Serrano for  his great spirit to work with and how he has led the Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and I wish him the best.
