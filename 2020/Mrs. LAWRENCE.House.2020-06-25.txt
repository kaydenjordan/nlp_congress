 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I have heard the  cries and the screams from the street ``Black lives matter.''   Mr. Speaker, as a Black woman elected to Congress, I feel the  generations of my people calling on our government time and time again  for decades and decades to enact transformational legislation, to  finally have a law on the books to stop police assaults on Black lives.   Sadly, as a country we can no longer use the excuse of being blind to  racism. We can no longer use the excuse of being deaf to the cries of  justice, for justice in this country, or the arrogance of White  privilege. Our country, our people, the citizens of this country are  calling on us to come together and to join America and vote for this  bill, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act now.   Mr. Speaker, in our country, we pledge one Nation under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. It is time to act now.    Mr. Chair, today, I am so hopeful after the vote for  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, I can now look at those  little children, those little Black girls and boys when they say, ``Am  I safe?'' ``Does anyone care about my future?''   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud that this was a bipartisan bill. I  strongly encourage the Senate to come to the table and let's continue  to do our job and ensure that the future of America is one that is  inclusive: that is one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and  justice for all.                            ____________________
