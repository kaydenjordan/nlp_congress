 Mr. Speaker, I really don't take any joy in being here  standing before you today to address this matter of grave concern.   Mr. Speaker, this is not trivial. This is not stupid. This is  profoundly important; a solemn duty that I do not take lightly. This is  not personal. This is not partisan. It is to protect this very body.   Representative Jamaal Bowman was criminally charged and pleaded  guilty to falsely pulling a fire alarm. While I applaud his confession,  that doesn't mean this is without consequences. This act was not a mere  lapse in judgment. It was not a mistake. It was not an accident.   It was an intentional, calculated attempt to disrupt the very  democratic process by halting a critical vote on this very floor,  voting for government funding. If you don't believe it, watch the  video.   What should our response be as a House to this willful act of  obstruction?   Mr. Speaker, to this point, nothing has been done.   This inaction sends a very dangerous message: that a Member of  Congress can break the law and the norms of this institution to  obstruct a vote without any consequences. We must rise above partisan  politics and hold our own accountable.   The integrity of our democratic process, the safety of our community,  the trust of the American people, and the function of this body demands  nothing less.   We cannot allow the reckless, calculated actions of one individual to  overshadow the critical work that this  [[Page H6193]]  body does. I am sure that Mr. Bowman is a fine Representative for the  people of his district. This is not a joyous day for anyone here on  this side of the aisle. This is a sad day for this body.   It is an even sadder day if we do nothing about this egregious act. I  recommend that the entire body vote ``yes'' for the censure.
