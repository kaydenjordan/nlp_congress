 Mr. President, a couple of days ago I came to the floor  to talk about the partial government shutdown, how it is impacting  different parts of my State--the Great State of Alaska--and, in  particular, how it is impacting the men and women in the U.S. Coast  Guard.   I think we all recognize as we are trying to work through this  partial government shutdown that a lot of Federal workers are being  impacted, but let me talk about the Coast Guard because I think it is a  little different than almost any other group of Federal workers.   On Tuesday, these brave men and women did not receive a paycheck.  They didn't receive a paycheck, and they are the only branch of the  U.S. military right now, out there around the world and around the  globe, risking their lives for the American people, who are not getting  paid. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines--we love them all. They are  working hard. They are getting paid. The men and women of the Coast  Guard are not getting paid. That is wrong. That is particularly wrong.  They can't leave the Coast Guard. They would get court-martialed. They  are working hard, saving lives in my State, certainly--in Alaska--all  the time, and they are not getting paid when the other services are  getting paid.   So what did we do? A number of us, Democrats and Republicans--almost  one-quarter of the Members of the U.S. Senate--cosponsored a bill that  says: Let's pay the Coast Guard. Let's pay the Coast Guard right now so  they are treated fairly, like the other men and women serving in our  military.   That was a good start. I was optimistic then. It has been a bit of a  roller coaster ride, but, to be honest, I couldn't imagine that this  bill wouldn't sail through. We are not going to be able to fix  everything right now, but this is one we can start working on, on these  individual issues, and there is a lot of talk of doing it.   Last week, I had the opportunity to raise this with the President and  his administration and the Secretary of Homeland Security, and we  continued to press this issue all week with the OMB Director, the Chief  of Staff of the White House, and the President himself, and he said  this week that he was going to support the bill. That is important. Now  you have the executive branch, the President of the United States, and  he will sign it. He said it. I was in a meeting with him yesterday, and  he said he is 100 percent supportive of this bill. It is bipartisan.  There are actually more Democrats than Republicans on the bill right  now.   What we did, trying to move this quickly, is we said: All right, the  President is going to sign it. We have a quarter of the Senate. It is a  bipartisan bill. Let's move it.   We moved to hotline it. What does that mean? To try to get this bill  to be moved through unanimous consent through the Senate, a hotline  means you are going to try to move it real fast and everybody is going  to vote on it. That started today. By noon, every Republican Member of  the U.S. Senate said: Good to go--cleared, hot. Let's pay the men and  women of the Coast Guard.   I had the opportunity to talk to a local public radio program in  Kodiak, the largest Coast Guard station in the country. I had the  opportunity to say to my fellow Alaskans that I am pretty optimistic.  We have moved. We have a lot of cosponsors--25 percent of the Senate,  Democrats and Republicans--and the President of the United States.  Bingo, Republicans have said we are good to go on it. I have certainly  started working with some of my Democratic colleagues who are also  optimistic. Why would we block this? Why would we block this? Remember,  they are the only men and women in the U.S. military not getting paid  right now, and we have a solution.   So I come to the floor, and I hate to admit it because 2 hours ago I  was pretty optimistic, but I am getting word that my colleagues--the  Democrats and the minority leader--are now saying: Maybe we are just  going to block this. I am not sure why. Nobody has come down here to  say why. We are running the hotline on the Democratic side. So maybe  that is just a rumor. I hope it is just a rumor. Why would you block  it? Come on, my colleagues on the other side. Why would you block it?  We are not going to fix everything tonight, but we could fix this  tonight.   Let me talk a little bit about my State. Some of you have probably  seen the ``Deadliest Catch'' and those kind of shows about Alaska. Look  at the men and women who are out there keeping our fishermen--American  fishermen--safe. On average, every month in the State of Alaska the  Coast Guard saves 22 lives--in 1 month, on average, in one State--and  it assists 53 people, reports and investigates 25 maritime casualties,  conducts close to 20 security boardings and over 20 security patrols.  If you are in trouble on the high seas in Alaska, which is a bad place  to be, the seas are never too rough or the skies never too dismal for  the Coast Guard to come out and rescue you. We have seen it time and  again, but it is not just in Alaska. It is all over the country, and it  is all over the world.    I talked to the Commandant of the Coast Guard just yesterday. I said:  Mr. Commandant, Admiral, I think we are close. The President is good to  go. I think most of the Senators are good to go. The bill has 25  cosponsors.   He reminded me that he has men and women in the Coast Guard deployed  in the Persian Gulf doing anti-piracy operations alongside U.S. Marines  and U.S. Navy personnel--right now, in the Persian Gulf, Marines, Coast  Guard, and Navy--and guess who is not getting paid. Does anyone think  that should be a tolerated situation? The answer is no. The answer is  no.   Again, I hope this is a rumor, and that the hotline is happening  right now on the Democratic side. We have cleared it--good to go. Every  Republican has signed off on this. I hope that this is just a rumor-- that tonight the Democrats will clear this and we will get it to the  House. The Coast Guard said they can start cutting checks again within  24 hours. The President will sign this. So there should be no reason  not to do this.   The partial government shutdown is negatively impacting Federal  workers. The President's request, in my view, for border security is  imminently reasonable. I hope the Speaker will view it that way. A lot  of her members are. We are all working for this. We are all working for  a solution. Senator Johnson put out a bill that I joined as a cosponsor  that would immediately pay all workers who are currently working  without pay. This would expand the idea of what we are doing with the  Coast Guard bill. I think it is a good idea. That is a start, but the  Coast Guard bill right now has momentum. It has momentum.   We could get this done in 24 hours. It is not a complete solution,  but we have the White House, and it should be the Senate and,  hopefully, the House getting ready to find a solution for at least for  some of the men and women in the Federal workforce.   But as I like to emphasize, they are not just any Federal workers.  All of  [[Page S292]]  them are important--there is no doubt--but when you are the only  members of the military not getting paid for risking your lives for  your country and we can fix it here tonight in the Senate, that is what  we should be doing.   I certainly hope this bill isn't being blocked unreasonably. As I  mentioned, it is not a complete solution, but it is the start of a  solution. For the life of me, I can't understand why this bill would be  blocked.   More importantly, the men and women of the Coast Guard will not  understand why this bill is being blocked. Communities that support and  depend on the Coast Guard--like Kodiak, AK--will not understand why  this bill is being blocked. These young men and women, who love their  country and have chosen to serve and protect us, are not going to  understand why this bill is being blocked tonight.   I don't want to use the word plead, but I am asking my colleagues on  the Democratic side to do the right thing and pass this bill tonight.  Every single American who is aware of this situation knows that it is  inequitable when the other members of the military--who are out there  risking their lives just like the men and women of the Coast Guard--are  getting paid and the men and women of the Coast Guard aren't.   We are on the verge of a solution. Passing this bill will take care  of at least one issue that we are all trying to resolve. Again, I urge  my Democratic colleagues--because all of my Republican colleagues have  already passed this bill in the hotline. I urge my colleagues to take  up this bill, do the right thing, and support the men and women of the  Coast Guard, who are not being treated equal to their brothers and  sisters in the other branches of the military.   Until then, I am going to continue to fight for this. I am going to  continue to raise the issue. We have made a lot of progress, including  getting the White House and the President on board and getting all of  our Members here on the Republican side of the Senate on board. I am  hopeful, with more advocacy and more reasoning with my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, that we will also get there, move this to  the House quickly, and get the men and women of the Coast Guard the  paychecks they are needing.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
