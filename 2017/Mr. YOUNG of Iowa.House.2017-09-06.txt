 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support  for REAP, the Rural Energy for America Program; the Biomass Crop  Assistance Program; the Biorefinery Assistance Program as well; and for  improving the changes in mandatory spending for these energy programs  when this bill is conferenced with the Senate.   These programs are very important to my State, other States as well.  They have been used to help farmers reduce their overall operating  costs and make their farming businesses more competitive. These  programs have also enabled rural businesses to obtain financing  assistance, ensuring rural Iowa has similar opportunities to thrive and  develop.   Now, I know that we have budget constraints, we are facing them, and  I know the chairman had to make some tough decisions. I believe he took  a very thoughtful approach to the overall agriculture appropriations  bill, and I am very thankful to be on that subcommittee.  [[Page H6848]]    During the full committee markup, I was pleased that the subcommittee  chairman committed to working with me to find alternative offsets to  reduce these spending changes.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chairman Aderholt's attention, and I  appreciate Chairman Frelinghuysen's attention to this matter, too.
