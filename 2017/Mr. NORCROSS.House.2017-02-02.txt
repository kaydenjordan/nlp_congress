 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters from  organizations that have long led the fight for workers' rights: the  AFL-CIO and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.                                                        AFL-CIO,                                                   February 1, 2017.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose the       Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval of the       regulations implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces       Executive Order.        The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations implement the       common-sense proposition that companies wanting to receive       lucrative taxpayer-funded government contracts should comply       with the law and respect workers' rights. The Executive Order       and implementing regulations establish a process for       reviewing the records of companies bidding for federal       business and ensuring that companies that receive this       business comply with the law and respect workers' rights. The       regulations improve the contracting process and establish       more fairness, so that companies that respect workers' rights       do not have a competitive disadvantage when competing against       companies that cheat by misclassifying their workers as       independent contractors, ignoring health and safety hazards,       or engaging in wage theft. Repealing these regulations will       remove an important incentive for companies to pay their       workers what they are due, protect their health and safety,       and comply with the law.        The regulations are needed because the current procurement       system does an inadequate job screening prospective       contractors and their compliance (or non-compliance) with the       law. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office,       federal contracts have been awarded to companies with       significant records of violating wage and hour, health and       safety, and other worker protection laws. A report by the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions similarly       found that the government regularly awards federal contracts       to companies with significant violations of worker protection       laws.        Wiping out these regulations using the Congressional Review       Act is a draconian and unnecessary act. If Congress adopts       this resolution, agencies will be forever barred from       adopting similar regulations in the future. This is overkill.       If Congress has concerns about aspects of the regulations, it       can work with the Trump Administration to modify those       provisions through the regular rulemaking process. Congress       should not use the blunt instrument of the CRA to wipe out       the rules and prevent their adoption in the future.            Sincerely,                                          William Samuel, Director.      Government Affairs Department.                                   ____       [From the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Feb. 2, 2017]   Roll Back of `Fair and Safe Workplaces' Will Hurt Workers, Reward Bad                                   Actors      hoffa statement of legislation aimed at rescinding executive order         Washington.--The following is a statement from Teamsters       General President James P. Hoffa on the House of       Representative's consideration of legislation later today       that would roll back the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces       executive order issued by President Obama in 2014 and       instituted last year.        ``Federal government contractors receive taxpayer dollars       to provide a service or product. And as part of that       agreement, they should be expected to follow the law when it       comes to the workplace and their employees. When they don't,       they hurt working families, they gain unfair advantage over       companies that play by the rules, and they should be held       accountable for their actions.        ``That's what the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive       order that took effect last August ensures. There is nothing       controversial about it. Lawmakers should want workers to       receive the paychecks they earn, be safe on the job and not       be discriminated against.        ``Taxpayer money should not be handed to companies that       blatantly violate labor and workplace laws. If elected       representatives are as truly interested in standing up for       workers as they claim, they will stop efforts to overturn       rules that protect employee pay and ensure workers can       provide for their families.''        Founded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters       represents 1.4 million hardworking men and women throughout       the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.     Mr. Speaker, before entering public office, I was an  electrician. I used to work on top of bridges doing very dangerous  work. Imagine climbing 150 feet up over  [[Page H912]]  water. But over the course of that career, three times, there were  gentlemen I worked with who never went home, never clocked out, never  went home to see their wife or their children.   Every day, 13 Americans are killed on the job; they didn't go home to  see their wife, their children, their husband. Sometimes accidents are  unavoidable, but many, many times they aren't, and that is what we are  talking about here.                                time  1515    The rule doesn't talk about hurting companies. We are talking about  basic information, the same information that everybody in this room  would ask if they were building an addition on their house. You would  want to know, if you were spending $10,000, whether or not that  contractor had any violations, did he finish the job, were people  killed on the job. But when we are spending $81 billion of the American  taxpayer, somehow we don't want to know that. If you go for a loan,  they want to know what your background is, even if you had given it ten  times before. If you are going to college, they certainly want to know  your background.   So what we are talking about here is simple transparency. It is not  just about workplace safety. It is about giving a free pass for  something that they did wrong. Let me repeat that. Something that  contractors did wrong. If they did nothing wrong, they have nothing to  fear. That is why I stand in opposition to this rule.   When I vote against this legislation, I want everybody in this room  to think about 13 men and women who aren't going home tonight, who  wouldn't have to tell anybody that they were killed on their jobs.
