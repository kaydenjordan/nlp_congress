 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts of my friends  across the aisle who believe that they are acting on behalf of  equality. I realize that they believe that their way of approaching  things includes much more wisdom than that of Moses, who is the only  great lawgiver depicted in this Chamber with a full face rather than a  side view.   I would only submit we are not wiser at this time than Moses. I have  heard comments from my friends, including my friend the former law  professor saying he was impressed with the ability of the courts to  sort out these civil rights issues.   But as my friend Justice Scalia once told me: If you guys are going  to screw up legislation over in Congress, don't come running to us all  the time because you don't know how to make laws that are fair.   That is what we have here. In an effort borne out of the best  intentions, we want to help the feelings of people who are gender  confused or just suffering gender dysphoria, the opposite of euphoria.  We don't want to hurt their feelings.    We are told that 25 percent of all women will suffer sexual assault.  The literature is clear that women suffer post-traumatic stress  disorder after sexual assault at three to four times the rate that  soldiers do, and that they are traumatized and retriggered by being in  a confined space like a dressing room or a restroom when a biological  man comes into that private area.   We are going to say to those women: You know what? You have just got  to get over your trauma because for the less than 1 percent who though  a biological man but think they may be a woman, so they are confused  gender-wise, we don't want to hurt their feelings. So you are just  going to have to get over your trauma.   This is what is going on here. If you look at the battered women  shelters around this country, who pays for most of those? It sure  appears to me, for the ones I see, they are Christian, Salvation Army,  Catholic. I have been told by many of these folks: We are just barely  surviving financially. This will force us to change our accommodations,  and we will go out of business.   We believe, as Christians, that Moses had it right on males and  females. Although there are people wiser in their own eyes than Moses  and Jesus, who said exactly verbatim what Moses did, if an orthodox  synagogue says, ``You know what? We think men should be rabbis,'' but  they don't hire the biological woman who says, ``I feel like I am a man  today,'' then they can be sued. But this bill gives not only the  claimant the ability to sue but also allows the Attorney General to  come in with the full force of the United States Government and destroy  that synagogue or that Christian organization.   I know there are people here who think, ``I do a whole lot more good  than these Christian organizations,'' but do you really?   This is borne out of good intentions, but it is going to be so  destructive to common sense and to people, to women who have been hurt.  As we heard in our committee from the second woman to get a scholarship  under Title IX, you are going to destroy women's scholarships.   She had a chart there. The three top times for the 400-meter in the  Olympics of 2016, she said there are thousands of men who have better  times. I know my friends said in the hearing, ``Gee, we know that men  would never act like a woman just to get a massive amount of money and  scholarships.''   I don't want to hear the majority say later, ``Wow, we really didn't  think that would happen.'' It is already happening.   If we are going to preserve the gains made by women under Title IX,  this needs to fail and not become the law. To preserve what we have  already done in the way of gains for women, I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, we heard a great deal of applause today  from all around the gallery when the so-called Equality Act passed.   Equality, what it really means is equality for some, but if you  believe the teachings of Moses and Jesus, then you are not only not  going to be treated equally, you are going to be persecuted,  prosecuted, tied up in court.   You will have people try to destroy not only you, but any religious  institution that tries to faithfully follow the teachings of Moses and  Jesus.   So the Equality Act is a misnomer, as is the statement that this  means the end of persecution.   Somehow, I hear Al Pacino in the background when it comes to  persecution, saying, Oh, I'm just getting started.   So I come before the House with a broken heart, as someone who has  studied, loved history, studied history, continues to read more  history, constantly.   This Nation is in big trouble. We have gone from the days when--I  guess the Bible is still probably the most-quoted book, year after  year, in this body, but somehow it often is used for personal abuse or  used without giving real context and real meaning.   But above every door in the gallery is the side profile of what were  once considered the greatest lawgivers in all of history. Some of us  learned about the code of Hammurabi. He is up there. The Justinian Code  is next to Hammurabi.   I think there are two or three Popes that were considered great  lawgivers.   Some wonder why Napoleon is up there, but the Napoleonic code is  still the basis of law in Louisiana.   Jefferson wasn't there during the Constitution, but he helped with a  great many laws and, of course, did most of the writing of the  Declaration of Independence. But there was much in the Constitution, or  a number of things were based on some things that Jefferson had already  worked on.   But the only profile that is not a side profile is that of Moses.   When Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke last in here, from this podium  behind me, the second level--some people wonder why the President, or  people like Netanyahu speak at the second level and not the top level,  and that is because this is the people's House. To speak in here you  must either be a Member of Congress or have been invited by the  Congress to speak here. That is why they are at the second level.  [[Page H3957]]    But, at the end of Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, he paid tribute  to the fact that he was facing a great Israelite, Moses; that, like I  say, at one time he was considered the greatest lawgiver of all times.   In view of decisions over the last 50 years, we have had a majority-- the Supreme Court, probably has reduced his 10 commandments down to  four or five.   But this bill, today, will allow persecution and prosecution of  anyone who tries to faithfully follow the teachings of Moses and Jesus.   When it comes to marriage, I know the Supreme Court has ruled. They  have substituted a majority, at least five judges, substituted their  opinions, and that is what they are, opinions, for that of the law, the  Constitution; because the Constitution, if you really followed it  strictly, marriage is not mentioned as a power or something that the  Federal Government would have power over. So, as the 10th Amendment  says, such a thing would be left to the States and the people. And many  of us believe that is where it should have been left.    But the Supreme Court, at least five oligarchs, decided to take that  over. And since they were so much wiser in their own eyes than Moses  and Jesus, they substituted their opinion for the opinions of the  people of 50 different States and, just basically, took over that  function, without amending the Constitution, without even changing the  law legislatively, or referendum, any means like that. They just  substituted their opinion.   It was Moses who said a man shall leave his father and mother, a  woman leaves her home, and the two will become one flesh.   When Jesus was asked--naturally the Pharisees were testing him,  trying to trick him, but he quoted Moses verbatim; man shall leave his  father and mother, a woman leaves her home, the two will become one  flesh. But Jesus added another line on to that: What God has joined  together, let no man put asunder. Nobody separate.   There is a video called White Winds, and in that video, the research  they have done indicated that there has only been one time in recorded  history when legal marriage included same-sex couples.   And, of course, those of us that have studied history, think about,  historically, the Roman Empire days, when same-sex couples were widely  accepted. Ancient Greece, same-sex couples were widely accepted.   But according to the research, this indication was that they say  marriage is, basically, as being an institution for procreation. And so  marriage was a man and woman. Have whatever same-sex relations you  want, but in those times and places, marriage was said to be between a  man and a woman, if it was legal.   Some of us would think back to the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, when-- well, the term ``sodomy'' comes from Sodom. But when same-sex relations  were widely accepted, obviously, no discrimination.   But according to the research in the documentary, marriage, even in  Sodom and Gomorrah, did not include same-sex couples because marriage  was for procreation, family.   According to the research, there is one recorded piece of information  about legalized marriage being same-sex couples. It was from a  Babylonian Talmud that indicated that during something called the Days  of Noah, marriage was legal between a same-sex couple.   So, according to the research of that documentary, we are living in  days similar to the days of Noah before the flood.   We are now beginning, in this country, in recent years, to experience  what people fled to this country to avoid experiencing, and that is,  discrimination against an individual because of their religious belief  as Christians.   Whether the Pilgrims, or so many other groups that came, of course,  there were some, even prisoners that came for other reasons. But in the  settlement of North America, what is now the United States, over 90  percent accepted Judeo-Christian beliefs as appropriate and the norm.   Some called Jefferson anything but a Christian, but he made clear  that he believed the teachings of Jesus. The story is told that--and I  did ask the opinion, or not an opinion, but ask for the facts from the  Congressional Research Service--about this Capitol being used as the  largest Christian church in Washington, D.C., in the District of  Columbia.   They came back with the information that it truly was; that what we  now call Statuary Hall--back at the time it was the House of  Representatives' Chamber--for the majority of the 1800s it was  considered, or it was used on Sundays for Christian worship service.  And Thomas Jefferson, as CRS verified, would come to the church  service--the nondenominational, Christian worship service that was held  just down the hall--each Sunday that he was in Washington during his  time as President.   The story is told that on one of those occasions he was riding his  horse, as he normally did, to come to church up here on top of Capitol  Hill in the Capitol. And someone saw him with a big Bible and asked,  Where are you going, Mr. President? And he said, I'm going to church up  in the Capitol.   And the individual said, But you don't believe everything that they  do.   And he said, Sir, I am the highest elected magistrate in this  country. It is imperative that I set the proper example.   So those were early beliefs. Sometimes it is hard for us to reconcile  those beliefs with the cruelty of slavery.   Even Jefferson, in the first version of the Declaration of  Independence--what looks like the longest grievance against King  George--Jefferson was saying, We have a right to separate from King  George because of the fact that he allowed slavery to ever start in  America.   So, on the one hand, Jefferson actually understood how destructive  slavery was; and on the other hand, he had slaves.   But it is--if you look through our history and how we improved up  until now, the great strides in civil rights, great victories in civil  rights, have come based on a powerful push from churches, Christian  churches, and from people who were guided by Christian principles.   The 1730s, 1740s, 1750s, sometimes referred to as the first great  awakening in America, powerful, powerful time of revival.   Winthrop is said to have spoken to a majority of Americans. They knew  of him or had heard him speak. He was a traveling evangelist.                                time  1300    Many historians say it was the great awakening and the belief in  religious freedom that drove--the belief in freedom that drove those  early Americans to a Revolution in standing for the rights given by our  creator and acknowledging, of course, that there is a creator.   Of course, the Constitution is written, agreed to in 1787, ratified  in 1789, but it is concluded, it is dated, ``In the year of our Lord  one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven,'' and it is referring to  our Lord.   I am sure that if many judges, many Federal judges had their way, we  would strike ``our Lord'' from the Constitution, as them thinking that  is somehow unconstitutional to mention ``our Lord'' in our own  Constitution.   But you look in the 1800s, certainly there were secularists who saw  the damage of slavery and there were some churches that supported it,  but the movement toward abolition was driven by people who believed in  God, most of them in Jesus Christ.   John Quincy Adams, who ran for the House after being President, stood  up down the hall over and over to speak against slavery. He had written  to a guy named William Wilberforce in England. Wilberforce had a  spiritual Christian awakening and ran for parliament. He believed God's  call on him was to bring an end to slavery in all of the British  empire, and that is what he spent his adult life in parliament trying  to do.   He had a victory at one point, partially through his parliamentary  career, in getting the slave trade outlawed. But still slavery  persisted, just not the trade in Great Britain. And then 3 days before  he died in 1833, slavery was outlawed altogether.   John Quincy Adams thought he was supposed to bring an end to slavery  in America the way Wilberforce had fought and successfully done in  England, but he didn't get it done.  [[Page H3958]]    He served in the House of Representatives from 1831 until his massive  stroke in 1848. It happened when he was trying to get up and speak  against the war with Mexico, because he was afraid war with Mexico  would end up perpetuating slavery even longer.   Daniel Webster, one of the great abolitionists, he would have crowds  gather around outside his office during times when he would read the  Bible out loud from within his office.   I have been here in Congress since January of 2005, and I don't  believe I have ever heard anybody reading out loud from the Bible and  having crowds gather around the outside of their office in the hall  here at the Capitol, but it used to happen.   Daniel Webster was driven by his Christian beliefs that slavery had  to come to an end. He, John Quincy Adams, so many others believed that  it was totally inconsistent. How could we expect God to keep blessing  America when we were putting our brothers and sisters in chains? The  church-ordained ministers were such a powerful force in bringing an end  to the evil cruelty called slavery here in America.   Then in the 1950s and 1960s, we didn't have a great awakening in the  20th century, but nonetheless, there was an ordained Christian minister  named Martin Luther King, Jr., and he was guided, informed by his  Christian beliefs. He was the most powerful individual force in moving  our country into accepting what the Constitution said and in assuring  that people would be treated equally.   But what Congress has been doing in recent years is passing more and  more legislation that will permit persecution of people trying to  follow their Christian beliefs, and that passed the House today.   Born out of the best intentions of people that don't want to see  anybody persecuted, and yet as a result of this bill, if it were to  become law, there would be widespread persecution and prosecution of  people who try to hold to their Christian beliefs.   And I know our friends don't want to harm battered women or do damage  to women's shelters, but I tried to encourage my friends, look at the  literature about women who are victims of sexual assault.   Having been a felony judge for a decade, I heard testimony constantly  about the victims and the victims' suffering and their ongoing  suffering and their trauma that they continued to live through and the  things that triggered their trauma.   It appears from the research literature that women--of course, we are  told that one out of four women will experience sexual assault.   We are also told that it is a fraction of 1 percent, a fraction of a  fraction, perhaps, of 1 percent of people who truly suffer from gender  dysphoria.   It used to be called a disorder. I think it still was in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV. It for sure was in III. But now  in V, it is called gender dysphoria, dysphoria being the opposite of  euphoria. It is a confusion, a dissatisfaction, an unhappiness with a  biological gender, so gender dysphoria.   It is interesting, even in the Equality Act itself, I mean, at one  place here it recites findings, and here on the bottom of pages 6 and  7, it points out that about one in five transgender people experience  homelessness.   Now, it doesn't go into the reasons for that, if that is true. And  possibly there could be discrimination that leads to homelessness, but  since this is a condition of unhappiness, a dysphoria, we don't know  the reasons for one in five, if that is correct, of people suffering  from gender dysphoria being homeless.   But without giving that finding, you go through the bill, this bill  is going to allow people to sue lenders who don't lend to people  suffering from gender dysphoria at the same rate as those who do not  suffer from gender dysphoria. Well, not only can those seeking loans  come against and sue the bank and win, the attorney general of the  United States is authorized under this bill to bring the full power of  the United States Government at war against any individual who  questions or is concerned about lending money to someone suffering from  this dysphoria.   But if someone even considered the fact that this gender unhappiness  or dysphoria, if they even considered that, then they are going to lose  the lawsuit under this bill to the individual and to the Attorney  General of the United States.    Now, previously, ministers were thought to have some religious  exemption. This is the first bill in American history we could find,  and it is certainly the first one since the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act of 1993, but the first time a bill actually spells out  specifically that you cannot claim religious beliefs as a defense.   So I am not hearing people talk about it, but I understand that  Orthodox Jewish synagogues believe they should have men as rabbis.   Well, under this, if it becomes law, if a woman comes forward and  says, ``I believe I am a man and I want to be your rabbi,'' and they  are not hired, well, not only does that person have a claim against the  synagogue, but also the Attorney General can come in and destroy the  synagogue financially. And that can happen with any church.   If a church says, ``We love everybody,'' like my own church,  Christian church, Green Acres Baptist, we love everybody. We welcome  anybody in our church. We will not discriminate against anybody who  wants to come worship the Lord with us. But if you want to be married,  it needs to be what Moses and Jesus said marriage is. Well, in the  past, you could utilize religion, religious beliefs as a defense, but  if this is the law of the land, then there will be no defense for  religious beliefs.   And, again, if White Winds is correct, then for the first time since  the days of Noah, we have come to believe that we are so much smarter  and so much wiser than Moses and Jesus. So it is an amazing time.   I know Christian friends say, Louie, you seem so down. You know, Paul  said, ``Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.'' And I  understand that, but I also know that as Jesus contemplated Jerusalem,  he had a broken heart. He said:         How many times have I wanted to bring you under my wing and       love you and protect you, and you wouldn't have it.    So there is a rebellion going on in this country, a rejection of  things upon which this country was founded.   And, you know, people try to paint someone like me as being a hater.  I am not a hater. There is nobody in this body I hate.   At a recent event, I had a person who looked like a woman, she said  she believed she was a woman, and we had a talk for about 20 minutes.  And I understood her thinking and I understood what she felt, though  she was a biological man. We disagreed about her lifestyle, but I had  nothing but Christian love. And we hugged, agreed to disagree, and  hugged as we went our ways. We were up here at the Washington  Convention Center.   I don't hate her. I don't hate anybody.   Plenty of people hate me.   But it is so unfair to say that anybody, just because they believe in  the teachings of Moses and Jesus, is a hater. It is simply not true.   But I do know that if anybody is not willing to forgive and love,  they haven't really grasped what it means to be a Christian.                                time  1315    But it doesn't mean you have to accept and encourage and applaud  things that you know are not helpful. I mean, for heaven's sake, the  most thorough research ever done on transgender--and it was done, I  believe it was Finland, a 30-year study, people seeking sex change  surgery--that 30-year study found that those who were seeking sex  change surgery were 20 times more likely to commit suicide. Now, how  could somebody who loves their fellow man and fellow woman, how could  somebody who truly loves them want them in a state of mind in life that  they are 20 times more likely to kill themselves, to take that precious  gift of life they were given? How is that loving somebody to want them,  encourage them, Oh, you stay in this lifestyle. You are ten times more  likely to kill yourself, but that is fine, we applaud you for being in  that situation, 20 times more likely to kill yourself.   And there is this great study here, ``The New Atlantis, a Journal of  Technology and Society'', this is from the fall of 2016, of a special  report on sexuality and gender: Findings from the biological,  psychological, and social sciences, by Lawrence Mayer, MB, MS, Ph.D.,  and Paul R. McHugh, MD. Dr.  [[Page H3959]]  McHugh is an amazing, brilliant man. He was the head of psychiatry at  Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins was the first hospital in the United  States who did sex change operations.   But as Dr. McHugh points out, after about 20 years of monitoring the  people on whom they did sex change surgery, they found that the  patients who went through this brutal, really brutal sex change  surgery, were no better off mentally than they were before. That was  Johns Hopkins' finding. They said: Why should we cut off or take out  perfectly healthy organs if the result is the person is no better? So  they quit doing sex change operations. As I understand it, they were  later threatened with losing a lot of money in support, so they are  back doing them now.   We hear from the left all the time about the importance of science,  and yet when it comes to science, like the heartbeat bill based on  science, we have been told that it is nothing but a mass of tissue  inside a pregnant woman. And yet, technology now has gotten so good  that at some 6 or 8 weeks into a pregnancy, you can hear a heartbeat,  and that heartbeat is from a living person.   And as has been said on this floor previously, if someone sees a body  collapse, you run up and check if there is a heartbeat. If there is a  heartbeat, you call for an ambulance. If there is no heartbeat, you  call for a morgue. We put a lot of stock in a heartbeat, so why  shouldn't it be part of a bill? And yet States that have passed the  legislation that says there is a heartbeat, then you can't do an  abortion, it is a living being.   Personally, I am thankful that nurturing women are the ones who carry  a child in utero, because if it were left to us men, I don't believe  there would be near as much love and affection felt by the child in  utero.   But I think back about when our first child was born 8 to 10 weeks  prematurely and my wife had to stay in Tyler. I didn't know whether to  stay with her or go with our child who was taken to Shreveport, trying  to keep her alive. She said: Go. Do anything you can for our child.   So I went to Shreveport. When I got there, the neonatologist, Dr.  Singh--just a wonderful, wonderful doctor. He loved those babies--he  said: Look, your baby's eyes, they are not working properly. She can't  see you, just a general blur. But she has been listening to your voice  for many months now. Even though she was in the womb, she could hear  your voice. She knows your voice. You talk to her. Stay here and talk  to her, caress, talk, that will be a great comfort.   And as most people know, a premature child, usually the lungs are the  last to develop, and that was Katy's case. The breaths were so short  and just erratic, and the heartbeat was really fast and erratic. It was  in Tyler and it was in Shreveport. After a couple hours of my sitting  there and just talking to her and caressing her little arms and face,  Dr. Singh came over and said: Have you looked at the monitors? And I  hadn't. I was looking at our child.   I looked up. The breathing was still fast, the heart was still fast,  but they had stabilized, they were not erratic. And Dr. Sing said: She  is drawing strength from you. She is drawing life and strength from  you. Well, how was I going to leave after that? They said I could only  stay 2 hours, but I couldn't leave. My child was drawing strength from  me.   So after I had been there 8 hours, he came over and said: Sir, you  really have to leave, you have got to take a break, you can't sit here  this long. And I said: But look at the monitor, she is doing well, I  don't want to leave. Eventually, they forced me to leave, but my mind  was back with Katy.   Anyway, that child knew my voice. She could hear my voice those 7  months in the womb. They know. They make a difference.   And the people who have supported the heartbeat bill, all of them  that I am aware of here in this body, it is based on Judeo-Christian  beliefs and the value of one person, the right to life that precedes  the right to liberty and pursuit of happiness.   This body has been in the business of taking away religious freedoms  for quite some time, and it appears that it is going to continue. But,  Mr. Speaker, I just want people to understand, the positions of the  people I know of who were against the Equality Act, it is not out of  any hate, it is not out of any desire to be discriminatory, part of it  is a desire not to have people 20 times more likely to kill themselves.   For heaven's sake, we have enough veterans taking their own lives, so  tragic; Americans taking their lives, so tragic. There is not much you  can say at a funeral of someone who has taken their life that brings a  lot of comfort to the family.   It specifically says in here, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as  amended, and it says right here in the bill that people who are  transgender, one in five will experience homelessness, without telling  us why. It says, So you have got to give them credit. Well, we  just brought our economy to the brink of ruin in 2008. And at some  point, in the beginning of that tragedy, we almost lost everything,  back in the nineties, when banks were required to lend money for homes  to people who couldn't afford it.    And I personally feel like some of the lenders who pushed people into  homes fraudulently that they couldn't afford should have done some jail  time. But it went on, it happened. A lot of lenders have told me over  the years: We are being forced to lend money to people we know can't  afford it, but, if we don't, the Federal Government is coming after us.  And if this bill becomes law, that will be the case, too.   A banker who says, Well, I am a little concerned, there is a 20  percent chance that this person suffering from gender dysphoria is  going to be homeless. They don't make good decisions. Maybe it is  because of some discrimination, but certainly some of it is because of  poor personal decisions. And now I have got the Federal Government  under this Equality Act saying I have got to lend them money anyway.  That if the fact that they are 20 percent more likely to be homeless,  if I consider that at all and say, We can't risk that money, we don't  want to bring the country to the brink of failure again, then the  United States Attorney General is authorized to sue me. The individual  that is not granted the loan will be authorized to sue.   This bill, though, unlike the Hate Crimes Act, some of us were  pushing in the Hate Crimes Act, let's at least define what sexual  orientation is. So because, as I said back then in debate, if you don't  define sexual orientation, some judge sometime in the Supreme Court at  some point will say, Well, you didn't define it, but you used the term  sexual orientation. So the meaning of that is very clear: anything you  are oriented toward sexually. So that would legalize some sexual  orientations that are currently crimes, whether it is necrophilia,  pedophilia.   Some have tried to say that I equated homosexuality and bestiality.  They were lying. I never did that. I said, let's define out those  things that we can agree should not be included, and we were refused  any type of limiting definition.   So one thing in this, there is a limitation that says, sexual  orientation. The term sexual orientation means, homosexuality,  heterosexuality, or bisexuality.   But then when it comes to gender identity, that definition is going  to cause a great deal of problems. And it makes clear, it even spells  out that you cannot deny access to a restroom, locker room, dressing  room, based on gender identity. It says, that is in accordance with the  individual's gender identity.   My friend, very smart friend, Mr. Askin, said that he has been amazed  over the years how courts could move forward and progress in  determining people's civil rights. He felt like we are not going to  ever have a problem with men claiming to be women, so they can get huge  scholarships, national notoriety, millions of dollars, or television  appearances. No man would ever do that. And if they tried, the courts  have been really good about being able to discern who is faking, who is  a man that says they are a woman and they really don't mean it, and who  is legitimately a man thinking that they are a woman.                                time  1330    The trouble with that is this Equality Act makes clear no individual  has the right to tell someone who says, ``I think I am a woman,'' if  you don't think they are a woman and you try to  [[Page H3960]]  ask questions to determine if they are really thinking they are a woman  before you treat the person like one, you have just violated the  Equality Act. You can't call into question somebody's own self- determinative identity of what they are, genderwise. This bill makes  that very clear. They and the Attorney General of the United States can  come after you.   That is why some people who have probably never voted for a  Republican in their lives have been heard saying: Wait a minute. Title  IX back in 1970 says you have to have an equal number of women's  scholarships and men's scholarships.   We had a witness who is a professor and said she was one of the first  couple of people to get a women's athletic scholarship under title IX  at Villanova, where she went to school. She pointed out: Look, here are  the three fastest times of the women in the 2016 Olympics in the 400  meter. Those are those three dots. And then the thousands of blue dots,  thousands of which are faster than those women, those are men, and many  of those are second-tier athletes. They are not great male athletes,  and they still beat the best women's time.   Just in the last couple of weeks, we had a guy who believes he is a  woman, and he broke a number of weightlifting records for women.   I know there are a lot of Democratic Party voters who may have been  here in the gallery clapping, violating the rules and clapping on the  passage of the Equality Act, but I have a feeling they have a daughter  who cannot get an athletic scholarship even though she is the best  female athlete in her high school, one of the best female athletes in  the State, and they are shut out from a female athletic scholarship  because guys are now applying who think they are women, and you can't  question them.   If they tell you they have self-identified as a woman under this  Equality Act, if that becomes the law, and you try to challenge them on  whether they really do think they are a woman or not, then you are wide  open to the Attorney General coming into your school and costing mega- dollars.   But I have talked to people who worked in women's shelters, and they  have said: We have been totally dedicated for decades to helping women  who are battered by sexual assault, maybe a husband assault. But we are  a Christian group, and if we are mandated to allow a man to come in  because he thinks he is a woman, we are mandated to bring them in where  these women are so vulnerable and so fragile, we will have to close our  doors.   I have had small college leaders tell me: If this bill becomes law,  we will have to change so much in the way of accommodation to  accommodate people under the new law that we will have to shut our  doors. We are just barely making it by a shoestring right now.   Now, the massive colleges and universities, you know, they are  getting so much money these days, they will be okay. But the small  colleges, they are going to have trouble coming up with the money.   The women's shelters are going to have trouble coming up with the  money, and they are not going to want to. They care so deeply about the  women who have been battered. I have seen it. I have talked to them.  But I have experienced the love they have for these women. They are  just at the end of their rope. And they sometimes call the women's  homeless shelter. They have nowhere else to go.   Now, after they have been brutalized by a husband or some other man,  somebody that is stalking them, they are going to be told they can't  keep a man out if he thinks he is a woman. They will close their doors.   So I know this Equality Act was done out of the spirit of caring and  not wanting to hurt anybody's feelings, but as we have heard over and  over throughout the history of this place, rights do have to be  balanced.   So on the one hand, you have people who are very confused and unhappy  about their gender, even though there is also plenty of evidence to  indicate that a child who identifies with the gender that that child is  not biologically, if that child is left alone, not pushed in one  direction or another, over 80 percent of the time that child will  ultimately resolve the situation and become comfortable, mentally, with  their biological gender.   But someone like Walt Heyer--I love the guy; he has been a woman,  physically, and he is back being a man--tried to commit suicide, and  now he spends his time lovingly counseling, encouraging, trying to talk  people down from killing themselves. He is just a sweetheart of a guy.  I saw him again, recently.   But if this Equality Act becomes law, he won't be able to do that  anymore. You can't try to talk somebody through their difficulty, their  suicide ideations if you are going to encourage them to be mentally  what they are biologically, because this allows even the Attorney  General to come after people like that.   People in this body would think such a person is mean-spirited. I  don't find a mean-spirited bone in Walt Heyer's body. He is just a  sweetheart of a person.   But when you hear people say this bill will bring an end to  persecution, it will bring an end to discrimination, that is true with  regard to someone who is different, mentally, from what they are  biologically at that moment.   As I said, the studies indicate that over 80 percent of the time,  someone who is left alone and not trying to be coached one way or  another, they end up having their mental attitude on gender resolving  and being biologically and mentally the same gender.   But you try to counsel somebody on that, you are going to be sued  individually. The Attorney General can come after you. And if your  position is based on the kind of love that Jesus Christ has filled you  with, care and compassion, and you try to counsel someone out of that  love and compassion, well, you have just violated the Equality Act, and  Big Brother government is coming after you.   It is really tragic. We used to have more religious freedom. Yes,  there were a lot of battles between denominations in America, and that  is why, in the Continental Congress, everybody didn't trust one person  in the Continental Congress to do a prayer that was fair to everybody,  because there were so many different denominations.   It sounded like the Quakers were usually the toughest to please by a  prayer by somebody who was not a Quaker. But they were always able to  come together and agree: Okay. This minister may not be from my  Christian denomination, but that minister will do a fair prayer for all  of the Christian denominations here.   But that is why, when Benjamin Franklin made his motion 5 weeks into  the Constitutional Convention, that they begin each day with prayer the  way they had during the Continental Congress, it ended up being voted  down, because, basically, they were saying: We don't have a treasury.  We are not getting paid, and so we can't afford to hire a chaplain we  can all agree on. So, if we can just get a Constitution together, then  we can have a treasury, then we can hire a Christian minister to come  in here and pray for all of the denominations represented here.   That is when Randolph from Virginia said: Okay. All right. You are  right. We don't have money to hire a chaplain right now, so I move that  we recess. Here we are, the end of June. A few days from now, it will  be July Fourth. We are going to celebrate our Nation's independence. I  move that we recess here in this Constitutional Convention and we  reconvene together at a church that has a minister that we can all  trust to be fair to our Christian denominations. Then we will worship  together, and after we worship together, then we will come back and try  this constitution, try putting one together.   Now, that one passed, and they all gathered at the Reformed Calvinist  Church in Philadelphia.   My friend Dave Brat loves that because he is Calvinist.   And the Reverend William Rogers was the minister presiding.  Apparently, he did an awesome job as a Christian minister of bringing  all of these delegates attending the Constitutional Convention  together.   It was written by others that when they reconvened, there was a new  spirit. Yes, they had disagreements, but there was a new spirit there.   I know people are taught nowadays that Benjamin Franklin was a deist,  someone who doesn't believe in God, just thinks some force, some thing,  [[Page H3961]]  something, created the universe, and if that thing or force, person, is  still around, it never interferes with nature or man. Everybody is on  their own.   But it was Ben Franklin that said: ``I have lived, Sir, a long time,  and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth-- that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to  the ground without His notice, is it possible that an empire can rise  without His aid?   We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that `except the  Lord build the House they labor in vain that build it.' I firmly  believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we  shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of  Babel.''   We will be confined by our local partial interests; and we,  ourselves, shall become a byword down through the ages.   That is because he knew this was the best chance in the history of  all of the world to have people self-governing. The Romans had a form  and the Greeks had a form, but not like this.   We have been blessed. We have continued to work together over the  centuries to get the Constitution to where all people will be treated  as they are created: equal; not equal in talent or intellect, but equal  in the sight of God, our Creator.   Yet, the Equality Act sends a message that if you are going to base  your life on the teachings of Moses or Jesus or both, then we will not  only persecute you, we will prosecute you. And the Attorney General of  the United States is authorized under the Equality Act, basically, to  destroy your life if you happen to believe and practice what Moses and  Jesus said.   We have done so much destruction of families in this country over the  last 50 to 60 years, and it is tough. I have seen it. People I love  have been a single mom or single dad raising kids. It is tough.   We have taken action, passed laws that really have been destructive  of the home as a nuclear home. We have seen the falling away from  Judeo-Christian beliefs.   As John Adams said, this Constitution is only meant for a religious  and a moral people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any  others.   So this is one more nail in America's coffin. As Jefferson said, I  fear for America because I know God is just. But this says Moses and  Jesus were just wrong. Anybody who tries to follow those teachings  publicly, we are going to destroy you until we make everybody equal  except Orthodox Jews and Christians following the Bible, and also  Muslims who are following the Koran. They will not be able to follow  the teachings of the Koran if this becomes law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 46 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, May  20, 2019, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
