 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition today  against H.R. 1280. This bill is nothing more than a get-cops-killed  campaign. It sends one clear message: Democrats hate law enforcement.   This bill does not bring justice to victims. It just takes revenge on  all of the men and women in uniform. Meanwhile, Speaker Pelosi is  surrounded by an army of taxpayer-funded law enforcement 24 hours a  day, 7 days a week.   This bill disarms cops and opens them to frivolous lawsuits by  lawyers representing criminals who got their feelings hurt simply  because they broke the law and got arrested.   Speaker Pelosi is putting police on a hit list to be ambushed while  on the job keeping our streets safe. So I have one message for  Democrats: Shame on you.   Shame on you for using these men and women to protect your fortress  [[Page H869]]  while destroying their rights and livelihoods. Don't call a cop for  help if this is how you are going to treat them. You should tell them  to go home. At least then, they won't have to stand guard while you  dismantle everything they stand for.
