 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the veterans  of our country. There are over 16,000 veterans in my district.   Mr. Speaker, 16,000 people have given their heart and soul to our  Nation. For so many, that call to serve has affected their health.   In my district alone, the VA has received 1,164 claims under the PACT  Act as of this October. That was possible because of the incredible  work of House Democrats to pass this law last Congress.   Currently, many VA centers lack the ability to provide care for  gynecological cancers. That leaves female veterans to search for their  own care. That must change. We need to fight for our female veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to reintroducing the Veterans' Cancer  Care Coordinator Act this week. This bill would create coordinators to  help female veterans receive the care they need from diagnosis through  remission. This builds on the successful Maternal Care Coordination  program at the VA.   As a Nation, we must protect our Nation's heroes. We must also put  veterans above politics. We must thank them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the veterans for their service.                            ____________________
