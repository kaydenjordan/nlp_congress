 Mr. Speaker, science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics, or STEM, is an industry comprised of physicists, chemical  and biomedical engineers, and professionals creating and developing  innovative technologies.   Demand for workers in these fields is high, but women remain  underrepresented, especially in engineering and computer sciences.  According to a study by the National Girls Collaborative, women make up  nearly 50 percent of the overall workforce but less than 30 percent of  careers in STEM.   Women have made tremendous strides in this field over the last few  decades, but women's underrepresentation in STEM limits discoveries and  holds back our economy. Today I want to tell Members about an  outstanding woman in my district who is paving the way for women in  STEM.   Aria Soha from Batavia, Illinois, works as the installation  coordinator for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program at Fermi National  Laboratory. Aria was an outstanding student in math throughout school  and chose to major in physics her second year of college at Carnegie  Mellon University.   In college, Aria worked relentlessly to find research opportunities  and got the chance to build microwave telescopes, tools to examine  high-energy radio waves that are hard to observe from the ground. After  graduating, Aria accepted a job at Fermi Lab, a world-class research  facility we are proud of in the 14th District.   There are so many hidden figures in STEM, and I am proud to shine a  bright light on the strong, smart women in the 14th District leading  and making a difference in our community.                            ____________________
