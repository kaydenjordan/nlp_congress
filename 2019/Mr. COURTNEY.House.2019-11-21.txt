 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 1309.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, today's vote on H.R. 1309 is an important milestone in  what has been a 7-year process of getting the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration to effectively act to protect the healthcare and  social service workforce from skyrocketing rates of violence.   Sadly, in America today, nurses, doctors, social workers, EMTs, and  nursing assistants are more likely to be the victim of on-the-job  violence than any other sector of our Nation's workforce.   This violence comes in the form of assaults, kicking, hitting,  choking, and spitting from patients and residents and clients or those  who may accompany them. It affects a worker's sense of safety at work.  It contributes to burnout, absenteeism, high workers' compensation  costs, and stress. Tragically, it can also lead to death.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, healthcare and social  service workers are more than five times as likely to suffer a serious  injury from workplace violence than workers in other settings. And this  chart, which shows the red line of healthcare workers versus other  sectors in the U.S. economy vividly, powerfully demonstrates the data  that is coming into the Department of Labor on this issue.   In psychiatric hospitals, that number is drastically higher. In a  recent survey, nearly 50 percent of emergency room physicians report  having been physically assaulted at work, and 60 percent of those who  have these occurrences said they happened in the past year.   As this graph shows, these numbers are on the rise. The incidents of  violence in the workplace have increased 80 percent over the last  decade.   Since OSHA has not effectively addressed this emergency, this bill is  necessary to ensure that a standard is issued and enforced in a  reasonable period of time.   Using past precedent, the bill calls for an interim final standard  within 1 year and a final standard within 42 months. The public comment  and rulemaking process is preserved in the development of the final  standard.   Very simply, the standard required by the bill would require that  covered employers, such as hospitals and psychiatric facilities,  develop a workplace violence prevention plan that is tailored to the  specific conditions and hazards present at each workplace. It is not a  one-size-fits-all requirement.   Madam Chair, developing a plan is not rocket science. For over 20  years, OSHA has published voluntary guidelines on violence prevention  that include commonsense measures, such as training staff about how to  identify high-risk patients, share the information with coworkers, not  be alone, and ways to de-escalate threats. We know from the Joint  Commission on Hospital Accreditation that these measures work, and the  problem is, though, that there is no consistent enforceable standard to  ensure their application, and that is precisely what this bill does.   While we will never eliminate all risk or stop every violent attack,  research on the measures in this legislation have been shown to  substantially cut the incidence of serious injury from workplace  violence. The nurses, doctors, social workers, and EMTs who care for us  in our times of crisis and need deserve to have these protections soon,  not in 7 years and not in 20 years, as is likely if we fail to pass  this legislation into law, leaving OSHA rulemaking to its own dilatory,  almost comatose, devices.   I would like to thank the large coalition of healthcare  professionals, their organizations, and union representation who have  diligently fought for these protections for years; the subcommittee  chair, Alma Adams, of the Workforce Subcommittee on Education and Labor  and Chairman  Bobby Scott for their leadership; also, Richard Miller  and Jordan Barab, our committee staff, who have done amazing work, as  well as Maria Costigan from my personal office, who have just worked  night and day for years to try and get us to this point.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   [[Page H9128]]                                            House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, September 6, 2019.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chair, Committee on Education and Labor,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: I write concerning H.R. 1309, the       ``Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act,'' which was additionally referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 1309, the Committee on Energy and Commerce agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that       fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce. The Committee takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. I also request that you support my       request to name members of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce to any conference committee to consider such       provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter in       the report on the bill and into the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of H.R. 1309.            Sincerely,                                                 Frank Pallone, Jr.      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Education and Labor, House of             Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, September 9, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: In reference to your letter of       September 6, 2019, I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 1309, the ``Workplace Violence       Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.''        I appreciate the Committee on Energy and Commerce's waiver       of consideration of H.R. 1309 as specified in your letter. I       acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite       floor consideration of H.R. 1309 and does not in any way       waive or diminish the Committee on Energy and Commerce's       jurisdictional interests over this or similar legislation.        I would be pleased to include our exchange of letters on       this matter in committee report for H.R. 1309 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill       to memorialize our joint understanding.        Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.            Sincerely,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just note that this is a bipartisan effort. There are 227  cosponsors in the House, 8 Republicans. And again, we have had lots of  engagement, accommodated a number of the issues that came up at the  public hearing process.   Again, I would just note that I appreciate the fact that the ranking  member spoke highly of OSHA's volunteer guidelines, which I have in my  hand here. Those are actually incorporated into the bill language for  the interim final standard. So we are working exactly with the  guidelines that she endorsed.  [[Page H9129]]    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Khanna), an early advocate of this measure.    Madam Chair, again very quickly, the mandate costs that  CBO scored, the $1.7 billion, that is spread out over 200,000  facilities, if you read their note closely. If you do the math, we are  talking about a $9,000 cost per year for facilities. That, in my  opinion, in terms of protecting their workforce, is not a high price to  pay to make sure that the people who work there are safe.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams), the chair of the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections,  and I want to thank her for moving this bill this calendar year.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chairman of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Madam Chair, just really quickly, it is true, yesterday  that notice went out scheduling that panel. I would just note, that is  the third time the department has sent out such a notice, and they have  canceled the prior panels. We will see whether or not it actually  happens in January.   We are in the third year of this administration, after a GAO report,  again after statistics and hearings, where we have asked questions of  the department to move on this, and frankly, we are talking about  adopting OSHA's own guidelines in the interim standards.   This is not some farfetched, radical proposal. It is their own  recommendations about how you can safely and effectively reduce  workplace violence.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), a great member of the Education and Labor Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer), one of our great new freshmen.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Iowa.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  [[Page H9133]]  from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the chair of the Subcommittee on Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I have exhausted all speakers, and I am  prepared to close on my side.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, regarding the paygo issue, just to be clear, paygo  applies to the budget impact. And the gentlewoman is absolutely  correct; CBO calculated a $60 million deficit impact over 10 years in  the Medicare program. Again, we spend over $700 billion a year in  Medicare, and, by all projections, that is going to go up.   By the way, $60 million is for rural hospitals. If you read the CBO  note, that is really the retroactive impact that has caused that,  really, budget dust in terms of the impact to the Medicare program.   Madam Chair, we have heard today about the urgency that this  emergency requires. We understand the statistics. Workers are uniquely  vulnerable in the healthcare setting to violence as they care for the  most vulnerable among us.   We know how to help. We know that evidence-based practices will lower  this trend line. And we know that when hospitals and other facilities  adopt them, rates of violence against staff go down.   In closing, I would like to share a few words from a letter written  to me by Gene Sausse from Louisiana about his sister, Lynne Truxillo,  who was a nurse in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, until her death just this  past April of this year in the hands of a patient while she worked.   Lynne saw the patient attacking one of her colleagues, and when she  intervened, the patient turned on her, grabbed her by the back of the  neck, slammed it into a desk, and she passed out and suffered  additional injuries. A few days later, she died from her injuries.   Lynne's brother came to Washington, unannounced to my office, a few  months ago to share his family's grief and explained why we cannot wait  another 20 years for OSHA to act. This is what he said:   ``It wasn't until days after my sister, Registered Nurse Lynne Sausse  Truxillo, was brutally attacked and murdered by a patient inside of  Baton Rouge General Hospital during her shift 6 months ago did I learn  that violent workplace incident rates are four times higher in  healthcare than all other industries. . . . As a small business owner  in New Orleans, I have firsthand experience with the complex and often  burdensome nature of government regulation. I get that, and I support  fewer regulations in certain circumstances. However, in the 6 months  since Lynne's death, I've learned how gravely and disproportionately  vulnerable healthcare workers are to acts of workplace violence against  them. The data, stats, and facts are undeniable on the subject. There's  practically a news story every day somewhere in America about it. It is  unconscionable that less care is given for the health and well-being of  those who care for us when we need it most. Thank you for trying to  spare other families from the kind of grief and tragedy mine has  endured every day since we lost our beautiful sister, mother, and  daughter.''   She should be home making Thanksgiving dinner for her children-- mother of two. But because we don't have a national enforceable  standard to reduce workplace violence in healthcare settings and social  work, this gentleman--he is not a lobbyist; he is not a super-PAC; he  is a brother--came to Washington at his own expense, like so many  others, to talk about the fact that we have a crisis. It is our job to  address that crisis, and that is what this bill does.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1309, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, again, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, but certainly with great respect for the proponent. I  actually supported making this amendment in order because I have such  high regard for the gentleman.   However, this amendment, essentially, Madam Chair, guts the bill.   The essence of this bill is to say to the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration, who has been studying this issue since the 1990s  and has issued commonsense guidelines--that again, Ranking Member Foxx  has touted as an example of how this isn't a real problem that we need  to accelerate, but the fact of the matter is, we incorporate those  guidelines in the underlying bill with a real deadline, 42 months. That  has precedent.   Congress has done this before. OSHA is an act of Congress, and we  have accelerated deadlines for bloodborne pathogens back in the late  1990s, gave them a 1-year deadline or a 6-month deadline to implement a  standard, again, for HIV, hepatitis B, and C, in healthcare. And thank  God. We are a safer country because Congress stepped in and set a  deadline for OSHA to act.   We did it for hazardous waste materials. We put a deadline to make  them act. Without a deadline, what we are stuck with is OSHA's  atrocious record of getting rules out in a timely fashion. Beryllium,  18 years it took; silica, 19 years. If you inhale silica, you suffocate  and get cancer; confined spaces in construction, working in trenches,  22 years.   And, yes, yesterday, the Trump administration, for the third time,  scheduled a preliminary panel with the SBREFA panel, having canceled  the prior two. We are 3 years into this administration, and still, to  this date, nothing actually has happened other than notices, which so  far have just been canceled over and over again.                                time  1030    Madam Chair, while we were here on the floor, one of the most  credible voices on this issue, which is the American College of  Emergency Physicians--when these unruly, agitated patients with the  heroin and opioid crises and behavioral health crises are coming  through the doors, they are the ones who are really at the front line,  along with the nurses and their assistants. They urge legislators to  oppose the Byrne amendment that would eliminate the deadline for OSHA  to issue a standard.   The reason they give is that, in 2018, they did a survey of emergency  physicians all across America who reported being physically assaulted  while at work, with 60 percent of those assaults occurring within the  previous year. This is happening in real time, and it is accelerating.  The trajectory is something that we cannot wait for OSHA to basically  go back and reinvent the wheel that they have already issued in terms  of guidelines about how to reduce risk in workplaces.   That is why, in addition to other issues in this amendment that  eliminate the whistleblower protection, as well as the interim final  standard, which, again, incorporates OSHA's already preexisting rules,  that I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.   Let's move forward, and let's do it in a timely fashion for America's  healthcare and social services workforce.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, the gentleman is absolutely right. The Obama  administration took too long to move on this. Again, I, along with  George Miller, requested the GAO study back in 2013. The results came  in, in 2016. He is right. The first regulatory step didn't take place  until January 2017, on the way out the door.   But we are 3 years into this administration, and they are not setting  the world on fire in terms of addressing this issue. That panel, which  you described, to call it a baby step is an overstatement. It is a baby  crawl, in terms of this process. Again, we have seen the track record-- 22 years, 19 years, 17 years--to get a standard out.   Our healthcare workforce cannot wait that long. That is why H.R. 1309  should proceed without the Byrne amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Harder) for yielding.   Again, I want to salute his amendment. For the record, there is no  prohibition built into OSHA that you can't have dual jurisdiction, in  terms of criminal investigations or prosecutions from injuries in any  setting that OSHA covers. However, I still applaud the Member for just  sort of foot-stomping this point to make sure that because so many of  these incidents involve assault, there is absolutely a clear signal  that there is no hindrance or obstacle.   Again, for that purpose, I certainly strongly support the amendment  and urge its adoption.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Brown of Maryland) having assumed the chair, Ms. Jackson Lee, Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  1309) to direct the Secretary of Labor to issue an occupational safety  and health standard that requires covered employers within the health  care and social service industries to develop and implement a  comprehensive workplace violence prevention plan, and for other  purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, again I rise in strong support of Mr.  Brown's amendment, which I think makes a good bill even better and does  focus on one of the causes, which, again, it is no big secret in terms  of what is driving this upward trajectory.   Domestic violence, in particular, is one of those types of cases that  are coming through the emergency room doors--agitated patients,  sometimes family members there--and that is where, again, we know  nurses, nursing assistants, and docs are being subjected to  unprecedented levels of assault.   That is why the Emergency Room Nurses Association just issued an  endorsement of H.R. 1309. Again, this is a trade association. This is a  union-affiliated organization. They represent emergency room nurses all  across  [[Page H9147]]  America in union and nonunion settings.   We have already heard earlier today that the emergency room docs have  come out for this.   Again, what Mr. Brown's measure does is focus on one of the causes  that is causing the unprecedented and unacceptable levels of assault  that are taking place in healthcare settings.   I just want to close by saying my wife, Audrey, whom I have been  married to for 30 years, is a pediatric nurse practitioner who works in  a specialty clinic at Connecticut Children's Hospital that deals with  victims of child sexual abuse and physical abuse, and that is precisely  the type of patient that Mr. Brown's amendment is focused on.   Again, if you want to talk about high tension, high-risk environment  in terms of those types of cases that come through, which, again, is  causing unprecedented incidents out there, this amendment helps those  employees to make sure that they are going to be able to deal with  these cases and continue to go on and be productive in the healthcare  system.   So, again, I want to thank Mr. Brown for offering this amendment.    Madam Chair, again, I want to congratulate Mr. Delgado  for his amendment.   And I want to point out the fact that when we voted on the rule  yesterday, there was a self-effectuating provision that eliminated  500,000 healthcare workplaces from the scope of this bill. Again, it  was at the suggestion of CBO because, frankly, it was never our  intention to include doctors' offices, podiatrists' offices, dentists'  offices. That is not what this bill is about. It is about larger  healthcare facilities, which we know are the hotspots where this type  of unfortunate activity goes on.   OSHA, just so you know, has a free consultation program for  employers, 90 percent funded by OSHA in all 50 states, that will  provide free assistance as new rules and regulations are rolled out.   And I want to again say, Mr. Delgado's amendment, which just foot  stomps the fact that we want to prioritize the flow of information is,  in my opinion, a very benign request and very much sensitive to  employers in facilities all across the country.   Again, we took care of the small guys in the rule yesterday, and this  amendment, again, just makes sure that anyone else will have all the  help that they need to understand the new rules.    Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order.    Madam Speaker, I insist on my point of order.    Madam Speaker, on behalf of America's nurses, doctors,  and social workers who are begging for relief from unprecedented levels  of workplace violence, I insist upon my point of order. The motion  violates clause 7 of rule XVI, the germaneness rule.
