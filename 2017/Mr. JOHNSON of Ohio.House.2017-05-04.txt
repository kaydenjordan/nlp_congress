 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me  time to speak up.   I, too, agree that Members of Congress should be subject to the same  rules and laws that the American people are. So I support my colleague,  Ms. McSally, in this legislation.   But, you know, I want to speak to the bigger, broader issue here. My  colleague from Pennsylvania said: What about that family with that kid  that has cancer?   Where was my colleague and the friends on the other side of the aisle  when ObamaCare resulted in millions of policy cancellations and  millions of Americans losing their coverage because of the broken  promises?   Where was my colleague and the Democrats when millions of Americans  were forced out of work because of the job-killing policies of  ObamaCare?   Let me tell you something. The American people remembered that, and  that is what happened in 2010.   We didn't hide in a back room to get what we are doing today done. We  have been working on it for 6 years, and we are going to get it done  today. We are going to meet the promises that we made to the American  people, and starting today, ObamaCare is on its way out the door.
