 Mr. President, during the last break in our voting  schedule here in Washington, DC, I was grateful to have the time back  home talking with my constituents about the challenges they are facing  on a day-to-day basis and, like we all, I think, try to do, figuring  out how we can be helpful to them here in the Senate.   I must note that there is usually a huge disconnect between what  seems to obsess the news media and folks living in the bubble of  Washington, DC, and what I hear from my constituents back home, and  this time wasn't much different.   When I was back in Austin, I received a briefing on the ongoing  pandemic response efforts. Like the rest of the country and the rest of  the world, COVID-19 hasn't gone away, and we are trying to slowly but  surely both adapt and deal with the pandemic.   Thanks to an overwhelming response by the Federal Government  initially back during the Trump administration, during Operation Warp  Speed, we have access to vaccines on the fastest timeline that we have  ever seen. Medical science and pharmaceutical companies and the  government came together to produce effective and safe vaccines at a  historic rate of speed. But even as the virus itself has morphed, as  viruses, I understand, will likely do, we still continue to need things  like personal protective equipment and additional tests and antibiotics  treatments for people in my State.   Ironically, President Biden ran in large part in 2020 based on the  COVID response of the Trump administration and, as we all recall, was  pretty harshly critical. But now he seems to have changed his tune.  When asked about things like access to testing, he says: Well, those  are really State responsibilities.   Well, passing the buck is a familiar pastime here in Washington, DC,  but I don't think anybody is fooled that this is an area where the  Federal Government continues to play an essential role. Yes, our State  leaders have done by and large, I think, a good job in their respective  jurisdictions. The fact of the matter is, we still need a plan to deal  with the testing and the ongoing effects of COVID-19.    Interestingly, people who wanted to get access to things like  therapeutics, anti-viral drugs, and monoclonal antibiotics were told  that the Federal Government would not allow the States to use those  particular modalities anymore because the Federal Government had made a  decision that this was not effective against the current strain. But,  as we know, this virus continues to mutate. We are hoping that we don't  go all the way through the Greek alphabet in various forms of this  virus, but the fact of the matter is, I think we have all now gotten a  little glimpse out of what Washington-run healthcare would look like,  starting with rationing based on decisions being made in Washington,  DC, about what should be available to people when they get sick or when  they see their doctor.   I believe that those decisions are best left to individuals, in  consultation with their healthcare provider to make those decisions.  But we have gotten a little bit of a glimpse when Washington says no  monoclonal antibiotics anymore, no therapeutic anti-virals because they  don't work against the current strain of COVID-19, the Omicron.  [[Page S470]]  As I said, the virus is probably not going to stop mutating, and  unfortunately, I think the Federal response--rationing access to these  therapies and treatment--could well backlash on the government.   I am appreciative of the dedicated work of all of our frontline  healthcare workers. As we all know, they have been pushed to the limit,  dealing with COVID-19. They are exhausted and, in many instances,  burned out.   There are not enough frontline healthcare workers currently. What  that means is that many hospitals and healthcare providers have to  contract with nursing services, which really are national organizations  that hire nurses and then contract out as needed to local hospitals.  What that usually means is, because there are not enough local nurses  available at the going rate, they have to contract for prices for those  nursing services that are many multiples of what ordinarily they would  have to do, causing a lot of pain and strain on healthcare providers  across Texas and across the Nation.   On my travels, I went to Fort Worth, where I visited with the  University of North Texas Health Science Center to discuss legislation  that I have introduced, along with Senator Leahy, a senior member of  the Judiciary Committee, called the Justice for All Reauthorization  Act. As the name suggests, this is a reauthorization of very important  tools that are needed at the local level to support victims and deliver  justice and avoid wrongful convictions.   This really focuses on the use of forensic techniques to test DNA and  other samples--for example, in a rape kit, which is collected following  a sexual assault, by a forensic nurse examiner who can collect a rape  kit. Assuming it is done properly and it is provided to a lab that  performs the appropriate test, you can identify with almost 100 percent  certainty who the assailant is or was. So it is really important for us  to make sure those tools remain available, including eliminating  further that rape kit backlog.   It used to be that the rape kits were not tested when the identity of  the assailant was not in question, because, in fact, many times the  identity of the assailant is known to the victim of that assault. But,  as we found out, the power of these forensic tests is immense. And we  can rule out somebody based on the DNA test. We can identify people who  have perpetrated multiple sexual assaults because many of these sexual  assault predators are serial offenders. And what we found out is even  when the statute of limitations has run, let's say, against a  particular sexual assault, many times you will be able to identify with  virtual certainty the individual who committed a subsequent sexual  assault for which the statute of limitations has not run. So that  remains very, very important.    In Houston, which is, we like to say, the energy capital of the  world, I sat down with leaders to discuss legislation that I have  introduced with Senator Coons, the Senator from Delaware, to expand the  use of hydrogen technologies in energy-intensive sectors. Hydrogen is a  unique energy source. As a matter of fact, Toyota, I believe, has  developed a fuel cell technology where, if you use hydrogen in the fuel  cell, you will not only get propulsion of a vehicle, you will actually  get water out the tailpipe. So it is very clean, and it is very safe.   But the problem is, of course, the expense of this new technology and  trying to get it used in places where it makes the most sense because  the infrastructure is critical both for the storage and the delivery of  the hydrogen for use in these energy-intensive sectors.   Texas is already the epicenter of energy production. We believe in  all of the above when it comes to energy, and these investments in new  clean energy like hydrogen can help us grow and diversify our State's  energy portfolio even further while continuing to reduce emissions in  many sectors that are currently big emitters of carbon and other  emissions.   So it was great to be back home, as I know we all feel when we get  back home, and to listen and to learn from your constituents--not just  the official talking points and the subjects that are always on cable  news or social media but about the challenges and the needs and the  hopes and the dreams of the people we represent, real people, the 29  million people I am privileged to represent in the Senate from Texas.   We also hear about some of their problems that they are dealing with  like inflation, and we are hearing more about rising crime. And my  constituents are looking to Congress for some leadership and some  action. They want to see clear and decisive steps made to address the  problems that Texas families confront on a regular basis. But, as I  said, there isn't a whole lot of overlap, it seems, with the agenda  here in Washington by the current majority in the House and the Senate  and the priorities of my constituents back home.   So the debates in Congress have largely been detached from their  reality. It is like living in an alternate universe, where we spend  more time talking about manufactured crises or political agendas than  solving real problems.   This year, it began with the $2 trillion partisan spending bill. Our  colleagues abused the rules of the Senate to pass this legislation  without a single Republican vote, and clearly they were hooked because  partisan legislating became the rule and not the exception last year.  Our colleagues scheduled votes on legislation that would exploit the  cause of pay fairness in order to help trial lawyers, even though wage  discrimination based on sex has been illegal for nearly 60 years.   They scheduled a number of votes on varying versions of legislation  to hijack America's elections because of an alleged voting rights  crisis, even though last November 2020 94 percent of respondents to a  Pew poll said it was either easy or very easy to cast a ballot in the  2020 election.   Now, I had an interesting exchange with the majority leader on this.  I actually had a chart that talked about that Pew poll. And he said:  Well, yeah, we agree everything was hunky-dory in November 2020, but  then it all went down the tubes when States began passing new election  laws.    But I pointed out to him--or I asked him: Well, what is your primary  concern?   He said: Well, ballot harvesting.   He thought that there ought to be more permissive ballot harvesting  than is allowed in some States. But he didn't talk about the things  like eliminating voter ID or making it harder to protect the integrity  of the ballot by making sure that the person, whether they were mailing  in their ballot or whether they were voting in person, was who they say  they were and legally entitled to vote. But, again, we spend a lot of  time on those multiple attempts to pass that takeover of State-run and  local-run elections.   And then there was the so-called Build Back Better bill. I am sure  that was focus group-tested so that it would be appealing to people who  maybe didn't know exactly what was in it, but then we found out that it  was massive tax increases and massive spending at a time when inflation  was as bad as it has been in my lifetime and where the dollar earned by  working families goes less and less far and, in fact, diminishes their  standard of living because of the effect of inflation.   So the BBB bill--some have called it Build Back Better; I prefer  ``Build Back Broke'' or ``Build Back Bankrupt''--which clearly would  have thrown gasoline on the problem of inflation, along with raising  taxes and depress our economy and job creation, it was so expensive and  unnecessary that our colleagues couldn't get all 50 Members of their  own conference on board.   And that is what happens when you have a 50-50 Senate with the Vice  President breaking a tie. This isn't exactly like FDR's New Deal, where  he had huge majorities and could basically move the country in any  direction he wanted. What you would ordinarily think with a 50-50  Senate is that requires bipartisan consensus building, not trying to go  it alone in a purely partisan manner. And it is no surprise that it  wasn't successful.   Well, obviously, economists have something called opportunity cost,  and what that means, as I understand it, is that if you are choosing to  do one thing, that means there are other things that you necessarily  cannot do, and that is an opportunity cost.   And one of the obvious costs to the American people is the border  crisis  [[Page S471]]  that has seen more than 2 million individuals encountered at the  southwestern border. It is no secret to anybody that the drugs-- including fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine, just to mention a few  of the drugs--that took the lives of 100,000 Americans last year  through drug overdoses, virtually all of those come across the  southwestern border.   And the cartels are not dumb. They are actually pretty shrewd. And  they figured out that if you flood the zone, you flood the border with  massive numbers of unaccompanied children and other vulnerable people,  that the Border Patrol will have to leave their station on the border  keeping the drugs and the cartels at bay, and that opens up huge  avenues of opportunity to smuggling drugs illegally into the United  States, in addition to the billions of dollars that they earn bringing  people into the United States from more than 150 different countries.   I know most people who don't live in a border State or who haven't  been to the border, they think, well, these are economic migrants from  Central America. That seems to be what the Vice President, who has been  designated as the ``immigration czar,'' so to speak, by President  Biden, what she seems to think. And, frankly, from the comments of the  President himself, he doesn't understand the dynamic at the border.   But, in reality, what Secretary Mayorkas, at the Department of  Homeland Security, and the Biden administration have done is to lay out  the red carpet for human smugglers and drug smugglers and migrants  coming from around the world. Early on in the Biden administration, I  went to the Del Rio Sector of the Border Patrol, and they told us that  people who they detained had come from more than 150 different  countries.    So this is really a global phenomenon based on how much money you  have and how much you are willing to spend--to the smugglers--to get  into the United States. And, again, for everybody whom we have no  record on, we don't know whether they have been sex offenders; we don't  know whether they have been murderers or committed other crimes back in  their home country. And we also know that, occasionally, we do catch  people who have been deported from the United States because of  criminal offenses who then come back into the United States because of  the opportunities provided by the lack of border controls.   This doesn't take into account all of the people whom the Border  Patrol calls the ``get-aways.'' In other words, we know how many people  turn themselves in and try to take advantage of the asylum system by  flooding our immigration courts and creating a huge backlog and then  melting into the great American landscape, but there are people who do  penetrate our borders that the Border Patrol never encounters, and so  it is really hard to know precisely what they are up to. But I can  assure you, based on my observation and experience, they are up to no  good if they are avoiding the Border Patrol.   Well, in trying to be constructive, which I believe in trying to do-- Washington, DC, can be a pretty tough place, and for sure there are  going to be things we disagree on, but there are also opportunities to  do things on a bipartisan basis. So seeing what was happening at the  border, I reached out to another border State Senator, Senator Sinema  from Arizona; and she and I both reached out to a Congressman from  Laredo, TX, Congressman Cuellar, and Congressman Tony Gonzales-- Cuellar, a Democrat, and Gonzales, a Republican.   So we had, literally, a bicameral, bipartisan effort to come up with  a piece of legislation that we thought that, assuming the  administration wanted some help, this might be a good place to start.  It is called the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act. But I am sorry to  report that the administration--indeed, the Democratic leadership,  particularly on the Judiciary Committee that has jurisdiction over  immigration matters--has shown absolutely zero interest in any kind of  measures to stop or to reduce the flow of migrants into the United  States and solve this problem.   Well, obviously, crime is still a big problem in America, and the  border is part of the problem because of the unrestricted flow of  people coming across the border. But we know last year, in 2020,  murders--that is 2 years ago now, 2 calendar years ago now--murders  rose by nearly 30 percent from the year prior, the largest single-year  increase on record. So crime has definitely spiked, for whatever  reason, and requires a forceful and effective response. We are still  waiting on data from 2021, but so far the picture doesn't appear to be  much brighter. A number of major cities have experienced their  deadliest years on record.   And Americans are taking notice. A poll in November found that more  than half of those surveyed believe local crime has gotten worse--a 13- point jump from the previous year. Concerns about national crime rates  are even higher. Nearly three-quarters of Americans who were polled  believe that crime is up nationally, and they are not wrong.   This, of course, is bad news for our families, our communities, our  businesses, and especially for our dedicated law enforcement officials.  Within a 5-day span just last week, five Harris County police  officers--that is Houston, TX--as well as a police canine officer were  killed or injured. During a 5-day span, five were killed.   An officer was shot and killed during a traffic stop. One was killed  during a hit-and-run while off duty. Three officers were wounded in a  shootout, and a police canine was stabbed with a butcher knife.   Amid this surge of crime and concerning acts of violence against law  enforcement and civilians, there is a clear need for Congress to step  up and act. We need to pass legislation to ensure that our police  forces are well funded, transparent, and held accountable.  Unfortunately, this is not a priority for the majority party. The  radical left and their base want to defund the police, and most  Democrats seem to be intimidated about speaking up and speaking for  their constituents when it comes to stopping or abating these crimes.   As I mentioned, families are also being pummeled by the highest  inflation in 40 years, and we have all seen prices going up everywhere,  from the gas pump to groceries, to cars, to clothes.   Business owners, of course, have been hit with a double whammy, as  supply chain issues have made it even more difficult and costly to  produce and sell and ship their products.   As I mentioned, gas prices are perhaps the most easily identified  area where inflation is eating away at people's paychecks. Drivers are  now spending 50 percent more today than they were a year ago on a  gallon of gas.   That is not just the big, headline-grabbing crises the Biden  administration has failed to address.   The national defense authorization bill is one of the best examples  of what we should do here in the Senate--an example of bipartisanship.  A version of this bill has passed every year for 61 years, and, last  summer, things appeared to be on track, even ahead of schedule. The  Armed Services Committee passed a national defense authorization bill  by a vote of 23 to 3. You don't get more bipartisan than that.   Unfortunately, for some reason, the majority leader refused to bring  the defense authorization bill to the floor and left the bill to  collect dust on the Senate calendar before moving it. When he finally  allowed it to come to the floor in late November, he tried to limit the  normal amendment process by blaming the calendar. But to no one's  surprise, that created a lot of issues and a lot of consternation. You  simply can't sit on a bipartisan bill for months and then claim there  is no time for a robust amendment process.   But eventually the Senate did pass the Defense authorization bill  before the end of the year. But we can't get in the habit of delaying  bipartisan bills in order to meet a partisan agenda.   Then there is government funding. We are more than a year into the  Democratic-controlled majority controlling the government and not a  single regular appropriations bill has passed. Our colleagues have  kicked the can down the road.    As soon as I am through with my remarks, I will be glad  to yield.  [[Page S472]]         So our colleagues kicked the can down the road when it  came to keeping the lights on in the appropriations process in  September and December, and now it looks like they are poised to do it  again and will not meet the February 18 deadline.   So with the focus on partisan politics rather than bipartisan  opportunities, our colleagues in the majority have simply ignored the  basic responsibilities of governing. They put the demands of  partisanship ahead of the needs of the American people. Rather than  reevaluate the strategy and perhaps make a course correction, our  colleagues have doubled down. They scheduled another vote on their  partisan election takeover bill. And when it failed, they attempted to  blow up the rules of the Senate to create an easier pathway to purely  partisan legislation.   So there is a massive disconnect between what Democrats in the  majority have been trying to accomplish here in Washington, DC, and  what the American people are telling me--particularly my constituents-- that they actually need.   Families in Texas are struggling to pay their gas and grocery bills,  and they are worried about the increase in violent crime. But our  colleagues are trying to convince them that they are wrong and that  what is important is a Federal takeover of State-run elections and to  provide additional tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires from  blue States by lifting or eliminating the cap on deductibility of State  and local taxes, as they attempted to do.   So a lot of the time we have had this last year--the opportunity to  pass good and meaningful legislation--has been lost, and thus the  opportunity cost of this partisanship is things that really would make  a difference and improve the lives of ordinary Americans.   The American people are not asking for a radical transformation of  the country. That was pretty clear by the 50-50 Senate that they  elected in 2020, as well as a bare Democratic majority in the House.  They want safe communities. They want an affordable standard of living.  They want secure borders. They want the right to decide what is best  for themselves and their families and not be dictated to or mandated by  the Federal Government.   So I continue to hope that our Democratic colleagues will abandon  partisanship and use the remainder of this year to support what the  American people actually want and need.   Mr. President, I would be glad to yield for a question.
