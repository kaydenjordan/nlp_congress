 Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Water Resources and  Environment Subcommittee and a cosponsor of this bill, I rise in  support of H.R. 8.   Our water infrastructure is important to the health of our economy  and job growth, including infrastructure job opportunity in the skilled  trades.   Supporting our water infrastructure is essential to the goal of  ensuring environmental justice. Communities in poverty and women and  children are especially vulnerable to the harsh consequences of failing  and faulty water infrastructure. Let us not forget Flint, Michigan.  This bill continues this important bipartisan process.   As a Representative from Michigan, this bill continues to protect the  Great Lakes region. The Davis amendment on the floor today affirms the  commitment to fighting invasive species. Completion of the long-awaited  Brandon Road Study is needed to combat environmental threats to our  region.   The Great Lakes waterways create thousands of jobs and create  billions in revenue, annually. We must continue to support the Army  Corps' operations that operate these critical waterways.   As Members know, our Nation's infrastructure is in desperate need of  repair, and we cannot kick the can down the road anymore. I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.
