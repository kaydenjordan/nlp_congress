 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, and I want to  associate myself with the remarks of the gentlewoman from Wyoming.   Although, in recounting the heroes of 9/11, she forgot the United  States Postal Service workers, and we have forgotten them in this bill.   During 9/11, the United States Postal Service workers continued to  deliver the mail despite the anthrax attacks. And they continue to  deliver medical supplies and medicines to every home and business in  America today, 6 days a week, yet they received no benefits in this  bill.   We need them also to execute a delivery-by-mail system, a vote-by- mail system, in this crisis to preserve our democracy as this crisis  continues. So we need to fix that in the next bill that we consider for  this type of relief. We have to remember the United States Postal  Service workers and the great job they have done on behalf of our  country.
