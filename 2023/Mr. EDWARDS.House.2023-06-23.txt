 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two of my  constituents, Alfredo and Jane Calvo, who will be celebrating their  50th wedding anniversary on June 30 this year.   They will be spending this milestone anniversary with their family:  Al, Michael, Kari, Leigh, and their young grandson, Tucker.   Jane served in the Henderson County PTA, the North Carolina General  Federation of Women's Clubs, and spent 16 years of her career as a  staffer for one of my predecessors, the Honorable Congressman Charles  Taylor. Jane has also worked for the Social Security Administration.   Alfredo was a volunteer soccer coach at Flat Rock Middle School and  East Henderson High School and served in the Social Security  Administration for more than a decade.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Alfredo and Jane Calvo  on their 50th wedding anniversary. Here is to many more.                            ____________________
