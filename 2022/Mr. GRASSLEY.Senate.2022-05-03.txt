 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on the  nomination of Joshua Frost to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury  for Financial Markets. While by most accounts Mr. Frost is qualified  for this position, I will vote against his nomination out of growing  concerns that the Treasury Department has been derelict in its  responsibilities to the Senate Finance Committee and its members.   The most recent example of Treasury thumbing its nose at the  committee is the unprecedented delay of Secretary Yellen in agreeing to  testify before the committee on the President's budget. Typically, the  Treasury Secretary agrees to testify before the Finance Committee the  week that the President releases his budget. Since 2005, the only other  time a Treasury Secretary testified before the committee more than 3  days after the release of the President's budget was Secretary Geithner  in 2009, and he appeared just 6 days after the President released his  budget.   This year, 37 days have passed since the President unveiled his  budget, and Secretary Yellen has yet to agree on a date to come before  the committee. Finance Committee members have been informed that the  earliest Secretary Yellen will appear before the committee is sometime  in June, more than 2 months after the release of the President's  budget. The reason given for this unprecedented delay is that Secretary  Yellen is too busy to fit the Finance Committee into her schedule. This  excuse rings hollow when just last week she was able to find time in  her busy schedule to give the keynote address at an event held at the  liberal Brookings Institution.   So Secretary Yellen has time in her busy schedule to address the D.C.  liberal intelligentsia at the Brookings Institution, but can't find  time to answer the questions of elected Members of Congress and their  constituents? This is unacceptable, and the Treasury Department must be  held to account for shirking its responsibilities. In light of this, I  intend to vote against the nomination of Mr. Frost to be an Assistant  Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets.                           Vote on Frost Nomination     Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak  about Orrin Hatch, whom many of us were fortunate enough to work with  for many, many years. He had a tremendous impact on the U.S. Senate  and, in turn, on America.   Barbara and I first want to express our condolences to Elaine, his  wife, to their six children and their families, and to all of those who  mourn the passing of this outstanding public servant and humble servant  of the Lord.   Senator Hatch's funeral will be this Friday.   In December of 2018, as his incredible 42 years in the U.S. Senate  were drawing to a close, Orrin Hatch delivered the usual farewell  address of retiring Members here on the Senate floor.   Concerned about the direction that he had seen this institution take  in recent years, he said:         We must restore the culture of comity, compromise, and       mutual respect that used to exist here--and still does, in       some respects.    He also said:         We must not be enemies but friends.    In his farewell address and in the quotes that I just read, Orrin's  commitment to mutual respect and integrity is made very clear. It is  also a charge to us to honor his memory by taking his words to heart as  we go about our work here and in what we do across the country.   During Orrin's career, he served as chairman of the Finance  Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and as President pro tem of the  U.S. Senate. I have had the honor of doing those same three things. The  Finance Committee and the Judiciary Committee are powerful committees  that deal with matters of broad importance to America. Decisions are  made there that directly affect the lives of all Americans. Many times,  dearly held beliefs and principles held by different Senators come into  conflict during long hours of work on important legislation or with  high-level Cabinet and judicial nominations.   Many of the tributes to Orrin have already made an observation which  I share from our decades of working together at the negotiating table.   Orrin was an unflinching, dyed-in-the-wool statesman who stayed true  to his values and his convictions and finessed disagreements with a  spirit of collegiality. He always remembered that he was working with  friends and not enemies, and he always remembered why he was in the  U.S. Senate--to represent the great people of Utah. Orrin's ability to  disagree without being disagreeable was evident from his incredible  level of productivity. According to the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation, when  he retired, he had passed more legislation into law than any living  Senator and had sponsored or cosponsored more than 750 bills that were  enacted into law.   As anyone who has spent any length of time in the Senate knows very  well, getting legislation enacted into law, especially any enduring  legislation, requires the ability to develop relationships and build  trust with Members of both parties. To be productive over the long  term, those relationships need to be able to withstand the unproductive  partisanship that tends to dominate the fleeting issues of the day.   Some of Orrin's most significant legislative accomplishments  highlight his ability to work across the aisle.   A prime example is the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term  Restoration Act, also known as Hatch-Waxman, stemming from his work  with longtime Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman.   Another important piece of legislation is the State Children's Health  Insurance Program on which he worked with the late Senator Ted Kennedy.  Orrin regularly talked about working with his good friend Senator  Kennedy. For many years, Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy appeared to be  complete opposites. They couldn't imagine that those two Senators, with  very different views, could even work together, much less be friends.  People who say that don't understand how the Senate works.   Orrin's spirit of bipartisanship didn't come at the expense of his  principles. Whether he was criticized for compromising with Democrats  or for not compromising enough, Orrin stuck with what he believed was  the right thing to do.   As chairman of the Finance Committee, during consideration of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, Orrin took the lead in drafting the most important  tax reform legislation to be enacted in more than 30 years.   When staff would discuss provisions to be included in the  legislation, Orrin would repeatedly ask what the tax policy was. This  was always his primary concern, not what was the most politically  expedient policy or the best policy with which to win reelection. Orrin  wanted to get the details right, and the rest of his decisions flowed  from that perspective. I know because I worked with him for decades on  that committee, particularly during that legislation.   Despite the criticism he would get from all sides, Orrin would never  let that drive him off course from sticking with his values and from  being civil with his colleagues. In his office, Orrin had a statue of a  red-tailed hawk that staff had given to him. It had a plaque on it that  said, ``Tough old bird.'' He adopted that phrase to describe himself to  reporters and many who met him in his office.   His ``tough old bird'' status was fully evident one late night during  the Finance Committee's consideration of that tax bill I have referred  to--the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. When Republicans were accused of only  being interested in looking out for the very rich, Orrin forcefully  noted his own very humble beginnings. He shared how he had worked his  whole career for ``people who don't have a chance.''   Another principle Orrin shared with me was the importance of staff.  To be effective day in and day out and to sift through the avalanche of  information that comes into every Senator's office, good staff is  vital, particularly when a Senator has served for a lengthy period of  time. Staff is important to preserving the institutional memory of a  committee. From years of around-the-clock work, they become really a  second family. They may not share blood ties, but they share loyalty  and share service to dig down into the trenches when policymaking and  politics become a blood sport. So having longevity and cohesion within  a staff is very, very important.    A tradition that I believe was unique to the Hatch office was the  election of a Pioneer Day's King and Queen from the people within that  office. Now, Pioneer Day is a Utah State holiday that celebrates the  entry of the first Mormon pioneers into Salt Lake Valley on July 24,  1847. To recognize that holiday, everyone working for Senator Hatch,  whether in his personal office or on a committee he chaired, would vote  for a King and Queen from a slate of candidates from within that  office. At a lunch attended by the whole office, Orrin would announce  the winners and crown the King and Queen. The coronation was a salute  to their service to the people of Utah, whose enduring pioneering  spirit rings true to this very day.   Outside of ensuring his office was a place that good staff would want  to work, Orrin was no aloof boss. His sincerity shined through with me  and his Senate colleagues and then, of course, with his staff. He  wanted to know what was happening in his staff's lives and made sure to  say that he appreciated their advice even when he might not take that  advice.   In closing, I return to what I said about Orrin and what he said in  his farewell address. I associate myself with his remarks that we must  be friends and not enemies. That is how we can honor Orrin Hatch and  keep his spirit within this institution that he cared so much for and  devoted much of his life to--here, right here, in the Senate.   Orrin's lifetime of public service helped generations of families in  Utah achieve a better quality of life and made America and the U.S.  Senate a better place.   Godspeed, my friend.   I yield the floor.
