 Mr. Speaker, this is a day of accountability and  defending our democracy.   The facts in front of us are clear: this President, Donald J. Trump,  coerced a fragile foreign ally to investigate his political opponent  and interfere in our elections. He leveraged critically needed,  congressionally-approved military aid to Ukraine.   The President's allies want to claim that he did this because he  cared about corruption, but if President Trump truly cared about  corruption, then he would have listened to the talking points that were  prepared by the National Security Council on anticorruption. He did  not. In fact, on those two calls with President Zelensky, he never  mentioned the word ``corruption.''   He did not abide by the Department of Defense's own recommendation  that Ukraine had passed all the anticorruption benchmarks, and he  didn't listen to the unanimous conclusion of all of his top advisers  that he must release that aid to Ukraine.   He did release the aid in 2017 and 2018, but not in 2019. Why?  Because in 2019, Vice President Joe Biden was running for President.   This is not hearsay. We have a responsibility. The President told us  himself on national television exactly what he wanted from the phone  call with President Zelensky. He came onto the White House lawn and he  said:         I wanted President Zelensky to open an investigation into       the Bidens.    He solicited foreign interference before, he is doing it now, and he  will do it again.   The President is the smoking gun.   Our Founders, Mr. Speaker, entrusted us with the awesome  responsibility of protecting our democracy, which gets its power not  from the bloodlines of monarchs, but from the votes of We the People.   Without that, we are no longer a democracy, we are a monarchy or a  dictatorship.   So today, to uphold my oath to Constitution and country, I will vote  to impeach Donald J. Trump.
