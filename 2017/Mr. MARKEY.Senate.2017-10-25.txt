 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, this summer the Children's Health  Insurance Program, or CHIP, turned 20 years old.   I served on the House committee that created this bill and was proud  to support providing the affordable comprehensive health insurance to  low-income children and pregnant women. It is a bipartisan program, and  it is an effective program. Last year alone, CHIP covered nearly 9  million children throughout the country. In Massachusetts, CHIP has  been instrumental in achieving near-universal coverage for our children  in the Bay State.   Yet, instead of celebrating CHIP's successes over the last two  decades, congressional Republicans have placed CHIP in programmatic  purgatory. That is because they allowed CHIP to expire at the end of  September. Instead of focusing on reauthorizing this critical  healthcare lifeline, Republican leadership chose to waste months of  time trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They let just one of  these successful programs lapse while they tried unsuccessfully to end  another. They were more interested in ripping healthcare coverage away  from millions of Americans and taking a machete to Medicaid rather than  protecting our Nation's children.   We should not forget that CHIP stands on Medicaid's shoulders. Any  fundamental changes to how Medicaid operates--whether it is block- granting or capping the program--will hamstring CHIP's ability to serve  children as effectively and efficiently as it was intended to do, but  instead of immediately returning attention to ensuring that this lapsed  deadline is not effective, House Republicans have further delayed  action by inserting partisan policies to pay for the program. This has  not only caused an unnecessary delay in passing a bill to reauthorize  CHIP, but it has dragged CHIP onto the political game board, turning it  and our children into pawns in their ruthless game of partisan chess.   CHIP has historically been and should be above such games because  CHIP is not just an insurance program, it is a reassurance program. It  reassures States that they can provide comprehensive healthcare  coverage to some of their most vulnerable, it reassures doctors that  their patients will be able to access care and treatment, it reassures  teachers that their students can be healthy enough to learn, and it  reassures Mom and Dad that their children can still get well in the  face of financial hardship.   Continued inaction on CHIP is dangerous and damaging. Every day we  delay reauthorizing CHIP is another day parents across the United  States live in fear that their children may soon lose their health  insurance. They panic at the thought of leaving their child's asthma  untreated, skipping a trip to the dentist, or delaying a doctor's visit  because they can't afford to pay for the treatment or medication that  may be prescribed. If we don't act soon, this fear may become a  terrible reality for families. In Massachusetts, CHIP funding will  expire early next year. This could impact coverage for 160,000 children  in the Commonwealth, potentially delaying access to treatment and  services that could have ramifications into adulthood.   In Congress, we are celebrating the 20th birthday of a successful  children's insurance program by effectively threatening to end it. That  is what Congress is now doing to the State of Massachusetts. That is  what they are saying to the State of Massachusetts; that they are going  to effectively try to shut down a program that for 20 years has served  the children in our State. That makes no sense.   I urge my Republican colleagues to put their partisan games aside to  provide certainty and stability to States, to providers, and to  reassure families by reauthorizing CHIP. When President Trump says he  wants to make the healthcare system in America better, when President  Trump says he wants to make sure families are able to take care of  their children, we have a program that does that already. It is  successful, and families and the States love it. All we need is  Republicans in the Senate to work together in order to make sure that  program continues for the health of all children in our country.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted to Tessa Rebholz, a fellow on my staff, for the  remainder of the session.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
