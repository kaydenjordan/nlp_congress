 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the award-winning  host of XL 106.7's morning show, Johnny Magic, with his show, Johnny's  House, for the great work he has done for the Central Florida  community.   Johnny was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, but has called Orlando  home for the last 30 years, while working for XL 106.7. He uses his  voice, talents, and resources to work with our community. During times  of need, after natural disasters, and times of crisis in our community,  he has gone out of his way to help those in need. He genuinely cares  for this community, and it shows through all of his hard work.   Johnny Magic has witnessed firsthand the struggles that many families  in our community experience. These experiences inspired him to develop  a program that would make it possible for disadvantaged families to  provide a wonderful holiday experience for their children. This is how  the Baby DJ, Inc. program came to fruition.   Over the last 25 years, this program has worked and collaborated with  local churches, nonprofit organizations, and community partners to  fulfill this mission. With the help of volunteers, the Baby DJ program  has been able to provide resources to assist families in need and, in  recent years, has expanded their operation to serve other charitable  efforts that take place throughout the year.   The program has provided backpacks and school supplies to countless  schools in need in central Florida. These supplies provide a welcome  relief to the families and students, as well as to teachers who  routinely pay for school supplies for students and for their  classrooms.   Johnny Magic, and his team, and the Baby DJ program, are not only  inspiring, but it is also what makes central Florida so wonderful.   So I want to thank Johnny Magic, I want to thank the good folks at  Johnny's House, the Baby DJ, Inc. program for their contributions and  for his contribution to central Florida.
