 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, this year on Veterans Day, I will join  all Americans in honoring those who have served in our Armed Forces. As  a nation, we owe those who have served a debt of gratitude for the  sacrifices they have made to protect our country, our way of life, and  the principles of liberty and natural rights. Too often, we forget to  thank the families who are left behind while they are in service. They  deserve our consideration as well.   The least we can do in return is work to ensure that all veterans  have the healthcare and benefits they have earned. We owe it to  veterans to ensure that they are never forsaken, nor forgotten.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
