 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and ask that we defeat the  previous question and move to pass Congressman Chabot's bill.   We are now in our sixth month of this pandemic. In our efforts to  combat this virus, the backbone of our economy, our small businesses,  have suffered greatly. Only now, after months of government-imposed  restrictions, is our economy starting to reopen and we are seeing the  unemployment drop, in part, but not throughout our economy.   Even in my home State of Nebraska, with the lowest unemployment rate  in the Nation, some of our small businesses are still struggling. While  restaurants and bars are getting back to work, others are still shut  down. Our live music venues, our playhouses, our travel and tour  companies are still facing some very dark times and may not open for 3  months. Some may never reopen without Congressman Chabot's bill.   Congress needs to put our partisan differences aside. Stop playing  election-year political games and come together to help the American  people. While we may be divided on if we should bail out cities that  were struggling financially prior to COVID, we can all agree that  certain segments of our economy are struggling in every city.   This bill will help our Nation's smallest, most vulnerable businesses  in every city. It will expand eligibility and expand the PPP throughout  the end of the calendar year to help these businesses in every city.   We can agree that this is needed from the East Coast to the West  Coast and everywhere in-between. Congress should act now.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and move to pass  the low-hanging fruit of the Chabot bill.
