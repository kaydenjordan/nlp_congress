 Madam Speaker, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, I  recognize Blanca M. Hernandez-Adame for all her tremendous work in  Nebraska's Second Congressional District. Blanca's determination and  kind-hearted nature have benefited our community for years.   Born in Torreon, Coahuila, Mexico, from a very early age, Blanca  showed signs of being a natural-born leader. She always stood out among  her peers in the different activities, groups, or social clubs she  participated in.   Blanca has three children: Eros, Daniel, and Camila. She is a strong  woman of faith and puts God first in everything she does. One of the  most important people in Blanca's life is her mother, who has been  present through good times and bad times for her whole life.   In 1995, Blanca began law school at the Universidad Autonoma de  Guerrero and demonstrated an interest in politics. She became involved  in Mexican politics and volunteered in campaigns for senators, state  Governors, rectors of the University of Guerrero, and even the  Presidency of the Mexican Republic in Mexico.   Blanca graduated from law school in 1999 and had the opportunity to  work for some of the most essential people in the State of Guerrero as  a trusted staff member. Later that year, due to the economic situation,  Blanca left Mexico for the United States to pursue opportunities for  herself and her family.   In 2000, she began working in a packinghouse. Blanca has the utmost  respect for people who work in these places, as they can be very  repetitive jobs and hard work. Some stay in the same place, doing the  same movement for 8 to 10 hours every day for weeks, months, and even  years. Every day that she spent at the packinghouse, she became more  convinced that she had to learn English and that if she didn't, she  would stay there forever working in a very difficult job.   She began taking English classes at night after a long day at the  packing plant, but one of Blanca's strengths is her persistence. She  knew that the effort would be worth it, so little by little she learned  to speak English and became a representative of the workers' union at  the packing plant.   From there, she became active in our community in South Omaha. For 6  years, she served on the board of directors of the One World Clinic in  Omaha. She volunteered in different community groups, nonprofit  organizations, and is the founder of the Queens of Cinco de Mayo  contest, one of the most important events in the Latino community of  South Omaha.   In 2016--and this is where we want to focus because she has done so  much great work here--she founded Generation Diamond to help people  reenter our community after incarceration. She believes that her  participants are diamonds in the rough that only need to be polished to  shine. In just 7 years, Generation Diamond is one of the only  organizations in Nebraska that helps the formerly incarcerated remove  tattoos free of charge and covers basic needs, such as food and  clothing. Services are offered in both English and Spanish, with a  focus on building the Latino community. They are able to help fund  employment and offer classes in trauma, finances, and stress reduction  to give those they serve a glimmer of hope and the ability to remain in  the community. Generation Diamond has grown rapidly, providing 1,020  services last month alone.   Madam Speaker, I thank Blanca for her hard work and determination to  make our community better, and for investing in so many people and  giving them a second chance. I am eager to see the growth and positive  impact Generation Diamond will have in my district.                            ____________________
