 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Last winter, two miracles occurred 3,000 miles apart. Here in  Washington, our Nation's Capital, Republicans and Democrats came  together and passed a significant water bill that was signed into law.  Back in California, we saw massive amounts of rainfall that came down  in our drought-stricken State, quickly filling our depleted reservoirs.   But I think we can actually take another big step forward by passing  H.R. 23, the GROW Act. This bill before us provides even more long-term  water solutions for California by expediting the consideration of  feasibility studies for water storage projects that have languished for  periods of time that are longer than it took to actually build the  Hoover Dam. The GROW Act also includes provisions that are critical to  the Bay-Delta operations and help improve water reliability.   Last year, Mr. Chairman, you heard a lot of doomsday predictions from  certain groups that said the language we passed would push threatened  species towards extinction. That did not happen. Today you hear a lot  of the same talk. But solutions to H.R. 23 are common sense and will  bring reliability to the water supply of California.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage a ``yes'' vote.
