 Madam Speaker, I am honored to yield to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), former chair of the Appropriations  Committee.               Honoring Fallen Heroes in Floyd County, Kentucky     Madam Speaker, what a very fitting and appropriate  tribute to such selfless servants.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).                           Remembering R.D. Kinsey     Madam Speaker, I am very grateful for the message from  my friend from Arkansas, words of wisdom that are greatly appreciated.   One of the things we took up this afternoon on a vote here--and if I  recall correctly, there were two of us voting no--but I know the people  voting for the bill wanted to try to help with the issue of baby  formula. But the bill was thrown upon Republicans last night, not  exactly the best way to handle legislation with far-reaching effects,  and then voted on today. Well, let's look at some of the facts.   Here is an article: ``Global infant formula products market:  estimations and forecasts for production and consumption.'' This points  out that in 2017, the EU was the biggest supplier of infant formula,  with one-third of global volumes, with China and southeast Asia in  second and third places respectively.   Chinese companies have invested in ingredient and infant formula  production capacity in France and in the Netherlands and have strategic  alliances in Denmark and Ireland. So that way, when they produce it,  they don't have to say, ``made in China,'' which causes some people  concern, especially when you have stories that exist, reports where  Chinese formula has done great damage.   Here is a story from September of '08: ``China: Fourth baby dies from  tainted formula.'' So Americans have reason to be concerned when we go  buying baby formula that is manufactured by Chinese companies, no  matter where it is actually produced.   Going back to this article, it says: ``China is the second largest  infant formula producer'' and points out they do export some of their  formula.   But with this report about opening plants in other countries, it may  give the impression and the appearance that these are not like the  formulas that were created in China.   So here is another line that says: ``A lot of the global growth in  infant formula production will come from Chinese companies investing in  production capacity outside China.''  [[Page H6669]]    So it is not enough to ask where was this produced; it is also  important to ask: Who actually produced it; who is behind it?   It is also surprising that we would get that bill late at night  before people are expected to vote on it the next day when--here is an  article from the BBC in May of 2022, and it indicates that the FDA said  sales of infant formula rose 13 percent in April compared to January  before the recall, and some indicators suggested that the out-of-stock  rates had been overstated. It says: ``Increased sales are a good  indicator of formula available to the general population.''                                time  1445    Now, if you are in a place where you can't find formula, then it is  not much of a comfort that people are finding more in other places in  the United States. But here it is: This should have gone through a  committee. This should have had an opportunity not just for debate but  for more research. It should be under what we normally try to do.  Leadership from the parties tries to give 72 hours' notice, but this  bears looking at.   I understand that the vote is only going to go until the end of the  year, but as Ronald Regan said, the closest thing to eternal life here  on Earth is a Federal Government program. I have seen in my years in  Congress things that are only going to be a matter of months, just 1  year, 2 years, 3 years, but they are still going on. It happens over  and over.   We have been told, oh, this is going to sunset, and that will be the  end of it. Then, we get pressure brought to bear on enough Members that  those sunsets are reset to further years down the road.   When it comes to baby formula, American babies should have enough  American formula produced to take care of them where we have--and  obviously, the FDA has shown in the last few years that they can be  totally incompetent in so many areas. They can have decisions appear to  be totally based on money rather than the best interests of Americans.  The FDA has shown that they don't care about it being your body, your  choice. They would rather force you to have injected into your body  what they tell you to inject, especially when it makes billions of  dollars for pharmaceutical companies that are under an emergency use  authorization so the companies have no liability for the death and  injuries that they cause.   In the case of baby formula, we find out in an article that indicates  that already the Abbott facility is at 95 percent of what it was before  the FDA shut them down and created problems in doing that without  proper regard.   It seems like this bill was a rush to get done without properly  considering what this would mean. Whether it is intentional or not,  what we keep seeing here are bills that pass through this House that  end up making profits for Russia, China, Iran, OPEC, countries that  hate us.   As I have said from years ago when I started pointing this out,  whether it is paying countries that vote against us more than half the  time in the U.N. or bills quickly passed like this that are going to  provide profits to other countries, we don't have to pay people to hate  us. They will do it for free.   Shouldn't we use profits strategically and quit helping those that  want to destroy America for all time? If you just look at the Ukraine  invasion by Russia, the policies, decisions, executive orders, things  that have been pushed through by this White House, pushed through  Congress by this White House, the Biden administration, Russia has made  so much profit because of what this White House has done that they have  been able to fund the war and the invasion in Ukraine.   On the other hand, we have had the same administration rush in and  get Democrat leaders in the House and Senate to pass bills that would-- well, we had $13 billion, $40 billion, we have had other bills that we  have to pass this to help Ukraine. Well, I voted against the last one  because there were simply not--I want to help Ukraine.   I have a special place in my heart for Ukraine, having been an  exchange student in Ukraine back in the seventies. I grew to love so  many of the people there. It is a good place. They are good people. Of  course, they were corrupted by a Marxist system, as every country that  attempts Marxist systems is. But as a farmer on a massive collective  farm explained to me when I asked, in the best Russian I could muster,  ``When do you work out in the field?'' because they were sitting there  in the shade in the middle of the morning, he said, in Russian, ``I  make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the sun as I make  in the shade, so I stay in the shade.''   Well, the Soviet system was able to crush the amount of produce that  could be generated in Ukraine and have done much better without the  Marxist-Soviet system as far as production.   But I would like to be assured by the bills we pass that money is  going to be utilized for what is intended. When you are giving tens of  billions of dollars to an administration that just carelessly and  callously leaves $85 billion of equipment in the hands of our enemies  that killed 3,000 people on 9/11 and would like to kill all the  Americans they can, then we need to be more careful in what we pass in  this Chamber because this administration cannot be trusted.   I have never indicated that I believe the administration wanted  American soldiers killed in Afghanistan because I don't believe that. I  just believe their incompetence is at such a level, their lack of  judgment is at such a level, that they made it possible that 13  soldiers could be killed on what should have been a peaceful exit if it  had been properly done and if we had properly utilized the assistance  of our allies, the former Northern Alliance that fought and originally  defeated the Taliban with about 300 special operators from the U.S.  There shouldn't have been any Americans who were killed in leaving  Afghanistan. But then to leave that much equipment, that just cries out  that this administration is incompetent, that the leaders in the  Pentagon are incompetent.   They continue to say climate change is the biggest threat, but let me  tell you, there was not a single military servicemember who was killed  in Afghanistan by climate change. Those 13 who were killed, it wasn't  climate change. It was incompetence by this administration, the poor  judgment by this administration, that got our people killed.   There will be more Americans killed, as our former allies that  initially defeated the Taliban by early 2002 told me in multiple  visits. For years, they were saying: You can't stay here forever. You  end up like occupiers. It is not good for you, and it is not good for  us. But for heaven's sake, don't leave the country so that the Taliban  is going to take over and kill off all of us who helped America. Don't  do that because they will kill us off, and the Taliban will still want  to destroy America. But next time they hit you and kill thousands of  people and you want to come to take on the Taliban in Afghanistan, we  will all be dead. Everybody that helped you will be dead. There will be  nobody to help you here.    They were trying to warn us not to negotiate with the Taliban, just  defeat the Taliban and leave, and leave them in a position in  Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban when they tried to rise again.   This administration did exactly the opposite. They negotiated with  the Taliban. They left them $85 billion of equipment to help kill  Americans in the future and our allies in the future. It sent a message  to China and Russia that if you want to invade another country, if you  want to take over an area where the U.S. was once the prominent force  to be reckoned with, do it now because the administration in charge of  America is too incompetent to do anything about whatever imperialistic  moves you want to make. That was the message this administration sent.   We need more safeguards. I think about a predecessor of mine, Charlie  Wilson. As some constituents have said over the years, Charlie had a  lot of personal issues, problems, but he was always honest about them.  Charlie was on appropriations, and he knew how to leverage  appropriations, as the Founders knew. They gave us the power of the  purse, yet this Chamber doesn't use our leverage to get good governance  out of a faulty administration. We just rush to give them sacks and  sacks of tens and hundreds of billions of dollars so they can throw it  around wherever they want it.  [[Page H6670]]    I was shocked to see that this administration, for the first time in  the history of the United States of America, is promoting atheism and  humanism. They are providing grants, as I understand it, through the  State Department to groups in other countries that will encourage  atheism in those countries. They will provide grants to other groups.  To be providing funds, grants, to export atheism makes it clear that  this administration is going to create chaos around the world.   As John Adams said, and it can't be said too often, this Constitution  was intended for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate  for the governance of any other. Unless we are going to get back to  teaching moral absolutes, some things are just wrong, and some things  are right. If you are not going to teach those moral imperatives that  we have had throughout our country--the Supreme Court said, no, you  have to stop with those. The Ten Commandments, no, don't be teaching  that. Somebody might think it is improper to murder. You don't want to  let that be taught in schools or brought up in public areas. Get rid of  those.   John Adams knew. George Washington knew. He talked about the  imperative nature of teaching morality and religion. Atheism is the  absence of religion. It is not a religion. Yet, this administration,  heavily funded by this body, is going around the world saying, yes, we  want to give you money if you are going to spread atheism and humanism  where we teach people to be as selfish as they possibly can be.                                time  1500    This country won't continue to go on as an experiment in self- government because you are going to have to get rid of the Second  Amendment. You are going to have to get rid of the right to be  protected from unreasonable search and seizure. You are going to have  to get rid of the freedom of assembly. You will have to get rid of  freedom of speech. You can't have freedom of religion. We are going to  have to basically get rid of the Constitution.   I would prefer to do what the Founders talked about--sure, there has  never been one perfect human being in all of history--none were  perfect. The amazing thing about the Founders is they recognized their  imperfection. They even put it in writing because they understood the  importance of all people being equal and that all people were endowed  with rights not from mankind, but from God.   When you fail to recognize that, then it is very easy to take away  people's rights because, you know, who are they?   If you believe what the Bible taught and teaches, we are created in  God's image--and I don't think it was in a physical image--but if  created in the creator's image then people, every single person, is  worthy of being free and worthy of having rights as pronounced in our  Bill of Rights and our Constitution.   We are at a very precarious situation in our history. We have had  those before. The Founders, like Thomas Jefferson--yeah, he had slaves,  but go look at his original copy of the Declaration of Independence. He  made clear that slavery was a scourge, it was an abomination, it was a  harmful thing, it was a grievance that the Founders had against King  George III because he should never have allowed slavery to get a  foothold at all, and that it was going to help destroy the country.   He recognized this was a problem. It got taken out of the final  draft. But you had Founders that recognized, yeah, they knew it was  hypocritical to have slaves and talk about how wrong slavery was. They  were trying to put together a government, a country, with freedoms that  would last, but they understood how precarious that was. They  understood that no government ever lasts forever. They tried to give us  the best instruments they could.   I read, of course, that Jefferson was not there for the  Constitutional Convention but sent a letter after he read it saying  that if I could change one thing, I would make it a requirement that  any bill had to be on file for a year before it could be voted on.  Well, that would have kept us from voting on this bill that rushes in  as formula production is getting back close to where it was in January.  We rush in at the last minute, and say: No, no, we are going to allow  people to buy more Chinese milk wherever they choose to make it.   Isn't it interesting, we keep doing things that end up profiting  countries that hate us.   That brings me to the topic of fuel. It is rather ironic--there is an  article from the Gateway Pundit. There is a Houston television station  doing a story on the wind turbines in Texas as ERCOT was created to  create policies and oversee our energy production in Texas.   We haven't really had problems with energy production until we got  ERCOT. Of course, they were putting so much emphasis in green energy  that we had a terrible power outage in winter. They were taking care of  spending more and more on windmills and solar, but they didn't follow  the advice of a study that said you need to winterize the natural gas  connections--so they weren't winterized, and we had a failure.   In this story: ``Texas grid operator ERCOT was forced to take  unprecedented emergency measures on Wednesday to avoid rolling  blackouts amid a heat wave as wind turbines failed to produce energy  due to low winds.''   Amazing. Those of us who have lived in Texas all our lives--well, I  had 4 years in Fort Benning, Georgia--but otherwise, we know that often  in the hottest part of the summer the wind doesn't blow and the  turbines won't turn. We need air conditioning more than ever.   Yet, in my district and adjoining areas, they closed a couple of coal  power plants. They had plenty of scrubbers on them to help have clean  air. Cleaner production of power than any coal plant in other countries  of the world. China is going to add another hundred to the hundred they  just opened. They are not going to be near as clean as we had in east  Texas. There are a couple more in my district that are scheduled to be  closed.   We are creating a situation where people will die because that always  happens when we don't have sufficient power, people don't have air  conditioning, and the heat gets them.   The article says: ``ERCOT manages electric power to more than 26  million Texas customers and represents 90 percent of the State's  electric load. . . .   ``On Monday ERCOT asked customers to voluntarily raise thermostats a  degree or two, turn off lights, avoid using ovens, washing machines and  dryers. . . . `'   This is Texas. We create ERCOT and what happens?   They go nuts on green energy. Now we are going to have what Gray  Davis used to have, called Gray-outs, in Texas. We got plenty of fuel.  We have lost our minds. Maybe we would be better off without ERCOT.   Here is an article from Tucker Carlson. This is from July 12. I am  going to read some of it.   He said: ``Voters, it turns out, are not into any of those things and  so nothing that resembles the Green New Deal is going to pass the  United States Congress in our lifetimes''--I am hoping not--``provided  this remains an actual democracy, which is to say, provided the public  has anything to say about how they're governed.   ``That's a nonstarter here. It's never going to happen by democratic  means, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. It doesn't mean that  ideologues can't impose the Green New Deal on weaker countries that are  too poor to refuse it, and over the past several years, that's exactly  what they've done. So the Green New Deal is actually taking effect  around the world. So, we don't have to guess what would happen if it  took effect here. We can know. That's the science.    ``Let's start with Ghana. Ghana's a pretty little country, peaceful  place, actually, on the west coast of Africa. Three years ago, Ghana  was in great shape. It had one of the fastest-growing economies in the  world. In fact, it had so much energy over most of the last decade, it  was exporting it to its neighbors in West Africa.   ``Now, those energy exports from Ghana peaked in 2014. Why that year?  Well, because the next year, the World Bank published this headline on  its website, `World Bank approves largest-ever guarantees for Ghana's  Energy Transformation.' Oh, when they promise to transform your energy,  slow down.   ``But Ghana didn't slow down. They just kept going. The World Bank  promised to provide, and we're quoting,  [[Page H6671]]  `technical assistance for energy sector reforms and the drafting of a  new renewable energy law.' So, in return for all this help, Ghana  agreed to limit its carbon emissions, and then they entered the Paris  climate agreement. Oh, how virtuous.   ``What happened next? This is the part you don't read that much  about. Last year, Ghana experienced a complete shutdown of its national  power supply. No more electricity, no emissions because we have no  electricity, and blackouts have continued since then. Just yesterday, a  news source in Ghana reported that, `Residents in parts of the Ashanti  region who have been hit with power cuts are without water as well,'  because it turns out you need electricity to provide water also to grow  food. Now, this is not a small thing. The Ashanti region has millions  of people living in it. They're all now living in the Stone Age and  it's not just the energy grid that's now compromised in Ghana.   ``International observers say the country is now facing severe food  shortages and hunger, starvation within a matter of months. Why is  that? It's a fertile country, hardworking people. Now they're running  out of fertilizer. Why? Well, because for years, Sandy Cortez's friends  in the NGO community pushed Ghana toward less efficient, more expensive  organic fertilizers and the government of Ghana, because it's not a  rich government, caved. Last year, according to Ghana's news service,  Ghana's agricultural minister `urged local farmers to adopt an organic  agriculture system to reduce the impact of climate change.'   ``Oh, what happened then? Well, the good people of Ghana, while they  feel good about their fight against climate change, are now starving  and in June, last month, police in Ghana used water and tear gas to  attack hundreds of demonstrators in Accra, which is the capital of  Ghana.   ``It's not just Ghana. The same thing just happened in Sri Lanka. In  2016, the World Economic Forum published an article by a Columbia  professor called Joseph Stiglitz, one of the dumbest people on planet  Earth, urging Ghana to transition to `high productivity organic  farming.' Now, what does Stiglitz know about farming? Ever farmed? No,  but he felt strongly that Sri Lanka should try a new kind of farming  and of course sold it to Sri Lankans as a pathway to prosperity.''   Again, this is Tucker Carlson.   ``In 2015, the World Economic Forum published an article on its  website entitled, and we are quoting, `This is how we will make Sri  Lanka rich by 2025.' You can search for that article, but it's gone now  along with the government of Sri Lanka. So, they had an actual  insurrection, not January 6, not a guy in horns, in a bearskin, running  around on mushrooms, making weird noises. No, an actual insurrection  where they like, come to your house and swim in your swimming pool,  root through your sock drawer and make you leave. That's what they did  to the people who run Sri Lanka. They, being the public.   ``The turning point came in 2021 when the president of Sri Lanka,  acting on advice from the World Economic Forum, banned the use and  importation of chemical fertilizers. Now, the problem was virtually  every farm in Sri Lanka uses those fertilizers to produce food, which  it turns out people need every day in order to survive. As a result of  that move, food prices in Sri Lanka nearly doubled. Millions more Sri  Lankans now live in poverty, which is not a joke and because the  economy has collapsed, Sri Lanka now cannot afford fuel imports. So,  Sri Lankans are now waiting days for gasoline. Watch.''                                time  1515    Then he has the story there from Sri Lanka:   ``What's so interesting is millions of people are now really  suffering. The government just fell in Sri Lanka. Now, no one in Sri  Lanka is White. They are what our Democratic Party would call people of  color and yet the American intellectuals who pushed that disaster in  Sri Lanka, who are responsible for the suffering there, have all  escaped culpability. No one is saying a word about it.''   ``The Netherlands, for example, which is a very rich country, the  second-biggest food exporter in the world, tried to do, for reasons  that are not clear but may have to do with Western guilt, the same  thing that leaders in Sri Lanka tried to do. They just ordered farmers  to cut virtually all of their nitrogen oxide emissions to `save the  environment.' Now, doing that would shutter most farms in the  Netherlands and destroy the country's food supply and once again, that  led to riots. So, everything that's happened in Sri Lanka and Ghana and  the Netherlands is happening at the behest not simply of ideologues,  but of some of the largest financial institutions in the world.   ``They want more of this. It's why Ghana has achieved a near-perfect  ESG environmental impact score of 97.7. According to World Economic  Research, Sri Lanka has an ESG score of 98.1, the Netherlands 90.7. So,  the poorer you get, the more human suffering there is, the higher your  ESG score, and that is important because companies will not invest  unless you have a high ESG score. Interesting. So, these countries have  no choice and that's why South Africa, for example, works so hard to  get an ESG score that now totals 91.   ``Now, that effort began in 2015 when South Africa switched to  renewables. Now, how did that work? Well, like everything in South  Africa, no one in America really wants to know. It's their favorite  country. It's a huge success. What's life like in South Africa for  people of all colors?'' ``Well, the Guardian, of all places reported at  the time, and we are quoting `solar, biomass and wind energy systems  are popping up all over the country and feeding the clean energy into  this strained electrical grid.'   ``So their grids have been falling apart since 1994, but no problem.  The green energy geniuses are going to save South Africa. How did that  work?   ``Well, 7 years later, The Washington Post reports that South Africa  regularly experiences `rolling blackouts that last 8 hours or more,  crippling economic activity and disrupting life in this nation of 60  million people,' . . .'' ``Ask anybody who lives there. It is falling  apart. Doesn't work.   ``Also join France. France is committed to renewable energy. How is  that working? Well, France currently has an ESG environmental score of  92.6. Why? Because 10 years ago France pledged to drive a quarter of  all of its energy from renewables in 2018. These policies led to  riots.''   He goes on to talk about how much chaos it created for France.   In everyplace that it has been tried with this green energy, it has  fallen apart--every single one--with no exceptions: Albania, Kenya,  Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Libya, and so on.   But it is not just a problem there, it is becoming a problem here.   United States' ESG scoring on environmental issues currently stands  at 58. But Joe Biden--who buys into every stupid trend--wants to change  that. It is very important to get our ESG score up.   Madam Speaker, you see in history, and you see around the world that  when Marxists want to take over, they take advantage of weaknesses, and  they exploit them. What they have seen America, exploit this green  energy deal in the name of saving the world, and, yes, there will be  riots.   For the morons that say I promote violence, I have never promoted  violence. I have promoted using our institutions that were created to  peacefully resolve them. As a historian, it is clear that Dr. King's  peaceful methods worked best toward bringing about needed change. But  as a historian, Madam Speaker, you have to note that when our  institutions don't do their jobs, then you end up with violence. I  don't want violence, but that is what happens.   It is happening in these countries that have gotten their ESG score  up and people start starving and they see their families suffering. We  can avoid all that. But we have got to stop the insanity.   What does it really come back to?   This: I saw it in the Soviet Union as a college student, and I am  seeing it happening now. I thought socialism, Communism, and  progressivism, whatever you want to call it, I thought it was dead  because it fails every time it is tried.   There is a tiny, elite ruling class when you have Marxism, socialism,  and progressivism--a tiny, little, elite ruling class. They will have  power. They  [[Page H6672]]  will have electricity. They will have what they need. They will have  food to eat. You might hear some of them behind closed doors say: Let  them eat cake or bugs.   We are being told: Eat bugs. Because your countries are going broke  because they are trying to get up their ESG scores. It is unnecessary.   We have people saying: You have to get rid of your car. You can't  have a car. That gives you too much freedom. You are a peasant. We want  to get back to the Middle Ages, these people say, who want to be part  of the elite ruling class. Yes. Let's get back to Middle Age mentality  where we have peasants, and they walk everywhere, and the elite ruling  class gets to ride in style.   No. We had the greatest, freest, and most wonderful country. Sure, it  had problems. Every country has problems. But it was the best that has  ever been. Now we are destroying it, and we are going back to a time  when elitists will fly around in their private jets and everybody else  will have to walk.   Now, let's get back to freedom across the board. We cannot do it if  we do not take notice and usage of the things with which this country  has been blessed more than any other.    We had another bill to put off limits more uranium. Well, don't  worry. When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State we sold, I think,  about 20 percent of our uranium available to Russia. Of course, she  made a lot of money for the Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton got  paid a lot of money. They were able to get that sale through.   Wasn't that great?   Continuing to put uranium off limits, we should have had rare-earth  metals that we were able to get from Afghanistan, but this  administration's incompetence left that in the hands of China that has  most now of the rare-earth minerals. Every week it seems like--at least  every month--we are putting more of our own blessed rare-earth metals  and minerals of all kinds off limits because we are going to drive this  country back to the Middle Ages, and people will be eating bugs as they  are being encouraged to do around the world.   We need to have freedom and not have Congress push us back to the  Middle Ages and push us back to the age of elitism or like it was in  the Soviet Union.   We were told before the eight of us went over there that only the  elite have cars in the Soviet Union. To them it is a game. Don't think  for a minute pedestrians have the right-of-way because they looked at  them as peasants, and they tried to hit them. Boy, did I see that. I  couldn't believe it. So you had to be careful because somebody is in a  car, and they are going to try to hit you. They did, a number of times.   That is where we are going back to. We are going to have Marxist  peasants and Marxist elitists if we don't stop the insanity. It needs  to stop now.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate what Tucker Carlson put together so we  can share here, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
