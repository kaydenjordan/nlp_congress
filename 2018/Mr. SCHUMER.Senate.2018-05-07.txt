 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we recently received some terribly bad  news. Michael Beaver, the Assistant Parliamentarian of the Senate,  passed away unexpectedly last week. His death at the young age of 39 is  shocking in its suddenness and tragic for the family, friends, and  coworkers he left behind.   Michael was incredibly bright, unfailingly honest, had a quick wit  and a dry sense of humor. I know that as an Assistant Parliamentarian  he was a member of a small but crucial team of behind-the-scenes  staffers without whom the Senate couldn't function.   Our thoughts are with his family today, especially his wife, Gilda,  and his two young boys, who will remember him as a loving and devoted  father. In the words of Scripture, ``Blessed are those who mourn, for  they shall be comforted.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, as the Senate returns  to work after the recess, we are scheduled to process six circuit court  judges over the next few weeks. Some of these judges are  noncontroversial and have received support from their home State  Democratic Senators, and we will work with the majority to confirm  them. But Michael Brennan, second in line this week, will receive a  cloture vote on the floor of the Senate even though one of his home  State Senators, Ms. Baldwin, has not returned a blue slip for his  nomination.   When hearing the facts, they are appalling--not just his ideology,  although Mr. Brennan is a very conservative nominee who failed to earn  the recommendation of a functioning bipartisan commission that was set  up by both Senator Baldwin, a Democrat, and Senator Johnson, a  Republican, to recommend Federal judicial nominees. That is how people  want us to do things, in a bipartisan way. I was able to work out judge  nominations in a bipartisan way in the Senate when we had a Republican  President, a Republican Governor, but that was overrun. This is now the  second time that Chairman Grassley has ignored the blue-slip tradition  in this Congress, but the part that really burns me and I think many  others who are fair-minded in the Senate and this country is the fact  that the seat that Mr. Brennan would fill on the Seventh Circuit was  held open for 6 years--6 years--via blue slips. Senator Johnson did not  turn in a blue slip, and the seat stayed vacant.   Now that we have a Republican President, Senator Baldwin's blue slip  is being ignored. What a double standard; what hypocrisy. When people  ask whether we are being obstructionist, let the shoe fit as to what  happened to this seat on the Seventh Circuit. It was historic  obstruction, yet Senator Leahy faithfully observed the blue-slip  tradition and kept the circuit seat vacant for 6 years.   Listen to this. During those 6 years, none other than Mr. Brennan  himself, the nominee, wrote an op-ed defending Senator Johnson's right  to refuse to return a blue slip to the Seventh Circuit vacancy. Of  course, irony of ironies, it is now Mr. Brennan who is up for  confirmation over the objection of one of his home State Senators.  Where is the defense of senatorial courtesy today?   Making matters worse is the fact that the far right is pushing very  conservative nominees, way out of the mainstream, and the pressure on  my friend--and he is my friend, the Republican leader--to ignore all of  the traditions, the blue slip above all, and create this double  standard is really galling.   On Wednesday of this week, the Judiciary Committee will hold a  hearing on Ryan Bounds. He is also a nominee for a circuit court, this  one the Ninth Circuit in Oregon. He has not received a blue slip from  either Senator Wyden or Senator Merkley. This will be the first time  the Judiciary Chairman has allowed a nominee who lacks the support of  both home State Senators to proceed, and it will be the third time this  Congress that Chairman Grassley--who showed himself to be a statesman  when he moved the bipartisan bill on the special counsel last week, but  in this case, there is no statesmanship showing--has ignored the  century-old blue-slip tradition.   When Democrats held the majority, we respected the blue-slip  tradition, not because it was some esoteric custom but because blue  slips are a way to force consultation and consensus on judicial  nominees. You don't get many nominees with a blue slip, far right or  far left. Those judges tend to want to make the law, not interpret it.  We want all our nominees, whether they are nominated by a Republican or  Democratic President, to be qualified and to have demonstrated  excellence in their careers. Blue slips were a way to encourage the  Senate to come together around qualified nominees. I assume that is why  41 Republican Senators a few years back, in 2009, wrote to President  Obama to say that ``we, as a Conference, expect [senatorial courtesy to  the blue slip tradition] to be observed, even-handedly and regardless  of party affiliation.''   Let me read that again. This is what Senator McConnell and Senator  Grassley signed: ``[W]e, as a Conference, expect [senatorial courtesy  to the blue slip tradition] to be observed, even-handedly and  regardless of party affiliation.''   Majority Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley both signed that  letter. Today they are singing a different tune. So while we want to  work with our Republican colleagues to confirm nominees expeditiously,  we are very disappointed in the way they have trampled the blue-slip  tradition.   When my colleagues come to me and say: What about comity and what  about working together? It goes both ways. It goes both ways. This is  appalling. It is unfair, it is wrong, and it is another degradation of  how the Senate has always functioned.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the subject of healthcare, last week,  insurance companies in the State of Virginia announced that health  insurance premiums would be much higher this coming year. More than  100,000 Virginians who rely on these plans are staring at a proposed  2019 premium that will be 15 percent or 27 percent or 64 percent  higher, depending on which insurer they use. In filing their rates, the  health insurers are pointing to the  [[Page S2507]]  actions of the Trump administration and congressional Republicans as  major reasons for the premium increases. The Trump administration and  our Republican friends in Congress are the reason these premiums are  going up, according to insurers. They suggest that is one of the  reasons.   Remember, President Trump canceled payments for the cost-sharing  program, which reduces premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for low- income Americans. Republicans in Congress repealed the healthcare  coverage requirement, which the CBO itself predicted would raise  premiums by 10 percent more each year than they would otherwise be and  result in millions more people without insurance.   Sometimes our Republican colleagues make a mistake and speak the  truth and admit that they are to blame in good part for these premium  increases. Former HHS Secretary Tom Price said he ``believes that  [repealing the individual mandate] actually will harm the pool in the  exchange market, and consequently, that drives up the cost for other  folks.''   This is not Chuck Schumer, a Democrat; this is the Republican former  Congressman, the Republican-appointed HHS Secretary saying that  Republican acts are causing premiums to go up.   The sabotage doesn't end there. As we speak, the Trump administration  is finalizing a rule that would expand the availability of junk  insurance plans that would force higher premiums on people with  preexisting conditions, impose an ``age tax'' on older Americans, and  once again could subject Americans to the devastating effects of  medical bankruptcy.   Make no mistake, all of this sabotage by Republicans has  consequences. TrumpCare is already heralding double-digit premium  increases in States across the country. The rates in Virginia are bad,  and the rates in Maryland may be worse. Maryland insurance companies  are announcing 2019 rates today, and one PPO plan is asking for a 91- percent increase--91 percent.   For the sake of a political vendetta--again, the hard right: Repeal  ObamaCare; show it doesn't work--Republicans are taking it out on  millions of American families by making the rates higher to prove a  political point so that Donald Trump can do a few more tweets. It is  not going to stick. It is not going to work. The American people know  who is in charge. The Republicans have the Presidency, the House, and  the Senate. The buck stops there when the rates go up.   President Trump and Republicans promised Americans a better, cheaper  healthcare system. Remember, President Trump said that he is going to  ``take care of everybody''--those are his words--and deliver  ``healthcare that is far less expensive and far better.'' President  Trump simply has not delivered. President Trump talked and talked and  talked about making healthcare better and cheaper as he ran and while  he has been President, but in every respect he has failed to deliver.  In every respect he has made the problem worse.   Simply put, President Trump has dropped the ball on healthcare, and  the public knows it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, a word on the Republican tax  bill. From the very beginning of our debate on taxes, Republicans  insisted that their bill was about helping the American worker, even  though the GOP tax bill directs 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1  percent. President Trump and the Republicans said it would be ``a  middle class miracle.''   Their theory was to give the big corporations and the wealthy a  massive tax cut, and the benefits would trickle down to everyone else,  even though that theory has been debunked over and over and over again.  Still, President Trump repeatedly promised that workers would see a  raise of $4,000 or more as a result of the Republican tax bill.   I would like to ask most Americans if they have gotten the $4,000  raise as the White House promised because, according to the April jobs  report, hourly earnings have not increased significantly and are  actually up just 2.6 percent over the past 12 months. Last month,  average hourly earnings increased by just 4 cents--hardly $4,000. No  matter how you look at it, the Republican tax bill has failed to  deliver anywhere close to the wage growth that was promised.   The harsh fact is that corporations aren't using the bulk of their  tax savings to boost worker pay or provide additional benefits or hire  more workers or buy more equipment. They are using the predominance of  tax savings on something called stock buybacks. The CEO says: Let's buy  back the stock. His shares go up. The shareholders' shares go up. The  American worker is left holding the bag.   According to a recent analysis by JUST Capital, only 6 percent of the  capital allocated by companies on the tax bill savings has gone to  employees, while nearly 60 percent--10 times as much--has gone to  shareholders. More than $390 billion has been authorized this year on  corporate buybacks, something we used to prohibit or make very  difficult, while only $6.7 billion has been spent on one-time bonuses  and wage hikes.   There is another Republican truth teller who is now getting pommeled  a little, but I respect him--Senator Marco Rubio. Here is what he had  to say last week:         There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big       corporations are happy, they're going to take the money       they're saving and reinvest it in American workers. In fact--    These are his words. They sound like mine.         In fact they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses;       there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been       massively poured back into the American worker.    Let me repeat that. This is Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida,  who said: ``[T]here's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been  massively poured back into the American worker.''   I couldn't have said it better myself. President Trump and the  Republicans promised a middle-class miracle, with tremendous raises for  workers, but they once again haven't delivered. Instead, the American  people have been saddled with higher deficits and a larger debt, while  corporations reward wealthy executives and shareholders. Even  Republican Senators are starting to admit it.   So I have heard some commentators say: Well, maybe the public says  that we don't like the President's tweeting, we don't like that he  changes his story, we don't like prevaricating, but at least he is  delivering.   Not with the tax bill, where so much of the wealth is going to the  top; not on healthcare, where premiums are going up. The American  people will have the right to protest come November, which I believe  they will.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
