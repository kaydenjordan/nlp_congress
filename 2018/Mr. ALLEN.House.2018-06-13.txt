 Mr. Speaker, in America today, in every State, in too many  families, there is a profound sense of pain, loss, and suffering caused  by the horrendous opioid crisis.   Unfortunately, my home State of Georgia is not immune to this growing  epidemic. Many of my closest friends have lost family members or  children, and the question is always: Why? How can this happen?   From 1999 to 2014, prescription opioid deaths increased tenfold in  Georgia. We saw over 500 deaths in 2015 as a result of opioid abuse.   Over the next few weeks, my colleagues and I in the House of  Representatives are bringing opioid addiction out of the shadows and  voting on over 50 pieces of legislation to prevent further opioid abuse  and assist those currently dealing with addiction. We must take  proactive steps to fight opioid addiction and focus on treating the  mind, the body, and, most important in my view, the spirit.   The road to recovery may be long and hard-fought, but the American  will is as strong as ever and shall prevail. We are at war with drugs,  and we must defeat this enemy.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the nearly 40  opioid-related bills before this House this week. America needs us.                            ____________________
