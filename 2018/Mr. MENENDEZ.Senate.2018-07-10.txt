 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my  colleagues who will be joining me shortly on the floor to voice their  support for the NATO alliance. Once again, we find ourselves facing a  crisis of President Trump's own creation.   For nearly 70 years, NATO has served as a pillar of stability and  security for the United States and our democratic allies across Europe.  It was there as Europe rebuilt after World War II. It was there to win  the Cold War. It was there to defend the United States after September  11. Yet today, for the first  [[Page S4861]]  time since World War II, an American President has given our closest  allies in Europe reason to question the trustworthiness of the United  States and our reliability as a NATO partner.   President Trump's slapdash approach to foreign policy, borne out of  heated campaign rallies instead of thoughtful Cabinet meetings, has  real implications for our national security. Such reckless behavior by  President Trump has weakened the United States on the global stage and  has created a more dangerous world for our citizens and our troops  serving abroad.   Today the President is on his way to Europe, and his intentions are  clear. President Trump will use every opportunity that comes his way to  admonish our allies, alienate our closest friends, and degrade the  post-World War II international order in the hopes of winning favor  with the dictator from Moscow.   In fact, this morning the President said his easiest meeting during  this trip would probably be with Vladimir Putin. Is it easy because  they share common values? Is it easy because he wants to be Putin's  friend? Is it easy because Trump would rather deal with an autocrat  than negotiate with democratically elected leaders?   Let's be clear. Meeting with a thug intent on undermining American  democratic values should not be easy, and it should not be chummy. Yet  as National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster reportedly said in the past:         The president thinks he can be friends with Putin. I don't       know why, or why he would want to be.    I agree with those comments of the former National Security Advisor,  General McMaster. It makes no sense. Attacking American democracy is  not exactly an act of friendship.   We know the circumstances are dire. The leaders of our intelligence  community and the entire Senate Intelligence Committee, on a bipartisan  basis, have concluded that Russia not only attacked the United States  in 2016 through its cyber efforts but continues to sow discord and  destabilize institutions that are at the very heart of American  democracy.   Yet to this day, President Trump continues to take Putin at his word.  With his warm embrace of the Russian dictator, many of us find  ourselves questioning the President's true loyalties, and it is no  surprise that our allies in Europe are questioning the loyalty and  commitment of the United States to the post-World War II international  order.   In the absence of U.S. Presidential leadership, I want to make clear  to our allies abroad, as well as our adversaries in the Kremlin, where  Members of the U.S. Senate stand. We stand for the rule of law and an  international order based on liberal democratic values; we stand for  security alliances among democracies based on mutual defense against  our enemies; we stand against dictators who invade our neighbors with  soldiers and cyber attacks; and we stand with our friends through thick  and thin.   Tomorrow, on the Foreign Relations Committee, we expect to make such  a declaration explicit with a bipartisan resolution affirming that the  U.S. national security is inextricably linked to the security of  Europe. We are not schmucks, Mr. President, for leading an alliance  that has brought peace and security for decades in the wake of two  devastating World Wars.   The Foreign Relations Committee will reaffirm a commitment to article  5 of the NATO charter, which says that an attack on one is an attack on  all.   We recognize that since article 5 took effect, it has only been  triggered once--only once--by and in support of the United States  following the September 11 attack. To this day, nearly 17 years later,  NATO troops still serve in Afghanistan in support of the American  effort.   These countries have all sent their sons and daughters to fight and  die alongside ours. They stand with us--and we with them--against  extremism, terrorism, authoritarianism, and proudly in support of  democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.   Members of the NATO alliance had been steadily increasing their  defense spending for the past 4 years in reaction to Putin's invasion  of Crimea and the implications for regional security, not Trump's  bluster.   Our allies understand the threat posed by a dictator who tears away  territory from its neighbors. The question is, Does President Trump? Is  there more work to be done to meet the 2-percent commitment  in countries across the alliance? Of course, but we need to acknowledge  the progress that has been made and the trend lines that are headed in  the right direction. Let's not jeopardize those trends by insulting the  very leaders we need by our side.    This week in Brussels, the President should do something he has  proven completely incapable of thus far--he should thank our allies for  their steadfastness, for their resilience, and for their commitment to  working with us to counter the threat posed by Russia.   President Trump should work with our allies to collectively increase  sanctions on Moscow. He should work with NATO to build our collective  cyber defenses against the onslaught of Russian cyber attacks and  disinformation. These are all things he should do--things a normal  American President would do--but based on the tweets and his past  actions, I have little hope he will choose such a path.   The President should also work with our allies to continue the fight  against ISIS. NATO countries form the core of the Global Coalition to  Defeat ISIS. NATO governments host working groups, contribute  resources, participate in airstrikes, provide stabilization assistance,  and face serious challenges in addressing the plight of foreign  fighters.   In Iraq, NATO is working to share more responsibility in training the  Iraqi security forces. This is exactly how strategic partnerships are  supposed to work. We identify challenges, cooperate on solutions, share  the burden of funding, troop deployments, and assistance in support of  a shared objective--in this case, a stable, unified Iraq that can stand  up to Iran.   In Syria, NATO should be a natural ally in countering Russian and  Iranian aggression. Despite regular, irrefutable evidence of war crimes  and crimes against humanity committed by Bashar al-Assad, Putin  continues to bolster the Butcher of Damascus.   In fact, Russian forces are directly complicit in targeting civilians  and civilian structures in Syria. These are facts that cannot be  ignored. Russian forces are actively working with Assad's regime to  bomb opposition in southern Syria into submission. These military  operations are taking place today inside the very deescalation zone  President Trump touted last year with Putin in Vietnam.   These developments have led to the largest displacement of civilians  in southern Syria since the beginning of this war. The President must  make clear, once and for all, that Russia is not a constructive partner  on Syria; that it is a willing accomplice and a perpetrator of war  crimes.   Our friends in Ukraine are fighting for their country on a daily  basis, battling Russian troops. As the globe focuses on the World Cup  in Russia, at least 17 Ukrainian troops have been killed or injured in  their own country by Russian forces--killed or injured in their own  country. We are helping our Ukrainian friends with training and  equipment. Under no circumstances, can this aid be diminished in any  way. President Trump needs to understand that any attempt to do so will  be met with strong and unified opposition in the Senate. President  Trump can never lose sight of the importance of eastern Ukraine, nor  can he forget the plight of so many Crimeans who suffer under Russian  repression to this day.   Today I submitted a resolution with Senator Portman calling for the  United States to declare a policy of nonrecognition of Russia's illegal  annexation of Crimea. This idea is modeled under the Welles  Declaration, which said the United States would never recognize the  Soviet annexation of the Baltic States. The Welles Declaration meant  something to the beleaguered people of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia,  all who yearned to be free of Moscow's repression, and today they are  free.   It represented the U.S. commitment to the territorial integrity of  independent countries. Today we have the same opportunity to send the  same message to those courageous Ukrainian citizens living in Crimea.   President Trump was reported to have said the people of Crimea want  to be part of Russia because they speak  [[Page S4862]]  Russian. Instead of misinformed judgments from the President, we and  the world need clear leadership that says definitively to President  Putin that we will not stand for his illegal occupation of Crimea; we  will not stand by in the face of ongoing attacks in eastern Ukraine by  Russian forces; we will not stand by while President Putin participates  in the commission of war crimes in Syria; and we will not stand by  while Russia attacks democratic institutions in the United States and  those of our closest allies.   I hope our President will meet with Putin in Helsinki and express  these simple but powerful statements. Yet nothing in his track record  gives me much hope that he will do so.   We have a President who is so enamored of Putin that to this day, he  still refuses to criticize the Russian leader, a President who sought  early in his term to lift sanctions on Russia, a President who has  questioned Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea, and a President who  routinely trashes partners in the strongest military alliance the world  has ever seen. This behavior is bizarre, it is erratic, and it is no  reflection of who we are as a country or a people.   In closing, I would remind the President that the Russia sanctions  law, CAATSA, restricts his ability to unilaterally lift sanctions on  Russia. Such a move would be subject to approval. So as he embarks on  his ``easiest meeting'' with Vladimir Putin, he is constrained by a law  that was supported by 98 Senators.   We know Putin seeks sanction relief. We must make clear that such  relief will only come when he withdraws from Ukraine, returns Crimea,  ends his support for Bashar al-Assad, and stops interfering in our  elections.   As someone who is personally sanctioned by Vladimir Putin, I will not  stop working to ensure that the CAATSA law is fully implemented by this  administration.   The hallmark struggle of our time is between those who champion  democracy and autocrats who use oppression, military evasions, and  disinformation to achieve their nefarious ends, and this week this  battle comes into sharp contrast.   Will our President side with our democratic allies in Brussels or  will he side with an autocrat in the Kremlin? Either way, the world  needs to know the U.S. Senate has made its view clear. We stand with  NATO. We stand with our allies. We stand for democracy and the rule of  law. We stand for the international liberal order that has kept the  peace for decades. We stand on these values today, and we will never  shy away from their defense.   With that, I yield the floor.
