 Madam President, I am pleased to commend  David Brinton for his contributions and dedicated service as a member  of my personal office staff.   A native of Tupelo, MS, David earned multiple degrees from  Mississippi State University, including a bachelor of business  administration degree with a major in business economics, a master of  public policy and administration, and a master of arts in economics.  Following that, David turned his attention to studying law, graduating  cum laude with his juris doctor from Georgetown University Law Center,  while working part time.   David's contributions throughout his tenure have been invaluable to  the legislative functions of my office, and his insightful input will  be missed. I, along with the rest of my office, have benefitted from  David's knowledge and experience. His personal qualities are  impeccable. He is a hard working, courteous, and intelligent young man,  who has a strong sense of responsibility, good judgment, and a pleasant  demeanor that makes him an easy person to like.   Mississippi and our Nation have been well-served by the diligence,  dedication, and commitment to excellence David provided on a daily  basis. He has put forth his best efforts to reflect credit on me, my  State, and the Senate, and has been successful in doing so. I will miss  David's good counsel. He has my appreciation and gratitude for the  notable job he has done in the Senate. I wish David, his wife Julia,  and their son Henry, all the best in their future endeavors.                            ____________________
