 Mr. Speaker, both the Washington Examiner and  Washington Times recently have reported on a practice that is resulting  in overly low approval ratings for President Trump. Pollsters are not  necessarily rigging their questions to get a desired result; instead,  they are creating a biased result by how they select people to poll.   Frequently, the pollsters contact more Democrats than Republicans.  Unsurprisingly, the results tilt anti-Trump. The Examiner pointed out  that this ``robs Trump of about 8 points in his approval ratings, from  46 percent to 38 percent.''   The Times noted that in polls including Presidential approval  questions, the Economist relied on a sample that used 58 percent more  Democrats than Republicans, which ``gave Democrats a 14-point edge,  while Reuters and Gallup gave Democrats an 11-point and 7-point edge in  their samples.''   Mr. Speaker, as the 2016 election taught us, we shouldn't rely on  biased polls if we want accuracy.                            ____________________
