 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  bravery of New Hampshire's own Bradley Haas, who was killed in the line  of duty while protecting the staff and patients at New Hampshire  Hospital on November 17, preventing what likely would have been a  tragic mass shooting in our psychiatric hospital.   There is no doubt that Chief Haas' courage saved countless lives. Our  community, our State, and our country owe him and his family a debt  that can never be repaid.   Throughout his life of service, Chief Haas always devoted himself to  working for others. He will be remembered as many things: a hero, a  patriot, a community leader, and, most of all, a friend. May he rest in  peace.                            ____________________
