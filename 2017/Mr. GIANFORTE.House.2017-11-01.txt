 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  also thank the gentleman from Arkansas, a trained forester, for his  efforts to reform how we manage our forests.   Montana faced a devastating wildfire season. Over 1 million acres  have burned in our State. Lives were lost. Our livelihoods were  threatened. Wildlife habitats were destroyed. We breathed the smoke as  the clouds hung in the air.   Earlier this week, the gentleman from Arkansas and I met with  conservationists, the Forest Service, local leaders, and key  stakeholders, including the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. They all  affirmed that litigation and an inability to inappropriately manage our  forests are the problem that lead to severe wildfires.   When catastrophic wildfires strike, we keep treating the symptoms-- suppressing the fires--and somehow think that the next wildfire will be  different. We have to address the underlying issues. We have to reform  how we manage our forests. We have to make our forests healthier and  our wildfires less severe. We can begin that process today.   The people of Montana need relief and a long-term solution. I  encourage my colleagues to support this bill.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Issa). The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter of  support for the legislation from the National Lumber and Building  Material Dealers Association, and a statement of support from the  former Chief of the Forest Service, Tom Tidwell.       NLBMDA Praises Reintroduction of Resilient Federal Forests Act         Washington, DC.--The National Lumber and Building Material       Dealers Association (NLBMDA) praises the introduction       yesterday of the Resilient Federal Forests Act by (H.R. 2936)       Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR). The legislation helps protect       the national forest system by implementing best practices       intended to lessen the threat of wildfires. Original       cosponsors for the bipartisan bill include Reps. Raul       Labrador (R-ID), Tom McClintock (R-CA), Cathy McMorris       Rodgers (R-WA), Rick Nolan (D-MN), Collin Peterson (D-MN),       and Scott Tipton (R-CO).        Rep. Westerman introduced the legislation during the       previous Congress in 2015, where it passed the House of       Representatives by a vote of 262-167 with support from 21       Democrats who crossed the aisle to support the bill.        The U.S. Forest Service manages over 190 million acres. Of       this, 46 million acres is designated as allowable for timber       harvest. Timber harvests from federal forests declined by 78       percent between 1987 and 2015, from 11.3 to 2.5 billion board       feet. This is far below the long-term, sustainable capability       of these lands of 12.2 billion board feet per year.        Poor land management during the past 30 years has led to       declining health of national forests. This has resulted in       fewer jobs and productivity in the forestry sector, fewer       board feet of domestically produced lumber entering the       market, and a marked increase in acreage ravaged by insects,       disease and fire.        ``The Resilient Federal Forests Act strikes a balanced       approach in managing the national forest system by making       more land available for logging in an environmentally       sustainable way,'' said Jonathan Paine, NLBMDA President and       CEO. ``NLBMDA thanks Congressman Westerman for his leadership       on this important issue.''        NLBMDA supports greater sustainable harvesting of federal       forests to meet long-term demand for lumber as part of a       comprehensive plan that does not place U.S. private forests       at a competitive disadvantage.                                   ____   Statement of Tom Tidwell, Chief, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest                                  Service     Submitted to THE HOUSE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON         FEDERAL LANDS on THE RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT OF 2017         Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for       the opportunity to present a statement regarding the       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. The U.S. Forest       Service is currently reviewing this discussion draft, and the       Administration does not have a position on it at this time.        We appreciate the significant work the Subcommittee put       into this bill since it was last introduced in the 114th       Congress. We also appreciate your efforts to incorporate       Forest Service comments and recommendations and are       encouraged by many of the goals outlined within this bill. We       look forward to continuing to work with you and your staffs       on the details to ensure this legislation results in       meaningful improvements to forest management work on the       ground.        The Forest Service welcomes legislation that expands the       toolset we can use to restore our nation's forests while       staying within the boundaries and intent of the National       Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.       Forest restoration projects provide rural jobs, mitigate the       severity of wildfires, enhance watershed conditions, and       ensure a variety of other economic, social and environmental       benefits for the American people. Provisions that expand       categorical exclusions, incentivize collaboration, and       streamline environmental analysis or consultation with other       federal agencies are all important issues in the bill that we       are reviewing.        It is notable that the Resilient Federal Forests Act does       not contain provisions that would mandate harvest levels,       require a new layer of zoning on the National Forests, or       elevate one use over another on these multiple-use lands, as       we have seen in other recent forestry bills.        While we support efforts to provide new tools to improve       forest management and restoration, capacity constraints,       including the present approach to budgeting for wildfire,       continue to be impediments to increasing the pace and scale       of this work. We look forward to continuing to work with you       on the wildfire title to find a solution that addresses the       disproportionate growth of fire programs as a share of the       agency's overall budget.        Again, I thank you for the opportunity to provide this       statement. The Forest Service stands ready to continue       working with you on this important legislation.
