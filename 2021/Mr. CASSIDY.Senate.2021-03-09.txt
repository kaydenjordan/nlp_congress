 Mr. President, on March 15, 2021, having served  the Louisiana District United Pentecostal Church in the role of  district secretary, 1998-2005, and district superintendent, 2005- Present, Reverend Kevin Cox will retire from his current role, though  remaining active in ministry.   Kevin was born in St. Paul, MN--spent his early years in Missouri-- before moving to Bogalusa in 1974, when his father became pastor there.  He is a graduate of Southeastern Louisiana University, where he earned  a BS in accounting. In addition to his ministerial license, he holds  CPA credentials. He married the love of his life, Delisa, in 1979. She  passed away in the spring of 2012. Kevin and Delisa served as pastor in  Wewahitchka, FL, from 1980-1986 before returning to Bogalusa where they  joined Kevin's parents and assumed the pastorate of First Pentecostal  Church of Bogalusa for 12 years. With his election as district  secretary, the Cox Family--Kevin and Delisa, along with their two sons,  Andrew and Stephen--relocated to the Campground in Tioga.   As district superintendent, in addition to being responsible for the  oversight of the ministers and churches of Louisiana, Reverend Cox has  continued to coordinate the Louisiana United Pentecostal Camp Meeting.  This annual Camp Meeting event has convened for over 100 years here in  Louisiana and consists of a week of worship, fellowship, and fun. The  Bible speaks of laying up crowns in heaven as a reward for good works  on earth. I hope it is many years before Kevin Cox ascends to heaven.  When he does, he will have many crowns.                            ____________________
