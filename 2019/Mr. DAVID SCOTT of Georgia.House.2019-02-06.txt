 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  Children's Healthcare of Atlanta for their extraordinary work in  fighting sickle cell anemia disease, and providing comprehensive  medical care for thousands of our children in Georgia.  [[Page H1368]]    Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is the home of this Nation's largest  pediatric sickle cell disease program with more than 1,800 children and  teens. Georgia is home to over 8,000 people who have sickle cell  disease, one of the Nation's most impacted populations.   On this Thursday, February 7, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta will  be hosting a briefing at 1 p.m. right here in the Capitol in room HVC- 201 to discuss innovations in sickle cell disease treatment.   Madam Speaker, more than 100,000 Americans have and suffer from  sickle cell disease. It is a painful, genetic blood disorder that  prevents the children from getting air. It is debilitating.   Madam Speaker, I ask that we stand proudly and support the Children's  Healthcare of Atlanta.                            ____________________
