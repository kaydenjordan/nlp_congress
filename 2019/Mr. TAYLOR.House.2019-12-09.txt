 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas' Ninth  District for his work on this piece of legislation.   I rise in support of H.R. 4713, the Department of Homeland Security  Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Authorization Act.   Every day millions of Americans interact with officials and  representatives of the Department of Homeland Security, most frequently  at airports across this country. In fact, the Transportation Security  Administration screens approximately 2.2 million passengers every  single day. Last year, TSA screened over 813 million individuals.   With more than 240,000 dedicated DHS employees working hard every  single day--and I mean every single  [[Page H9376]]  day; they do not take a day off, the Department of Homeland Security-- they are keeping our Nation safe. While there is no doubt that this is  a massive undertaking, we must also work to ensure the civil rights and  liberties of every single American are upheld by the Department of  Homeland Security.    H.R. 4713, the bill before us today, safeguards the civil rights of  Americans by increasing accountability and transparency. Just as the  dedicated men and women who work to protect our homeland, ensuring the  constitutional rights of all Americans are protected is critically  important for us to maintain a free society.   Increasing transparency and accountability is not a partisan issue,  and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 4713.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise with my fellow Texan, Dr.  Burgess, to congratulate the Frisco Chamber of Commerce on earning a 5- star accreditation from the United States Chamber of Commerce.   Frisco is home to some of the most innovative and booming businesses  in Texas and throughout the entire country. Partnering with  approximately 1,300 member businesses who represent more than 75,000  employees, the Frisco Chamber of Commerce goes above and beyond to  provide the business community with a powerful voice through its  advocacy efforts and partnerships.   The Frisco Chamber of Commerce received the highest accreditation  awarded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as a result of their effective  organizational procedures and community involvement.   After earning this accreditation, the Frisco Chamber of Commerce is  now among the top 2 percent of chambers in the Nation to receive this  prestigious designation.   I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in  congratulating the Frisco Chamber of Commerce on this tremendous  achievement.                            ____________________
