 Mr. Speaker, as the gentlewoman from New Jersey  said, my colleagues and I will show and prove our true intentions in  occupying our seats here in Congress.   We will have the chance to stand with the 24 million Americans who  have health coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act or cosign  billion-dollar tax cuts to the wealthy. We will have the chance to  reject the attacks on the health of women and older Americans or force  Americans to pay more for less. We will have the chance to choose  between what is best for all or what is best for some. We will choose  between right and wrong.   Changes to the current law proposed in the un-American Health Care  Act, also known as TrumpCare, could result in cuts to benefits,  increased costs, or reduced coverage for older Americans.   According to the 2016 Medicare Trustees Report, the Medicare part A  trust fund is solvent until 2028. This is 11 years longer than  predicted in 2009, due in large part to the changes made in the ACA.   Repealing the additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on high-income  workers, as proposed in this new bill, would remove $117.3 billion from  the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund over the next 10 years. It would  hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish  Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.   Additionally, provisions of the un-American Health Care Act that  create a per capita cap financing structure in the Medicaid program is  equally dangerous. These provisions would endanger the health, safety,  and care of millions of individuals who depend on the essential  services provided through Medicaid.   The CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid funding by $880  billion over 2017 to 2026. Medicare and Medicaid must be protected and  strengthened for older Americans and future generations.   Any healthcare legislation presented must take into consideration  future generations of men and women who will take our seats in this  Chamber, future generations that will produce our first woman  President, future generations of women that hopefully will not have to  fight against men meddling in their healthcare decisions.   This bill is a war on women, and, quite frankly, there is nothing  pro-life about it. This bill attacks women's access to reproductive  health care from every angle, undermining not just contraception access  and abortion coverage, but also making it much harder for women to  receive maternity coverage when they do give birth.   The abortion rate is at a historic low, and most analysts say the  principal reason is that the ACA made contraception cheaper and easier  to obtain. The CBO report was all-encompassing, but most strikingly  pointed out a provision that would undermine Planned Parenthood, a  critical provider for women's health care.                                time  1615    This provision would bar women on Medicaid from using their coverage  to go to Planned Parenthood, immediately resulting in many of these  women losing access to contraception and leading to closing of clinics  nationwide.   The CBO estimated that 15 percent of women living in low-income and  otherwise underserved areas would lose their access to services to  prevent pregnancy. In short, local access to reproductive health care  dries up.   In short, this is unacceptable. Just as I opened, I am going to  close. Tomorrow my colleagues and I will show and prove our true  intentions in occupying our seats here in Congress. We will have the  chance to stand with the 24 million Americans who have healthcare  coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, or cosign billion-dollar  tax cuts to the wealthy as proposed under the Trump healthcare bill.   We will have the chance to reject the attacks on the health of women  and the working families or force Americans to pay far more for far  less, and we will have the chance to choose between what is best for  all or what is best for some. Tomorrow, with the votes cast on this  bill, we will get the chance to choose between right and wrong.
