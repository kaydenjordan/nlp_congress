 Mr. Speaker, as the first registered nurse  elected to Congress, I can attest to the importance of the Affordable  Care Act in improving our country's health care, especially for the 133  million Americans living with pre-existing conditions--of which 11.5  million live in my home state of Texas.   Today, we bring a resolution to the floor that reaffirms our support  of the Affordable Care Act and defends its protections. It is clear as  day that this president and his administration will stop at nothing to  tear down the very law that has expanded critical health care coverage  to millions of Americans.  [[Page H2968]]    I urge my Republican colleagues to join us to protect the health care  of all our constituents. We cannot stand silent when our health care  system is thrown into chaos.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
