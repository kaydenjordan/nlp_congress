 Madam President, I rise today to honor Eric Cioppa, the  superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance, who recently retired  after more than three decades of distinguished public service to the  State of Maine. Throughout his time at the bureau, Eric's leadership  and service have benefited all Mainers and have contributed to the  financial health of Mainers.   Eric joined the bureau in 1988 as a statistician before being named  supervisor of the workers' compensation section. I had the pleasure of  working directly with Eric when I was commissioner of the Maine  Department of Professional and Financial Regulation. In 1998, he was  promoted to deputy superintendent and was then appointed to the  position of superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance by Governor  Paul LePage in 2011, a position to which he was unanimously confirmed,  and then reconfirmed in 2017 to serve another 5-year term.   Throughout his service as superintendent, Eric's work has touched the  lives of nearly every citizen in Maine. His tireless commitment to  protecting insurance consumers, while also supporting ongoing  competition and innovation in Maine's insurance industry, will leave a  lasting positive impact on the State. Furthermore, numerous Governors  have benefited from Eric's guidance and expertise on a wide range of  insurance issues for decades, and his deep knowledge of Maine's  insurance industry will be missed by all policymakers.   Outside of Maine, Eric has been heavily involved in helping to set  national priorities and developing new laws and regulations through his  longtime service with the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners, NAIC. At NAIC, he has served as the association's  president, vice president, and secretary, among other positions.  Attributable to his stellar reputation, Eric was appointed by his peers  at NAIC to serve a 2-year term as the State insurance commissioner  representative on the Financial Stability Oversight Council in 2018 and  was reelected for another 2-year term in 2020.   Eric has also been an invaluable resource for me on insurance issues  going back to my time as commissioner of the Maine Department of  Professional and Financial Regulation. Throughout my service in the  Senate, Eric has continued to provide wise counsel and advice to both  me and my staff, and his wisdom and insight will be greatly missed.   Eric exemplifies the ideal public servant, and there is no doubt that  Mainers are better off because of his longtime dedication to protecting  and serving the public. I wish him and his family all the best as they  embark on their next chapter.                            ____________________
