 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer this amendment  to the underlying legislation, H.R. 729, the Coastal and Great Lakes  Communities Enhancement Act.   My amendment seeks to provide critical reforms to duplicative,  burdensome, and outdated policies that hamper energy exploration and  critical coastal restoration. To be clear, coastal restoration is vital  to deterring ecosystem degradation and fueling economic sustainability  for communities who call this southernmost part of Louisiana home.   The loss of our coastal areas presents an increased threat to safety  within residential communities, and it negatively impacts business  investments due to the difficulty in obtaining insurance.   Since the 1930s, Louisiana has suffered nearly 1,900 square miles of  land loss, and it is anticipated to lose an additional 4,000-plus,  unless Congress acts to loosen the regulations that have delayed  critical projects that bolster vulnerable habitats and communities.   Take my home State of Louisiana, for example, which has greatly  suffered from overreaching government regulation.   In March of 2017, the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana  announced the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion Project was going to be  delayed an additional 2 years due to permitting issues. This project is  considered the very cornerstone of the Coastal Protection and  Restoration Authority's 2017 Coastal Master Plan to mitigate flood  risks, restore and protect critical habitats, and ensure Congress is  not debating the issue 15 years after the region has been irreparably  lost and sunk into the Gulf of Mexico.   In addition, this amendment supports the national security interest  of the United States to ensure our men and women in uniform are able to  properly train for future missions.   In 2016, a Federal court of appeals revoked the U.S. Navy's  authorization to use sonar for critical national security training  because it conflicted with the rules and regulations under the MMPA. To  address these delays directly, my amendment simply makes commonsense  updates to the MMPA that help increase regulatory efficiency and remove  duplicative permitting requirements under Federal law.   For anyone to insinuate that this amendment will destroy protections  and result in wetland and species decline is simply untrue. In fact,  the reforms made by my amendment would further support coastal habitats  and species restoration, U.S. national security interest, and American  energy independence.   Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I really appreciate the  gentleman's zeal, but I want him to know the focus is on the right  thing. We are focused here on solving problems.   This is not the first time this legislation has been misunderstood or  even mischaracterized. As I stated previously, those who say that this  amendment would weaken the effectiveness of certain elements of the  Marine Mammal Protection Act resulting in industries involved with  offshore areas having unfettered access to conduct activities that are  detrimental to marine life is just absolutely not the case.   This amendment would roll back burdensome regulations on companies  seeking to do business in offshore areas, but it does it in a very safe  and responsible way. The current process is just too burdensome; it is  too time-consuming.   Though the MMPA includes statutory deadlines for Federal agencies  processing Incidental Harassment Authorization applications, industries  operating in offshore areas cite delays that lasts hundreds of days,  and that is just simply not acceptable.   Previously, the Government Accountability Office reported on this  exact issue. The GAO discovered that the National Marine Fishery  Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to meet basic tasks,  which included accurately recording application dates and timelines. In  addition, the GAO found that some IHA applications sat within these  agencies for years. In addition, ESA's list of species recovery efforts  have also been hampered or delayed by the current IHA process.   During a previous Water, Power and Ocean Subcommittee hearing on  marine mammal predation of ESA-listed salmon species in the Pacific  Northwest, the then-regional director of the Washington Department of  Fish and Wildlife testified that, ``the conditions associated with the  current requirements of Section 120 of the MMPA are challenging and  expensive to implement, limited in scope and legal challenges have  slowed the progress in reducing impacts to salmon.'' That is just one  species, as an example, but it illustrates the need for this amendment  to be adopted to H.R. 721.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), our distinguished  ranking member.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  a true Louisiana icon, Dr. C.O. Simpkins, Sr., a doctor, veteran,  distinguished public servant, and civil rights leader, who passed away  last week.   Doctor Simpkins, a proud native of Mansfield, Louisiana, leaves  behind a wonderful legacy of service to his fellow Louisianians: He  defended our Nation as a captain in the United States Air Force; he  treated our families as a beloved dentist; and he served honorably as a  member of the Louisiana House of Representatives.   Dr. Simpkins' greatest impact was unquestionably in the fight for  civil rights. He was a friend and contemporary of the Reverend Dr.  Martin Luther King; he was a founder of the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference; and he was a tireless advocate for freedom,  justice, and equality.   Today I am honored to join my colleagues from the Louisiana  delegation to introduce legislation to designate a U.S. Post Office in  Dr. Simpkins' name in his hometown of Mansfield. It is a small but  sincere gesture of appreciation for a good man whose legacy lives on in  our Nation, our State, and our communities.   Godspeed, Dr. Simpkins.                            ____________________     I truly thank my friend, Congressman Barr,  for hosting this Special Order. I applaud the sentiments that he just  shared. I associate myself with them and the conviction that he has. I  certainly share it, and I know so many of my colleagues, at least on  this side of the aisle, do as well.   In 1923, there was an average, middle-class family man named Roy Otis  Martin, who bought a rundown lumber mill in Alexandria, Louisiana. He  worked hard. He established it, he expanded it. He ultimately  transformed it into one of the largest economic generators for our  State.   This is what makes America great. This is true freedom. This is real  opportunity. And it is a story that has been repeated so many countless  times throughout our Nation's rich history. However, many Americans,  particularly our younger generation, seem to be losing hold of these  values.   There was a survey that just came out this past March; we all  lamented the findings: 49.6 percent--almost 50 percent--of millennials  and members of Generation Z responded to this poll and said that they  would, ``prefer living in a socialist country.'' It is shocking.   Just last month, there was another poll that came out. It found that  70 percent of millennials say they are likely to vote socialist; 15  percent of millennials think the world would be a better place if the  Soviet Union still existed. Only 57 percent of millennials believe the  Declaration of Independence better guarantees freedom and equality over  the Communist Manifesto. These are just shocking numbers, and they are  really frightening, because it is this mindset that is the antithesis  of everything that our Founders fought for.   What do we stand for in America? We stand for core American  principles, the principles of individual freedom and limited government  and the rule of law; things like peace through strength, fiscal  responsibility, free markets, and human dignity. And those are all of  the values that socialism steamrolls. Those are the ideals that this  country was founded on, and they have to remain the foundation for  everything we do because it is central to our identity.   Unfortunately, now more than ever, there is this false message that  has taken root, one that says government is better, that more  government is even greater. Most of those running for President in 2020  on the Democrat side of the aisle are promising free healthcare and  free education, and some are going as far as actually promising free  money to every American on a monthly basis for those who put their  trust in the government.    The problem is, the government was never intended to be our savior.  Our Founding Fathers built this Republic on strong convictions that  every American is entitled to individual freedom and they should never  be controlled or owned or dictated to by the government. In fact,  Thomas Jefferson said the following during his first inaugural address:   ``What more is necessary to make us happy and a prosperous people?  Still one thing more, fellow citizens--a wise and frugal government,  which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them  otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and  improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it  has earned.''   There are two competing visions for America today, and that is the  bottom line. The contrast is becoming ever more crystal clear. You  simply cannot be for individual freedom and liberty and also be for  socialism. Those are mutually exclusive pursuits. You simply can't have  both.   Socialism is the antithesis of everything we stand for in America,  beginning with our national motto, inscribed right there above the  Speaker's head.   Do you know that socialists sneer at the motto ``In God we trust?''  You know why? Because as social Democrat-turned Communist hero and  Soviet Union Premier, Vladimir Lenin, explained in 1905, this is what  he wrote: ``There is nothing more abominable than religion.'' Every  socialist is, as a rule, an atheist.   But now is the time for us to articulate with clarity, conviction,  and consistency exactly what our Founders stood for, what America is  for, who we are, and why we are exceptional.   I close by just thanking, again, the gentleman from Kentucky for  putting this Special Order together at such a critical hour in our  Nation's history.   And we will continue to fight wholeheartedly against socialism, so  that all Americans can have the same opportunity that our forefathers  had to turn lumber mills into legacies.
