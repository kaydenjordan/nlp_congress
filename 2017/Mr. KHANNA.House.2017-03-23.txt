 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership and  for yielding me the time.   When the President campaigned, he said he wanted more benefits, more  coverage, and lower premiums. Since he got to the White House, he said,  well, health care is complicated; and they have tried to create a bill  with the Republicans cobbling every special interest group and every  faction.   But the President knows it doesn't have to be complicated. He knows  the solution. In 2000, he wrote that the Canadian plan, single-payer  plan, helps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans. There  are fewer medical lawsuits, less loss of labor to sickness, and lower  cost to companies paying for medical care for their employees.   He wrote further that, ``We, as a Nation, need to reexamine the  single-payer plan;'' and he advocated for a single-payer plan.   Mr. President, what has changed?   You know what the solution is. If you are serious about health care,  work with people like Senator Sanders, Congressman Welch, and others,  and offer a real solution to the American people.
