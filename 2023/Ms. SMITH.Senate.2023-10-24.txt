 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Jessica Looman  to be Administrator for the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of  Labor. And I want my Senate colleagues to know a little bit about  Jessica, whom I have had the opportunity to know well and to work with  since 2011.   Jessica is from St. Paul, MN. She has worked as an attorney and  advocate, as a labor leader heading the Minnesota building trades, as a  public sector leader, and as a lifelong champion for workers. And in  all her roles, Jessica has earned the reputation for being thoughtful  and innovative and fair. She is respected for her skill leading large,  complex organizations and getting results and working productively with  diverse groups of people to find good solutions and common ground.   Before I was Minnesota's Senator and Lieutenant Governor, I served as  chief of staff for the Governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton. And when we  needed a leader who was trusted both by business and by labor to be a  leader at Minnesota's Department of Labor and Industry, we selected  Jessica, who served both as assistant commissioner and also as deputy  commissioner. And Jessica impressed me and everyone with her  leadership, her competence, and her commitment to fairly and diligently  enforcing the law.   She led Minnesota's efforts to ensure safe, fair, and healthy  workplaces and labor standards. And she led our effort to expand  apprenticeships. Jessica was respected by business and labor alike for  her commitment to establishing reasonable, effective workplace rules  and regulations.   A couple of years later, when we needed a strong leader to take on  Minnesota's Department of Commerce, Jessica was our first pick. In that  role, she again showed her skill as an executive leader, leading  successful statewide initiatives and growing Minnesota's clean energy  jobs. So I have no doubt that Jessica will be a fair and pragmatic  Administrator for the Wage and Hour Division, which is responsible for  enforcing some of our Nation's most important laws governing minimum  wage and overtime pay and child labor standards.   As Administrator, Jessica will have direct impact protecting the  interest of hard-working Americans, like the waitress whose boss is  stealing her tips, or the building trades' carpenter or laborer who has  the right to earn the prevailing wage on Federal projects so that they  can support their families, or the worker who isn't being paid for the  overtime hours that they have worked. Ms. Looman's values are rooted in  fairness and the promise that all work has dignity and should be  respected.   One of the things that I have learned in my time in public service is  that, if you understand both sides of an argument and you really  listen, you can usually find a solution that works. Jessica exemplifies  this approach. In all of the years that I have worked closely with her,  she always approaches issues with that keen desire to understand what  both sides need and what they want and then to find a solution that  both sides can agree is fair.   And let us be honest, sometimes regulations can seem subjective and  hard to understand. And Jessica gets this, and so she is always looking  for a path that is reasonable, that protects people's rights, and that  follows the law but that is reasonable. I think that this is why she is  respected both by employers and by labor, first in Minnesota and now at  the U.S. Department of Labor, and it is why she will make a strong,  respected, and trusted Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division.   I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation. Her reputation as a  respected, effective leader has been built over years of hard work,  fighting for working people, and she has a track record of successfully  building coalitions and consensus, even when there are real and  difficult challenges to bridge.
