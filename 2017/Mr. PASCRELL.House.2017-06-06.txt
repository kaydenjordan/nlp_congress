 Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of H. Res. 354, I  rise today in strong support passing this legislation to condemn the  reprehensible attacks outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence on May  16.   I am a proud member of the Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish  Americans. New Jersey's Ninth District, and particularly my hometown of  Paterson, has a large and thriving Turkish-American community and I  cherish our close relationship. However, what happened last month was  beyond the pale. The brutal attacks on peaceful protesters are an  affront to our American values and core democratic freedoms of free  speech and peaceful assembly.   One of the individuals attacked by President Erdogan's thugs was a  constituent of mine from East Rutherford. As a college student, Ceren  Borazan bravely joined her friends to peacefully protest President  Erdogan's policies in Washington D.C.   Since President Erdogan has taken office, Turkey has cracked down on  freedom of expression, raided media outlets, and jailed judges,  journalists, and civil servants in violation of democratic norms.   Outside the embassy Ceren was thrown to the ground and kicked by the  Turkish security guards. During the attack a blood vessel in her eye  burst and weeks later she is still reminded of the trauma by nightmares  and fears of retribution. While freedom of speech and freedom to  protest may be prohibited in Turkey, they are bedrock U.S. principles  that must be safeguarded. Violence is never an appropriate response to  free speech.   To ensure such an incident never happens again on our soil, those  involved in carrying out this attack must be brought to justice. They  must be denied diplomatic immunity and prosecuted to the fullest extent  of U.S. law. Mr. Speaker, we must pass H. Res. 354 today to call  attention to these attacks and to ensure justice is carried out for  people like Ceren.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an editorial from The  Star-Ledger titled ``Trump won't denounce American thuggery. Will he  punish Turkey?''       Trump Won't Denounce American Thuggery. Will He Punish Turkey?                      (By Star-Ledger Editorial Board)         Time to take stock of our rights of free speech and       peaceful protest in this country, and what--if anything--      President Trump has done to protect them.        He's been noticeably silent on the brutal beating of       peaceful protesters in Washington, D.C. by the Turkish       President's thuggish bodyguards, on public property, right in       front of our own police, fully caught on video.        The violence was completely unprovoked, and happened       shortly after Trump welcomed Turkish President Recep Tayyip       Erdogan to the Oval Office. Among others, a young woman from       East Rutherford, Ceren Borazan, was put into a headlock and       choked--popping a blood vessel in her eye--by a man who       threatened to kill her.        This is common practice in Turkey--which is why Trump needs       to make it clear that it isn't acceptable here.        But perhaps the real problem is that it is increasingly       acceptable here. Not just verbal and physical attacks against       peaceful protesters, but against journalists, whom Trump has       called ``the enemy of the people.''        In the past month alone, reporters have been arrested,       slapped, pinned against a wall and choked for trying to do       their jobs; most recently by newly-elected Montana       congressman Greg Gianforte, accused of body-slamming a       journalist.        He's faced no real consequences. ``Elections are about       choices and Montanans made their choice,'' Speaker Paul Ryan       said Friday. Trump, who had lavished praise on Gianforte--``a       wonderful guy''--added: ``Great win in Montana.''        Perhaps this is why the former Breitbart News reporter       Michelle Fields, who was grabbed roughly by Corey Lewandowski       last year when she tried to ask Trump a question, said some       Republicans ``have put party over civility.''        The casualty isn't just civility. Trump's hostility toward       the press--like his attempt to use the FBI to muzzle       journalists--has led  [[Page H4632]]       Reporters Without Borders to lower America's ranking on press       freedom, measured by government restrictions and threats       against the news media.        We're now ranked right below Burkina Faso, one of the       world's poorest countries.        This failure to speak up for peaceful protesters and       journalists began at Trump's rallies, where his supporters       threatened and committed actual violence against them. Since       then, the United Nations has warned that the basic principle       of peaceful protest is under attack in the United States. At       least 19 states have introduced measures that would       criminalize such protests.        The very least the President can do is make some sort of       distinction between what is tolerated here and in Turkey.       Yes, it's a NATO ally, and we have a complex relationship.       But this is about protecting the freedom of speech and       assembly, and basic rules of law in our own country.        The New York Times has publicly identified the culprits,       and New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell is among those leading the       bipartisan charge to hold them accountable. If we can't get       to the thugs in Turkey, then the Trump administration should       hold the diplomats here to account.        Think about the message it sends if the Turkish government       escapes this without so much as a slap on the wrist. A truly       populist President, a defender of American freedoms, would       stick up for the people--not the jack-booted thugs.
