 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member. I rise today to  oppose H.R. 10, a dangerous assault on American consumers that would  gut the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act.   If the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act is allowed to be inflicted on working  families, the reckless financial speculators who sold out the American  people on Wall Street would be given a free pass to perpetrate future  financial abuses that will reap billions for them and rob average  Americans of their financial security again.   The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act would take us back to the pre-2008 era of  unchecked reckless financial abuses that resulted in the worst  recession since the Great Depression.   Let me remind Members of the crushing cost of that national economic  emergency: over 8 million jobs lost, 10 percent unemployment, 7 million  home foreclosures, and trillions of dollars of personal institutional  wealth wiped out.   No proponent of this bill can look the American people in the face  and tell them that this is better for consumers, because it is not.
