 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a great  Mississippian. Billy Mounger helped shape the landscape of State and  national politics.   He helped build the Mississippi Republican Party from an almost  nonexistent political group to a party with a supermajority in the  State legislature that holds all statewide elected positions and five  out of six of Mississippi's seats in the United States House and United  States Senate.   He also served as Mississippi's chairman at the 1976 Republican  convention for someone who would later become one of the greatest  Presidents in our lifetime: Ronald Reagan.   Billy Mounger's dedication extended beyond politics, as he led in a  variety of community interests. From the United States Military  academies and his alma mater of West Point to the International Ballet  Competition, he excelled in building institutions to serve the people  around him.   Our State and our Nation will benefit for generations to come, thanks  to the life well lived by Billy Mounger.                            ____________________
