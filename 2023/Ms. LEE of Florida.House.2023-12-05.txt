 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  American Confidence in Elections Act, the most transformative election  integrity bill to be considered in the House in decades.   Over the summer, the American Confidence in Elections Act, or ACE  Act, passed out of the Committee on House Administration.   The ACE Act equips States with election integrity tools, implements  key reforms in D.C., and protects political speech.   In examining history, precedent, the Framers' words, debates  concerning ratification, the Supreme Court, and our Constitution, we  know the division of power between States and the Federal Government  provides Congress with a limited oversight of Federal elections.   With this responsibility, we created the American Confidence in  Elections Act to help ensure that States are best equipped with the  tools they need to perform successful election administration.   As Florida's former secretary of state, I oversaw elections as our  State's chief election official.  [[Page H6115]]    I know firsthand just how important efficient and effective election  administration measures are in ensuring that Americans continue to cast  their ballots and participate in our democracy.   As chair of the House Administration Subcommittee on Elections, one  of my top priorities is to share insight into the policies that lead to  stronger elections across our Nation.   This is exactly what the ACE Act will do.   My colleagues and I have worked in collaboration with secretaries of  state, local election officials, legislators, and voters across the  Nation to craft this legislation--in true ``by the people, for the  people'' fashion.   Our ACE Act leaves the primary responsibility for administering  elections to the States while recognizing the important role that  Congress plays as a resource and a partner.   Election officials have a saying: Elections are partisan. Election  administration is not.   The American Confidence in Elections Act is a strictly commonsense  measure that protects our voting processes and makes it easier to vote  and harder to cheat.   Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of Americans agree that only Americans should  vote in American elections. A majority of Americans support photo voter  ID provisions.   The ACE Act encourages States to adopt strong voter ID laws and  provides best practices and technology standards to ensure that every  State in our Nation has the tools needed to conduct secure and  efficient elections.   I look forward to bringing this commonsense election integrity  measure forward to both strengthen and safeguard our elections.   I thank Chairman Steil for his leadership on this bill, and I look  forward to seeing it brought to the House floor for final passage.                            ____________________
