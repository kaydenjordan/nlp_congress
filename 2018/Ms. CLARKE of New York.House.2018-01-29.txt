 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the  gentleman from Georgia, for anchoring this very important Special Order  this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in solidarity with my colleagues in this very  important  [[Page H664]]  discussion about fair share fees for union workers.                                time  2045    In 1977, the Supreme Court, in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,  decided that fair share fees were constitutional, full stop. This  decision allowed unions to be paid fair share fees by nonunion members  in order to negotiate on their behalf.   Fair share fees have become increasingly significant and important,  as unions continue to fight for worker protections in the workplace.   Now, 40 years later, the Supreme Court is poised to hear this issue  yet again in Janus v. AFSCME.   So what has changed? What has changed?   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned that this is yet another attempt  to put big business above working people and weaken organized labor as  effective representatives for the working class.   I, therefore, ask the Court to be thoughtful. I ask that they think  of the consequences that will follow by reversing this law. I ask the  Court not to be used as pawns by the Republican conservatives,  millionaires and billionaires, to weaken organized labor and unions of  the 21st century.   If it were not for organized labor, many of us would not be standing  here representing our constituents today. My mother was a member of DC  37, a part of AFSCME, and it was through her labor union, her local,  that she was able to put money aside for my brother and me to go to  college, to make sure that our healthcare was taken care of.   And here we are in the wealthiest Nation in the world where  millionaires and billionaires are lining their pockets with profits,  and, at the same time, we have workers who are before the Supreme Court  just seeking dignity to be organized through labor and labor unions.   This is a time for all Americans to remember their roots. Organized  labor is part of the bedrock of this Nation. It is my hope that the  Supreme Court will remember that in their deliberations.
