 Mr. President, I understand there are three bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, later today, I will join President  Trump, the Democratic leader, the new Speaker of the House, and our  congressional colleagues down at the White House.   The meeting represents the latest in the President's ongoing efforts  to persuade Democrats that appropriate funding for border security is a  better outcome than persisting in this partial government shutdown. I  hope that this time around my friends across the aisle will come  prepared to engage much more seriously on the issue at hand.   We may have entered a new Congress since our last meeting, but the  basic steps that are needed to end this unfortunate standoff really  haven't changed at all. We are in the same place. As I have said on  several occasions and as the administration has affirmed, any viable  compromise will need to carry the endorsement of the President before  it receives a vote in either House of Congress. Under these conditions,  the package presented by the House's new Democratic leaders yesterday  can only be seen as a time-wasting act of political posturing. It does  not carry the support of the President--in fact, the administration  indicated yesterday that the President would actually veto it--and it  cannot earn the support of 60 of my colleagues over here in the Senate.   My friends across the aisle understand the ground rules perfectly  well. They know that a solution will need to be palatable to House  Democrats and Senate Republicans alike. They know that making laws  takes a Presidential signature. We all learned that in grade school. In  fact, the Democratic leader himself insisted ``the President must  publicly support and say he will sign an agreement before it gets a  vote in either Chamber.'' That is the Democratic leader who said that.   Everyone understands what we need to move forward and successfully  make policy instead of simply staging political theater. Everyone  should understand just how urgently the situation on our Nation's  border demands our attention--the situation that has been accurately  described by the Commissioner of the CBP--the Border Patrol--as a  ``border security and humanitarian crisis.'' This shouldn't be taken  lightly. It should not be viewed as an opportunity for the new House  Democratic majority to prioritize political performance as an art form  ahead of the public interest.   I urge our Democratic colleagues to approach our meeting today with a  willingness to join the administration and the men and women of Customs  and Border Protection to work to protect our border and bring this  partial shutdown to an end.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, while these  discussions continue, the Senate will also be taking up other important  work.   Yesterday, the senior Senator from Florida introduced a package of  four bills that pertain to U.S. policy in the Middle East. I am a proud  cosponsor of  [[Page S26]]  this legislation, along with the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee to be, Senator Risch, and Senator Gardner. It speaks directly  to some critical American interests in that part of the world--our  security cooperation with key partners, Israel and Jordan, and the  ongoing humanitarian and security catastrophe of the Syrian civil war.   First, this legislation recognizes the growing threat Iran, Syria,  Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups pose to the State of  Israel, and it aims to strengthen key elements of our relationship with  our closest partner in the Middle East.   It affirms that the United States needs to ``walk the walk,'' and it  authorizes military assistance, cooperative missile defense, as well as  loan guarantees.   It encourages closer U.S.-Israel technological cooperation to better  address 21st century threats, and it clearly states that it is official  U.S. policy to help Israel preserve its qualitative military edge over  those who might wish it harm.   The legislation also recognizes the security, economic, and  humanitarian challenges the ongoing conflict in Syria poses to the  people and Government of Jordan, and it reauthorizes important  legislation aimed at deepening our defense cooperation with this  important regional partner.   In addition, the bill contains a bipartisan provision from Senators  Rubio and Manchin to combat the BDS movement, an aggressive and hostile  attempt to delegitimize and economically boycott the State of Israel.   This legislation gives State and local governments across America  more flexibility to limit their own business relationships with  entities that support this horrible effort to hurt our ally. In effect,  this provision allows jurisdictions to boycott the boycotters--let me  say that again: ``to boycott the boycotters''--and make sure they don't  send taxpayer dollars to companies that embrace this anti-Israel  posture.   Now, with respect to the ongoing conflict in Syria, there are,  certainly, differing views about the role of the U.S. military with  respect to threats emanating from Syria. There is no question that we  continue to face serious challenges from al-Qaida and ISIS in Syria, as  well as from Iran, Russia, and the Assad regime itself, and I  anticipate this body will debate U.S. military strategy toward Syria in  the coming weeks, as it conducts oversight over the administration's,  apparently, ongoing review of its Syria policies.   Admittedly, there are no easy solutions in Syria. I hope the  administration and Congress will be deliberate and sober as we consider  the risks of various approaches to the endgame of the fight against the  physical caliphate of ISIS. After all, American lives, critical  national security interests, and the future of a turbulent yet critical  region are all at stake. The debate is forthcoming. I imagine it could  be contentious.   There should be little debate, however, about the Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act, which has overwhelming bipartisan support and  the endorsement of the administration.   This bill, which is included in this package, speaks to the human  tragedy of the Syrian civil war. It provides nonmilitary tools for  responding to the atrocities conducted by the regime of Bashar al- Assad. It will hold accountable those responsible for the torture and  murder of countless Syrian civilians and provide more leverage for  diplomats to end the conflict through peaceful negotiations that are  consistent with the demands of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254.   Unless the Syrian regime changes course, ends its brutality against  the Syrian people, and negotiates a peaceful end to the civil war, the  butchers of Damascus will find their key financial institutions and  industries sanctioned by the United States.   This bill will not bring back the hundreds of thousands of Syrians  who have been murdered or tortured by the regime, but it will be  another arrow in the quiver of diplomats who are seeking to end this  awful war and stabilize a region of critical importance to the United  States and its allies. So I am proud to cosponsor the package of  legislation that Senator Rubio introduced yesterday.   I am clearing the way for the bill, S. 1, to be debated and voted on  here on the Senate floor as early as next week, and I look forward to  voting to pass this important bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 28         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(5) On February 3, 2015, the United States signed a 3-year       memorandum of understanding with Jordan, pledging to provide       the kingdom with $1,000,000,000 annually in United States       foreign assistance, subject to the approval of Congress.
