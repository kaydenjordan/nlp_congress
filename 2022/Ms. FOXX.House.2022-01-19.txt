 Madam Speaker, Washington Democrats have become desperate  to shield their slim majorities in the House and Senate; so desperate,  in fact, that they are willing to silence millions of Americans by  orchestrating a Federal takeover of elections.   Look no further than H.R. 1 and H.R. 4. These pieces of legislation  are the ones Americans should be concerned about.                                time  1030    Madam Speaker, all Washington Democrats have done is operate off  their own manufactured hysteria.   Thanks to ranking member Rodney Davis of the Committee on House  Administration, we have the facts on why the Democrats' narrative is  wrong.   2020 saw the highest voter turnout in 120 years, and according to  Pew, 94 percent said it is easy to vote. There is clearly no widespread  ``voter suppression'' issue in this country.   Georgia's new ``voter suppression law'' has more days of early in- person voting than New York.   Texas' ``voter suppression law'' ends pandemic exceptions like  universal drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting. Neither existed in  Texas before 2020. Neither widely exists even in blue States.   When it comes to abolishing the filibuster, there are even more  facts.   The filibuster prevents Federal laws swinging wildly with every  election.   If the filibuster is taken away, millions of citizens and entire  States would be silenced.   Senator Schumer's push is not a response to the 2020 election or new  State laws.   As early as 2019 and August 2020, Senator Schumer was already  discussing abolishing the filibuster, but only if he won control.   If the filibuster is wiped clean off the map, imagine what will be  done next: Packing the Supreme Court; ramming through the Green New  Deal; defunding the police, and every other misguided item that  Washington Democrats have in their political playbook.   The consequences would be disastrous for America.   Madam Speaker, Americans do not want the one-party rule agenda of  Washington Democrats, the anniversary of which is tomorrow.   They do not want to see their own country become even more bankrupted  by the failed policies under this administration and razor-thin  majority.   Republicans will continue to stand firm against this far-left agenda,  and we will not sit on the sidelines.   It is vital that Americans know what these election bills will do and  the consequences that will affect this great country if they are  passed.   Thank you again to Ranking Member Rodney Davis and his staff for  their continued hard work and diligence on this issue.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for a year, the Biden administration has  struck out on every jobs report.   If this were a baseball game, this administration would have been  benched long ago.   Economists predicted that 450,000 new jobs would be added in the  month of December.   But what was the result? A dismal 199,000 jobs were added, the worst  report of Joe Biden's Presidency.   Mr. Speaker, with these kinds of numbers, America's economy and  workforce will never recover.   No matter how this administration spins these failures, one thing is  abundantly clear: You cannot swing, miss, and then claim you have hit a  home run.                            ____________________
