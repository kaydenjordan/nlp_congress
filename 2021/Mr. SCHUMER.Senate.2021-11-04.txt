 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Democrats are closer than we have ever  been to finalizing and passing legislation to achieve President Biden's  Build Back Better agenda. We have made great progress since the  President announced his framework last week, including by coming to an  agreement that will, for the first time ever, empower Medicare to  directly negotiate prices in Part B and Part D and lower prices for  millions of seniors and American families.    We will also cap out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000 a year, and our  agreement will make it so Americans with diabetes don't pay more than  $35 per month on insulin. One of the great confounding mysteries over  the last several years is, how did insulin--a drug that has been on the  market for years and years and years; there is no patent--end up  costing $600 a dose for people who can barely afford it? Diabetes  affects so many people, and yet they have to pay all of this money.   So, as the House prepares to move forward, the Senate continues to  achieve progress in our goal of passing Build Back Better before  Thanksgiving. That is our goal. We are moving forward because the  challenges American families and workers are facing are enormous, and  President Biden's agenda has many things that will lower costs and help  families pay the bills--lower costs and help families pay the bills.   Take childcare, for instance. Families sometimes pay more than  $10,000 a year for a child just to take care of him--a truly  backbreaking expense. Secretary Yellen warned that the slack  [[Page S7766]]  in the labor force is connected to childcare. Well, the President's  framework provides the largest investments ever to help families afford  childcare services.   I believe, of the 37 OECD nations, developed and semideveloped  countries, we are the 36th in childcare. Once Build Back Better passes,  that awful statistic will be gone.   Take pre-K. The President's framework will, for the first time ever,  provide universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. Millions of kids will  be able to get on the right track early in life because of this  investment--long overdue.   We will also extend the child tax credit. This will help millions of  parents better afford things like groceries and diapers and utilities  and other daily essentials.   Of course, there are bold steps we are taking to fight climate  change. Our country has had too many homes destroyed by hurricanes and  flooding. Entire cities in the West are breathing toxic air caused by  extreme wildfires. Heat waves and droughts endanger millions of  Americans who make their living working outdoors or who don't have air- conditioning.   These disasters cost us tens of billions each year, so Build Back  Better's investments will help us reach our climate goals and represent  bold steps in the right direction. All the while, the President's plan  will be fully paid for and help our country reduce inflationary  pressures, as no less than 17 Nobel Prize-winning economists have  affirmed.   We are going to keep pushing to get these great policies over the  finish line. As we have said repeatedly, nobody is getting everything  they hoped for in the final deal, but Build Back Better will have  things that everyone wanted.   Passing transformative legislation isn't easy--it is hard, very  hard--but the long hours we are putting in and the discussions we have  had, some of them quite pointed, will be worth it when we produce a  very good result for the American people. So we are going to keep  working and keep working until we get this done.                                Voting Rights    Now, Madam President, on voting, yesterday was a sad day because, for  the fourth time this year, the Senate had an opportunity yesterday to  begin debating on the right to vote, but, yet again, virtually every  Senate Republican denied the Senate a chance to act as the world's  greatest deliberative body. They filibustered the mere opportunity to  debate an issue that has had a long bipartisan history in the Senate.   There was one bright note--one brave, courageous exception--and I  want to thank my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, for  voting in favor of beginning debate on the John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act. I thank my Democratic colleagues--there are so many-- particularly Senators Leahy and Durbin, for spending weeks working with  her to find a compromise.   Senate Democrats want to find a bipartisan way forward on the issue  of voting rights. That is why we worked with Senator Murkowski. But,  ultimately, it is up to Republicans to come to the table and join us.  We have been trying to convince them for months--for months. This has  not been a rush. We have offered four reasonable proposals in an  attempt to merely begin debate--in June, in August, in October, and now  here in November.   At no point did we call on Republicans to support our policies only  but just agree to deliberate, to say what you think, and maybe we could  have come to an agreement on something so important, as the Senate has  always done in the past on this issue--bipartisan.   Off the floor, we held public hearings, numerous group discussions,  and countless one-on-one meetings with the other side, including talks  led by no fewer than seven Democrats--Manchin, Kaine, Tester, King,  Durbin, Klobuchar, Leahy--and there were more, I am sure. At virtually  every turn, we have met with resistance.   What has happened to the party of Lincoln? What has happened to that  noble, noble view that voting rights are important on both sides of the  aisle?   The Senate is capable of far more than what we have seen from our  Republican colleagues on voting rights. Throughout our history, our  predecessors used regular order to debate and compromise and to pass  transformative legislation--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the  Civil Rights Act, and, of course, the Voting Rights Act--but anyone who  has served in this Chamber over recent years knows that the gears of  the Senate have become stiff and slow to turn.   Who thinks that the original Social Security Act would have passed in  this partisan Chamber today--or any New Deal legislation? If we were  trying to create Medicare from scratch in 2021, who thinks that it  would have survived a filibuster? The same Chamber responsible for  those great, noble accomplishments in the past must be restored so it  can take action in the modern era.   As I said a few weeks ago, I believe the Senate needs to be restored  to its rightful status as the world's greatest deliberative body.  Debate is central to this Chamber's character, but so is governing and  so is taking action when required after debate has run its due course.  The fight is far from over. Democrats will explore alternative paths to  restore the Senate so it does what its Framers intended--debate,  deliberate, compromise, and vote.   Just because Republicans will not join us to defend our democracy  doesn't mean Democrats will stop fighting. It is too important. Even if  it means going at it alone, we will continue to fight for voting rights  and find an alternative path forward to get the Senate working again to  protect our fundamental liberties as citizens.                                 Nominations    Now, Madam President, on nominations, today, the Senate is going to  confirm Mr. Robert Santos to serve as the Director of the Census  Bureau.   A native of San Antonio, who grew up in a Mexican-American family,  Mr. Santos, in his 40-year career, has become one of the top  statisticians in the country. If confirmed, Santos would be the first  Hispanic and, in fact, the first person of color to become a permanent  Director of the Census Bureau. He is exactly the kind of person our  country needs overseeing our census--impartial, highly experienced,  someone from outside politics. We must and need to protect our census  from the pressures of partisan politics, and Santos is the perfect fit.   President Trump--true to form--spent years trying to politicize and  weaponize our country's census, going as far as maliciously trying to  include citizenship questions and have counts of undocumented  immigrants. Mr. Santos will restore trust and integrity to one of the  most important Agencies in government.   On Mr. Syed--of course, there are too many other qualified and  uncontroversial nominees who are still awaiting their confirmations  because of shameful Republican delay. Mr. Dilawar Syed is a  particularly egregious example. Syed has been nominated to serve as  second in command at the SBA. He is the definition--the definition--of  a qualified, uncontroversial nominee. His nomination has been praised  by no less than the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--hardly a liberal crowd-- and he would be the highest ranking Muslim in our government.   But our Republican colleagues on the Small Business and  Entrepreneurship Committee have not just blocked his vote, they have  even refused to give him a markup. Their justification keeps changing  from one explanation to another, which is another way of saying there  seems to be zero legitimate grounds for opposing him. Today, he has  been scheduled to have a markup, but because of Republicans, it has  been pushed back again on account of their ridiculous concerns.   The political right seems to relish in trying to score political  points by connecting far too many of President Biden's nominees--many  of whom happen to be individuals of color--to hot button, partisan  issues whether or not they have any relevance.   It is shameful, unacceptable, and ridiculous for Republicans to keep  stalling on Syed's nomination. He is eminently qualified to serve in  the SBA. Why are Senate Republicans opposing Mr. Syed's nomination? Let  me ask the question again. Why are Senate Republicans opposing Mr.  Syed's nomination?   I urge my colleagues to drop their resistance and allow this  excellent, straightforward nominee to receive confirmation.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S7767]]    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 401.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 345.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 463.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  [[Page S7778]]  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, November 4, be  waived.    I yield the floor.
