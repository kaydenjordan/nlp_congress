 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I will start:   ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect  Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the  common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings  of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.''
