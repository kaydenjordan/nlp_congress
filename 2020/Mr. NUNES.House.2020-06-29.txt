 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1425.   Per usual, this is a partisan bill that will go nowhere in the Senate  and the President will not sign into law.   Among the various problems in this bill is the Democrats' insistence  on including provisions which will prevent scientists from finding new  cures--at a time when our Nation is working to overcome the  coronavirus.   According to the California Life Sciences Association, if this bill  passes, 88 percent of new drugs in the pipeline will be discontinued.  That is hundreds of diseases that will not be cured and countless lives  that will be lost. That is not something that I can support.   Rather than engineer a government takeover of the prescription drug  industry, we can work together to provide lower prices for families,  and we can do it without reducing cures. But this bill we have before  us today is not the answer.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1425.
