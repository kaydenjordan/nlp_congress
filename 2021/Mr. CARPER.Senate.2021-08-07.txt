 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks this morning.    Mr. President, well, soon we are going to vote on  cloture, and we will move toward, I hope, concluding our consideration  of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   I have spoken, as our Presiding Officer knows, over the last few days  quite a bit as to why the legislation we are considering today is so  important.   I think that as we prepare to take this vote, though, we ought to  take maybe just another minute or two and reflect on the bill's merits  and the needs that it will address--important needs it will address-- for our country.   In my opening statement, several days ago, I reminded the Senate that  the state of our Nation's infrastructure currently ranks and rates at a  C-minus according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. That is  not the infrastructure that the American people want or need in the  21st century.   In the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee,  which Senator Capito and I are privileged to lead and which the  Presiding Officer is a new member of, this bill includes language that  will make historic investments in our roads, our highways, and our  bridges--a 34 percent increase, if you will, over the last 5 years. The  bill will also reauthorize our drinking water and our water sanitation  programs at robust new levels.   As we take this vote, I think it is important to reflect on our past  efforts. I want to go back in time and why this vote is so important  today.   Since I first joined the Congress as a brandnew freshman Congressman  from Delaware in 1982, we have updated our transportation laws in this  country some eight times--eight times. With each of these efforts we  have tried to improve our policies, address gaps, incorporate new  information, and deliver needed resources.   The modern era of these transportation laws began in 1991. George  Herbert Walker Bush was the President, and Congress passed and then  President Bush signed into law legislation called the Intermodal  Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA, as it was called at  the time--ISTEA.   Until ISTEA legislation was adopted--enacted and signed into law--as  a matter of Federal policy, we divided transportation into separate  systems. We had, on the one hand, highways; another hand we had rail;  another hand we had transit, and our policies really didn't consider  them as a united, unified, integrated system, which is how most  commuters and most travelers in our Nation really thought it to be.   ISTEA sought to change that. ISTEA sought to change that by requiring  integrated regional planning of transportation systems that accounted  for and better facilitated connections amongst our highways, our rail,  and our transit to enable more efficient freight movement and more  efficient movement of people.   It was around the same time that we also integrated our  transportation policy with the Clean Water Act, which represented a  major strengthening of our pollution laws to respond to urban smog,  acid rain, ozone depletion, and other air pollution problems.   For the first time, transportation planning was obliged to take into  account pollution from mobile sources and take steps to reduce the  considerable contribution of transportation to our pollution.   Today's legislation substantially builds on our historic efforts to  reduce dangerous emissions like greenhouse gases and particulate matter  that spew from too many of our cars, our buses, and other modes of  transportation.   Congress took another major leap in transportation policy a few years  later, in 1998, in fact, with the Transportation Equity Act for the  21st Century, also known as TEA-21, which focused on improving safety  while advancing America's economic growth and competitiveness.   Nearly 10 years later, in 2005, as transportation fatalities reached  a 10-year high of over 43,000 people--over 43,000 people--President  George W. Bush, son of Herbert Walker Bush, signed into law the Safe,  Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy  for Users. That is a long title, but we found an acronym for it,  SAFETEA-LU, in 2005.   At its core, the key was that this legislation improved highway  transportation safety through the creation of the Highway Safety  Improvement Program to reduce highway fatalities.   Then, in 2012, President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for  Progress in the 21st Century Act, known as MAP-21. Responding to  concerns about the growth of the number of small programs, MAP-21  sought to simplify the highway program structure, provide more  flexibility to States, while also increasing their accountability and  focusing on performance outcomes, including safety, asset conditions,  congestion, and air quality.   Congress reauthorized our transportation laws most recently in 2015,  when President Obama signed into law the Fixing America's Surface  Transportation Act, or FAST.   The FAST Act focused on freight movement, supported with new formula  and competitive grants for highway and intermodal freight, as well as a  focus on Federal and State freight planning efforts.   Today, our Interstate System is a critical national asset, carrying  over a quarter of all motor vehicle travel in our Nation--over one- quarter--despite being only 1 percent of all lane miles.   These highways have enabled a significant expansion of truck  movement, including supporting local businesses, interstate commerce,  international trade, and providing Americans with access to low-cost  goods and services.   Along with the many benefits of interstate highways have come  indisputable costs. Highways have spawned sprawling auto-dependent and  development patterns that exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions, thus  compromising our efforts to deal with a changing climate.   Interstate highways divided communities and were often intentionally  built through minority and low-income neighborhoods, becoming tangible  evidence of racism. Today, more than 36,000 people lose their lives  each year on our roadways. While we seek to maintain the mobility  benefits of the Federal-aid highway system, we must also acknowledge  and address these significant detriments.   We have been at the hard work of transportation policy for a long,  long time in this country, and we have enjoyed major success,  benefiting our people and our economy. And if we are honest with  ourselves, we have made quite a few mistakes along the way, dividing  communities with poorly considered projects and developing a  transportation sector that produces twice as much greenhouse gas  emissions as any other country's transportation sector.   We have an opportunity to learn from both success and failure, and we  must account for new challenges that were not on our radar screen in  the past--not the least of which are the serious threat of climate  change and the obvious specter of environmental injustice.   Today, we are rising to the challenge. The bill before us, the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, includes, among other  provisions, the largest Federal investment in public transit in  history; the largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure in history; the largest investment in clean energy  transmission in history; the largest investment in climate resiliency  in history; and the largest investment in transportation  electrification in history.   Infrastructure policy is a little bit like an aircraft carrier. The  Presiding Officer, who just left the podium, retired as a Navy Captain,  and so did I. He and I both spent a lot of time in airplanes, and he  spent a fair amount of time in outer space as an astronaut. But we have  both spent some time on aircraft carriers, and we know you can't turn  an aircraft carrier on a dime. With the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act, as we say in the Navy, we are ``coming hard about.'' Coming  hard about. The carrier is turning. We are finally recognizing climate  change and addressing it. We are  [[Page S5997]]  recognizing some of the mistakes of infrastructure policy in the past  and fixing them.   Before I call for us to invoke cloture, I am channeling today, of all  people, Winston Churchill. I love Churchill. I know he is quoted by a  lot of my colleagues as well. One of my favorite quotes from Winston  Churchill is, ``The further back we look, the further forward we see.''  Another one I especially like from Churchill is, ``You can always count  on America to do the right thing in the end after trying everything  else.''   It would seem, as we have gone through this legislative process, that  we have tried just about everything else. We had a lot of surprisingly  good debate here on this floor. Senator Capito, my colleague and  partner in the Environment and Public Works Committee, has done a great  job. But we have seen a lot of amendments offered--over 20--to this  bill. I think most of them were bipartisan. A bunch of them have been  adopted.   The other thing I would just offer from Churchill is another one of  my favorites:         Democracy is the worst form of government devised by the       wit of man . . .        Democracy is the worst form of government devised by the       wit of man . . .    This is a hard way to go, and we have learned that again as we have  gone through this process. As we prepare to maybe, hopefully, invoke  cloture, I again want to say how much I have enjoyed working with my  ranking member, Senator Capito--two West Virginians who found common  ground on these issues and worked hard to lead our team and a lot of  other committees of jurisdiction. Another one of them was led by  another West Virginian, Joe Manchin. I want to thank all those  committees for their good work and for the leadership we received from  our leaders.   With that having been said, let's go ahead and vote, and I hope to  vote to invoke cloture and take the critical next step.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion     Madam President, earlier today, I quoted Churchill  actually a couple of times. One of my favorite Churchill quotes is,  when asked when he was being thrown out of office at the end of World  War II--he was asked by reporters outside of 10 Downing Street: Mr.  Churchill, for you, is this the end?   He said: It is not the end. This is not the beginning of the end.   He said: This is the end of the beginning.   While we are grateful for everybody who voted for cloture, it is not  the end, but it takes us a step closer to the end. I just want to thank  everybody who came in, took the time to get here to vote. We are  prepared to take the next step. It involves some additional  negotiations. A lot of folks have amendments they want to offer. Some  of those that are not germane I think will largely fall away. There are  legitimate, germane amendments that still need to be negotiated and may  require some unanimous consent votes.   This is another step, important step. I am grateful that we could be  this far. I note Senator Capito feels the same way.                              Amendment No. 2633     Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2633 to H.R.  3684.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
