 Mr. President, 3 months ago, President Biden announced  his intention to completely withdraw U.S. forces from the ongoing fight  against terrorists and terrorist enablers in Afghanistan. I said then  this was a shortsighted decision, and sure enough--sure enough--a  reckless rush for the exits is becoming a global embarrassment.   Just take the reports that our forces slunk away from the  strategically vital Bagram Air Base in the middle of the night without  plan for our Afghan partners to secure the base or even to keep the  electricity on. But President Biden remains defiant. He has rejected  warnings that the government in Kabul will fall to the Taliban. He is  ignoring the truth unfolding before our own eyes: Afghanistan is  unraveling.   Since April 13, the Taliban has retaken administrative districts all  across the country at a truly alarming pace. With military victory in  reach, the group is hardly even pretending to seek a negotiated  solution. It has wasted no time dragging large swaths of Afghanistan  back under its repression, but President Biden appears unmoved. He says  he bears no responsibility for the plight of the Afghans who fought  with us.   Back in 2019, when his predecessor was contemplating a quick  withdrawal from Syria, then-Candidate Biden called that notion ``the  most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms  of foreign policy.''   Well, look where we are today. The Taliban is hunting down the U.S.- trained pilots who helped defend the Afghan people. It has wiped out  scores of special forces resisting its advance. As the Taliban moves  toward threatening Kabul, the Biden administration seems to have no  plan to efficiently process special visas for the Afghans who helped us  and no plan to get those people safe passage to our Embassy or, for  that matter, even out of the country.  [[Page S4837]]    The dangers facing the Afghan people--especially, especially women  and girls--are heartbreaking. The humanitarian crisis may well be  historic. But this is also an awful, bungled mess from the perspective  of our own national security. The President's own CIA Director told  Senators this decision would be certain to inhibit our ability to  collect intelligence. Gen. Frank McKenzie of Central Command confirmed  this week, this very week, that intelligence collection was already  suffering.   The President's top advisers understand very well that the Taliban is  capable of retaking control of Afghanistan in just a matter of months.  This would allow al-Qaida to reconstitute. So analysts are debating not  if, not whether, but when al-Qaida will again threaten the United  States from Afghanistan.   Just wait until we see Russia and China rushing into the void,  exploiting our retreat to expand their power and influence in Central  Asia. Just wait until the botched retreat and lingering threats end up  requiring a large, ongoing presence of our military and surveillance  forces in the region rather than freeing up resources for the Indo- Pacific. Just wait until the Biden administration ends up consumed with  this humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan and its destabilizing  effects rather than focusing on building coalitions to counter Chinese  or Russian aggression.   Yet, amid all this, President Biden isn't reconsidering. Instead, he  is flooring it. The administration actually sped up the withdrawal so  it can accomplish it even before the darkly ironic deadline of  September 11.   So I have forcefully opposed efforts by Presidents of both parties to  cut and run from our work in Syria or Afghanistan. I have warned of the  huge strategic price America would pay if this administration pretends  that terrorists will play nicely with their political timeline. As one  recent headline put it, ``We might be done with jihadis but they are  not done with us.''   President Biden and his team are desperate to duck hard questions  about Afghanistan, but the American people deserve answers. They  deserve to understand the risks of this trajectory and how the  Commander in Chief plans to keep us safe against a terrorist enemy that  his own senior advisers admit will be allowed to regroup thanks to the  President's actions.   I hope that, even in this Democratically controlled Congress, our  national security committees will uphold their obligation to oversee  this unfolding debacle and its implications. Ending our presence in  Afghanistan will not end the terrorist war against us. Sadly, the  opposite is likely to be true. This self-inflicted wound could very  well make the struggle even more difficult and even more dangerous                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a totally different matter,  Senators have just spent 2 weeks traveling our home States and hearing  what is on the minds of working families. I got to spend time with all  kinds of hard-working Kentuckians across the Bluegrass.   There is no question we are in better shape than we were a year ago.  Thanks to the genius of science, the success of Operation Warp Speed,  and the bipartisan rescue packages the Republican-led Senate passed in  2020, the year 2021 was primed and set up for a historic American  comeback well before the new Democratic Congress or the new Democratic  administration was even sworn in.   But Democrats still wanted to rush ahead with the huge borrowing and  spending sprees they had promised their far left. Top economists,  including famous Democrats, warned our colleagues to think again. Even  liberal experts tried to warn our colleagues that the socialist ideas  they had drawn up in 2020 were not suited to what Americans needed in  2021. Overspending and overborrowing would unleash inflation, slow  rehiring, and hurt small businesses.   All that was predicted, but Democrats rushed ahead. They rammed  through what the White House bragged was the most leftwing legislation  in our Nation's history, and now Democrats want to follow up with an  even more absurd summer sequel.   Well, let me tell you, I just spent 2 weeks hearing from my fellow  Kentuckians, and they are already paying a heavy price. Manufacturers  are still absolutely hammered by supply chain shocks. Employers large  and small say Democrats' special bonus for workers to stay unemployed  is badly hampering their ability to fully reopen and to serve their  customers. Most of our surrounding States have already put a stop to  this awful idea, but Kentucky's Governor, regretfully, hasn't.   It isn't just for-profit businesses, either, that are having trouble  getting people back to work. I heard from one residential treatment  center for pregnant women and new moms grappling with substance abuse.  They said that because of the generous Federal bonus for staying home,  they have had trouble finding enough support staff to even reopen one  of their facilities post-COVID. About 80 percent of the people who  schedule an interview don't even show up.   These backward bonuses have also invited heaps--heaps--of fraud. In  California, for example, a significant share of the State's COVID  unemployment benefits were paid out fraudulently, billions and billions  of dollars to people who shouldn't have gotten them at all. And now-- get this--Democrats want to give the California labor secretary who was  in charge of that nightmare a promotion. In fact, we are scheduled to  vote on her confirmation today to a leading position at the Department  of Labor. You really can't make this stuff up.   And then there is inflation. Just this morning, we learned that  runaway inflation has continued to hit working families and hit them  hard. Consumer prices spiked in June considerably more than had been  forecast. Inflation is up 5.4 percent year over year--the fastest jump  in 13 years. Stunningly, it is up 0.9 percent just month over month.  Families are feeling it everywhere, from the supermarket to the gas  pumps, to housing, to the used car lot, and beyond--all thanks in part  to the Democrats' half-baked spending spree from the springtime. Now  they want an even more absurd, even more damaging summer sequel.   What Democrats say they want to force through this summer through  reconciliation would make our current inflationary mess look like small  potatoes. Nobody seriously thinks our country needs another gigantic  overdose of overborrowing, overspending, and overtaxing.   This isn't what the American people voted for, either. Our  distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from Vermont, the chair of  the Budget Committee, has been very transparent about his socialist  ideology for decades, very upfront about it, but the country didn't  elect a 50-50 Senate and a President who claimed to be a moderate so  that Chairman Sanders could turn America into a socialist country.   Working Americans know that is not what they voted for. This summer  they will see who wants to borrow and spend trillions more dollars for  no reason and who would rather help them get their jobs back, their  stable prices back, their small businesses back, and their lives back                            ____________________
