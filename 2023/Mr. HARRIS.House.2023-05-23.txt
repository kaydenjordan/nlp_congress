 Mr. Speaker, it is not the Republicans who want to defund  veterans. It is the Democrats.   We have marked up the MILCON-VA bill in subcommittee, and it doesn't  have cuts. I don't know where the people on the other side of the aisle  suggest we are not supporting veterans. As a veteran myself, I am proud  of the work we do.   It is the President who suggested that we decrease from the fiscal  year 2023 numbers across the board. Mr. Speaker, that is defense,  veterans. That is across the board.   It is the President who wants to cut the defense budget. It is the  President who wants to defund our veterans. Shame on the President.                            ____________________
