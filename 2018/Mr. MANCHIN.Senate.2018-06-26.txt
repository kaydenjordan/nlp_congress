 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Anthony  ``Tony'' Paesano, an accomplished educator, Korean war veteran, a  beloved public servant, and my dear friend, who left a significant  imprint on my home State of West Virginia.   Born in Follansbee, in the scenic northern panhandle, Tony has always  had a passion for the noble profession of education. He was a walk-on  for the Duquesne University football team in 1948 where he earned a  bachelor of arts degree in education. Following his discharge from the  U.S. Army, Tony began his nearly 40-year career as an educator, serving  as principal of Brooke High School for 16 years.   There is much to be said about someone who gives so much to our  Nation, then comes home to give even more to their home State and  community. Prior to the start of his teaching career, Tony put his  Duquesne ROTC training to use in the Army serving as a second  lieutenant in Korea from 1952 to 1954. In fact, in 2017, I was honored  to recognize Tony when he was selected as Veteran of the Year by the  Brooke County Veteran Memorial Park Foundation. He is well known for  his work honoring his fellow veterans. He has also served as master of  ceremonies at Memorial Day and Veterans Day services in Follansbee and  led the efforts to  [[Page S4400]]  establish the Veterans Memorial Fountain at Follansbee Park and to  bring the Moving Wall to the city for the annual Community Days  festival.   Following his retirement from education, Tony served on the Brooke  County School Board for 10 years, then stepped down to serve as mayor  of Follansbee for another 10 years. He is the founder and former  president of the Brooke County Schools Education Foundation, which has  provided countless scholarships for Brooke County High School Seniors.   It would be difficult to find anyone as knowledgeable or dedicated to  our home State as Tony. He has always given each project or challenge  his all because it is for the good of his community: his hometown. He  is an active member of the St. Anthony Catholic Church and the  Follansbee Knights of Columbus and served 25 years as president of the  Follansbee Chamber of Commerce. Throughout the years, we bonded over  our passion for public service, for inspiring the next generation of  leaders, and we share the common goal of helping the rest of the  country discover all that West Virginia has to offer.   Tony has worn many hats, and I know he will carry the same passion  for Brooke County and for West Virginia that he always has and will  continue to make a difference in his community. It is my greatest honor  to extend him, his lovely wife, Lorraine, their children, Toni, Frank,  and John, and their families my very best wishes in the days and years  ahead.                            ____________________
