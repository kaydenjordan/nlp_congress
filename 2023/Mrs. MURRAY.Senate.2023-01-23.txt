 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate Alfie Alvarado- Ramos, the Director of Washington State's Department of Veterans  Affairs, who will retire on January 31, 2023, after serving Washington  State and our veterans for over 29 years. Alfie's impressive career is  marked by many well-earned accolades, but most of all by her dedication  to serving Washington State and the Nation.   Throughout her military service, Alfie's service has been recognized  with awards and decorations, including the Legion of Merit, Order of  Military Medical Merit, Expert Field Medical Badge, and Meritorious  Service medal. After 22 years, she retired from Active Duty in August  1993 as the command sergeant major of Madigan Army Medical Center and  Troop Command, Joint Base Lewis-McChord.   She has also proven herself a distinguished and passionate leader in  the management of medical services delivery and human resources  management, especially for our veterans. Alfie is an alumna of the  Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government Executive  Program, the University of Washington Executive Management Program, and  holds a master's degree in healthcare administration, and a licensed  nursing home administrator.   As director of Washington State's Department of Veterans Affairs,  Alfie was a member of Governor Jay Inslee's executive cabinet and  chaired the Washington State Military Transition Council. In this  capacity, she has helped the agency lead statewide efforts for the  seamless transition of servicemembers and their families to Washington  State's communities. As a leader in our State, she has been honored  with many well-earned local, State, and national awards, including the  Governor's Distinguished Management Leadership Award and the Department  of Veterans Affairs Secretary's Leadership Award.   Alfie's extraordinary commitment to servicemembers and veterans is  unmatched. Anyone who has worked with Alfie, as I have been honored to  do for many years, knows her tireless dedication and relentless drive  to improve services for members of the military, veterans, and their  families. From mental health to education and training, military spouse  employment, to emergency funding for State veterans homes in the depths  of the COVID pandemic, Alfie has been an incredible partner.   Although there are so many stories I could share about the way Alfie  has fought for veterans in Washington State, there is one in particular  that I will never forget. Back in 2013, the State of Washington, thanks  to Alfie's leadership, secured Federal funding for a veterans home in  Walla Walla. Unfortunately, through a series of bureaucratic mishaps,  our State was in danger of losing that funding--that is, until Alfie  stepped in. She called to let my office know about the problem and was  absolutely furious the Federal Government would pull the rug out from  under those veterans who needed care the most. I couldn't have agreed  more. It was unacceptable--so we didn't accept it. Together, we fought  to keep the funding, and we won. There is now a beautiful veterans home  in Walla Walla thanks to Alfie's tireless dedication to Washington  State veterans.   I will miss working with her in the years ahead, but it has been an  honor to know Alfie throughout her career as dedicated mentor, teacher,  and guide for the next generation of military and veteran leaders. I  know Washington State and the Nation will be in good hands, thanks to  her and her legacy will continue far beyond her own retirement.   I offer my deepest appreciation for Alfie's dedicated service to the  United States of America and Washington State. I ask that my colleagues  join me in congratulating Alfie on her well-earned retirement and  wishing her many years of enjoyment with her family.                            ____________________
