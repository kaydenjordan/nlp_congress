 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R.  1435.   California has long been a global leader in the fight against air  pollution. Whether it is greenhouse gases, smog, or other harmful  pollutants, California has often been the first State to protect our  citizens from the terrible health impacts of dirty air.   You get a lot of criticism when you are a leader, and Californians  are no strangers to criticism. Time and again, that criticism fades as  the rest of the country, and often other countries, see the benefits of  California's emissions policies.   In 1966, California established the first tailpipe emissions standard  in the Nation. The country soon followed with the Clean Air Act of  1970, which created the EPA, and established the first national air  pollution standards.   The Clean Air Act also recognized California's leadership by  explicitly affirming California's authority to set more stringent  emission standards.   Thanks to that authority, California continued to lead the fight  against air pollution and adopted the first NOX standards  and the first particulate matter standards for motor vehicles.                                time  1430    In 2004, California adopted the first greenhouse gas pollution  standards for vehicles. The EPA followed in 2010 with the first  national standards for greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles.   Now, the impacts of climate change, caused by fossil fuel pollution,  are becoming more numerous and deadlier. More frequent and more intense  floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and heat waves threaten to make our  communities unlivable.   This bill, however, enshrines the internal combustion engine in the  Clean Air Act. We are leading the Nation with cutting-edge vehicle  emission standards that will reduce greenhouse gas pollutants and lead  the world in the fight against climate change. This bill is a love  letter to Big Oil, legally mandating that Americans think first of the  internal combustion engine before considering air quality or public  health.   We have a chance to stop climate change before it is too late, but  this bill would keep dirty gas and diesel cars on the road forever,  dooming our children to face the worst impacts of climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1435.
