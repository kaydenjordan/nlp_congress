 Madam President, there is a sales tactic known as throwing  spaghetti at the wall, where the salesperson suggests an outrageously  high price to see if it sticks. More often than not, the price is dead  on arrival. It is intended to be; that is part of the trick.   See, the element of shock allows the salesperson to create an  illusion of a spectacular discount by slashing the initially  artificially high price. The customer then leaves feeling like they  stumbled onto an incredible deal, too good to pass up, even though they  left with a product they either didn't want or couldn't afford or, at a  minimum, a product for which they paid too high a price.   When I read President Biden's budget request, it felt more like I was  trapped at a kiosk in the middle of the mall or being sold a used car  by a predatory, unscrupulous salesman, not reading a serious budget  proposal from the President of the United States. So I would suggest  the President try again because the spaghetti didn't stick. We are not  buying what the President is selling, and his budget is dead on  arrival.   When the President reached the end of his sales pitch, he told us the  price: a whopping $6.9 trillion. It would create a $1.8 trillion  deficit in the first year alone. Then by 2027, we would break the  record for the most debt held by the public as a percentage of U.S. GDP  since World War II.   Utahns are already pinching pennies as a result of this approach to  budget.   In August, I stood where I stand now, as this body was on the cusp of  passing the $1.7 trillion omnibus package, and read letters I received  from Utah constituents. They explained how difficult life has become  under Biden's recordbreaking inflation. They described the daily  choices they were forced to make because of how expensive life had  become under this administration.   Jennie from Salt Lake City wrote:         My annual income is about $30,000 a year. I'm panicking.       The price of groceries and other goods has increased so much,       I'm struggling financially. I understand my utility bills       could double or even triple. I don't know how I can afford to       live.    Since Democrats started their reckless spending 2 years ago, prices  have risen more than 15 percent. Groceries are up nearly 20 percent.   Kevin from Murray, UT, wrote:         This morning, I filled up my work . . . truck. It cost       $149. I'm a small business [owner], and the price of fuel is       a major challenge for our company of 5 vehicles traveling to       our various projects.    President Biden's energy policies caused gas prices to reach $5 and  energy costs to skyrocket. Gas is up 45 percent, and Biden's budget  will crush American energy with $31 billion in new taxes.   I said during that speech that if the definition of ``insanity'' is  doing the same thing and expecting different results, then spending  more money and increasing taxes to reduce inflation certainly meets  that definition.   This approach is insane, and the President is doubling and then  tripling down. Rather than address the spending driving inflation, the  Biden administration continues to blame inflation on everything from  the pandemic to Putin. We know why. The President won't address  inflation because he wants to spend even more. He wants to create the  biggest government we have ever had and make it more and more  expensive.   We have to get this monkey off our back, but that can't be done in  darkness. That has to be done while acknowledging the problem that we  have and addressing it head-on, not obscuring it.   I want to be clear that the Constitution tasks Congress with  determining annual spending and revenue levels, not the President's  annual budget proposal, and clearly this is for good reason. We have a  constitutional duty here to protect our constituents from the snake oil  salesman hell-bent on taking the American people for all they are  worth, who will leave the American people with junk they don't need and  a payment they can't afford.
