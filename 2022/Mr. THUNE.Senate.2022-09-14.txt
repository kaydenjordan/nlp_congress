 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, Democrats and the  President gathered at the White House to celebrate their so-called  Inflation Reduction Act--a bill that will do absolutely nothing to  reduce inflation.   You don't have to take my word for it. The nonpartisan Penn Wharton  Budget Model said this about the bill's impact on inflation:         The impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable       from zero.    ``[S]tatistically indistinguishable from zero.''   Or you could take the word of the Democrat chairman of the Senate  Budget Committee, who admitted on the Senate floor right here that the  so-called Inflation Reduction Act would not reduce inflation. That is  right.   To describe yesterday's celebration at the White House as tone deaf  would be putting it mildly. Democrats had a big party to celebrate a  bill that may fulfill some of their Big Government fantasies but will  do nothing to fix the inflation crisis facing our country. Meanwhile,  Americans were dealing with the release of August inflation numbers,  which were even higher than expected and made it very clear that the  soaring prices will continue for the foreseeable future.   One of President Obama's top economic advisers noted yesterday:         Today's CPI report confirms that the US has a serious       inflation problem. Core inflation is higher this month than       for the quarter, higher this quarter than last quarter,       higher this half of the year than the previous one, and       higher last year than the previous one.    That is from one of President Obama's top economic advisers, who made  that statement yesterday.   Yet Democrats and the President somehow thought yesterday was a good  day to celebrate fulfilling some of their Big Government fantasies.   I guess Americans struggling to afford their soaring grocery bills  can be comforted by the fact that, thanks to Democrats' legislation,  their tax dollars will now be going to fund electric vehicle tax  credits for wealthy Americans, not to mention road equity and  identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage--yes, provisions in the bill  that they were celebrating yesterday. Meanwhile, the pain of inflation  is permeating every aspect of our economy.   During the month of August, I spent a lot of time traveling around  South Dakota, and naturally I spent a lot of time talking to farmers  and ranchers. One thing I heard over and over is the toll that  inflation is taking on agriculture.   In addition to the normal challenges every American is facing from  inflation, like high utility bills and high grocery prices, farmers and  ranchers are facing massive increases in the price of essential inputs  like fertilizer  [[Page S4589]]  and fuel. Under the Biden administration, farm production expenses will  reach a record high this year. Fertilizer prices are on track to  increase by 84 percent--84 percent. That is a staggering increase. Fuel  prices are on track to increase 65 percent. And there is no end in  sight.    Farmers are facing a huge increase in interest costs thanks to a  combination of higher interest rates and record-high farm debt. Gross  farm income is actually supposed to reach a record level this year, but  those gains are expected to be entirely wiped out by inflation--and  then some. Thanks to inflation, net farm income is expected to  decrease. At a time when gross farm income is expected to reach a  record level--14 percent higher year over year than last year--net farm  income, inflation adjusted, is actually going to go down because of the  impact of inflation.   Meanwhile, Democrats were at the White House celebrating a bill that  will not only do nothing to address our inflation crisis but will drive  up energy bills for American farmers and American families.   Agriculture is the lifeblood of my State of South Dakota, and  addressing the needs of farmers and ranchers is always one of my top  priorities here in the Senate. While it is, unfortunately, going to be  difficult to stop Democrats from prolonging our inflation crisis as  long as they are in charge in Washington, in the meantime, I am doing  everything I can to make life easier for our farmers and ranchers.   One of my top priorities right now is preparing for the 2023 farm  bill, to make it as effective as possible in addressing the challenges  that are facing our farmers and ranchers. I have been holding  roundtables in South Dakota to hear directly from producers about their  priorities for the farm bill. So far, I have held roundtables covering  row crops, conservation, and livestock. I also participated in a farm  bill panel at Dakotafest and an Aberdeen Area Chamber of Commerce farm  bill discussion at the Brown County Fair.   I look forward to continuing to receive input from producers as the  time to draft the farm bill approaches. I have also begun introducing  legislation--based on my conversations with farmers and ranchers--that  I will work to get included in the farm bill.   In March, I introduced the Conservation Reserve Program Improvement  Act, which would make CRP grazing a more attractive option for farmers  and ranchers by providing cost-share payments for all CRP practices for  the establishment of grazing infrastructure, including fencing and  water distribution. It would also increase the annual payment limit for  CRP, which has not changed since 1985, to help account for inflation  and the increase in land value.   In May, I joined Senator Klobuchar to introduce the Agricultural  Innovation Act. Currently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture collects  reams of data on conservation practices. The problem is that a lot of  this data is often not analyzed and presented in a way that would be  useful for farmers and ranchers.   The legislation Senator Klobuchar and I introduced would provide for  better processing and development of the data that the USDA collects so  that farmers and ranchers can evaluate the impact of conservation and  other production practices on things like soil health, crop yields, and  profitability. Our bill would make it easier for farmers and ranchers  to decide what conservation practices to adopt by, among other things,  helping producers identify the ways that adopting conservation  practices can improve their bottom line.   In the next couple of weeks, I will be introducing another piece of  legislation for the 2023 farm bill to improve the effectiveness of  livestock disaster assistance for producers. Too often, producers find  that accessing disaster relief programs at the Department of  Agriculture is an arduous and lengthy process. I am working on  legislation that would make it easier for farmers and ranchers to  access the Livestock Forage Disaster Program and the Emergency  Conservation Program so that producers can receive timely assistance in  the wake of natural disasters like drought and flooding.   The U.S. Drought Monitor plays a critical role in triggering USDA  disaster assistance, and I am working to build on my previous efforts  to improve weather monitoring and the accuracy of the Drought Monitor.   This isn't a farm bill issue per se, but I am also introducing  legislation today to prevent Democrats from using funding in the  recently passed and misnamed, as I pointed out earlier, Inflation  Reduction Act to monitor livestock methane emissions.   It is very clear that elements of the radical environmental left  would like to see U.S. livestock producers out of business entirely. My  legislation is designed to forestall future attempts to curtail beef  production by preventing the Biden Environmental Protection Agency from  using funds in the Democrats' bill to monitor livestock emissions.   Agriculture is a challenging way of life. In addition to backbreaking  work in all weather, our Nation's farmers and ranchers have to contend  with the uncontrollable whims of the weather, which can wipe out a herd  or a crop in a day. And as if the actual challenges of the job weren't  enough, over the course of the Biden administration, our Nation's  farmers and ranchers have had to deal with soaring inflation.   I am incredibly grateful for all the South Dakota farmers and  ranchers and all of our Nation's farmers and ranchers who continue to  persevere during these difficult circumstances. I will continue to do  everything I can in Washington to make their jobs easier and to support  them as they do the essential work of feeding our Nation and the world.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4850         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
