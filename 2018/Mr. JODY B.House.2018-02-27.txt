 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, what an honor it is to  likewise stand.   I remember the first live crusade I ever went to where Billy Graham  was there in Atlanta in the early 1970s. As a young pastor and as a  pastor for almost 20 years, I likewise had the opportunity to meet him.  As a young pastor, he signed a Bible for me, which today still remains  a treasure.   But what we don't need to forget is the message that he gave us. It  is the message of Scripture. It is the message of God. It is a message  that talks about all of us and our condition, that we are sinful, that  we are separated from God, that we have committed things that separate  us eternally unless they are dealt with.   That gospel message from the Scripture that Billy Graham so  eloquently shared was that God loves us, and He gave His son to die in  our stead.   I noticed the other day we are told that archeologists may have found  the signature of the Old Testament prophet Isaiah. When I thought of  that, I actually thought of Billy Graham and how he would have taken  that Isaiah passage in chapter 53 and made a gospel message from the  Old Testament prophet, where he said in chapter 53 that all of us, like  sheep, have gone astray, that every one has gone his own way. Yet God  has laid on him the iniquity of us all.   Here we are, and here is our sin. Here comes Christ without sin, and  God laid on Him the iniquity of us all.   As much as we remember Billy Graham these days, let us never forget  the importance of his message and never forget the message.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and I urge America to hear the  gospel message and to respond in faith to the love and the grace of God  through Jesus Christ that Billy Graham so powerfully presented to all  of us.
