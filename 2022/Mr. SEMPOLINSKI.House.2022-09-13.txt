 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Katko for that  wonderful introduction. I thank my fellow New York State delegation  members for joining me. I thank the Minority Leader for being here. It  is an honor to be the Representative of the people of the Southern Tier  and Finger Lakes.   I am blessed to have my family with me. My parents are here; they  have given me everything. My in-laws, who have always treated me like  family, are here. I would not be standing here without the support of  my wife, Angie, who is my soulmate and best friend.   I am also joined by my daughters. My younger daughter Maddie is with  us. She is my bright-eyed, little sweetheart; she is 2. And I am joined  by my older daughter Jojo. She is clapping.   I think other Down syndrome parents will understand what I mean when  I say that in the person of Jojo I am joined today in this Chamber by  my hero.   Over the last few months, I have been repeatedly asked, ``Why would  you run when you will only serve for 4 months?'' My answer has always  been, ``It would be an honor to serve for 4 minutes.'' Most people in  history have had to live their lives under despots and tyrants, but not  here, not in America. That is the freedom our ancestors purchased for  us at such great cost. We choose those who speak for us. To do so is a  sacred thing.   We have so many challenges right now as a Nation. Rising prices steal  from those who can least afford it. Crime puts fear in all of our  hearts. And, sadly, so many feel that they are not heard by their  Government.   I can tell the people of the 23rd District, without doubt, they are  heard. I am blessed to be from one of the most beautiful places on  Earth. I pray that I can be worthy of the people who have sent me here  to speak for them.                            ____________________
