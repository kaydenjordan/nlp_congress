 Madam Speaker, I really appreciate my colleague  setting up this Special Order to talk about something that is so  incredibly important and often not really brought to the surface.   I am here today to join my colleagues in support for the FAIR Act,  because I don't believe that victims of racial discrimination should be  forced into a secretive process in which they have no access to justice  and accountability.   This is especially important to me because of the story of two  Floridians, Glenda and Peter Perez. Both worked for Cigna until forced  arbitration absolutely ruined their lives.                                time  1630    As reported by Business Insider, everything was going well and,  ``They were living in a newly built home in Ruskin, Florida, happily  raising their three kids.'' That is what they say about themselves. But  due to forced arbitration, things turned for the worse.  [[Page H7592]]    Two years ago, Glenda, who is Latinx, was fired after reporting  racial discrimination. Unknown to her, buried in the fine print of the  employment agreement she signed along with other onboarding documents  when she was first hired was a forced arbitration clause, so Glenda had  no choice but to go into forced arbitration proceedings.   But as the article notes, ``Instead of the simple and fair process  that arbitration promises to be, Perez saw her claim dismissed without  so much as a hearing, only to learn later that her apparently  independent arbitrator was so friendly with the attorney representing  Cigna that the arbitrator invited him to his 50th birthday party.''   To no surprise, the arbitrator sided with Glenda's employer, Cigna.   When her husband, Peter, complained about the unfairness of the  process and how the arbitrator truly was not independent, guess what?  He too was fired.   Now Glenda and Peter are struggling to support themselves and their  three children and trying to fight their wrongful termination in court.   No worker should ever have to go through what Glenda and Peter have  endured. This is why I support ending forced arbitration by voting for  the FAIR Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues who care about justice,  who care about fairness, to support the FAIR Act.
