 Mr. Speaker, The Washington Times  editorial board is appreciated for publishing ``Joy, and Vaccines to  the World,'' where they praised President Donald Trump for his efforts  to bring a vaccine to the United States faster than any other vaccine  in history.   The article is explaining:         The lifesaving COVID-19 vaccine that President Trump       promised to deliver has arrived in record time. Hallelujah.        On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration concluded its       review of the front-running vaccine developed and gave a       green light for distribution. Initial shipments are expected       to reach all 636 locations across the 50 States by today.        ``Promises made, promises kept,'' Mr. Trump likes to say.       That is the can-do spirit that makes America special. Just in       time for Christmas, the fruits of Operation Warp Speed are       starting to bring joy to the world.    In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our family's sympathy for the death of former DNC Chairman Don  Fowler.
