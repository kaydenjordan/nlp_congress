 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is extremely regrettable that we find ourselves here today.  Democrats have said all year that there must be a deal to raise  statutory budget caps in a manner that allows responsible investments  in both defense and nondefense priorities, because both are critical to  our continued safety, security, and prosperity.   The majority failed to engage all year, choosing instead to pass  partisan appropriation bills that can never be signed into law.   More than 2 months ago, President Trump and Democratic congressional  leaders struck an agreement to avoid a government shutdown and buy time  for negotiations on new spending caps that would make it possible to  enact a responsible, bipartisan full-year spending law. Precious little  has been accomplished since then.   Now here we are again with the majority asking support for a 2-week  stopgap continuing resolution. So I ask the majority: What do you  expect to accomplish in the next 2 weeks that we have been unable to  accomplish in the last 2 months? I want to repeat that. I would really  like to know what you expect to accomplish in the next 2 weeks, when we  haven't been able to accomplish anything in the last 2 months.   The rationale to support a short-term stopgap continuing resolution  is that the parties are engaged in good faith negotiations to develop a  responsible, bipartisan spending package; negotiations are on a  positive trajectory and additional time is simply needed to seal a  deal. Can anyone in this Chamber claim that this is the case today?   The President continues to irresponsibly threaten a government  shutdown and launch ad hominem attacks. Majority leadership is playing  games with the contents of this and future continuing resolutions.  Negotiations on new spending caps for defense and nondefense  investments are stalled.   The majority is grasping for excuses as to why they have failed to  protect 700,000 young Americans from deportation, reauthorize the  Children's Health Insurance Program, or move expeditiously on critical  disaster assistance.   Is there any evidence whatsoever that this majority intends to  fulfill these vital responsibilities to the American people?   Given these failures, I believe it is incumbent on Members of  Congress to say enough is enough. The American people are sick of the  games. They want results.   It is time for the Republican leadership and President Trump to get  serious, engage with Democrats. We stand ready and willing to help  develop a framework for a responsible, bipartisan spending agreement  and to negotiate the details of a full year's spending package.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing  resolution, which is yet again a complete abdication of our  responsibilities.   Instead of adopting fully funded appropriations bills or an omnibus  with an actual chance of passing this Congress, we remain mired in this  unbreakable habit of passing continuing resolutions. This not only  creates needless legislative and economic uncertainty, it costs the  government, especially our military, billions in wasted taxpayer  dollars. Moreover, this abdication reflects the Republican leadership's  complete abandonment of our values and the needs of our constituents.   For one, we have yet to pass the Dream Act. Despite widespread  support nationally and with growing fear of deportations, this Congress  has ignored the 122 DREAMers who lose their protected status every day.  These are Americans by any definition, and this is their home. I will  not stand by as this President cruelly threatens to send these brave  young people back to countries about which they have no memory.   When will this body fully address the horrific disasters that have  ravaged Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and  California? Countless communities, including my own, are anxiously  awaiting vital recovery assistance that only the Federal Government can  provide. These abdications are simply immoral. It doesn't end there.   Congress has failed to renew the Children's Health Insurance Program.  States and families across America are scrambling to find replacement  funds and healthcare alternatives for their children.                                time  1445    When did CHIP and protecting the health of our children become a  partisan issue?   My Republican colleagues want to add more than $1 trillion to the  deficit for tax cuts for big corporations and the top 1 percent, while  they are at it; but then they say we can't afford to spend a fraction  of that on healthcare for children?   These priorities are backward and morally indefensible.   Instead of protecting Americans from the scourge of gun violence,  Republicans are weakening our already feeble gun laws by passing more  legislation that ensures more deadly gun violence in our towns and  cities.   We need to pass an omnibus budget that doesn't threaten programs for  our veterans and children or make drastic cuts to the Medicare and  Medicaid programs that our seniors rely upon.   Instead of handing massive tax cuts to millionaires and powerful  corporations, we should pass a budget that supports education, expands  women's health, and provides real economic relief to the middle class.   In short, we have to break this body's obsession with promoting the  interests of the well-off and special interests, and ignoring the needs  of children, DREAMers, seniors, and the middle class.   This continuing resolution does nothing more than provide another  short-term fix for the Republican leadership's unhealthy addiction. It  is abominable, it is irresponsible, and we should set it aside and  focus on making long-term decisions for the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to comment on this continuing  resolution and on the past year of this Congress.   The biggest economic challenge of our time is that people are in jobs  that do not pay them enough to live on. Wages are not keeping up with  rising costs for healthcare, childcare, and housing. Too many families  struggle to make ends meet, let alone put money in a college fund or go  on vacation. That is what we should be focused on. We ought to be  creating jobs and raising wages.   Yet, for the first 9 months of this year, this Congress attempted  again and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have  raised premiums and deductibles, thrown millions off insurance, and  made healthcare unaffordable.   Then we spent our entire fall on the Republican tax scam. Big  corporations, millionaires, billionaires write the rules to make this  government work for them, and Republicans are their comrades-in-arms in  rigging the game against the middle class.   Just a few days ago, Senator Orrin Hatch said: ``I have a rough time  wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help  people who won't help themselves, won't lift a finger, and expect the  Federal Government to do everything.''   Get out of the Senate Chamber. Understand what people's lives are  about today. Walk in their shoes and understand their struggles.   But this is the ugly truth of the Republican tax bill. This is what  the vote was about. These are their values on display.  [[Page H9735]]    This tax scam is going to raise the deficit, and the Republicans will  use it as an excuse to cut vital social safety net programs: Medicare,  Medicaid, Social Security, LIHEAP, TANF, education programs, SNAP, food  stamps.   Right now, funding is insufficient to provide childcare assistance to  all who are eligible; yet, if we pass this tax bill, we will be under  intense pressure to cut this assistance. That is what they want to do.  This is wrong.   Now we are punting one of our core obligations as a Congress: funding  our government programs.   This is unacceptable. It is a disturbing pattern and it is  unsustainable. We should be negotiating spending levels for 2018.   The majority can never again speak about regular order. This year has  been one partisan attempt after another to harm working class and  middle class Americans so that they could fulfill their campaign  promises.    We have no budget agreement. We have no resolve on the Children's  Health Insurance Program. We have no resolve on a myriad of programs  that people rely on to live their lives every day. There is no resolve  on the DREAMers.   Why would we need another 2 weeks when they have had all this time to  work on these issues?   The American people deserve better. I say: Shame on this Congress,  and vote ``no'' on this continuing resolution extension.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I really rise on behalf of the American  people. All it takes is a simple pen and cooperation between  appropriators to get the job done.   Just a few days ago, I listened to representatives from the city of  Houston. They are only a sample of the hurting people who have suffered  after hurricanes--one of the toughest hurricane seasons in the history  of the United States. They indicated that there are 300,000 single- family homes and multi-family homes still under.   In my district alone, among other districts, from one part of the  State to the next, there are people living in shells of a house. We  have yet had a response to be able to help those individuals who have  either maxed out or don't have the insurance because they were not in a  flood zone. That requires us to not do a CR, but to work on the  appropriations.   I have got health clinics and the Texas Children's Hospital coming to  me every day wondering about the Children's Health Insurance Program  because people are hurting.   You see, I am not trying to oppose a bill for myself. I am opposing a  bill that doesn't have the needs of the American people. It doesn't  have healthcare in it. It doesn't have the hurricane funding in it. It  doesn't have the funding we need for the Army Corps for pending  projects to stop the major catastrophic flooding in Houston, Harris  County; and it has low nondefense spending.   Let me be very clear. I want a prepared military. I want them to have  the training and the equipment that they need. It doesn't have that as  well.   So, frankly, I believe that we have to stand against a war on the  American people, a tax bill that is moving along, but the  appropriations is not; $1.4 trillion taken out of the fat that does not  exist so the bones of the American people's budget--so that a tax cut  can go to the top 62 percent and 80 percent, but we can't have the  funding that we need for the American people.   This is a war on the American people and, for once, Mr. Speaker, I  have got to be on the winning side and fight for the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, my good friend just spoke on the floor  of the House, and I certainly look forward to working with him and  being committed to standing against any legislation that does not  provide Hurricane Harvey funding, and the CR does not.   There is nothing in the CR that has anything to do with those who are  suffering, with houses that are in disrepair or destroyed, as well as  other items, Army Corps of Engineers items. That is why I stand ready  not to be in a dispute, but to really raise the issue with my  colleagues of how urgent it is to move to the appropriations process.   I mentioned in my remarks that I am concerned as much about military  preparedness as I am about nondefense discretionary spending. I want  everybody to be helped. I want the American people to be helped.   So my vote, whatever it might be, is going to be to drive this engine  forward to make sure resources get down to Harris County, Houston,  Corpus Christi, and all the parts of Texas that are in need, and my  fellow brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,  and Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I reiterate, the Democrats have said all year there must be a deal to  raise spending caps in order to enact appropriation bills. Instead of  heeding that advice, the majority is once again stumbling from crisis  to crisis trying to fund the government 2 weeks at a time.   Without a path forward to keep our country secure and make  investments to grow our economy, we should immediately lift the caps on  defense and nondefense spending.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
