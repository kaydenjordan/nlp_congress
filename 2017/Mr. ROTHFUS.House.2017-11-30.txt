 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving  Access to Manufactured Housing Act, and I urge my colleagues to support  the passage of this rule and the underlying bill.   As the vice chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit Subcommittee and a cosponsor of this legislation, I want to  underscore the impact that passing the Preserving Access to  Manufactured Housing Act would have on hardworking Americans.  [[Page H9533]]                                     time  1300    We all agree that we should work to ensure that everyone can afford a  safe place to live. Representative Barr's bipartisan bill will remove  misguided barriers that block access to affordable manufactured homes  while preserving consumer protections.   In many parts of this country, manufactured homes represent a cost- effective and customizable housing option. It is important to keep in  mind that the challenge of finding affordable housing is not  exclusively an urban problem. Housing affordability is a challenge in  many rural areas as well, and manufactured homes can be a solution.   This is an industry that offers millions, including many rural  Americans with moderate incomes, a chance at home ownership. In fact,  nationwide, 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes.   In my State of Pennsylvania, manufactured homes comprise almost 5  percent of the housing stock. Manufactured homes account for 73 percent  of all new homes sold under $125,000. The average income of a  manufactured home purchaser is less than $40,000 per year.   The manufactured housing business also sustains thousands of  families. Sixteen thousand workers in Pennsylvania are employed in that  industry.   Unfortunately, misguided rules from Washington, D.C., threaten to  choke off access to manufactured homes. When Washington bureaucrats  sought to implement Dodd-Frank, they put forward rules that led some  manufactured housing retailers and sellers to be considered loan  originators. They also expanded the ``high-cost loan'' definition and  swept many manufactured housing loans into that category.   The increased restrictions, liability, and stigma that accompany  these designations have led many in the industry to cut back on  lending. As a result, fewer hardworking Americans will be able to  afford a quality manufactured home for their families.   The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act will address these  harmful restrictions that are making manufactured homes unaffordable  for prospective homeowners while preserving important consumer  protections.   This bill clarifies that a manufactured home salesperson is not a  loan originator unless he or she is being compensated by a lender, a  creditor, or a mortgage broker. It also adjusts the high-cost mortgage  designation thresholds so that many manufactured housing loans are once  again not included.   It is important to keep in mind that the Truth in Lending Act and  State consumer protection laws will still apply after the enactment of  this legislation.   Representative Barr's bill is a narrowly focused, commonsense, and  bipartisan effort to target a specific challenge facing prospective  purchasers of manufactured homes. This bill will preserve access to  affordable housing for millions of American families.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge support for the Preserving Access to  Manufactured Housing Act and this rule.
