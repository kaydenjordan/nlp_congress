 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to speak  about a courageous Texan who is a part of the Cleburne Fire Department  in the district that I represent, Lieutenant Kris Watson.   We all have been closely watching the recent fires in California that  have been catastrophic to families and businesses. Thousands of  buildings, including homes, were scorched in the blaze, and at least 85  people lost their lives. I cannot imagine what the California community  is going through, and my heart breaks for them.   While these fires were treacherous and unpredictable, our very own  Cleburne firefighter, Lieutenant Watson, was one of 200 Texan  firefighters who answered the call for help. He selflessly went into  harm's way and put his life on the line to save others. This man is a  true hero, and I am humbled to speak about him today on the House floor  in front of my colleagues and the Nation.   Even though the fires have finally calmed down, the effects will be  felt for years to come, and it is important to let our friends in  California know that we are with them and that we will continue to keep  them in our thoughts and our prayers.   I am happy to report that Kris made it back to Cleburne safely last  week. Everyone in Texas' 25th District is proud of our fellow Texan,  and I thank him for his valor.   May God bless the Cleburne Fire Department and God bless the people  of California.   In God we Trust.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program.   Mr. Speaker, for 20 years, Congress has been putting off making  meaningful reforms to this problematic program. Taxpayers continue to  pay the price for our failure to act. With every year that passes, the  NFIP goes further and further into debt.   The unsustainability of this program has even caused Congress to  cancel $16 billion in NFIP debt last year.   Without meaningful reform like what this body approved when we passed  the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, what protections do taxpayers have?    Mr. Speaker, the reauthorization before us today is not reform. By  simply changing the date of the NFIP expiration, this body is tacitly  stating that reform can't be done.   Enough is enough. We can't continue to pass our problems along to  those in the future. The time to fix this problem is now. I will oppose  extensions of the NFIP as long as this body continues to ignore  meaningful reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I invite all my colleagues to join me in voting ``no''  on this legislation.
