 Madam Speaker, I rise to mourn the loss of my good friend,  Dr. Terry Yamauchi, who passed away last month.   As a young boy growing up during the Second World War, he and his  mother were interned at a Japanese relocation camp in Idaho.   Following this, he and his family moved frequently for his father's  career, including a 2-year stint in Japan while his father was a U.S.  Treasury representative.   Dr. Yamauchi graduated from the University of Oregon Medical School  in 1967 and completed his post-doctoral training at the UCLA School of  Medicine.   After a few years at UCLA, the doctor joined UAMS, the University of  Arkansas Medical School, and Arkansas Children's Hospital, where he  practiced for over 40 years.   Throughout his distinguished career, he authored over 300 medical  papers and book chapters over pediatric and infectious disease. He  served as the director of the Department of Human Services for Governor  Bill Clinton.    Terry's service to our community will not be forgotten. My prayers  are with his wife of 55 years, Alison, his children, and grandchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank my friend from Texas for his  inspirational recitations of these outstanding young people who seek an  appointment to the military academy. There is no more optimistic and  positive aspect of being a Member of Congress than making those  appointments. I thank him for his service.   I also want to echo our thanks from both sides of the aisle to the  Chaplain, the Clerk of the House, the Sergeant at Arms, the minority  and majority cloakrooms, and our brave stenographers who sit here for  hours taking down every inspirational word. We thank them for their  service in this Congress.   Madam Speaker, in October, as the first frost touched Ukraine,  Vladimir Putin turned 70 years old. That week, Russian chess champion  and activist Garry Kasparov spoke at Westminster College in Fulton,  Missouri, the scene of Churchill's famous ``Iron Curtain'' speech.  Garry Kasparov declared: Thirty years of making concessions that were  intended to keep the peace have only postponed the war.   Appeasement, Madam Speaker, never works. Kasparov went on to say: The  price of stopping a dictator always goes up. It may seem expensive  today, but it is only going to be more tomorrow.   It is critically important that we build a consensus to support the  Ukrainian people and their government in their valiant efforts to  reject Putin's rapacious invading Army.   This illegal invasion and Putin's wanton war crimes have been  rejected by the world. This is evidenced by votes in the General  Assembly of the United Nations and the ejection of Russia from the U.N.  Human Rights Council. It is evidenced by Sweden and Finland petitioning  to join NATO. It has been evidenced by a global coalition of nations  supporting the Ukrainian people with humanitarian assistance and  military aid.   But in order to maintain and enhance that global coalition of  citizens and their elected representatives, it is critical that we  provide a great deal more information and oversight to that  humanitarian and military assistance. Only together can we help Ukraine  eject the bully and free its people.   I support the idea of a special inspector general to oversee U.S.  military and humanitarian assistance, coordinating with the very active  and existing inspector general programs at the Department of Defense  and Department of State. This is common sense. American taxpayers need  to ensure full transparency and accountability for our financial  support.   Likewise, in my view, the Biden administration has done a poor job  explaining to Congress the over 100 billion euros in support of Ukraine  from all the countries of the world, including the United States. That  is, they should provide Congress detailed assessments of what funding  has been provided to Ukraine, both military and humanitarian, from the  European Commission, individual member states of the European Union,  and other nations from around the world, such as our great friend and  ally, Japan.   It is important for us, in assessing our own contributions to freedom  in Ukraine, to assess and encourage our friends, allies, and partners  to do as much as they can, maybe more, and as effectively as possible.  We are all in the boat pulling mightily in the same direction, but we  need that detail and transparency.   Madam Speaker, in that regard, I was reflecting on my prior  government service as a Treasury Department official during the  administration of George H. W. Bush.   On August 1, 1990, Iraq was invaded by Kuwait and within 12 hours was  in full control of that country.   President Bush denounced the invasion and stated clear and effective  principles: First, to seek the immediate, unconditional, and complete  withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait; next, to restore Kuwait's  legitimate government; and, finally, to remain committed to the  security and stability of the Persian Gulf region.   Backed by a Security Council resolution at the U.N., the Bush  administration set about to carry out those objectives.   It is important to note the extraordinary leadership of then  Secretary of State Jim Baker, Secretary of Treasury Nick Brady, Deputy  Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger, and the Undersecretary of  Treasury David Mulford. They all worked as a team and built an  extraordinary coalition to  [[Page H9849]]  raise the financing for this global effort to stop Saddam Hussein and  his illegal invasion.                                time  2140    U.S. forces ultimately deployed over 600,000 military personnel  alongside more than 200,000 troops from our allies. Secretaries Baker  and Brady and their teams visited selected countries and developed the  financial resources to effectively fund Kuwait's liberation. More than  90 percent, Madam Speaker, of the United States' incremental costs were  reimbursed by our allies. This work was inspirational then and now.   I call on Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Secretary of the  Treasury Yellen to craft an active and effective campaign to globally  bring forward even more diverse, comprehensive financial resources to  support Ukraine and their valiant fight to inject the invader.   This campaign will be essential to see the financial burden shared  widely among all peace-loving countries of the world.                   The Federal Reserve and Price Stability     Madam Speaker, as inflation continues to wreak havoc on the  wallets of our hardworking families, I rise today to urge the Federal  Reserve to stay the course and win the fight against this insidious  inflation.   Our economy is in this troubling situation of coping with a four- decade high in prices due to three core reasons:   First, the Biden administration's wasteful spending, pouring an  avalanche of loose money into an economy struggling with getting folks  back to work and supply chain woes.   Madam Speaker, our fiscal 2023 spending is running 25 percent greater  than just before the pandemic; 25 percent more on an annual basis. If  you include all President Biden's new spending spree, it is running  $1.3 trillion higher per year.   I wish Chairman Powell back in 2021 had agreed with former Treasury  Secretary Larry Summers and opposed this massive, unfunded fiscal  stimulus.   Next, the Biden administration's war on energy and employment has  made it harder to get people back to work and harder to find and  produce the badly needed oil and gas, get it out of the ground and on  its way to heat our homes, fuel our communities, and support our allies  in Europe.   Finally, the Federal Reserve itself kept interest rates too low for  too long while also purchasing trillions of dollars in government  securities. Now the Fed is left playing catch-up in the hopes of  beating inflation in the short run without damaging our economy in the  long run.   Madam Speaker, I have a better approach. Earlier this year, alongside  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds), my friend and colleague, I  introduced H.R. 7209, the Price Stability Act. This legislation would  ensure that our central bank focuses exclusively on its principal  mandate of price stability.   This bill repeals the 1970s so-called dual mandate whereby the Fed is  conflicted, supposedly focused on price stability but also maintaining  a growing economy. Madam Speaker, the legislative branch and the  executive branch should have that responsibility for policies that  promote economic growth and a well-trained workforce with more job  opportunities. The Fed should focus exclusively on price stability.   Now, I welcome the Federal Reserve's current efforts to mitigate  inflation, and I urge Chairman Powell and his colleagues to avoid  distraction and ensure their efforts are successful. Inflation is a  thief, and it hurts our hardworking families, our seniors, and those on  fixed incomes. It is vital that the Federal Reserve focus on containing  inflation and steer clear of economic policy fads.                 recognizing arkansas governor asa hutchinson     Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Governor Asa  Hutchinson and recognize his accomplishments as the 46th Governor of my  home State of Arkansas.   Governor Hutchinson began his career in service when President Ronald  Reagan appointed him to the position of U.S. attorney for the Western  District of Arkansas. Afterwards, he went on to serve three successful  terms in this Chamber, representing the fine citizens of Arkansas'  Third Congressional District.   During his third term in Congress, President George W. Bush appointed  him as Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration and later as an  Under Secretary in the newly created Department of Homeland Security.   Governor Hutchinson has been instrumental in aiding our families by  cutting taxes by over $250 million and signing into law legislation  that exempts the retirement pay of veterans from State income tax.   Governor Hutchinson has been a great advocate toward enhancing  computer science education in our State. His leadership led Arkansas to  be the first State in the Nation to pass legislation requiring every  public school to teach computer science courses. This has  further encouraged our students to pursue pathways and become  innovators.    He has also served as an advocate for our Little Rock Venture Center,  entrepreneurship, and enhancing venture and startup ecosystems across  our State.   During his time as Governor, he has enhanced Arkansas' reputation as  a business-friendly State, which has attracted companies to make the  Natural State their latest location and existing companies to expand  their business, creating more career opportunities for our citizens.   Over the past 8 years, the Governor and I have partnered on many  projects that have benefited the constituents of the Second District of  Arkansas.   Governor, I am grateful for your steady hand during the COVID-19  pandemic and for your dedication to our State. Governor Hutchinson is a  true public servant who worked every day to make our State a better  place. Asa, your leadership will be missed, and your hard work not  forgotten. Martha and I send our very best wishes to you and Susan for  that next chapter.             congress must work to limit aggression by countries     Madam Speaker, as we enter the final weeks of the 117th  Congress, it is important that we acknowledge the work that we have  done as a body to limit the financial capabilities of Russia's illegal  war in Ukraine.   Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 6899, the Russia and Belarus SDR  Exchange Prohibition Act, which passed with bipartisan support in both  the House and the Senate, and was signed into law by President Biden in  October.   This bill closes a loophole around Western sanctions by freezing  Russia and Belarus out of future International Monetary Fund financing  by preventing them from using special drawing rights, known as SDRs, to  fund their nefarious activities: The war in Ukraine.   We must stay vigilant of the aggressive tendencies of other nations,  such as Russia and Belarus, and make sure they are not able to pledge  or transfer, that is, cash in those SDRs to fund their terror.   It is important that we continue to work together in the new Congress  to make sure that aggression is not rewarded and that we are working to  limit the financial capabilities of countries who demonstrate their  aggression toward another sovereign nation.                        halting the spread of captagon     Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud the inclusion of the  CAPTAGON Act in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. The  production and sale of the dangerous narcotic Captagon is being used as  a major revenue source, fueling the regime and the war machine of  Bashar al-Assad in Syria.   It is this illicit activity that has allowed them to ignore U.S.  sanctions and continue to oppress the people of Syria and export  terror.   By using an interagency task force, including the Department of  Defense and the Drug Enforcement Administration, our CAPTAGON Act will  design a strategy to be able to disrupt and dismantle the trafficking  networks that are fueling terror in Syria and across the region.   While both the State Department and the White House have failed to  include Syria in their list of major illicit drug-producing countries  for FY 2023, I applaud this Congress for taking this key step in making  sure more illegal drugs are not able to make it through Europe, through  the Middle East, or even into the United States by working toward  halting the spread of Captagon around the world.  [[Page H9850]]                                     time  2150                  Retirement Wishes for Walter Hussman, Jr.     Madam Speaker, I stand today to recognize the outstanding  career of Walter Hussman, Jr., the publisher of the Arkansas Democrat- Gazette.   Recently, Walter announced that he will retire from the publication  at the end of 2022.   Walter's career began with him placing comics in the Camden News for  25 cents an hour all the way to restructuring the Arkansas Democrat,  buying the Arkansas Gazette and crafting the State's largest newspaper,  the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.   Over his career as a publisher, he oversaw many changes, including  bringing the Democrat-Gazette into the digital age, for which he was  recognized with national attention.   During his announcement of retirement, Walter shared that it is time  now for the next generation.   Walter is an example of the American Dream, how hard work and  dedication to your craft can lead to a long, prosperous career.   Congratulations, Mr. Hussman, on your outstanding career, your  evidence as a mentor and a role model, and I wish you a well-deserved  retirement.                    Nigeria Country of Particular Concern     Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge the President and our  Secretary of State to rectify their mistake of not designating Nigeria  as a Country of Particular Concern as it relates to religious liberty.   Having the ability to practice religion without fear is one of our  most basic principles needed to create a strong and stable nation.   Under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the President  is required to review the status of religious freedom in every country  of the world. Any country that is seen to have consistently and  violently violating their citizens' religious freedom must be labeled a  Country of Particular Concern.   Over the last 2 years, Nigeria is a nation which hits every troubled  benchmark listed in this act. And yet, Madam Speaker, it has been left  off the list.   Over the past 2 years, violence targeted against Christians has  steadily increased. So labeling Nigeria as a Country of Particular  Concern is a vital step in working toward stability in Nigeria, better  partnerships with the United States, and a step toward international  religious liberty for all.            Congratulating Leslee Tell--Fulbright Fellowship Award     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Leslee Tell, of  Conway High School, who has recently been awarded a Fulbright  Fellowship for the spring of 2023.   Mrs. Tell has taught in Conway schools since 2006 where she  originally taught students home economics, eventually moving on to her  current subject, a broader one, family consumer sciences.   The Fulbright Distinguished Awards in Teaching Research Program  offers educators the opportunity to teach abroad for a semester. In  just a few months, Mrs. Tell will be on her way to Vietnam where she  will be teaching home economics at a local public high school.   I visited with Leslee and her colleagues, and she is so excited about  this opportunity, not only the impact on her but her impact on those  students. I look forward to learning about her journey, the positive  impact that she will make and what she learns from those kids in her  class.   Congratulations, Leslee. We look forward to following your time in  Vietnam and sharing your success.                             Crisis at the Border     Madam Speaker, as we end this calendar year, I rise once  again to bring attention to the crisis at our southwest border.   In 2022, over 2 million migrants were encountered at our southwest  border; the highest number in American history.   Just 2 months ago, there were over 230,000 migrant encounters at our  border. On top of this number, it is estimated that roughly 64,000  illegal immigrants evaded apprehension in October, and 70,000 evaded in  November.   For over a year and a half now, there have been over 150,000 illegal  border crossings each month. Those numbers are higher than ever.   Madam Speaker, 98 individuals on the Terrorist Screening Database  were apprehended at the southern border; more than the last 5 years  combined.   Over the last 2 years, the Biden administration has repeatedly  repealed effective Trump-era policies that kept our border and our  Nation more secure. Despite claims from Secretary Mayorkas saying  otherwise, the Biden administration does not have operational control  over our border.   During a recent visit to Arizona, President Biden claimed that there  were ``more important'' things to do than visit the southern border.   Madam Speaker, the President is in Arizona. What is more important  than a morale-boosting visit to our men and women at Customs and Border  Patrol?   What is more important than keeping our border secure?   Well, apparently, the President's 49 trips to Delaware, or maybe the  President's 8 trips to go get ice cream were more important.   Madam Speaker, I urge this President to take a trip to our southwest  border, see for himself, meet with our agents working on the border,  and see the reality of the crisis that his administration has created.                       Opioid Crisis Impacting America     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the opioid crisis  impacting all Americans. Opioids, such as illicit fentanyl, are  flooding across our open borders and sweeping across our Nation and  into every town and city.   In fiscal year 2022, 14,700 pounds of illicit fentanyl were  confiscated at our southern border. How much came across that wasn't  confiscated?   Over 75,000 Americans lost their lives last year to opioid overdoses,  many of them accidental. To help combat this, I introduced the  Preventing Overdoses and Saving Lives Act this year, alongside my  friend and colleague, Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan.   This legislation was inspired by my home State of Arkansas, which  currently encourages prescribers of opioids to also co-prescribe an  opioid overdose reversal medication, such as naloxone.   This summer, that legislation passed the House in a bipartisan mental  health package.   Madam Speaker, I am hopeful my colleagues in the Senate will work to  move this valuable piece of legislation forward because the data is  clear--co-prescribing helps save lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
