 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Edwin Reyes DeQuiros, a dedicated servant to the great people of West  Virginia. After a 34 year career, Edwin is retiring as an Immigration  Services Officer for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  Application Support Center office in Charleston, WV.   Edwin is a joy to work with and has served as a valuable and  consistent liaison between USCIS and my office. His goal is to try to  assist the customers to the best of his knowledge and experience but  not to the extent of compromising U.S. immigration laws and the USCIS  policies and regulations.   Born and raised in the Philippines, Edwin is no stranger to the legal  immigration process. In January of 1981, he married a young beautiful  woman from Charleston, WV. Based upon this marriage and her approved  immigration petition, the U.S. Embassy in Manila, Philippines, issued  an immigrant visa for him as the spouse of a U.S. citizen.   In September 1982, he and his wife, along with their then 10-month- old son, arrived in Los Angeles, CA. Finding a job in L.A. was  difficult and frustrating as a new immigrant with no work experience in  the United States in addition to not having a vehicle.   In November 1982, an experience he credits to the grace of God and  answered prayer, he was hired by the Broadway Department Store, sister  company of Neiman-Marcus, as a merchandise handler. His job was to  unload merchandise from the semi-trucks to the stockrooms. A year  later, he was promoted to a plainclothes loss prevention officer tasked  with arresting shoplifters. Two years later, he became the loss  prevention manager of the same store, and one of his duties was to  apprehend dishonest store employees. He became a naturalized citizen of  the United States in July of 1986.   In November 1987, he saw an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times  that the legacy INS--now the United States Citizenship and Immigration  Services--was hiring a Criminal Investigator/Special Agent. Edwin was  hired and became an INS Special Agent, attended the Immigration Officer  Basic Training Course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in  Brunswick, GA, and was assigned to various units--Fraud, Employer  Sanctions, Anti-Smuggling, Criminal Alien Apprehension Program, and the  Violent Gang Task Force--within the INS Investigation Branch.   Nine years later, he transferred to the INS Investigation Branch in  Charleston, WV, eventually named Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  ICE. During his time as an ICE Senior Special Agent, he was assigned to  investigate child pornography cases, import and export law violations,  and human trafficking/smuggling cases.   After more than 20 years of combined and exemplary service with  legacy INS and ICE, Edwin retired on September 29, 2008. Three days  later, he was hired on a government contract as a Special Deputy U.S.  Marshal with the U.S. Marshal Service in Charleston, WV. On January 30,  2012, he became an Immigration Services Officer for the United States  Citizenship and Immigration Services' Application Support Center office  in Charleston, WV.   Edwin and his wife of 40 years, Christine, are the parents of two  children, Adrian and Jeremy. In retirement, they will enjoy time with  family, riding their road bikes, traveling and walking the trail paths  along the Kanawha River. Edwin truly believes that wherever God leads  him and however he serves Him, he can be used by God to help others  shine His light. We thank Edwin for his service and for shining his  light for those on the immigration path. It is a pleasure to call Edwin  DeQuiros a fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
