 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Can you say ``slush fund''? OCO is basically a slush fund.   The idea was, oh, we went to war--more than a decade ago--and we  couldn't anticipate the expenses, so Congress passed an overseas  contingency account. It is not very well supervised by Congress, and as  you heard earlier, the Pentagon can't even account for the funds that  go in there.   But now, here we are. We can certainly anticipate what is going on  next year and the year after with the Pentagon. Why isn't it going  through the regular process within the Pentagon budget and with full  scrutiny by the United States Congress and, God forbid, maybe even  auditable? Imagine that.   The only agency of the Federal Government which is unable to pass an  audit is the Pentagon.   About a decade ago, I got an amendment on the floor to require an  audit, but it got taken out in a conference committee. What are they  afraid of in accounting for the dollars they get? And this is the least  accountable of all the dollars they get.   This is a modest reduction, and it would restore funding to the 2019  levels. You should vote for this amendment.
