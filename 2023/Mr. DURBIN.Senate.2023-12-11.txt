 Mr. President, over the weekend, I joined Senator Tim  Kaine of Virginia on a trip to Guatemala and Honduras. With us were  Senators Merkley, Butler, Welch as well as Guatemalan-American  Congresswomen Torres of California and Ramirez of Illinois.   Both Guatemala and Honduras have struggled with conflict, corruption,  stark inequality, and fragile democratic governments.   Many of us have forgotten that until the 1980s, much of Latin America  was led by military dictators, sometimes with Cold War-era support from  the United States.   Guatemala's bloody 36-year civil war only ended in 1996. It is a  reminder of why the U.S. attention to this region's nascent and often  fragile democracies is so important.   Guatemala is facing a deeply challenging Presidential transition. In  October, Bernardo Arevalo won in a decisive landslide election where he  pledged to tackle endemic corruption. Early polls showed him at 3  percent of the vote. When the final election took place, he won by 20  percent, a 1 million vote plurality, but outgoing President Giammattei,  and Attorney General Porras are, unfortunately, attempting to undermine  that peaceful transition ahead of the January 14 inauguration.   I might add that unlike other elections in Central and South America,  this election where Mr. Arevalo prevailed was monitored by  international sources, and the votes were challenged in court, counted,  and found to be still in his favor, overwhelmingly.   In fact, shortly after President Giammattei didn't show up for a  meeting with us one morning, his government crudely tried to annul the  recent election results. This clumsy coup attempt--which was globally  rejected--must not succeed. The Guatemalan voters' choice must be  respected.   I want to raise the attention of the Senate to two Guatemalan  political prisoners we asked about but were denied an opportunity to  visit in prison, former prosecutor Virginia Laparra and journalist Jose  Ruben Zamora. You won't be surprised to hear that both focused on  issues of corruption, which is why they landed in jail on nonsense  charges.   I look forward to working with the new President-elect, Arevalo, once  he is sworn in, and hope their release will be one of his early  actions.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Richard E.N. Federico to the United States Court of Appeals for the  Tenth Circuit.   Born in Richmond, IN, Mr. Federico earned his B.A.J. from Indiana  University in 1999, his J.D. from the University of Kansas School of  Law in 2002, and his L.L.M. from Georgetown University in 2012.   Since 2003, Mr. Federico has served the Navy in various positions  both in the United States and abroad. More specifically, he has served  as: trial counsel in Trial Service Office East of Naval Station  Norfolk; director of military justice and trial counsel in the U.S.  Regional Legal Service Office of Europe and Southwest Asia in Naples,  Italy; defense counsel in the Office of the Chief Defense Counsel in  the Office of Military Commissions; executive officer, senior defense  counsel, and officer in charge at Naval Station Mayport in  Jacksonville, FL; appellate defense counsel in the Appellate Defense  Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General in Washington, DC;  military judge in the Navy-Marine Corps Trial Judiciary; and trial  counsel for the Navy Reserve Region Legal Service Office Southwest at  Navy Base San Diego.   Between 2015 and 2017, he served as an assistant federal public  defender in the Federal Public Defender's Office for the District of  Oregon. In 2019, Mr. Federico was designated and certified by the Judge  Advocate General of the Navy as a military judge. Throughout his naval  career, on Active Duty and in the Reserves, he has also been detailed  to serve in a quasi-judicial capacity as a preliminary hearing officer.  Mr. Federico has been detailed to preside over 11 court-martial cases.  Since 2020, Mr. Federico has served as senior litigator in the Federal  Public Defender's Office for the District of Kansas. He previously  served the office as an assistant Federal public defender and as a  research and writing specialist. Throughout his career, Mr. Federico  has tried dozens of cases to verdict in U.S. district courts and in  military courts-martial, and he has also filed and argued several  appeals.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr. Federico as ``well  qualified,'' and his nomination is strongly supported by his home State  Senators, Mr. Moran and Mr. Marshall.   I am confident that Mr. Federico will serve honorably on the Tenth  Circuit. I proudly support his nomination.                         Vote on Federico nomination.     I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin),  the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the  Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse), and the Senator from Oregon  (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 304.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.
