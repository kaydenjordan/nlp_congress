 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Mrs. Anne Cox Chambers, who passed away on January 31 at the  age of 100.   Her friends and family remember Mrs. Chambers as a wonderful, kind,  and elegant lady, whose influence spanned the globe.   An influential businesswoman, legendary philanthropist, and dedicated  public servant, her many talents included co-owning the family media  company, Cox Enterprises, for 33 years, and serving as the United  States ambassador to Belgium.   Mrs. Chambers was Atlanta's first female bank director, as well as  the first woman to serve as a director of the Atlanta Chamber of  Commerce. Mrs. Chambers was also a director of The Coca-Cola Company.   Mrs. Chambers supported many causes anonymously, but was especially  dedicated to the arts with her contributions to the High Museum of Art.   A force to be reckoned with who made Atlanta and the world a better  place, Mrs. Chambers will be dearly missed. Her family and friends are  in my thoughts and prayers during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
