 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1620, the Chesapeake Bay  Program Reauthorization Act.   H.R. 1620 represents good governance to reauthorize the Chesapeake  Bay Program and passed out of the committee with strong bipartisan  support.   The Chesapeake Bay watershed is one of the largest estuaries in the  United States, covering 64,000 square miles; is home to more than 18  million people; hosts two major ports as major international gateways  for trade; and produces about 500 million pounds of seafood each year,  some of which I enjoyed just the other day.   I want to thank Members for their continued support for the  restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, including Mr. Wittman of Virginia,  Mr. Riggleman of Virginia, and Mr. Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. I know  this issue is very important to their districts, their constituencies,  and to the entire region and, frankly, the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to think of what Mr. Wittman and our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle stated; that this Chesapeake  Bay, it is a tremendous resource to our Nation, recreational  opportunities, the shipping opportunities in it, never mind the  wonderful seafood.   I urge support of this bipartisan piece of legislation by all  Members, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4031. H.R. 4031 is a critical bill to  reauthorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an initiative near  and dear to my heart and the Great Lakes Caucus.   The Great Lakes, as was noted, is the largest system of fresh surface  water in the world. The GLRI, as it is known, has been a catalyst for  unprecedented partnership between Federal, State, and local agencies  for years to improve the ecosystem, to improve water quality, and to  support the economy of the entire Great Lakes region and the Nation.   H.R. 4031 has broad and bipartisan support with nearly 50 cosponsors,  and I am proud to be one of those cosponsors. I thank our Members for  continued support for the restoration of our Great Lakes. This issue is  very important to my district and many other Members' districts in our  Congress here.   The Great Lakes have an incredible impact on our region's way of life  that cannot be overstated. At one point in time when I was younger, we  actually had a license plate that called Michigan the Water Wonderland  because of the importance of the Great Lakes on our State.   States all along the Great Lakes rely on them as a freshwater  resource, a driver of our local and national economy, and a world- renowned recreation destination. It impacts from Minnesota all the way  to New York.   In my home State of Michigan, we have the most Great Lakes shoreline  of any State, with more than 3,000 miles of our State shaped by four of  the five Great Lakes. My district is nearly surrounded by the Great  Lakes system.   The projects that the GLRI makes possible have a proven track record  of success and impact in our communities.   Take the Marysville shoreline in Michigan's 10th District, my home  district, as an example. The GLRI provided the funds to remove a  failing seawall and replace it with a natural, sloping shore.   Additionally, further south of my district, the restoration of  wetlands in the Harsens Island area provided habitat for waterfowl and  fish that had been destroyed over the years.   These projects resulted in the creation of jobs in the region,  habitat restoration for wildlife, and a pathway for people to walk  along the river or the lake, to view and enjoy it. This is one of the  countless examples that highlights the importance of the GLRI for Great  Lakes communities like mine and throughout the region.   GLRI investments have delivered great outcomes, but there is more  work to be done to protect our Great Lakes, including stopping the  spread of invasive species, like Asian carp; protecting our drinking  water, a critical and urgent need; and restoring habitat loss.   I have advocated for GLRI since I arrived here and recently spoke  with the President about the importance of the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative. It is crucial that Congress continues to authorize this  program that protects and restores the Great Lakes. It, like many other  estuaries we have talked about today, is a national treasure that our  country relies on for drinking water, commerce, and more.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4031 offers a chance to continue this support. I  urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my colleague and the co-chair of the  Great Lakes Task Force.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the balance of time on  both sides, please.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), another colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me close with this: This bill passed committee with strong  bipartisan support. As my colleagues have noted, including Mrs.  Walorski, recreational use of the Great Lakes is an important component  of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.   As I close, I would like to quote the immortal words of country  superstar, Craig Morgan. It is a little unusual, but I think it is  appropriate today.    He said in a song:       I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake      We're headed out to a special place we love      That just a few folks know      There's no signin' up, no monthly dues      Take your Johnson, your Mercury or your Evinrude and fire it             up      Meet us out at party cove      Come on in; the water's fine      Just idle on over, and toss us a line    Support reauthorization of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4275. H.R. 4275 represents  good governance to reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration  Program. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin watershed is home to  approximately 2.2 million people and covers 5,000 square miles.   In June of last year when the Subcommittee on Water Resources and  Environment held a hearing on many of these regional watershed  programs, we invited Ms. Kristi Trail from the Lake Pontchartrain Basin  Foundation to testify on the need and importance of reauthorizing this  program.   During that hearing, we heard that Lake Pontchartrain and its  surrounding watershed play an integral part of the wetland ecosystem of  the Gulf Coast, contributing over $35 million to the local economy.   As a result of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation's work through  this program, the lake is making a tremendous comeback by constructing  multiple reefs for fish habitats, improving previously impaired water  bodies, and growing their community outreach programs.   I would like to thank Mr. Garret Graves, the sponsor of this bill,  for putting this forward and for his support.   I also would like to recognize the fact that we limit the EPA's  administration to 5 percent. So the money goes to restore Lake  Pontchartrain.   For these reasons and numerous others, I urge support of this program  and this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Graves of Louisiana,  and all sponsors in support of this bill. As I indicated earlier, it  has bipartisan support of the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
