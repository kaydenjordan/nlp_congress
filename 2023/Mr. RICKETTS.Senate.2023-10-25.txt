 Mr. President, I am here today to join my senior  Senator to celebrate this historic achievement for our State of  Nebraska and women's athletics.   Nebraskans, we love our sports. And we are particularly proud of the  University of Nebraska-Lincoln Cornhuskers. Today, I especially want to  point out our pride in the UNL women's volleyball program. As my senior  Senator just recognized, they are the No. 1 team in the Nation. We have  had five national championships in volleyball in the State of Nebraska.  It is the third most in the NCAA. That is also as many national  championships as we have had for our college football team. The  volleyball program has nine former Olympians. The Husker women have  also played on the U.S. National Team. In fact, three of them are on  that team right now. They are also pioneers in name, image, and  likeness.   As my senior Senator pointed out, we just beat the previous No. 1,  undefeated University of Wisconsin Badgers on Saturday night in a five- set thriller that lived up to its billing as the match of the century.  In 2022, our volleyball team led the Nation with an average attendance  of 8,190 fans per game. We have had 314 consecutive sellouts in the  regular season. And for the last nine consecutive seasons, we have led  the Nation in attendance.   But earlier this year, Nebraskans helped the women's volleyball  program reach a new height, a world record. It was Volleyball Day in  Nebraska: 92,003 of the best fans in sports jammed into Memorial  Stadium to watch four women's volleyball programs highlight their  talent. The Wayne State College Wildcats took on the University of  Nebraska at Kearney Lopers, and the  [[Page S5172]]  Omaha Mavericks took on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Cornhuskers.  The eyes of the entire world were focused on Memorial Stadium.   Right in my home State of Nebraska, we had the most highly attended  women's sporting event in the world ever. As Omaha World-Herald  columnist Tom Shatel wrote:         Volleyball Day in Nebraska may be the biggest Title IX       statement of all time.    Volleyball Day demonstrated just how much progress we have made in  providing equal opportunity to our daughters, granddaughters, and  sisters in sports. Title IX was about leveling the playing field for  women's athletics. And for over 50 years, it has done just that. And,  of course, this is more than just about sports for many of these women.  Athletics have been a pathway for scholarships, educational  opportunities, and career pathways.   The University of Nebraska also prides itself in instilling life  skills into its student athletes. The Huskers Women's Volleyball  Program has been filled with remarkable student athletes in the truest  sense of the word. They lead the Nation with 40 volleyball Academic  All-Americans as part of a nation-leading 351 Academic All-Americans in  all sports. They also have three NCAA volleyball Elite 90 award  winners.   The players are the stars. But, of course, you can't have a good team  without a good coach. The Nebraska women's volleyball program has a  great one in Coach John Cook. Coach Cook has been a part of the  Nebraska volleyball family for 23 years. During that time, the team has  made the NCAA playoffs every single year. Under his eye, the women's  volleyball team has won four national championships. And in September  of 2022, Coach Cook celebrated his 800th career coaching win.   The Huskers' tagline is: ``In our grit, our glory.'' Volleyball Day  in Nebraska and a new world record in attendance at a women's sporting  event is the epitome of this motto.   Congratulations to everyone at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln  whose grit made Volleyball Day possible and to all the other programs  who participated.   I also want to thank vice chancellor and athletic director Trev  Alberts and his team for their efforts. Thanks also to Coach Cook and  his staff, and most especially, thank you to the women of the  University of Nebraska volleyball program. You have given us something  very special to be proud of. Truly, there is no place like Nebraska.  Nebraska is what America is supposed to be.   And, finally, thank you to the senior Senator from Nebraska for  introducing this resolution. I am proud to join you in recognizing this  great achievement.   I yield back.
