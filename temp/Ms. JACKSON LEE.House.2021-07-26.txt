 Madam Speaker, I am here to anchor this Special  Order on the fierce urgency of preserving the precious right to vote by  passing H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and  legislation like H.R. 1, For The People.   I am delighted to be co-anchoring this Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order at the request of our tireless leader for justice,  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty of Ohio, and to be joined by my co-anchor,  Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York, and many other members of the  Congressional Black Caucus.   Fifty-six years ago, in a century that was close to a hundred years  after the Emancipation Proclamation and the rendition of the 15th  Amendment, the very right to vote, there we were fighting with this  beloved Member of Congress, who challenged us to get into good trouble,  fighting in 1965, pursuant to the collapse of the understanding of the  15th Amendment, fighting for the right to vote again.   Madam Speaker, here we are today, 2021, now 56 years after the 1965  Voting Rights Act, fighting for the right to vote.   I want to make sure that I pay tribute to Our Power, Our Message, led  by the Honorable Joyce Beatty, who does not only speak her words, but  she acts on her words, how proud we were. But I am sure pride is not  what she wants us to feel as she walked down this difficult road here  in Washington, D.C., to be able to express, with Black women and  others, that we have a fierce sense of urgency, and was arrested, just  about two weeks ago, in the name of voting rights.   So let me, for a moment, read to you out of the book that has just  been published by a dear, beloved friend, ``Carry On.'' I use this book  in the Rules Committee, when there seems to have been a challenge to  helping the impoverished. I concluded my remarks, when I was giving  amendments, to help the impoverished to carry on.   But on the issue of justice, these are his words: ``We must practice  what we preach. If we believe in life and liberty, then we should not  defer the dream of equality and justice''--the right to vote--``under  the law for people of color. We must use the system of government to  improve our laws and to make our society fairer and more just. While no  one bill can right the many wrongs, we can stitch together partial  solutions to deal with the complex societal issues that lead to  systemic bias and inequality.''   That is why we stand here today. We are stitching together a response  to the collapse of voting rights in America. We are stitching together  laws that will deal with the mass of suppression laws being passed in  State legislatures across America. We are stitching together a response  for those brave Texas Democratic representatives who are here in  Washington, D.C., who are begging us to pass H.R. 1 and S. 1 and of  course we have passed H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act.                                time  2015    Let me just briefly say that serious damage to the precious right to  vote occasioned by the rightwing conservative majority on the Supreme  Court demands that the Congress exercise its powers under section 5 of  the 15th Amendment to restore the extraordinary reach and effectiveness  of section 2 and section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The 15th Amendment  said that no law, no State legislature should abridge the right to vote  on the basis of discrimination of race and color and ethnicity and that  the Congress should stand up and provide the relief and the answer.   Did you hear, Madam Speaker? The Congress. And the Congressional  Black Caucus has said that, not only with their words but with their  bodies. Hank Johnson was just arrested last week, Congressman Hank  Johnson.   So the objection to the VRA and their opponents is without substance.  I have long said that the States that were subject to preclearance  under the Voting Rights Act earned their way into so doing by  discriminatory laws.   Madam Speaker, June 25, 2021, marked the eighth anniversary of the  Supreme Court's infamous decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which  immobilized the Department of Justice from subjecting discriminatory  voting and election laws to the preclearance.   On August 6 will be the commemoration of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  56 years. And look at the predicament we are in.   Later on in this debate I will recount all the times we voted for the  Voting Rights Act. Madam Speaker, it was bipartisan. It was across  racial lines, regional lines, because we knew it was the right thing to  do.   So tonight we stand on what is right. We stand on good trouble. We  stand on making the decision that not the  [[Page H3892]]  Shelby case, not the Arizona case. The Arizona case is Brnovich v. DNC  that dashes section 2, and frankly says, by one of the justices, that a  little bit of discrimination is okay. Not on the watch of the  Congressional Black Caucus and all of my colleagues, because voting  rights belongs to every single person in this Congress and to their  constituents.   Why would they want to deny the implementation and the substance of  the Constitution and the 15th Amendment?   So here we are tonight to be able to explain to the American public  and our colleagues that we cannot wait any longer for H.R. 4 or H.R. 1,  S. 1, S. 4, and we are here tonight to tell our story.   It is my pleasure and certainly my privilege, as we continue to tell  our story, and as I continue to weave in that story, to yield to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Beatty), who, again, has spoken with her  actions, not just her words, the Chair of the Congressional Black  Caucus, senior member and chairwoman on the Financial Services  Committee, and, again, someone who showed the Nation that it is both  our message and our power by being arrested in the name of the fight  for equality, getting into a little good trouble.   I am sure John Lewis, rest in power, is looking down on us.    Madam Speaker, I thank the Chairwoman of the  Congressional Black Caucus for her powerful words. And, yes, thank her  for acknowledging the women who stood in the gap, including Melanie  Campbell and Reverend Barbara Williams Skinner and Clayola Brown, and  Tamika, who has been at the forefront as well, and many, many others  that have, likewise, been at the forefront. We are pleased to be able  to join in their leadership as well.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, let me ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Torres), a gentleman who now walks in history, who knows his  history, and who is prepared to fight against that history that should  never be repeated, my coanchor, who has eloquently articulated what was  in General Granger's Order No. 3, and that is the equality of rights.    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from New York for opening the pathway. We may have him continue to  explore that journey, which I will take up, and that is the question of  the filibuster. Someone described it as busting things up and busting  good things up.   We know that there has to be a solution to those who have argued  that, in fact, they are about the institution of the other body; they  are about the integrity of the other body. I would argue that where  blood has been shed so that people have died so that people might vote,  it is not the integrity of the institution. It is the life and death of  voting rights, not only for people of color, but for this Nation.   A man who has argued eloquently about the filibuster and a resolve of  our next steps, but also recognizes historically, not only the civil  rights journey but the fundamental right of voting that should not be  hindered or undermined is our majority whip, and we are very grateful  for his leadership and his historical perspective and his current  understanding of how we have to get the job done.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn).    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from South Carolina for his comments. He clearly acted, as I indicated,  and that is, he presented the history, but he brought us to the 21st  century and 2021. I think the challenge that we are now offering to the  American people, incredulously, how can anyone try to undermine the  votes of any American, and particularly those Americans of color?   As I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, let me at least  just depict for a moment the uniqueness of our history, for this  picture is a picture  [[Page H3894]]  of a whipped, beaten back of a slave. That means that we had  extraordinary conditions, extraordinary circumstances. In the 1800s  preceding and around the Emancipation Proclamation, I will just read  these words as I yield: Congress put forward the 15th Amendment and it  made it very clear that:         No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or       standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied       by any State or political subdivision in a manner which       results in a denial or abridgement of the rights of any       citizen of the United States to vote on the account of race,       or color, or language minority status.    This was coming out of slavery when they had the 13th Amendment that  eliminated slavery but didn't eliminate stigma and institutional  racism, gave due process, and then gave the right to vote out of the  history of what is depicted here. That is why this is so serious that  an institutional rule cannot survive over the right to vote, and the  big lie cannot supersede the right to vote.   It is my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams), who is a historian and professor in her own right and  spent her life's work teaching at historically Black colleges which  were born out of the seeds or born out of the quagmire and the fires of  slavery but born to make a difference. She has been a champion for the  HBCUs and understands what the denial of the vote and voting rights  means to that constituency.                                time  2045     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  pointed message about North Carolina and her district. I think I join  her. My district is a voting rights district, so we know what it is to  be at the edge of surviving.   The only way that we have survived is with the protection of the 1965  Voting Rights Act. We are living testimony that it is crucial to the  vast diversity that has been created in this House on behalf of the  American people.   Madam Speaker, let me now take the pleasure of yielding to another  distinguished Member who has had her own history in a very unique  State.   Someone asked the question: Is it Southern? Is it Northern? I think  you only have to hear her--and, of course, the President of the United  States, who is a very forthright leader. President Joe Biden and Vice  President Harris have been forthright in confronting issues that have  been meant to help the American people heal and unite. She has been  right in the mix and, as well, has been a leader on labor issues, a  leader on healthcare issues. But one thing she knows is the depth of  disparity that plagues a community when voting is extinguished.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. Blunt  Rochester).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  mentioning Bob Moses.   For those of us who care and know about history, we know about Bob  Moses, and it makes this night even more significant because if you are  losing the peaceful warriors who helped organize and put themselves on  the line, then we must carry on. I thank the gentlewoman from Delaware.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, let me make an argument regarding  where we are, and then I will be happy to yield to my coanchor and  happy to conclude.   Madam Speaker, I wanted to reemphasize where we are today and  reemphasize that, unfortunately, a bill that had been passed as  bipartisan for years has been ``upheavaled'' by the Supreme Court.  Unfortunately, a Supreme Court that, as my friend from New York  described, is an activist Supreme Court--the Shelby Court and now the  Brnovich Court, absolutely wrongheaded decisions.   In Shelby, I believe the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that  you don't throw away an umbrella in a rainstorm.   Now, let me characterize these words and not attribute them. I think  one of the other points that was made is: Just because polio is not on  the rise, you don't get rid of the polio vaccine. Just because you  think COVID-19 is gone, you don't throw all manner of precautions to  the wind.   Obviously, we see what is happening with this kind of reckless  behavior and this kind of red State, blue State discord. People are  dying.   That is where we are with voting rights. The Shelby case in 2013 just  imploded the preclearance, which in actuality says that as you begin to  think about a bill that may have these discriminatory impacts, they can  be precleared by the Department of Justice and stopped in their tracks.  Section 2 says the harm has been done, and you can run into court  making the argument that it is discriminatory.   Tragically, all we were left with, before the Brnovich case, was  section 2. But here, what has happened in this case that came out of  Arizona--a place where the big lie is playing out every day with a  false and misleading and disreputable vote count. To my colleague, I  don't know what they found yet, but it is certainly one that has no  basis in fact.   The Court in Brnovich suggested that they would have something called  guideposts--I call them burdens or suggestions--that when reviewing  claims that are facially so-called neutral election policy, practice,  or voting rule, and it is discriminating, you can look at these  aspects.   You can burden us by saying, ``Here is what you look at.'' Are they  ordinary burdens or mere inconvenience exception, the size of  disparities and burdens imposed by the challenge rule, other  opportunities to vote provided by a State's election system.   So, the polls are closed. You can't do a mail ballot. You don't have  Souls to the Polls. So, just find some other way to vote.   That is the question. They say, ``other opportunities to vote.'' You  close out all the other supporting aspects of voting, and maybe you can  get to vote in a snowstorm. Maybe you can get to vote as a military  person in battle. Maybe you can show up to the voting poll on election  day because that is another opportunity. Maybe you can get on a plane  and leave battle to vote. These are the just nonsensical aspects of the  Brnovich case.   Legitimate State interests justifying the challenge voting rule--oh,  there is a State interest to close your polling locations in minority  neighborhoods, to not have places to get a voter ID in eight counties  in Texas when you have a law that says you must have a voting ID, or to  close out Souls to the Polls, a perfectly legal concept to allow people  who work around the clock through a Sunday to go vote. I guess you  would tell them to just find another opportunity.   When we were in the middle of COVID-19 and nurses and doctors were  working around the clock, Harris County said: We will give you 24-hour  voting.   Legally, law enforcement present, machines in order, no fraud  detected at all, but you are fighting COVID, and you might not get off  until 1 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m.   Yet, this is what the big lie brings about, and then the degree to  which a voting rule departs from what was a standard practice when  section 2 was amended in 1982.   Now, the crisis of this is that all of this must be run down for you  to be able to prevail under section 2, under the Brnovich case.   Taken together, this Supreme Court cabal is saying to racial, ethnic,  and language minorities already intimidated--and you need to look at  what John Lewis faced in 1965, this brunt force, law enforcement on  horses chasing foot soldiers back over the bridge, 8-year-olds running  for their lives, and bloodied older persons, foot soldiers, and John  Robert Lewis, who said he thought he was going to die.                                time  2100    That is what sacrifice has been made for voting. Taken together, this  court decision is saying: What is the big deal? It is only voting. Just  like with bad weather, sometimes you just have to grin and bear it and  have a little inconvenience. Just a little bit of discrimination. Why  are you concerned about that?   And so I assume that without the 24th amendment, that this  conservative majority and the court will subject poll taxes and  literacy tests to the review standard enunciated in Brnovich. Just a  little bit of inconvenience. Take that money out and pay that poll tax.  You don't have any money? I guess your fundamental right to vote has  just been extinguished.   That is where we are today. That is why we are here today challenging  the filibuster, speaking about the Federalist papers nullification, and  trying to understand that the Constitution prevails over all of these  miserly bills across the Nation. The 15th amendment and then the  Constitution statement, very clearly says that Congress, that no one  can nullify or stop your rights as a person that is elected to Congress  because they have no rights.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article, an op-ed, that I  submitted on June 26, 2021, authored by myself.    Where GOP Lawmakers Have Passed New Voting Restrictions Around the                                  Country         Republican state legislators have introduced hundreds of       bills that would tighten access to voting around the country,       many of them echoing former president Donald Trump's false       claims that loose election laws allowed fraud to taint the       2020 White House race.        The groundswell began early this year with the introduction       of 253 bills proposing voting restrictions across 43 states       as of mid-February, according to the nonpartisan Brennan       Center for Justice. That number rose to at least 389 bills in       48 states as of mid-May.        The national spotlight is now on Texas after Democratic       lawmakers left the state on July 12 in an effort to block       passage of one of the most stringent new voting measures in       the country. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said the members       could face arrest when they return, which is not expected       until the state's special legislative session concludes--      potentially as late as Aug. 7.        Across the country, 17 states have enacted laws this year       that tighten the rules around casting ballots and running       elections, according to the nonpartisan Voting Rights Lab,       which tracks developments in state election law.        Many of the bills target mail voting and other policies       that helped safeguard the franchise during the coronavirus       pandemic and produce the highest turnout among American       voters in more than a century.        Some of the bills also seek to curtail early voting, impose       restrictions on voter registration efforts, limit the power       of local officials to oversee elections and stop private       donors from supplementing their operational budgets.        Democratic-controlled states have moved in the other       direction, approving measures to formalize more permissive       voting policies from 2020, complementing proposed federal       legislation to protect voting rights with a set of national       standards.        In addition to the states listed below, Alabama, Arkansas,       Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, New       Hampshire, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming have       also passed laws with restrictive language.  [[Page H3896]]                    STATES WITH SIGNIFICANT NEW VOTING RESTRICTIONS       Arizona--Enacted May 11 and June 30        Republicans in Arizona changed the state's popular       Permanent Early Voting List, which determines who receives       mail ballots each election cycle.        The new rules mean voters who do not cast a ballot at least       once every two years will have to respond to a government       notice to avoid being removed from the list and to continue       getting a ballot in the mail.        Another measure, signed into law on June 30, stripped power       from Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, allowed third       parties designated by the legislature to flag ineligible       voters for removal from the rolls and provided funds for       election security and post-election recounts.      Florida--Enacted May 6        New state law signed May 6 institutes a number of changes,       including requiring voters to renew their mail voting       application every two years and to submit a form of       identification.        With some exceptions, voters' access to drop boxes for       returning mail ballots will be limited to early voting hours,       a maximum of 12 hours per day.        If any drop box is found to be accessible outside of these       hours, the local supervisor of elections could be subject to       a civil penalty of $25,000.        Voters will be permitted to drop off only two ballots for       nonfamily members.        The law gives partisan election observers more access to       the ballot counting process.        It also prevents behavior undertaken with the ``intent'' of       influencing a voter, so the law is likely to bar efforts to       provide food and water to people waiting in line to cast in-      person ballots.        Donations to election budgets from private individuals are       also not allowed.      Georgia--Enacted March 25        Georgia's new voting law signed by Gov. Brian Kemp (R) on       March 25 imposes a number of restrictions on voting in the       state, earning it comparisons to the Jim Crow laws that       effectively blocked Black men and women from voting in the       American South.        Specifically, the rules prevent proactively sending mail       ballot applications to voters, require voters to submit       identification with their application to be approved and       shorten the time frame for the application process to take       place.        Like several other states, Georgia added new restrictions       on the use of mail ballot drop boxes and prohibited providing       food or water to people waiting in line to vote in person.       Legislators also stripped certain powers from the secretary       of state, removing that official as chair of the State       Election Board and allowing the General Assembly to select       his or her replacement.      Iowa--Enacted March 8        New Iowa voting law shortens the application period for       mail ballots and bars election officials from proactively       sending application forms to voters.        County auditors can face criminal charges if they do not       follow certain procedures in purging voter rolls.        The early voting period--and voting hours on Election Day       are shorter.        Local officials' discretion in placing drop boxes is       curtailed.                        What to watch in coming weeks       Texas        One of the most restrictive voting bills in the country was       defeated--at least temporarily--in Texas on May 30, when a       Democratic walkout in the state House caused the chamber to       miss the deadline for passage.        The GOP bills would empower partisan poll watchers and       impose stiff penalties on election administrators for actions       such as sending unsolicited mail ballot applications to       voters.        Comparing the legislation to Jim Crow laws, critics have       said it would disproportionately affect people of color.        The measures would prohibit drive-up voting and other       methods used widely by Black and Latino voters in Houston to       cast ballots during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as       create strict signature-matching rules that could force the       rejection of valid votes cast by mail.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Torres), my co-anchor, and I thank him again for his joining  me tonight, and for our journey that we are on trying to raise up  justice in this country.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York.  I am so glad he said the words ``by any means necessary.'' That is  striking, and without a doubt, the approach of the activist Supreme  Court, right-wing, of the big lies, and of those who wish to stall and  stop the very lifeline of American democracy, and that is the right of  each person to vote their conscious.   As we have said: Our message, our power; but our voice, our vote; our  vote, our voice. And I thank him for joining me this evening for  elaborating and detailing and roll-calling where we are today.   I notice the gentleman did not step in the breach and indicate that  we might need to expand the Court. That is another discussion  altogether.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush), a member of the Judiciary  Committee. I think she can speak in her own way on the vitality of a  vote for poor people.    I thank the gentlewoman. Madam Speaker, thank you  for recognizing me to anchor this Special Order on the fierce urgency  of preserving the precious right to vote by passing H.R. 4, the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and legislation like H.R. 1, the  For The People Act.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 26, 2021, on page H3897, the following appeared: Thank you,  Madam Speaker for recognizing      The online version has been corrected to read:   I thank the gentlewoman. Madam Speaker, thank you for recognizing    ========================= END NOTE =========================      I am delighted to be co-anchoring this Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order at the request of our tireless leader for justice,  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty of Ohio, and to be joined by co-anchor,  Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York, and many members of the CBC.   Before I begin, Madam Speaker, let me share some history and  important numbers with our colleagues and the nation that show for most  of the past 56 years, support for the Voting Rights Act and protecting,  preserving, and expanding the right to vote of all Americans has been  an issue that Americans have supported in overwhelming numbers all  across the nation.   On July 9, 1965, House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85 vote,  with Democrats voting 221-61 and Republicans 112-24.   House later approved the VRA conference report on August 3 by a 328- 74 vote (Democrats 217-54, Republicans 111-20).   The Senate passed the VRA on August 4 by a 79-18 vote, with Democrats  voting 49-17 and Republicans 30-1.   This landmark legislation, P.L. 89-10, was signed into law by  President Lyndon Johnson as on August 6, 1965.   Five years later, on June 22, 1970, the VRA was renewed for five  years as Public Law 91-285, passing the House by a vote of 272-132 and  the Senate by a vote of 64-12.   Five years later, on June 4, 1975, Congress extended the VRA for  seven years, enacting Public Law 94-73, with majorities of 341-70 in  the House and 77-12 in the Senate.   On June 29, 1982, a Republican-controlled Senate joined with a  Democratic House to pass Public Law 97-205, extending the VRA for 10  years, with the vote in the Senate of 85-8 and the vote in the House of  389-24.   Ten years later, the bipartisan Voting Rights Language Assistance Act  was passed as Public Law 102-344 on August 26, 1992.   And on July 27, 2006, the Voting Rights Act was extended for 25 years  when the Congress passed Public Law 109-246 (H.R. 9), the Fannie Lou  Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act  Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.   The vote for H.R. 9 was 390-33 in the House and 98-0 in the Senate.   Madam Speaker, every extension of the Voting Rights Act recounted  above was signed into law by a Republican President, from Richard Nixon  to Gerald Ford to Ronald Reagan to George H.W. Bush, and George W.  Bush.   This chain of bipartisan support for voting rights stood solid and  unbreakable until the Supreme Court's horrendous decision in Shelby  County v. Holder 570 U.S. 529 (2013).                   PROTECTING AND PRESERVING VOTING RIGHTS    Madam Speaker, the serious damage to the precious right to vote  occasioned by the right-wing, conservative majority on the Supreme  Court demands that Congress exercise its powers under Section 5 of the  15th Amendment to restore the extraordinary reach and effectiveness of  Section 2 and Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.   As an aside, Madam Speaker, on the objection of VRA opponents to  states subject preclearance having the burden to bail themselves out, I  have long said that the states that were subject to preclearance under  the Voting Rights Act earned their way in, so it only fitting that they  earn their way out.   Madam Speaker, June 25, 2021, marked the 8th anniversary of the  Supreme Court's infamous decision in Shelby County v Holder, 570 U.S.  529 (2013), which immobilized the Department of Justice from subjecting  discriminatory voting and election law changes to prior review and  approval, or ``preclearance.''   It was predicted at the time by me and other defenders of the  precious right to vote that the Court's misguided and naive decision  would usher in a wave of state and local initiatives intended to  suppress and nullify the rights of black Americans, persons of color,  young adults, and marginalized communities to exercise the most basic  act in the political process: voting.   As we have seen in recent months, this prediction has tragically come  to pass.   Not to be content with the monument to disgrace that is the Shelby  decision, the activist right-wing conservative majority on the Roberts  Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil twin, the decision in the  Arizona case of Brnovoich v. DNC, 594 U.S. _, No. 19-1257 and 19-1258  (July 1, 2021), which engrafts on Section 2 of the Voting Rights  onerous burdens that Congress never intended and explicitly legislated  against to ensure that:   ``No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,  practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or  political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or  abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on  account of race or color, or language minority status.''   Among these burdens, couched as ``guideposts,'' or ``suggestions''  are that when reviewing claims that a facially neutral election law,  policy, practice, or voting rule has a discriminator, and therefore  unlawful, effect on minority citizens, courts are to consider the  following matters:   1. An ``ordinary burdens'' or ``mere inconvenience'' exception;   2. Size of disparities in burdens imposed by the challenged rule;   3. Other opportunities to vote provided by a state's election system;   4. Legitimate state interests justifying the challenged voting rule;  and   5. The degree to which a voting rule departs from what was standard  practice when Section 2 was amended in 1982   Taken together, this Supreme Court cabal is saying to racial, ethnic,  and language minorities: ``What's the big deal, it's only voting. Just  like with bad weather, sometimes you just have grin and bear a little  inconvenience.''   This Supreme Court majority has simply never understood, or refuses  to accept, the fundamental importance of the right to vote, free of  discriminatory hurdles and obstacles.   Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th Amendment, I venture to say  that this conservative majority on the Court would subject poll taxes  and literacy tests to the review standard enunciated in Brnovich v.  DNC.   Their predecessors on the Court understood this, going back at least  as far as 1938, when the Supreme Court held in Chief Justice Hughes'  famous Footnote 4 in United States v. Carolene Products, 304 U.S. 144  (1938), that government action alleged to discriminate against  ``discrete and insular minorities'' would be subject to ``strict  scrutiny'' by reviewing courts.   Madam Speaker, you might be asking who are these ``discrete and  insular minorities'' about whom the Court was referring?   The answer is they were and are persons ``excluded from ``those  political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect'' them,  racial and language minorities, and aliens, all of whom were denied the  single most important tool for protecting and advancing one's interests  in a democracy: the right to vote.   I ask unanimous consent to include in the record of this hearing, a  June 26, 2021 op-ed authored by me entitled ``A Strong Voting Rights  Act Is Needed Now More Than Ever.''   It is useful, Madam Speaker, to recount how we arrived at this day.   Madam Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of  heroic souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to  vote for all Americans by their participation in marches for voting  rights on ``Bloody Sunday,'' ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final,  completed march from Selma to Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women,  boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so  much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to  bring it even closer to its founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.  [[Page H3898]]    On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  demonstrators, including our beloved former colleague, the late  Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brutally attacked by state and  local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to  Montgomery in support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.   No one who witnessed the violence and brutally suffered by the foot  soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will ever  forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory and  experience.   On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol and in the presence  of such luminaries as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rev.  Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; Roy  Wilkins of the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National Urban League; James  Foreman of the Congress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of the  Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis of the Student Non- Violent Coordinating Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert  Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President Johnson addressed the nation  before signing the Voting Rights Act: ``The vote is the most powerful  instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and  destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are  different from other men.''   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter  discrimination violations that historically left millions of African  Americans disenfranchised.   In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans  registered to vote in Texas and only about 3 percent of African  Americans living in the South were registered to vote.   Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major  causes of these racially discriminatory results.   After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited  these discriminatory practices, registration and electoral  participation steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than  1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote.   In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were  approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just  three in Congress.   Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the  South.   Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 there were more than 9,100  black elected officials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest  number ever.   Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act opened the political process for  many of the approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials that have  been elected and appointed nationwide, including more than 275 at the  state or federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress.   Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered  harsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited  greatly.   As I indicated, the crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is  Section 5, which requires that states and localities with a chronic  record of discrimination in voting practices secure federal approval  before making any changes to voting processes.   Section 5 has protected minority voting rights where voter  discrimination has historically been the worst.   Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped more than 1,000  discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107  discriminatory changes right here in Texas.   Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary leadership of President Lyndon  Johnson, the greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dramatic change in many states across  the South.   But in 1972, change was not coming fast enough or in many places in  Texas.   In fact, Texas, which had never elected a woman to Congress or an  African American to the Texas State Senate, was not covered by Section  5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the language minorities living in  South Texas were not protected at all.   But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the tireless voter  registration work performed in 1972 by Hillary Clinton in Texas, along  ``With hundreds of others, including her future husband Bill, Barbara  Jordan was elected to Congress, giving meaning to the promise of the  Voting Rights Act that all citizens would at long last have the right  to cast a vote for person of their community, from their community, for  their community.   Madam Speaker, it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in  Houston that in pursuit of extending the full measure of citizenship to  all Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also  represented this historic 18th Congressional District of Texas,  introduced, and the Congress adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and  4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, which extended the protections of  Section 4(a) and Section 5 to language minorities.   During the floor debate on the 1975 reauthorization of the Voting  Rights Act, Congresswoman Jordan explained why this reform was needed:   ``There are Mexican-American people in the State of Texas who have  been denied the right to vote; who have been impeded in their efforts  to register and vote; who have not had encouragement from those  election officials because they are brown people.   ``So, the state of Texas, if we approve this measure, would be  brought ``within the coverage of this Act for the first time.''   When it comes to extending and protecting the precious right to vote,  the Lone Star State--the home state of Lyndon Johnson and Barbara  Jordan--could be the leading state in the Union, one that sets the  example for the nation.   But to realize that future, Texas must turn from and not return to  the dark days of the past.   By embracing the discriminatory Texas SB7 and the ``Big Lie'' that  the 2020 election, by all accounts adjudged the most secure and  inclusive in American history, was riven by voter fraud, Texas  Republicans are making the wrong choice to their eternal shame.   Texans must remain ever vigilant and oppose all schemes that will  abridge or dilute the precious right to vote, like the odious Texas SB7  recently passed by the Texas State Senate but killed, but not yet  permanently, by the unity and courage of Democrats in the Texas State  House of Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the House Democrats of the Texas General  Assembly for being on the front lines, fighting in opposition to Texas  SB7 on the House floor and I join with them in calling upon the U.S.  Senate to eliminate the filibuster and to bring to the floor for debate  and vote--so Congress can pass--H.R. 1 and H.R. 4, the John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act.   We must all do our part to preserve this most important heritage  because it was earned with the sacrifices and the lives of our  ancestors.   The right to vote is a ``powerful instrument that can break down the  walls of injustice'' and must be protected against attack from all  enemies, foreign and domestic, using all the legal tools at our  disposal.   Madam Speaker, the right to vote and to participate meaningfully in  civic and political affairs has done more to advance the cause of  freedom, justice, and equality than the Second Amendment has ever done,  if it has done anything at all.   It is time the Congress act to protect and expand the right to vote,  the only right that is preservative of every other right.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled ``John Lewis  leaves behind a powerful legacy of social justice.''                 [From the Washington Post, July 19, 2020]        John Lewis Leaves Behind a Powerful Legacy of Social Justice                           (By Peniel E. Joseph)         On July 17, congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis       died at 80, on the same day as 95-year-old stalwart C.T.       Vivian, Martin Luther King's favorite preacher. Both leave       behind a legacy of social justice activism that played a       pivotal role in some of the most resounding victories of the       civil rights movement: America's Second Reconstruction.        Lewis's death comes at a critical moment in U.S. history,       amid a moral and political reckoning on black dignity and       citizenship that represents nothing less than a Third       American Reconstruction. And his life provides lessons for       activists today on how to confront racial violence, forge       productive alliances and transform American democracy.        Born in 1940 in Troy, Ala., to a family of sharecropping       farmers, the deeply religious Lewis joined the movement for       black dignity and citizenship as a student activist in       Nashville. Already enthralled by the dazzling oratory of the       young Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis enjoyed an unusual kind       of political apprenticeship under the mentorship of an array       of movement leaders. He learned the practical application of       nonviolent civil disobedience from the Rev. James Lawson and       became fast friends with fellow student activists such as       Diane Nash. Ella Baker, founder of the Student Nonviolent       Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced ``snick''), played a       critical role in convincing students such as Lewis that       they--and not just King and older generations of preachers--      could play pivotal leadership roles in an unfolding national       drama.        Lewis's calm demeanor, personal sincerity and outward       humility made him a quiet star among student leaders. He was       arrested dozens of times for civil rights activism between       1960 and 1966. In 1961, he joined hundreds of volunteers on       Freedom Rides, traveling throughout the Jim Crow South to       challenge segregated bus terminals. On May 14, 1961, Lewis       experienced a vicious beating at the hands of a white mob as       a Freedom Rider in Anniston, Ala. It was the first of many       brutal experiences he endured as an activist,  [[Page H3899]]       and such punishment bolstered Lewis's political resolve to       defeat racial segregation.        Elected chairman of SNCC in 1963, Lewis became the youngest       national civil rights leader of the 1960s. At 23, he was the       youngest speaker at the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963.       Although parts of the collectively written speech were       abandoned after objections from white allies in the movement,       Lewis prepared the nation for continued racial combat in the       service of justice. ``By the force of our demands, our       determination and our numbers, we shall splinter the       desegregated South into a thousand pieces and pull them back       together in the image of God and democracy,'' he argued.        Lewis effectively navigated between student militants in       SNCC--which craved transformational political change radical       enough to protect black life in the Mississippi Delta and       Alabama black belt--and more pragmatic civil rights leaders       who viewed the Democratic Party as the most effective vehicle       for widespread social change. In 1964, Lewis encountered       Malcolm X while touring Africa in hopes of forging       international alliances to strengthen domestic black freedom       struggles and came away from his meeting impressed with the       black nationalist icon's willingness to explore political       alliances with civil rights leaders.        On March 7, 1965, Lewis, dressed in a crisp white shirt,       tie, raincoat and backpack, joined several hundred       demonstrators crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma,       Ala., who were routed by blue-helmeted state troopers. The       violence that afternoon left Lewis with permanent scars on       his head. But the activists' resolve in the face of violent       opposition helped trigger the moral and political outrage       that led to the passage of voting rights legislation. Lewis's       involvement at that moment made visible to the whole nation       the violent, racist dehumanization of black people.        In May 1966, Stokely Carmichael, the charismatic Howard       University activist and friend turned organizational rival,       replaced Lewis as SNCC chairman. Carmichael's call for       ``Black Power!'' the next month during a civil rights       demonstration in Mississippi helped to transform the       aesthetics of the black freedom struggle. Lewis completed his       college degree at Fisk University at the moment when Black       Power activists were calling for a dramatic and radical       restructuring of American democracy. The political vision of       Black Power activists, despite political disagreements with       Carmichael and SNCC, inspired Lewis, who used the racial       solidarity forged in the crucible of the movement as a       springboard to political office.        As the radical hopes of the 1960s faded in the aftermath of       King's assassination on April 4, 1968, Lewis turned to       electoral politics. In 1986, he won the Georgia congressional       seat he would hold until his death in an ugly political       battle with Julian Bond, the charismatic SNCC activist and       former friend turned bitter adversary. Over the next 34       years, Lewis went from staring down the forces of white       supremacy at bus stations and bridges to confronting these       same adversaries in the U.S. Congress. Bringing organizing       skills learned as an activist and radical ideas about       transforming American life, he fought valiantly for health-      care, gun-control and anti-poverty legislation. During the       late 1980s and 1990s as the nation turned away from the       vision of the ``Beloved Community'' outlined at the March on       Washington, Lewis advocated for a return to the anti-poverty       and anti-racist policies that briefly flourished during the       1960s.        The American political establishment, over time, caught up       with his accomplishments. Barack Obama's watershed       presidential election proved a boon to Lewis's political       legacy, with the first black president acknowledging the       congressman's towering achievements with a Presidential Medal       of Freedom. Lewis recognized Obama's ascent as part of a       political harvest reaped from the bloodstained sacrifices of       earlier generations.        Lewis understood that those struggles for black dignity and       citizenship continued during his lifetime. He embraced the       Black Lives Matter movement, including the recent national       and global protests for racial justice and equality in the       aftermath of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police.       ``It is so much more massive and all-inclusive,'' Lewis noted       of Black Lives Matter. Whereas black women, including those       who helped to nurture Lewis and lead the movement, were       excluded from speaking at the March on Washington in 1963, he       marveled to witness the prominence of black women in the BLM       movement--as featured leaders, organizers and strategists. As       an elder statesman within political and civil rights circles,       Lewis continued to encourage the young to lead a movement he       recognized as continuing into our own time.        Lewis's extraordinary life offers important lessons for       contemporary generations organizing for black equality in       America and around the world. His example teaches us that       movements for racial justice have always been denigrated by       authorities and been targets of violence by political,       legislative and military bodies. Young people who refused to       heed the warnings of an older generation helped to transform       American democracy, but they received crucial mentoring from       a council of elders who believed, like Baker, that strong       people did not require charismatic top-down patriarchal       leadership. To the contrary, young activists could be trusted       to ask the right questions that would lead to what Lewis       called the ``good trouble'' capable of ending systemic       racism, structural violence and white supremacy.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    The gentleman is always enormously courteous, and I  will be brief.   Since I was on the committee the gentleman might have been staff, but  I know in the House, for example, we had at least 100 hearings and  15,000 pages of testimony. It was chaired at that time by Jim  Sensenbrenner, a Republican, who was meticulous in making sure we had a  record. So I am not sure where the gentleman is getting his information  from.   I will just finish by simply saying that the voter suppression laws  that we are dealing with today are all engaged responding to the big  lie that there was not a legitimate election in 2020, and my good  friend knows that President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were elected in  2020. So we wonder the basis of these voter suppression laws.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I will not take more of his  time.
