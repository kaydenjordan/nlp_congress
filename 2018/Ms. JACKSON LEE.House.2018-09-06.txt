 Mr. Speaker, I look forward to having the  opportunity to speak about former Congressman Ron Dellums at a  lengthier time, but I wanted to stand and pay tribute to him at this  time, and to indicate what an important experience it was to serve with  him for the short period of time that I had to do so.   One of my predecessors, the Honorable Mickey Leland, who died in  Ethiopia some many years ago trying to serve those who were starving,  had a strong bond and friendship with Congressman Ron Dellums, and it  was clear, when I came to the United States Congress, why. Both men had  a deep and abiding passion and conscience for what is right.   And even as Mr. Dellums ascended to the chairmanship or leadership of  the Armed Services Committee, he was always committed and dedicated to  his values, and that was peace, and reconciliation, and the idea that  it was important to invest in people, as opposed to investing in  enormous, large budgets for the defense.   We thank him for his work on HIV/AIDS but, more importantly, on his  counseling and mentoring, and we are grateful to his family for sharing  him with America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand here with our  good friend just leaving the podium, the Honorable Lacy Clay.   It is good to see the kind of family attitude that we are all  expressing. Each person has gone to hug the Honorable Barbara Lee  because she is the closest to Congressman Ron Dellums, and we want his  family to know of the intensity of our love and respect.   Congressman Lacy opened up the gate for me and the door for me  because I think Congressman Ron Dellums understood, as Frederick  Douglass did, that, where there is no struggle, there is no power.  Without struggle, there is no power. For all that he stood for, even in  his early years, he had no fear of struggle.   So I stand today on the floor of the House to be able to pay tribute  to our friend and, might I say, our brother, to be able to thank the  gentlewoman from California for her wisdom in allowing us to share this  time with him. I thank the gentlewoman so very much for giving us this  beautiful portrait for us to stand next to and for America to be  reintroduced to the Honorable Ron Dellums.   Ron Dellums was a Member of Congress, former bay area Congressman and  Oakland mayor, first African American elected to Congress from northern  California, tireless champion of racial and social justice, Marine  Corps veteran and peace warrior, and Congressional Black Caucus and  Congressional Progressive Caucus cofounder. That is a long litany of  brilliance, but, as well, a pioneer--legendary, brilliant--and a  dynamic former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. And the  fact that he represented constituents so ably.   I am glad, as I came here as a newbie, as a new Member of the United  States Congress, wasn't I fortunate to get the last years of service of  the Honorable Ron Dellums? I saw him as the lead Democrat on the Armed  Services Committee, just missed his service as a chair of the Armed  Services Committee.   I listened to Leader Pelosi, and she will be able to tell her stories  going forward as they celebrate in Oakland. Might I pay tribute to his  family members who will celebrate in Oakland.   Let me say to the family members, my deepest sympathy, but joy for  his life, and thank you for sharing him with us.   I must start with the story that I heard, which was of the  appointment of Ron Dellums and Pat Schroeder to, I believe, the Armed  Services Committee, as the committee was convened then by individuals  who held themselves high and mighty, including the chairman. There was  only one chair, and that chair had to be shared by the first woman and  the first African American to be on that committee.   Yes. Can you imagine? They were told to sit in one chair.   But I am grateful that through that struggle--power in his birth in  1935; power to his parents, Verney and Willa Dellums, and all of his  relatives; and, as well, power in what he did in life--his engagement  and his passionate commitment were traits of the Dellums family.   His father was a longshoreman. There lays the foundation for his love  of labor. I understand Cottrell Laurence Dellums helped Asa Philip  Randolph organize the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, of which my  grandfather was a member.   He graduated from high school. He enlisted in the Marine Corps during  the Cold War, but he also came back to his community and used the GI  Bill. He developed a pathway for education, an associate of arts degree  out of Oakland City College, then on to get a bachelor of science  degree from San Francisco State. What I want most of all to say is that  he then carved his pathway.   And Barbara Lee continues to remind us that she is a social worker.  Well, Ron Dellums got his MSW from the University of California at  Berkeley in 1962.   Yes, this manly man, this man of men, was a social worker who  understood the needs of people who were vulnerable, a psychiatric  social worker where he worked in the department of mental health and  mental hygiene and taught at San Francisco State.   Interestingly enough, he became a council member, of which I was one  as well, at a young age, served only for a short time. And then, in his  thirties, he went to the United States Congress and never looked back.  He never lost. He ran against an incumbent as an antiwar, anti-Vietnam  candidate, and he won overwhelmingly.   Again, there is no power without struggle. That was not a friendly  place to be, against the war. It was well known to follow you  throughout your career. It was viewed as unpatriotic, maybe even as NFL  players today are viewed as they take a knee for issues that they  believe in.   But Ron Dellums was a dignified patriot. He loved his country. He  loved his flag. And he came to this Congress with a love of the  institution as he served on so many committees, Foreign Affairs.    I remember the Post Office Committee because Mickey Leland was on the  Post Office Committee, and they  [[Page H7907]]  served together. They became good friends. It is important to  acknowledge them together as good friends.   I met Ron, maybe for the first time, as an unelected official when  Mickey brought the Congressional Black Caucus to Houston, Texas. It was  a day we will never forget. It was a day of happening. It was a day of  celebration. We couldn't believe it. The Congressional Black Caucus was  coming to Houston, Texas, to the Shamrock Hotel that used to be a  segregated hotel, and all of us came to pay homage, tribute, and honor  to these Congresspersons who had come to celebrate.   He was of grand stature, being a member of the Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence, and then, of course, going on to be a  founder of the Congressional Black Caucus. I stand here as the chair of  the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation to express my deepest  appreciation for that service.   In the Progressive Caucus, Ron Dellums again became a soldier on the  battlefield for so many issues, in particular, ending and breaking the  shackles of apartheid in South Africa.   Remember, when I started out, there is no power without struggle. He  participated in that struggle, and I remember that fight, that  magnificent day when he brought forward this bill in 1986 to overturn  Reagan's veto, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. He had a  congressional override where the President of the United States was  vetoing the sanctions that Congress was attempting to put forward. That  was a legacy, or that was the pathway, the struggle, that helped to  propel the end of apartheid, the vicious cycle of apartheid in South  Africa.   He continued to champion Africa even after he retired. He continued  to mentor and to stay around to give us inspiration, to tell us that we  could do it, that we could be strong.   Of course, how I remember when this Congresswoman, the Honorable  Barbara Lee, came and touched all of us and came with that inspiration  and that idea and vision that Ron Dellums had about ending the horrors  of HIV/AIDS in Africa, the whole idea of PEPFAR, the whole idea of the  Millennium Fund. All of these were visionary ideas that came about for  him to help save lives.   So as I said, in my early years, he retired in 1998, but he then  continued on to be the man that he is, being the mayor of Oakland, and  being a striking mayor, a truth-telling mayor, somebody who was loved  and beloved by all those whom he had the privilege of serving.   Then, of course, to his family, he was that giant, that husband, that  father and brother and just someone whom they could look up to.   So I thank the gentlewoman for organizing this Special Order, and I  thank this giant of a man in stature but, as well, in purpose and in  heart. I thank him so very much for serving his nation and showing us  what patriotism is, what the flag really means. It is the opportunity  to protest, petition, and to speak to your government, and also to  protest to make your government a better place.   This is a great, great nation. Ron Dellums understood that. Marine  Corps Ron Dellums understood that. Social worker Ron Dellums understood  that. Husband, father, and relative understood that. And, of course,  United States Congressperson Ron Dellums understood that.   But never would he yield his values, his heart, his passion, and his  sense of justice just because he had a title. He believed that  America's greatness was one based upon her people's willingness to  challenge her and to make her the very best that she can be.   My heart goes out to his family and I continue to mourn, but I  celebrate his life with joy.
