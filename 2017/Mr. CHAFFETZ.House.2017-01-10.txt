 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 274) to provide for reimbursement for the use of modern  travel services by Federal employees traveling on official Government  business, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 274         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing Government       Travel Act''.       SEC. 2. FEDERAL EMPLOYEE REIMBURSEMENT FOR USE OF MODERN                     TRAVEL SERVICES.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of General Services       shall prescribe regulations under section 5707 of title 5,       United States Code, to provide for the reimbursement for the       use of a transportation network company or innovative       mobility technology company by any Federal employee traveling       on official business under subchapter I of chapter 57 of such       title, except that the Director of the Administrative Office       of the United States Courts shall prescribe such regulations       with respect to employees of the judicial branch of the       Government.        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Innovative mobility technology company.--The term       ``innovative mobility technology company'' means an       organization, including a corporation, limited liability       company, partnership, sole proprietorship, or any other       entity, that applies technology to expand and enhance       available transportation choices, better manage demand for       transportation services, and provide alternatives to driving       alone.        (2) Transportation network company.--The term       ``transportation network company''--        (A) means a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship,       or other entity, that uses a digital network to connect       riders to drivers affiliated with the entity in order for the       driver to transport the rider using a vehicle owned, leased,       or otherwise authorized for use by the driver to a point       chosen by the rider; and        (B) does not include a shared-expense carpool or vanpool       arrangement that is not intended to generate profit for the       driver.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON TRANSPORTATION COSTS.         Section 5707(c) of title 5, United States Code, is amended       to read as follows:        ``(c)(1) Not later than November 30 of each year, the head       of each agency shall submit to the Administrator of the       General Services, in a format prescribed by the Administrator       and approved by the Director the Office of Management and       Budget--        ``(A) data on total agency payments for such items as       travel and transportation of people, average costs and       durations of trips, and purposes of official travel;        ``(B) data on estimated total agency payments for employee       relocation; and        ``(C) an analysis of the total costs of transportation       service by type, and the total number of trips utilizing each       transportation type for purposes of official travel.        ``(2) The Administrator of the General Services shall make       the data submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) publically       available upon receipt.        ``(3) Not later than January 31 of each year, the       Administrator of the General Services shall submit to the       Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of       Representatives, and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate--        ``(A) an analysis of the data submitted pursuant to       paragraph (1) for the agencies listed in section 901(b) of       title 31 and a survey of such data for each other agency; and        ``(B) a description of any new regulations promulgated or       changes to existing regulations authorized under this       section.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous remarks on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, is a  bipartisan bill sponsored by Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts.  Mr. Will Hurd of Texas and Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina  have all come together on this bill. It is a good bill.   This bill came up in the 114th Congress. The same bill passed through  the committee by regular order, and then in a close vote--much like the  Clemson-Alabama game last night--when we voted on this bill last  session was 415-0. I think there was a pretty good sense from the past  Congress that is a good bill, and it should pass.   Federal employees' current transportation options on official travel  are limited. While some agencies allow employees to be reimbursed for  the use of sharing economy services, such as Lyft or Uber, not all of  them do. As a result, the whole Federal Government does not benefit  from the cost savings that can occur while being associated with these  services.   The Modernizing Government Travel Act allows the Federal Government  to reap the benefits of the sharing economy. The bill ensures that new  transportation services as they emerge, Federal employees can quickly  take advantage of the efficiencies of the new technologies that may be  offered.   By opening up a new market for transportation services, H.R. 274 will  also help spur innovation and competition, creating greater cost  savings. We have some 2 million Federal employees. So this is an  important part and it shouldn't be glanced over. There could be  considerable savings along the way.   We must ensure that there is accountability for travel expenditures.  Our committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and  other watchdog groups outside of government are looking at these  expenses. We have a duty and obligation to ensure that we are dealing  with Federal taxpayer dollars responsibly. This bill mandates that  agencies report their travel costs for each type of travel service to  the General Services Administration, the GSA. The GSA must publish that  data, helping make the Federal Government more transparent and  accountable. The GSA will also report to Congress on agency official  travel costs in order to make sure that they inform future  transportation policy decisions. I urge passage of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), the cosponsor of this bill and someone  who has been very involved in this subject.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Moulton, first and  foremost, for his service to our country, serving in the armed  services. We really do appreciate that. I can't thank him enough for  that service. But I also appreciate him bringing forward this bill and  his working with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).   I appreciate what Mr. DeSaulnier and our ranking member on our  committee, Mr. Cummings, have done, too, to help move this bill  forward.   So there was good, broad, bipartisan support, strong support in the  114th Congress, passing unanimously, with 415 votes. I think it is  worthy to bring this up early in the Congress and get on with the idea  of saving money and taking advantage of technology, as Mr. Hurd said  and as Mr. Moulton talked about as well, save some money and tap into  the technology that is available to save money for the government and,  ultimately, for the taxpayers. It is their money indeed. So I would  urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
