 Mr. President, replying to my colleagues, I think the  Senators from Nebraska and South Carolina know that I have great  affection and respect for them--and I have from the day they got here.   I used to be a State treasurer. I was elected at the tender age of  29. Delaware had the worst credit rating in the country. We were dead  last and couldn't balance our budgets to save our souls, and we had  pretty much no money in the unemployment insurance fund.   Over time, we straightened out our finances, elected a guy named Pete  du Pont as our Governor. I was treasurer for a while, and we had a  Democratic and a Republican legislature--split. We learned how to work  together. It is something we call ``the Delaware way.''   Later on, I got to be Governor, succeeded not Pete du Pont but Mike  Castle, who was his successor. I was very active in the National  Governors Association. They even let me be chairman for a while. I was  the lead Democratic Governor on welfare reform when I was a member of  the National Governors Association.   I was raised in a coal mining town in West Virginia. Parents--not  much money, deep faith, hard work. My dad used to say to my sister and  me: I don't care if you have to work three jobs to pay your bills, work  three jobs.   That is really the way I was raised, and I suspect that most of us  here were raised that way--a strong work ethic.   When I was involved as the lead Democratic Governor on welfare  reform, I used to say people ought to be better off working than they  are on welfare. Bill Clinton said that often. I really believe that.   The thing that was wrong with welfare--our welfare system--was that  people were actually better off staying home than they were working. So  kind of the same principle we are talking about here.   Every State has its own unemployment insurance fund. We have one in  Delaware. They have one in Nebraska, one in Texas, one in Illinois.  They are different, and different benefits are calculated in different  States.   I just got off the phone, colleagues, with a fellow named Cerron  Cade, who used to be a member of my team when I was early in my time in  the Senate. He is now secretary of labor.   I said, Cerron--Mr. Secretary--what do we pay people in Delaware on  unemployment insurance? What is the replacement rate? He said it is  somewhere between 25 and 50 percent of what people were earning. But he  said there is a $400 cap per month--excuse me--per week. There is a  $400 cap per week on the benefits that we will pay anybody, regardless  of what they were making--$400 a week.   If you think about it, $400 a week for 4 weeks is like $1,600 a  month. Add to that the $600 benefit, and we are talking about $2,200  per month.   If somebody is working full time--    Excuse me. There you go. But if you add the numbers, I am  not sure we end up with $24 per hour in Delaware.    It might be the case, but I would have to see those  numbers.   My secretary of labor said he thought that the number that we were  looking at here was something like $13 an hour in Delaware, when you  add it all in, as opposed to 24. So we will go back to do our math.  [[Page S2051]]         Happy to yield.    I thank the Senator very much. I will go back and will  reengage with our secretary and make sure we have the math right.   The other point that he made--I asked him: How hard would it be to  administer? Is it something we could stand up in a couple of weeks or  are we talking about months or what? He said this would not be an easy  thing, administratively, to do. And at a time where we are anxious to  get the benefit out the door in a hurry, this would not be easy. I  would just ask us to keep that in mind.   One of the people I talked to last week when I was trying to figure  out, really, what kind of big package legislative package No. 3 should  be--Leon Panetta is one of the people I talked to. He told me about the  three t's: timely, targeted, and temporary. Those are the three that he  talked about.   Timely means making sure we figure or calculate the right benefit but  that we are able to turn around and pay it in a timely way.   What I gathered from my secretary of labor is we are not going to be  able to incorporate what they are doing at the State level, feed into  that the State and the Federal benefit, and do it in a timely way. I  think, if we could do that, you would have, probably, a fair amount of  bipartisan support. But it is that delay, and we just don't know how  long that delay would be   Ted Kennedy used to sit behind me when I first came to the Senate.  And I noticed that I knew some Senators. Dick Durbin and I served in  the House together, and other people, we had been Governors together. I  didn't know Ted Kennedy. One day I said to him: I am new here in the  Senate, and I don't really know you very well.   What I was doing was going to have a cup of coffee with the Senators  I didn't know well, and I asked if I could maybe have a cup of coffee  with him. He said: We will do better than that. Come to my hideaway,  and we will have lunch together. I said: That is great.   I didn't think we ever would, but it was a nice offer, a nice idea.  Two weeks later, we had lunch together in his hideaway. It was like a  Kennedy museum. Some of you have been there before. It is an amazing  place.   I remember I asked him: How is it that so many Republicans here want  you, Ted Kennedy--the most liberal Democrat, maybe, we had at the  time--to be their lead cosponsor on their bills? Why is that?   And he said: I am always willing to compromise on policy, never  willing to compromise on principle.   I think that the policy here is that, when people are unemployed and  they need help, we want to help them, and we help them in a timely way.    I will just finish my thought, and then I would be happy  to.   But in a timely way. And I am just concerned--my second concern,  along with my first concern: I am just concerned that the idea to deal  with this in a timely way is going to be diminished, maybe  significantly. We just, honestly, don't know.   I am happy to yield.    I would be happy to discuss that with you and better  understand what you offer. I wasn't here when you spoke. Thank you.   I yield the floor.
