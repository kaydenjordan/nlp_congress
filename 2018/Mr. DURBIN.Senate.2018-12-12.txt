 Mr. President, today, the Senate is voting on a  resolution of disapproval that would rescind a dangerous decision made  by the Treasury Department and restore a vital tool in the fight  against illegal spending in U.S. elections.   In July, the Treasury decided to reverse decades of precedent and  eliminate a requirement that certain tax-exempt organizations must  report the identities of their major donors to the Internal Revenue  Service as part of their annual returns.   Why is this important? Because the 501(c)(4) ``social welfare  organizations'' and 501(c)(6) business leagues that now are no longer  required to disclose their donors to the IRS are the very same groups  that have poured nearly one billion dollars of dark money into U.S.  elections since 2010.  [[Page S7459]]    Dark money makes it nearly impossible for the public to find the true  sources behind the shady attack ads and political campaigns that these  organizations fund. But by at least requiring these groups to disclose  their major donors to the IRS, the rule ensured that the government  could monitor the groups' compliance with campaign finance laws, such  as the ban on foreign contributions. Now that this enforcement tool has  been lost, it will be much easier for foreign powers to illegally  funnel money into our elections through dark money organizations.   At a time when we know the U.S. remains under threat of foreign  interference in our elections, why would we make it harder for the IRS,  law enforcement, and our nation's intelligence organizations to monitor  the movement of money in our political system? The answer is clear--we  shouldn't. The Senate must act to rescind Treasury's misguided decision  and restore an essential tool in the fight against illegal money in  politics and ward off the threat of foreign funds influencing U.S.  elections.   I am proud to join Senators Tester and Wyden in support of this  resolution and urge my colleagues to cast their vote in support of  today's CRA.                            Tribute to Bill Nelson    Mr. President, I would like to enter into the Record a tribute to my  colleague and friend Bill Nelson of Florida.   Bill is leaving the Senate after an amazing career. We served  together on the House for 8 years, 17 years in the Senate--a quarter of  a century working together. He is an extraordinary man who has  represented the State of Florida so well, served as one of the few  congressional astronauts in 1986 when he was on the Space Shuttle  Columbia.   He is a courageous, hard-working man. With his wife Grace by his  side, they have done so many good things. They went to Haiti together,  and I respect his commitment to public service and his commitment to  the people of Florida.   Senator Nelson and I go back a long ways. We served together in the  House for 8 years--and 17 years in this Senate. A quarter-century  together in the arena. I remember then-Congressman Bill Nelson made the  gutsy decision to fly in space aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Columbia in  January 1986.   To give you an idea of how much courage that took, consider this:  That was the last shuttle mission before the Space Shuttle Challenger  disaster.   A number of people who have flown in space talk about something they  call ``the overview effect''--a shift in perspective that occurs when  you see the Earth hanging like a tiny, fragile ball in the black void  of space. From the heavens, there are no boundaries, and you see that  all of us on this planet are part of the same whole.   I think that seeing the Earth from that perspective would make anyone  a better Senator. It may explain why Bill Nelson has always been so  willing to reach out to other Senators--including our friends on the  other side of the aisle--to solve problems for the people of Florida  and for our Nation. He knows that our common humanity is bigger than  our differences of opinion.   Senator Nelson displayed a different kind of courage in the Senate.  He voted for the economic stimulus package that helped pull America and  the world back from the brink of a Second Great Depression. He voted to  create the Affordable Care Act--a vote that was politically risky, but  has saved lives.   NASA and America's manned space program has had no greater champion-- save possibly John Glenn himself.   Bill Nelson has been a champion for: Working families; economic  fairness; and good schools and affordable college education.    He has fought for: Clean oceans; safe and sustainable energy;  reasonable, responsible action to prevent climate chaos; and for  scientific integrity.   He has given most of his adult life to public service. He is a  reasonable man in an unreasonable time. I will miss his courage in our  caucus and in this Senate. I wish my old friend all the best as he  begins the next chapters in his remarkable life. He will be missed.                               Border Security    Mr. President, let me also say at this moment that we are debating  the question of border security.   Yesterday, the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection appeared  before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. McAleenan, who has been the  Commissioner, is a professional. I respect the fact that he has a world  of experience.   When he came to my office last year, I said to him: If I gave you a  blank check for border security to make us safer in the United States,  what would you buy?   He said: More technology, more people.   You will note that he didn't say a wall because he knows, as we do,  that a wall is a 19th century answer to a 21st century challenge. We  can make America safer, and should, with a secure border, using  technology and personnel--well trained. This notion that we need to  build a $5 billion wall came up yesterday during the course of the  hearing.   I noted the fact that for the first time in my life, it was being  reported publicly that the life expectancy of Americans has gone down.  You wonder why, in this great, progressive, prosperous Nation, it is  the case. It is because of the drug epidemic--an epidemic which has  been fueled by opioids and heroin and fentanyl. Some 40,000 or more  Americans lose their life annually to this epidemic--more than we lose  in traffic accidents, for example.   When you look at the source of the narcotics, you find the most  deadly chemical, fentanyl, is coming into the United States over our  borders, where it is then mixed with other chemicals and sold to those  on the street, ultimately leading to their death.   My question to Customs and Border Protection was: What more can we do  to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States from China, through  Mexico, and other places? What I heard from Mr. McAleenan was not  encouraging because it says to me he knows what can be done, and yet he  doesn't have the resources to address it.   Let me be specific. He told me last year there is something called a  Z Portal. This is a scanning device which can literally scan railroad  cars, trucks, and cars coming into the United States to see if they  detect anything suspicious--whether it is narcotics or contraband or  guns or individuals hidden away.   Currently, almost 100 percent of the railroad cars go through the  scanning before they come into the United States, but fewer than one  out of five other vehicles are scanned. I asked Mr. McAleenan, if we  are going to put more money into border security, wouldn't we put money  into these Z Portals; wouldn't you ask for more money to fund this  technology? He said he would, and he wanted to.   I asked him how much it would cost to really make sure we have border  protection to stop these deadly narcotics from coming into the United  States. His answer was $300 million. Put that next to the President's  outrageous demands for $5 billion for a wall that all of us agree--at  least most agree--is an ineffective and wasteful expenditure of  taxpayers' money.   The President may think he made some campaign pledge that he has to  keep come hell or high water, but that pledge also included a promise  that Mexico was going to pay for this wall. Now the President wants us  to pay for this wall. That is $5 billion for his campaign promise  instead of $300 million to keep America safe from more narcotics  flowing across our borders. That, to me, is a ridiculous option that  the President is demanding.   If we want a safe border, if we want to stop this drug epidemic which  is killing so many people, let us put the technology in place which  will keep us safer. That technology is not a wall from sea to shining  sea that the President demands.                            Saudi War Powers Bill    Mr. President, regardless of who is serving in the White House--a  Democrat or Republican--I have long felt the Constitution is very  clear. The American people--through Congress, and through Congress  alone--have the constitutional responsibility to declare war.   Whether I was holding President Bush in the Iraq war or President  Obama in our interventions in Syria or Libya to this standard, it  really came down to the same basic principle. The Constitution is  clear. Article I section 8 states: ``The Congress shall have the power  . . . to declare War.''  [[Page S7460]]    What we are doing later today is a debate over the future of the U.S.  involvement in the war in Yemen. It is long overdue and deeply  important.   It occurs as we are entering the 18th year of the war in Afghanistan.  That is an incredible fact. I was on the Senate floor and voted some 18  years ago, after the 9/11 occurrence, to go after those responsible for  killing 3,000 innocent Americans and who were believed to be in  Afghanistan at the time. I voted with a clear conscience, understanding  no one can strike the United States and kill innocent people without  being held accountable.   I had no idea when I cast that vote that beyond Osama Bin Laden, we  would continue using that authorization against terrorism 18 years  later to prolong the longest war in the history of the United States-- the war in Afghanistan.   I don't believe anyone who voted, as I did, in 2001, for that  authorization of force could have imagined that 18 years later we would  still be engaged in a war in Afghanistan or that the authorization  would be stretched beyond credibility to approve the U.S. military  action in multiple countries around the world, which brings us to the  war in question today.   The disastrous and bloody Saudi-led war in Yemen is supported by the  United States. Does anyone here remember voting to authorize U.S.  military involvement in that war? Of course not. Did anyone who voted  for the 2001 AUMF, authorization for the use of military force dealing  with al-Qaida, believe we were including the Saudi-led quagmire in  Yemen, a quagmire led by a reckless, young Saudi Crown Prince who I  believe had direct knowledge of the brutal murder of journalist and  U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi?   Not only was this war never authorized by the elected representatives  of the American people, it is a humanitarian disaster. An estimated  85,000 children have already died of malnutrition in this war, and in a  country of 28 million, nearly half are facing famine because of a war  that was initiated by the Saudis and supported by the United States.    Look at this heartbreaking photo. This is the photo of a 7-year-old,  young Yemeni girl, named Amal Hussain. This photo was taken and  featured in the New York Times in November. This young girl died  shortly after this photo was taken.   ``My heart is broken,'' her mother said.   I know this is a difficult photo to display in the U.S. Senate, but I  believe it is necessary. It shows the consequences of this war and the  failure of Congress to speak out clearly to this administration and  take the actions necessary to stop our involvement in this war and  humanitarian disaster in Yemen. The malnutrition and innocent suffering  that you see in this photo cannot be ignored.   On Sunday, some may have read the New York Times columnist Nick  Kristof's devastating piece ``Your Tax Dollars Help Starve Children''  about his recent and courageous trip to Yemen. Mr. Kristof writes about  girls like Amal and notes how we typically think of war casualties as  being men who have had their legs blown off. Yet, in Yemen, he writes,  the most common war casualties are children who are dying of starvation  and that in the conference room in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and here in  Washington, officials, simply, don't fathom the human toll of their  policies. Maybe some think that this war in Yemen is justified, that  Iranian influence and the Houthis in Yemen are credible threats to U.S.  security interests.   Ultimately, this is not about the merits of any such fight. It is not  about soldier against soldier or combat against combat. It is about the  innocent bystanders who are dying by the thousands. It is also not any  way to vindicate the Houthis' troubling role in the horrible Yemeni  civil war or their likely support from Iran. I don't try to do that,  and I won't. It is about our constitutional duty and responsibility to  debate and vote to participate in this war or in any war.   Our Founding Fathers were wise and knew that the decision to send  someone's son or daughter into war must not be made by a King or a  supreme executive, but in our case, it is by the United States, by the  elected Representatives of the people. Just think of how many battles  in human history--how many deaths, how much blood and destruction--have  occurred to satisfy vanity or the narrow interests of a despot or an  unelected ruler.   Our Constitution makes it clear that we are different. The American  people are given the voice and the responsibility to decide if their  sons or daughters will participate in the war, and they do it through  the U.S. Congress, including this very organization, body, in which I  serve. We have utterly failed as the U.S. Senate in this  responsibility.   So we are long overdue to have this debate, which is coming up today  or tomorrow, and a vote, which will ultimately reflect whether we  should continue with the war in Yemen. I will be voting against that  war. I believe we have to put an end to this humanitarian disaster, and  the American people, especially those in Illinois, have sent me here to  Congress to express that clearly.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
