 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding student, athlete, and leader from my district.   Tyler Linderbaum of Solon, Iowa, not only creates a huge impact on  the football field as the starting center for the Iowa Hawkeyes, but he  also creates a huge impact in our community.   This season, Tyler used the new NCAA rules to hold a fundraiser for  our beloved University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital. After  setting up a website to sell merchandise, he presented the Children's  Hospital with a check for $30,000.   On the football field, Tyler was dominant. In addition to leading the  Hawks to 10 wins, Tyler was named the first team All-American, and was  also awarded the Rimington Award as college football's best center. For  his work, Pro Football Focus graded him with their highest grade ever  given to a college football center.   Thank you, Tyler, for being an outstanding citizen of our community.  I am looking forward to watching you continue to dominate in the NFL  and make our State and our world a better place. Go, Hawks.                            ____________________
