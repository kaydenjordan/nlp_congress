 Mr. Speaker, today is National Human Trafficking  Awareness Day, and I rise to bring attention to the horrific increase  in human trafficking and online sexual exploitation.   Since the pandemic began, trafficking and sexual exploitation have  skyrocketed in my own home State of Missouri and across the United  States of America and the world.   I have made it a priority to support survivors and hold websites  accountable for facilitating sex trafficking.   I am proud to be the only Member of Congress in over 20 years to  successfully amend section 230 of the Communications Decency Act with  my bill, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or FOSTA.   In the coming weeks, Mr. Speaker, I will introduce multiple pieces of  legislation to combat human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and  online sexual exploitation.   We must come together to eliminate this barbaric trade.                            ____________________
