 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 4571, which is at the  desk; further, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Thank you to the Senator from Florida.   Mr. President, President Biden has wasted no time--no time at all--in  embarking on his crusade to hamstring American energy production.   On day 1 of his Presidency, President Biden halted all new oil and  gas lease sales on Federal land. Now Americans are paying the price.  Across the Nation, people struggle to fill their gas tanks, as prices  climb to over $5 a gallon, but there is apparently no need to worry.  According to the President, Americans' pain at the pump is merely part  of an energy ``transition,'' as he puts it.   It is important to note here that this transition is a transition  away from affordable, reliable fossil fuels.   It is not that high gas prices are a problem to be fixed but, rather,  high gas prices somehow are the solution. They are what will facilitate  this transition. The President is getting the results that he wants.  This is a feature, the ultimate feature. It is the end goal, not a bug  in his plan.   Despite this being part of the plan and, in fact, his objective, it  didn't take long for the President to realize how unpopular high  gasoline prices really are. Now he is trying to take credit for even a  slight reduction in gasoline prices. First, by no means is this  reduction sufficient. Second, we can't attribute that reduction to the  President's policies.   To be clear, placing a moratorium on the sale of oil and gas leases  on Federal land is outside the President's authority. If the President  actually possessed that authority, he wouldn't have attempted to  portray this as a temporary pause. It is clear that this is a thinly  veiled attempt to enact the most radical climate policies our country  has  [[Page S3523]]  ever seen--policies that have never been enacted by Congress and  policies that Congress would not enact.   Our suspicions were confirmed when Gina McCarthy, the President's  climate adviser, said during an interview:         President Biden remains absolutely committed to not moving       forward with additional drilling on public lands.    So much for a temporary moratorium.   Confused as to whether Ms. McCarthy's statement represented the  administration's policy, I asked Interior Secretary Deb Haaland whether  it was indeed the administration's intention to indefinitely pause the  sale of all Federal oil and gas leases. She responded: ``I don't  know.''   ``I don't know'' is not an acceptable answer to the Utah communities  who rely on those oil and gas leases. ``I don't know'' is not an  acceptable answer to Americans paying over $5 a gallon for gas. ``I  don't know'' isn't an answer to the Americans who have found every  aspect of their lives rendered unaffordable by this administration's  policies, and now this only adds insult to injury.   The American people simply cannot endure President Biden's clear-as- mud policies any longer. I have introduced legislation to reaffirm that  under the Mineral Leasing Act, the President of the United States  absolutely does not have the authority to hold the country's domestic  energy production hostage. Their continued efforts are coming at the  expense of struggling families.   The Biden administration is fighting in court for Presidential  authority to enact sweeping changes to American energy policy on a  whim. While I believe the courts will arrive at the same conclusion, we  can act now to ensure citizens and companies receive the certainty they  deserve.   We could end this crusade today if we enacted this legislation and  get to work securing American energy independence for generations to  come. It is for that reason that I was disappointed when my friend and  colleague on the other side of the aisle came and objected to passing  this by unanimous consent today. It does, in fact, state what the law  already provides anyway. It shouldn't hurt us to make it obvious. Yet  he objected even though this policy is harming the American people.   It is disappointing that it had to end this way today, but this is  not over. No, we will be back. We will be back as often and for as long  as it takes in order to give the American people the relief that they  need and that they definitely deserve.   Now I yield the time to my friend and colleague, the Senator from  Alaska.
