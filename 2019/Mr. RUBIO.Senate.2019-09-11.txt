 Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our economy. It is my privilege to honor a Florida small  business that not only produces outstanding products but also assists  survivors of human trafficking by providing dignified work and a second  chance at life. This week, it is my pleasure to recognize Rethreaded of  Jacksonville, FL as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Rethreaded was established in 2011 following founder Kristin Keen's  return from India where she worked with victims of human trafficking.  Realizing that there was a need in her own community to provide  opportunities to survivors, Kristin sought to create a safe haven where  women could learn skills while also earning a living. Many Rethreaded  employees are survivors of human trafficking, and since its launch,  Rethreaded has employed 40 women. The company has raised awareness  about the horrific realities of human trafficking in the immediate  community and beyond as well.   Rethreaded sells conscious gifts and handcrafted accessories such as  purses, scarves, and jewelry at its storefront in Jacksonville, as well  as online. Their website not only provides nationwide customers access  to their products, but it also serves as a platform from which they  promote human rights issues that are foundational to Rethreaded's  purpose.   Over the years, Rethreaded has partnered with more than 300  companies, including Southwest Airlines, which provides airline seat  leather for various ``upcycled'' products such as keychains and  earrings. Since the beginning of this partnership, Southwest has  provided more than 5,400 pounds of leather to Rethreaded, saving 2.8  tons of waste from entering our Nation's landfills. This partnership  provided national exposure, but it was not the first time Rethreaded  has received acclaim. The company appeared on ``Project Runway All  Stars,'' an opportunity which gave their brand yet another chance to  promote their mission. Additionally, Rethreaded has established  relationships with numerous strategic partners, named Freedom Partners,  which supply ready-made products from around the world. Selling these  ready-made products in the Rethreaded storefront and online supports  like-minded enterprises that also strive to end human trafficking.   Rethreaded not only creates sustainable products for a good cause but  also provides a supportive community for women who are in need of hope  and healing. In addition to providing employment, Rethreaded has  established programs to assist employees in the recovery process.  Programs such as its warm-line telephone crisis support service, mental  health group services, care management services, and individual  counseling services target the unique challenges facing trauma victims.   Congratulations to Kristin and the entire team at Rethreaded on their  8 years of service. I commend their efforts to provide dignified  employment and skills training to women in our community who have been  impacted by human trafficking. Rethreaded is a great example of the  positive impact social entrepreneurship ventures can have in our  communities. I look forward to watching their continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
