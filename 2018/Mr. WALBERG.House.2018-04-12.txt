 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Deputy Andrew  Jenkins of the Eaton County Sheriff's Department for being awarded the  Congressional Badge of Bravery. He is only the second law enforcement  officer from Michigan to ever receive this high honor.   On the evening of December 20, 2016, Deputy Jenkins was the first  emergency responder to a Delta Township residence which was already in  flames. Although he had no protective clothing or equipment, he  immediately entered the home, finding three family members, two of whom  were disabled and unable to walk.   He subsequently rescued all three occupants, carrying the disabled  individuals to safety as the fire continued to spread, putting himself  in great danger. All three residents and Deputy Jenkins were  hospitalized and treated for smoke inhalation, and one person was  subsequently treated at the University of Michigan burn unit.   If Deputy Jenkins had not acted so quickly that night, three lives  may have been lost. His heroism and selfless actions that night clearly  established why Deputy Jenkins is so deserving of the Congressional  Badge of Bravery.                            ____________________
