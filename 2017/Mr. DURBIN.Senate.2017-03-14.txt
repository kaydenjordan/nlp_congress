TrumpCare     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  TrumpCare     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  TrumpCare     Mr. President, last week congressional Republicans  finally unveiled their proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act. The  Affordable Care Act is a law passed by Congress a little over 6 years  ago with the express goal of expanding the number of Americans with the  protection of health insurance. It has been successful. We have the  lowest percentage of uninsured Americans in history. What it means is  that through offering Medicaid to those in low-income categories,  offering help to pay premiums for those in middle-income categories,  and offering choices in the insurance exchange, we have really changed  health insurance in America in 6 years.   Now Americans realize that when they take a look at their actual  health insurance policy, it is worth something. It may be hard to  remember--but we should--that only 6 years ago, if you happened to have  a child with a preexisting condition and you were not lucky enough to  have your insurance through your employer and you went out on the open  market, you were in for a rough ride. Many health insurance companies  would not insure a family with a child who had a history of diabetes or  surviving cancer. We changed that. We said that no health insurance  company in America can discriminate against a person or family because  of a preexisting medical condition. Is there one of us who lives in a  family which doesn't have a relative, a close relative, with a  preexisting condition? That was an important reform that was part of  the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare.    We also came to realize they were selling health insurance to people  with some fine print that made a difference--lifetime limits on  coverage. Well, I have $1 million coverage. That sounds great, until  the next diagnosis or the next accident. Now, $1 million doesn't seem  like such a large amount of money, and God forbid you end up with a  chronic illness.   One of my constituents came by to visit me 2 weeks ago. She was a  guest of one of the Members of Congress during the President's speech  to the joint session. She was diagnosed a few years ago with an unusual  disease, one that is life-threatening at any given moment. She told me  that in the past 3 years, she has spent more than $700,000 on  medication--$700,000--and that will be a burden she faces for the rest  of her life.   If her health insurance had a limit on how much it paid, there would  reach a point where she couldn't buy the medicine she needs to save her  life. We did away with that, and we said: You can't discriminate  against people by putting these limits. We also said: When it comes to  charging premiums, you can't discriminate against a person applying for  health insurance solely because they happen to be a woman.   There has been a lot of controversy over that in the House in their  debate over the last week or so, but what we said basically is that  when it comes to insurance risk, put everyone in together, make this a  bigger pool of people seeking health insurance so insurance can be  profitable and affordable at the same time.   We also said: When it comes to the premiums charged on health  insurance--and I call attention to all of us over the age of 50--we  said you cannot discriminate in premiums you charge in health  insurance. There can't be a disparity of more than 3 to 1 for the most  expensive health insurance policy to the least expensive. We also said,  in addition to that, if you have a child, son or daughter, graduating  college and looking for a job but has no healthcare benefits, keep them  on your family plan until they reach the age of 26. I have been through  that. Most families have.   I had a recent college graduate, no longer with student health  insurance, and I said: Jennifer, do you have health insurance?   Dad, I feel just great.   No father wants to hear that answer. So we changed the law.   When it came to Medicare, under the Affordable Care Act, we said: We  are going to eliminate the gap in coverage for prescription drugs for  seniors. They used to call it the doughnut hole. It made no sense. It  was something only Congress could dream up. We closed it and said: We  are going to give seamless coverage to Medicare prescription drugs.  That was part of the Affordable Care Act.   We put in incentives for people providing medical care to find ways  to give us good quality care and reduce the cost. What was the net  result? The slowest growth in hospitalization premiums for employer- based healthcare that we have seen in modern times.   When they put this new model for healthcare against the Medicare  Program--that is a program for seniors and disabled--guess what. It  bought 10 years of solvency for Medicare. That  [[Page S1785]]  meant a program that is critically important for 60 million Americans  had 10 more years of solvency.   Did this program have problems? Of course it did. When you take on  the healthcare system of America, you are not going to get it  completely right the first time. I believed--and many others did--that  as important and valuable as that vote was, we had to be prepared to  return to this program to make sure we addressed problems as they would  arise.   For example, there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act of substance  when it comes to controlling the price of pharmaceuticals--prescription  drugs.   Well, I can tell you what has happened. Blue Cross Blue Shield in  Chicago came to see me, and the CEO said: Blue Cross Blue Shield is now  paying more for prescription drugs than we are paying for inpatient  hospital care. The cost of drugs has gone through the roof. The net  result of that, of course, is the cost of healthcare goes up too. The  Affordable Care Act should have addressed that but did not.   We also had to find a way to make sure there was health insurance  available all around the United States. Some companies jumped in; some  jumped out. Many of us believe we should have a single-payer plan  available in every part of America so you could choose for your family  a Medicare-type plan if you wish. Otherwise, you would go to a private  health insurance company, if you wish. It is your choice.   The Republicans opposed the Affordable Care Act. In the House, they  voted against it 57, 58 times--I lose count. Then came the day when  they had the majority in the Senate, in the House, and in the White  House--the answer to their prayers. Now, once and for all, they can get  rid of the Affordable Care Act. They have the votes, but then there was  a problem.   People across America started asking: If you repeal it, what will  happen next? Will I still be able to get health insurance? Will I be  protected if I have a preexisting condition? Will there be limits on  what the policy covers?   Well, they hadn't quite thought that far ahead to look for the  substitute, to look for the replacement. So they went to work in a  matter of 5 or 6 weeks and created what is now being considered by the  House of Representatives--the Republican replacement plan.   The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan office that takes a  look at our bills and legislation and puts a score on them. How much is  it going to cost? What is it going to do?   We waited for Congressional Budget Office scores over and over again  when we wrote the Affordable Care Act. They would come in and say:  Nope, you have to go back to the drawing board. You have to change this  and change that.   Well, just this week, they came out with the score on the Republican  replacement plan, the one to replace the Affordable Care Act. They took  a look at it, and here is what they told us.   To start off with, the Republican replacement plan throws people off  health insurance coverage. How many? Remember when President Trump said  the GOP healthcare bill would have ``insurance for everybody''? Under  TrumpCare, the new Republican plan, TrumpCare, 14 million people would  lose their health coverage next year. By 2026, 24 million people will  have lost their healthcare coverage.   Is this what we were looking for in the replacement plan for the  Affordable Care Act, to say to 24 million Americans, you will no longer  have health insurance coverage? Think about the outcome of that. Think  about someone with a chronically ill child or someone who faces a  chronic illness themself with no health insurance.   Think about a working person who has no health insurance where they  work. At least they had coverage through Medicaid and perhaps through  the insurance exchange with a subsidy. Now they are losing it.   Think about those same people without health insurance. They will  still get sick and will still go to the hospital but will be unable to  pay. Incidentally, their bills they can't pay, we pay. Those bills are  passed on to everyone else.   So the first plank of the Republican TrumpCare, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, is to eliminate health insurance for 24  million Americans. In addition, the Republican TrumpCare plan  significantly raises premium costs on seniors.   According to the official Congressional Budget Office estimate, the  bill will ``substantially raise premiums for older people.'' How does  that happen? Well, in addition to cutting back on the financial  assistance for seniors to buy health insurance, TrumpCare would allow  insurance companies to charge older people significantly more than the  Affordable Care Act. Remember the limit, the 3-to-1 limit on premiums  that we built into the Affordable Care Act? TrumpCare says: No, make  that 5 to 1. So it means, if you are over the age of 50, buying health  insurance, your premiums can go up dramatically, according to the  Congressional Budget Office.   There is another thing too. As we take more and more people off of  health insurance coverage, it really, in a way, dampens the incentive  for affordable healthcare so the costs are not contained as they are  today, and the solvency of Medicare--which we said was 10 years more,  remember that--they reduce it by 4 years.   What the Republican TrumpCare plan has done is it threatens the  solvency of Medicare. Is that what we were looking for on the repeal of  the Affordable Care Act? I don't think so.   TrumpCare also raises costs for lower and middle-income families. By  repealing the cost-sharing subsidies and lowering the bar on health  plans, the Congressional Budget Office says that lower and middle-class  families shopping in the individual market should expect to see--and I  quote from the report--``substantially increasing out-of-pocket  costs.''   The bill also defunds Planned Parenthood, which was to be expected.  We expected it in many bills. According to the Congressional Budget  Office, defunding of Planned Parenthood would ``affect services that  help women avert pregnancies . . . most likely residing in areas  without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve  low-income populations.'' The Congressional Budget Office projects that  15 percent of those people--again, these are lower income women in  medically underserved areas of America--would lose access to care.   Also, TrumpCare, at the same time it does this--eliminates health  insurance for 24 million, raises the premium costs, and defunds Planned  Parenthood. For good measure, TrumpCare also provides tax cuts to the  wealthiest people in America. Is that what we were looking for? Was  that part of the bargain? Those making over $1 million a year in income  will get a $50,000 tax cut from the TrumpCare bill. The wealthiest one- tenth of 1 percent get a tax cut of nearly $200,000.   Finally, while cutting taxes for the very rich, TrumpCare also  slashes $880 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years.  Medicaid is a vital healthcare program. Most people think about  Medicaid--oh, that is health insurance for the poor. It is. But who are  the poor? Overwhelmingly in numbers, they are children and their moms  who are in low-income groups. That is the biggest number, but the  biggest expense for Medicaid isn't kids and their moms. It is grandma  and grandpa. It is our families and parents who are in an assisted care  home who have Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to get by.   These cuts by the Republicans and TrumpCare to Medicaid will be felt  by families across the board. In addition, it means that those who  represent States like mine and the Presiding Officer's, with rural  populations that have small hospitals that depend on patients paying  something when they come through the door--many of them are paying  through Medicaid, and if Medicaid is reduced, the payments to the  hospitals are reduced.   That is why the Illinois Hospital Association warns us against  TrumpCare. The Illinois Hospital Association says it will threaten the  hospitals of my State. They will not be receiving the Medicaid  reimbursement. They believe that up to 90,000 jobs at these hospitals  will be lost in Illinois. I will tell you, as a downstater, those are  some of the best paying jobs in the community. Many of my small towns  trying to keep businesses or attract businesses brag up their hospital,  as they should, and now TrumpCare threatens the future of these  hospitals.  [[Page S1786]]    Medicaid is a vital healthcare program for 65 million Americans-- seniors, persons with disabilities, children, and low-income families  nationwide, 3 million of them in my State. TrumpCare would devastate  the program. By 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 14  million fewer people would have Medicaid.   The Affordable Care Act took a lot of good steps toward improving  healthcare for seniors. Before the Affordable Care Act, the number of  uninsured adults ages 50 to 64 rose substantially--growing from 3.7  million in 2000 to 8.9 million in 2010. Insurance companies were  rejecting more than one in five applications from individuals between  the ages of 50 and 64.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the rate of uninsured adults ages  50 to 64 dropped 47.4 percent, from 11.6 percent to 6.1 percent. The  largest reduction in the uninsured rate occurred in the States that  chose to expand Medicaid.   The Affordable Care Act also prohibited insurers from denying  coverage, as I said earlier, to people with preexisting conditions. It  limited how much insurers can charge older enrollees, closed the  doughnut hole, and made important preventive services available for  free, such as colonoscopies and annual checkups.    Let's look at what the TrumpCare program--the Republican program-- does to seniors. It allows insurers to charge older people  significantly more than younger people, it reduces tax credits to  seniors who pay their premiums, and it would devastate the Medicaid  Program, which helps to pay for two out of every three seniors in  nursing home care.   There is another thing I want to make a note of. Many years ago in  the Senate, back at that corner desk, sat a Senator from Minnesota  named Paul Wellstone, a Democrat. Over here on the aisle sat Pete  Domenici of New Mexico, a Republican. For years they argued that we  should include in every health insurance plan in America coverage for  mental health, and the insurance companies fought them. Because many  mental health conditions are chronic and long-term and may, in some  cases, be expensive, they didn't want them. But Wellstone and Domenici  had family members who struggled with mental illness, and they said we  need to include this in every health insurance plan. Thank goodness  they finally prevailed. Every health insurance plan in this country has  to treat physical health issues and mental health issues the same,  thanks to Wellstone and thanks to Domenici.   In addition they added something that many of us overlooked: It said  mental health and substance abuse treatment. What does that mean? It  means that if some member of your family is addicted, your health  insurance plan can help pay for the help they need to get rid of their  addiction. For a lot of people it was the only place for them to turn,  and it worked, and thank goodness it did, because we are at that moment  in American history where because of opioids, heroin, and fentanyl, we  have dramatic increases in addiction.   Now what is going to happen under the TrumpCare approach when it  comes to mental illness and substance abuse treatment? Are we going to  require--mandate--every health insurance plan to include mental health  treatment as well as substance abuse? Over and over we hear from our  Republican friends: We want competition. We want choice. We want to  eliminate mandates.   They can take that approach, but we are going to lose coverage for 24  million Americans. If they take that approach, we are going to be  offering health insurance plans that aren't there when families need  them.   We had a roundtable discussion in Rockford, IL, last Friday. When I  go to these communities, I bring in people who are administrators of  the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses, the clinics, the substance  abuse treatment centers. To a person, they oppose TrumpCare. Every  single one of them said that it is the wrong thing to do at this moment  in time. It will leave people more vulnerable. It will leave families  with health insurance that is worthless when they need it. Those are  the bad old days we finally escaped 6 years ago, and now Republicans  want us to return to this competition-choice access to healthcare. I  have access to a Rolls Royce dealership, too, but I am not going to be  buying a Rolls Royce because I can't afford it. If you give a person  access to health insurance that they can't afford, you are not giving  them anything.   What we tried to do with the Affordable Care Act is to make sure we  gave people not only access but protection with health insurance. From  the beginning, the Republicans have said: Let's repeal the Affordable  Care Act. Now they have found that replacing it is a lot harder than  they ever expected.   I said from the beginning, as well, if the Republicans are willing to  take repeal off the table, I am going to pull up a chair. If they want  a bipartisan approach, an honest approach to making the Affordable Care  Act better, let's sit down and talk. Sign me up. If the goal is to give  more people good health insurance that they can afford to protect their  families, if the goal is to find ways to give us better healthcare,  quality results at a lower cost, I want to be a part of that  conversation. But if the goal is to deny health insurance coverage to  24 million Americans, count me out. That to me is a step backward in  time.   What comes next? If the Republicans do this to the Affordable Care  Act, what is next--Medicare? Well, we happen to know the Secretary of  Health and Human Services believes in privatizing Medicare. I don't. I  think that is a step in the wrong direction, and it will reduce the  protection of Medicare. But if they will do this to the Affordable Care  Act, then can Medicare or Social Security be far behind?   It is important that we maintain our values when it comes to critical  programs that America and its families count on.   I hope the House of Representatives defeats TrumpCare, puts it out of  its misery, and then invites all of us to come together on a bipartisan  basis to talk about what we really need for healthcare in this country.   I find it incredible that there is no major medical group in America  today that supports TrumpCare--none, not one. All we have is some  conservative think tanks that believe this is a wonderful model. But  the people on the ground--the administrators in the hospitals, the  doctors, the clinicians, the nurses, the people in the healthcare  clinics--all tell us TrumpCare is a disaster. It is a step in the wrong  direction. It is going to decrease coverage and increase costs. That is  not something that America needs for its future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  another rule the Republicans want to overturn instead of working with  Democrats to create jobs. This rule outlines when State unemployment  agencies can drug test applicants for unemployment benefits.   Today there are roughly 7.6 million Americans who are unemployed, and  over 2 million of these unemployed Americans are collecting  unemployment insurance. About 150,000 of these people live in Illinois.   Unemployment insurance benefits provide a lifeline to many workers  and families who are struggling to make ends meet. If this resolution  passes, my Republican colleagues will succeed in preventing hard- working Americans from receiving these benefits, and they will succeed  in making it more difficult for unemployed Americans to find work.   This past August, the Department of Labor finalized a rule that  explains when State unemployment agencies can subject unemployment  benefit applicants to a drug test. The rule clarifies which occupations  regularly conduct drug testing, as established by the Department of  Labor, to help State programs that conduct drug testing.   This rule makes sure States have the guidance they need to implement  drug testing requirements in a fair and legal  [[Page S1794]]  mariner, but if this partisan CRA is signed into law, it will undo a  bipartisan compromise that was created to ensure equitable access to  unemployment benefits.   Unemployed Americans have paid into the unemployment insurance  program, and they are entitled to receive that insurance when they lose  their job to circumstances beyond their control. By supporting blanket  drug testing of unemployment insurance applicants, my Republican  colleagues are targeting hard-working Americans who in many cases have  fallen on hard times.   And let me be clear, this will make it more difficult for them to  receive the benefits they have earned.   Millions of Americans around the country voted for leaders who would  fight for the working class. Repealing this rule will be another broken  promise to those families.   Drug testing is also expensive. In 2011, the Texas Legislative Budget  Board estimated it would cost Texas $30 million over the course of just  1 year if they moved forward with a universal drug-testing policy for  unemployment benefits.   When States have conducted drug testing of applicants for other  government programs, like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  program, very few claimants have tested positive for drug use.   My Republican colleagues say that this resolution will help save  taxpayer money, but overturning the Department of Labor's rule will  lead to millions of wasted taxpayer dollars on drug tests that come  back negative.   This resolution isn't about saving money. It is about paving the way  for lawmakers who want to drug test every American who has to file for  unemployment insurance; yet these same lawmakers aren't calling for  drug testing Americans that claim other Federal benefits, like tax  credits or deductions on their tax returns.   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to remember: the  Department of Labor's drug-testing rule is about real people who depend  on unemployment insurance to live in America.   They need these benefits to put food on the table, to make a rent or  mortgage payment, or to pay for gas to allow them to continue their job  search.   When people become unemployed, it is often a result of company  downsizing or outsourcing American jobs, not drug use. We should not  and cannot unfairly stigmatize these workers and make it even more  difficult for them to get back on their feet after becoming unemployed  by undoing this regulation.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 42  today, a bill in search of a problem. Back in 2012, Congress passed  legislation to extend temporary unemployment insurance as our country  worked to recover from the recession. That legislation included a  bipartisan compromise that allowed States to drug test people applying  for unemployment compensation if they were fired from their previous  job for drug use or they were pursuing employment in a field that  regularly required drug testing for safety reasons. The Department of  Labor was charged with determining those occupations.   This guidance is critical because courts have twice ruled against  States who implemented blanket testing for TANF benefits. Without  probably cause, they ruled that such testing violated constitutional  rights. By overriding the Department of Labor's rule, States are left  in confusion.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle might argue that the  authority to drug test is important to help save money in the program.  There is no clear evidence that this is the case. There is also no  convincing evidence of rampant drug use among beneficiaries. States  have engaged in drug testing for TANF recipients with remarkably few  results. In Oklahoma in 2015, nearly 90 percent of those required to  take a drug test had a negative result for drug use. In fiscal year  2014, Utah's drug testing returned just 18 positive results. As of  2016, only 0.1 percent of all applicants for Tennessee's cash  assistance program tested positive.   We all acknowledge an opioid crisis in our communities. Instead of  using resources to help people access treatment programs, we are  debating creating costly drug testing programs that have failed to  produce significant results in States where they have been tried. Over  in the House, they are considering TrumpCare, which would erode drug  treatment coverage. We should be working to address this tragedy, not  spending time on wasteful and damaging measures like these. I urge a  ``no'' vote.
