 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand as a Member of Congress  for my first floor speech. I purposefully rise to speak about the issue  of gun violence and, specifically, H.R. 8.   Last year, 40,000 people in America died of gun violence, over half  to suicide. Another 80,000 people were wounded, literally caught in the  crossfire.   This week, I was honored to stand with Gabby Giffords--a woman whose  public service inspired my own--the Speaker, and Chairman Thompson to  cosponsor H.R. 8.   Background checks work and the public knows we must pass this  legislation to save lives.   As I worked with Gabby Giffords, I was reminded of the words of  Robert Frost marking JFK's inauguration. He wrote: ``Courage is in the  air.''   We must act on that courage.                            ____________________
