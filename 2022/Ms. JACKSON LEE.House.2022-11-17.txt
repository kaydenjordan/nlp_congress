 Madam Speaker, I rise this morning to engage in a  limited, but hopefully important, discussion about America's history  and to encourage my colleagues for collaboration. It is in reference to  H.R. 40, the Commission to Study Slavery and Develop Reparation  Proposals.   I stand on the perspective of how important it is for us to engage in  dialogue. We are hearing across America that Americans are frightened  about the discussion of our differences.   This land was first held by the indigenous people, Native Americans.  Every other group came to America, whether or not you are of European  heritage, Hispanic heritage, Asian-Pacific, Southeast Asian, or whether  you are African heritage. As a descendant of enslaved Africans, we are  the only group that came as slaves to this country and held in bondage  for over 200 years.   You have not seen African Americans refuse their patriotism, refuse  to serve. We have served in every war since the Revolutionary War.   You have never seen African Americans refuse to shed blood for the  freedom of this country or to wear the uniform.   You have not seen us shy away from serving as firefighters and law  enforcement, teachers, businesspersons, social justice leaders, such as  Dr. King, John Lewis, and, yes, Malcolm X.   You have not seen us, as women--Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Harriet  Tubman, Coretta Scott King--stand away from the fight. We have embraced  freedom, justice, and equality.   You did not see us attack this most solid and somber institution,  sacred, on January 6, 2021. We were not the masses that were trying to  undermine democracy. In fact, in this last election, I stood on the  premise of defending democracy, and I take no back seat to my love of  this Nation.   And so I ask my colleagues, why do you in any way doubt the value and  importance of H.R. 40? The purpose is to acknowledge the fundamental  injustice and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and to  establish a commission to study and consider a national apology and  proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery.   It was based on the premise of racism. There was, in fact, no  compensation, no life insurance, no salaries. Slaves were born, lived,  and died in slavery, never seeing freedom. They worked from sunup and  beyond, and they worked until they fell dead in the fields.    They built this Nation. They built the United States Capitol. They  built the White House. They, in fact, created an economic engine by  making cotton king, and they created an economic engine by this  transatlantic slave trade.   The traders decided to stop trading spices and gold and to use the  human beings that they marched for 300 miles to weaken the slaves so  they would not have a fight before getting on those ships. Many dropped  into the watery grave before they got on. Many died in the dark  passage.   But yet, here we are today.   And so this is not pointing the finger. This is not accusatory. This  is, in fact, a reconciliation. I insist that we establish this  commission, and we must establish it by a vote or establish it by  executive order.   Reverend Mark Thompson, a political activist for social justice,  said: If we were granted H.R. 40 by executive order, it would be  America once and for all saying Black lives actually do matter and this  Nation must be repaired. It is restoration and repair, but it stands on  the basis of facts. There is no doubt that we have been impacted, that  DNA in the trajectory of slavery to today.   For example, COVID, Black African Americans got COVID at a rate  nearly 1\1/2\ times higher than that of White people, were hospitalized  at a rate nearly 4 times higher, and 3 times more likely to die. COVID  hit us very desperately.   Interestingly, a recent peer-reviewed study from Harvard Medical  School suggests that reparations for African Americans could have cut  COVID-19 transmission and infection rates both among Blacks and the  population at large. Reparations are curative, they are not punishment.  The analysis continued to look at data throughout the Nation.   And so as we move in this lame duck session, it is important that we  come together for reconciliation, restoration, and provide the  Commission to Study Slavery and to Develop Reparation Proposals.   I thank my colleagues for their support, and I believe together we  make America strong, America free, America just, and America equal.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have authored H.R. 40, legislation that  establishes a commission to study and develop reparation proposals for  African Americans. Congress must pass this bill to begin the process  toward reconciliation with the Black community. I have also called upon  President Biden to create the H.R. 40 Commission by Executive Order.   The purpose of H.R. 40 is to acknowledge the fundamental injustice  and inhumanity of slavery in the U.S. and to establish a commission to  study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for  the institution of slavery, its subsequent racial and economic  discrimination against African Americans, and the impact of these  forces on living African Americans. The Commission is also charged to  make recommendations to Congress on appropriate remedies.   Now--more than ever--the timing is ripe for the enactment of H.R. 40.  We have a President in the White House who has expressed his undeniable  support and we urge President Biden to institute this executive order.   My Democratic colleagues in the 117th Congress and I have made  historic strides in advancing H.R. 40 since it was first introduced in  1989 by the late Michigan Congressman Rep John Conyers. H.R. 40  garnered more support over the past 33 years; it has approximately 200  co-sponsors, including 25 U.S. senators. Also, it is supported by over  300 organizations and allies, including the National Conference of  Mayors.   One of my top priorities for this lame duck session of Congress in  November and December, regardless of who controls Congress, is to have  H.R. 40 pass the House of Representatives because. This will send a  message of broad support to President Biden and strengthen our hand in  urging him to create the Commission to Study and Develop Reparations  Proposals through Executive Order.   Reparations are overdue. Our entire country needs reparations, to  allow us to move forward as an untied society.   The concept of reparations is a well-established principle of  international law, defined as the act or process of repairing or  restoring.   It is payment for an injury; redress for a wrong done. In the context  of Black people in  [[Page H8552]]  North America, the concept of reparations essentially constitutes four  elements:   1) the formal acknowledgment of an historical wrong;   2) the recognition that there is a continuing injury;   3) the commitment to redress by the federal government which  sanctioned the enslavement and subsequent discrimination; and   4) the actual compensation in whatever form or forms that are agreed  upon.   The reparations movement does not focus on payments to individuals.  The harms under discussion from the legacy of slavery and racial  discrimination are seen in well-documented racial disparities in access  to education, health care, housing, insurance, employment and other  social goods.   Reparations settlements can be created in as many forms as necessary  to equitably address the many forms of injury sustained from chattel  slavery and its continuing vestiges.   Now--more than ever--the facts and circumstances facing our nation  demonstrate the importance of H.R. 40 and the necessity of placing our  nation on the path to reparative justice.   Reverend Mark Thompson, a political activist for social justice  remarked ``If we were granted H.R. 40 by executive order, it would be  America once and for all saying Black lives actually do matter, and  this nation must be repaired.'' I along with many others share in the  same sentiment.   The impact of the pandemic changed the nature of the conversation.  COVID has devastated the African American community.   According to the latest estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control, Black people get COVID-19 at a rate nearly one and a half  times higher than that of white people, are hospitalized at a rate  nearly four times higher, and are three times as likely to die from the  disease.   Interestingly, a recent peer-reviewed study from Harvard Medical  School suggests that reparations for African Americans could have cut  COVID-19 transmission and infection rates both among Blacks and the  population at large.   Their analysis, based on Louisiana data, determined that if  reparations payments had been made before the COVID-19 pandemic,  narrowing the wealth gap, COVID transmission rates in the state's  overall population could have been reduced by anywhere from 31 percent  to 68 percent.   In 2019, we have also seen hundreds of thousands peacefully take to  the streets in support of Black Lives and accountability for law  enforcement. Many of those protesters carried signs in support of H.R.  40 and made the important link between policing and the movement for  reparative justice.   Tragically, we have also witnessed insurrectionist attack this  institution, brandishing symbols of division and intolerance, that echo  back to the darkest periods of our nation's history. Clearly, we  require a reckoning to restore national balance and unity.   Four hundred years ago, ships set sail from the west coast of Africa  and in the process, began one of mankind's most inhumane practices:  human bondage and slavery.   For two centuries, human beings--full of hopes and fears, dreams and  concerns, ambition and anguish--were transported onto ships like  chattel, and the lives of many forever changed.   The reverberations from this horrific series of acts--a transatlantic  slave trade that touched the shores of a colony that came to be known  as America, and later a democratic republic known as the United States  of America--are unknown and worthy of exploration.   Approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved  in the United States and colonies that became the United States from  1619 to 1865.   The institution of slavery was constitutionally and statutorily  sanctioned by the Government of the United States from 1789 through  1865.   American Slavery is our country's original sin and its existence at  the birth of our nation is a permanent scar on our country's founding  documents, and on the venerated authors of those documents, and it is a  legacy that continued well into the last century.   The framework for our country and the document to which we all take  an oath describes African Americans as three-fifths a person.   The infamous Dred Scott decision of the United States Supreme Court,  issued just a few decades later, described slaves as private property,  unworthy of citizenship.   And, a civil war that produced the largest death toll of American  fighters in any conflict in our history could not prevent the  indignities of Jim Crow, the fire hose at lunch counters and the  systemic and institutional discrimination that would follow for a  century after the end of the Civil War.   The mythology built around the Civil War has obscured our discussions  of the impact of chattel slavery and made it difficult to have a  national dialogue on how to fully account for its place in American  history and public policy.   While it is nearly impossible to determine how the lives touched by  slavery could have flourished in the absence of bondage, we have  certain datum that permits us to examine how a subset of Americans-- African Americans--have been affected by the callousness of involuntary  servitude.   We know that in almost every segment of society--education,  healthcare, jobs and wealth--the inequities that persist in America are  more acutely and disproportionately felt in Black America.   This historic discrimination continues: African-Americans continue to  suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships  including but not limited to having nearly 1,000,000 black people  incarcerated; an unemployment rate more than twice the current white  unemployment rate; and an average of less than 1/16 of the wealth of  white families, a disparity which has worsened, not improved over time.   H.R. 40 follows the successful model of the reparations campaign for  Japanese-Americans interned during WWII. The campaign began with a 1980  congressional bill establishing a commission to investigate the  internment, evaluate and consider the amount and form reparations would  take, and make recommendations to the Congress for remedy. Based on the  Commission's findings, President Reagan signed into law the Civil  Liberties Act of 1988.   In short, H.R. 40 is not about direct payments to individuals. The  legislation creates the framework for a national discussion on the  enduring legacy of slavery, and the complex web of  discriminatory conduct sanctioned by the Federal government well into  the 20th century, to begin the necessary process of atonement and  recovery.    Assessing the quantifiable amount owed to Black citizens due to  generational racism and injustice should be left in a commission's  hands.   H.R. 40 seeks to establish a national commission to examine the  lasting economic effects of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and racially  discriminatory federal policies on income, wealth, educational, health,  and employment outcomes; to pursue truth and promote racial healing;  and to study reparations.   The committee should comprise of appointed members (seen in section  4) and pioneers in the field of reparatory justice.   I also support President Eiden in creating a reparations committee  through executive action.   Given the political limitations of moving legislation in the Senate,  an executive order is the only practical method for establishing an  H.R. 40 commission.   Black household wealth is less than one fifth of the national  average.   The median black household had a net worth of just $17,600 in 2016.  Yet in that same year, the median white household held $171,000 in  wealth while the national household median was $97,300.   The black unemployment rate is 6.6 percent more than double the  national unemployment rate.   Approximately 31 percent of black children live in poverty, compared  to 11 percent of white children. The national average is 18 percent,  which suggests that the percentage of black children living in poverty  is more than 150 percent of the national average.   In the healthcare domain, the disparities suffered by African  Americans is also troubling.   Over 20 percent of African Americans do not have health insurance,  compared to a national average between 8.8 percent and 9.1 percent.   One in four African American women are uninsured.   Compared to the national average, African American adults are 20  percent more likely to suffer from asthma and three times more likely  to die from it.   Black adults are 72 percent more likely to suffer from diabetes than  average.   Black women are four times more likely to die from pregnancy related  causes, such as embolisms, and pregnancy-related hypertension, than any  other racial group.   In our nation, among children aged 19-35 months, black children were  vaccinated at rates lower than white children: 68 percent versus 78  percent, respectively.   Education has often been called the key to unlocking social mobility.   African American students are less likely than white students to have  access to college-ready courses.   In fact, in 2011-12, only 57 percent of black students have access to  a full range of math and science courses necessary for college  readiness, compared to 81 percent of Asian American students and 71  percent of white students.   Black students spend less time in the classroom due to discipline,  which further hinders their access to a quality education.   Black students are nearly two times as likely to be suspended without  educational services as white students.   Black students are also 3.8 times as likely to receive one or more  out-of-school suspensions as white students.  [[Page H8553]]    In addition, black children represent 19 percent of the nation's  preschool population, yet 47 percent of those receiving more than one  out-of-school suspension.   In comparison, white students represent 41 percent of pre-school  enrollment but only 28 percent of those receiving more than one out-of- school suspension.   Even more troubling, black students are 2.3 times as likely to  receive a referral to law enforcement or be subject to a school-related  arrest as white students.   School districts with the most students of color, on average, receive  15 percent less per student in state and local funding than the whitest  districts.   And, of course, we cannot consider the disparities between black and  white in America without considering the intersection of African  Americans and the Criminal Justice system.   There are more Black men in bondage today who are incarcerated or  under correctional control, than there were black men who were enslaved  in the 1800s.   The United States locks up African American males at a rate 5.8 times  higher than the most openly racist country in the world ever did:   South Africa under apartheid (1993), African American males: 851 per  100,000.   United States (2006), African American males: 4,789 per 100,000.   Incarceration is not an equal opportunity punishment. For example,  incarceration rates in the United States by race were:   African Americans: 2,468 per 100,000.   Latinos: 1,038 per 100,000.   Whites: 409 per 100,000.   African American offenders receive sentences that are 10 percent  longer than white offenders for the same crimes and are 21 percent more  likely to receive mandatory-minimum sentences than white defendants  according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.   Looking at males aged 25-29 and by race, you can see what is going on  even clearer:   For White males ages 25-29: 1,685 per 100,000.   For Latino males ages 25-29: 3,912 per 100,000.   For African American males ages 25-29: 11,695 per 100,000. (That's 11  percent of Black men in their late 20s.)   Looking at males aged 25-29 and by race, you can see what is going on  even clearer:   For White males ages 25-29: 1,685 per 100,000.   For Latino males ages 25-29: 3,912 per 100,000.   For African American males ages 25-29: 11,695 per 100,000. (That's 11  percent of Black men in their late 20s.)   And African Americans are more likely to be victims of crimes.   Black children die from firearm homicides at a rate 10 times higher  than their white counterparts.   Overall, one in 50 murders is ruled justified--but when the killer is  white and the victim is a black man, the figure climbs to one in six.   A handgun homicide is nine times more likely to be found justified  when the killer is white and the victim is a black man.   Handgun killings with a white shooter and a black male victim exhibit  an even more dramatic bias: one in four is found justified.   But then again, we knew these inequities existed because for many  Black Americans, these disparities are just a part of daily life.   Examined in the aggregate, they represent a stunning chasm between  the destinies of White America and that of Black America.   This is why, in 1989, my predecessor as the most senior African  American on this august Judiciary Committee, the honorable John  Conyers, a past Chairman of this Committee introduced H.R. 40,  legislation that would establish a commission to study and develop  proposals attendant to reparations.   Though many thought it a lost cause, John Conyers believed that a day  would come when our nation would need to account for the brutal  mistreatment of African-Americans during chattel slavery, Jim Crow  segregation and the enduring structural racism endemic to our society.   I would like to take this moment to personally thank the estimable  John Conyers for his work on this legislation for the last thirty  years.   With the rise and normalization of white supremacist expression  during the Trump administration, the discussion of H.R. 40 and the  concept of restorative justice have gained more urgency, garnering the  attention of mainstream commentator, and illustrating the need for a  national reckoning.   H.R. 40 is intended to create the framework for a national discussion  on the enduring impact of slavery and its complex legacy to begin that  necessary process of atonement.   The designation of this legislation as H.R. 40 is intended to  memorialize the promise made by General William T. Sherman, in his 1865  Special Field Order No. 15, to redistribute 400,000 acres of formerly  Confederate owned coastal land in South Carolina and Florida,  subdivided into 40 acre plots.    In addition to the more well-known land redistribution, the Order  also established autonomous governance for the region and provided for  protection by military authorities of the settlements.   Though Southern sympathizer and former slaveholder President Andrew  Johnson would later overturn the Order, this plan represented the first  systematic form of Freedmen reparations.   Since its introduction, H.R. 40 has acted to spur some governmental  acknowledgement of the sin of slavery, but most often the response has  taken the form of an apology.   However, even the well intentioned commitments to examine the  historical and modern day implications of slavery by the Clinton  administration fell short of the mark and failed to inspire substantive  pubic discourse.   For many, it was not until The Atlantic published Ta-Nehisi Coates'  The Case for Reparations that the mainstream public began to reckon  with, or even consider, the concept of reparations.   Though the Federal government has been slow to engage the issue of  reparations, individuals, corporations and other public institutions  have engaged the discussion out of both necessity and conscience.   In 1994, a group of California plaintiffs brought suit against the  Federal government and by 2002, nine lawsuits were filed around the  country by the Restitution Study Group.   Though litigation has yielded only mixed success in court, a serious  foundation was laid for alternative forms of restitution.   For example, in 2005, J.P. Morgan & Company tried to make amends for  its role in the slave trade with an apology and a $5 million, five-year  scholarship fund for Black undergraduates in Louisiana.   In 2008, the Episcopal Church apologized for perpetuating American  slavery through its interpretation of the Bible and certain diocese  have implemented restitution programs.   In 2003, Brown University created the Committee on Slavery and  Justice to assess the University's role in slavery and determine a  response.   Similarly, in 2016, Georgetown University apologized for its  historical links to slavery and said it would give an admissions edge  to descendants of slaves whose sale in the roth century helped pay off  the U.S. school's debts.   In 2017, my alma mater Yale University announced that it would rename  Calhoun College--named for John C. Calhoun--would be changed to honor  Grace Murray Hopper, a trailblazing computer scientist who also served  as rear admiral in the United States Navy.   The University's president, Peter Salovey, indicated that removing  Calhoun's name was consistent with its values because Calhoun had a  legacy of a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately  promoted slavery as a positive good.   And, in April of this year, students at Georgetown University voted  in favor of paying reparations to the descendants of enslaved people  who were sold by the university in order to satisfy its debts.   In 1838, in a practice likely far wider spread than is likely  accounted for, Georgetown Jesuits sold 272 slaves who worked on  plantations.   When the results of the Georgetown poll were announced, the numbers  were overwhelming: 2/3 of students indicated that payments should be  funded to descendants of these slaves and would be paid for by a fee  that would apply to all undergraduate students.   While the vote was nonbinding, it nonetheless represents the first  time the student body of a university has voted to implement a  mandatory fee to account for reparations.   These are only a few examples of how private institution have begun  reckoning with their past records.   I expect that a growing number of institutions will be forced to  examine their histories of discrimination, if for no other reason than  increasing public scrutiny will force their history to light.   Since my reintroduction of H.R. 40 at the beginning of this Congress;  both the legislation and concept of reparations have become the focus  of national debate.   For many, it is apparent that the success of the Obama administration  has unleashed a backlash of racism and intolerance that is an echo of  America's dark past which has yet to be exorcised from the national  consciousness.   Commentators have turned to H.R. 40 as a response to formally begin  the process of analyzing, confronting and atoning for these dark  chapters of American history.   Even conservative voices, like that of New York Times columnist David  Brooks, are starting to give the reparations cause the hearing it  deserves, observing that ``Reparations are a drastic policy and hard to  execute, but the very act of talking and designing them heals a wound  and opens a new story.''   Similarly, a majority of the Democratic presidential contenders have  turned to H.R.40 as a tool for reconciliation, with 17 cosponsoring or  claiming they would sign the bill into law if elected.  [[Page H8554]]    Though critics have argued that the idea of reparations is unworkable  politically or financially, their focus on money misses the point of  the H.R. 40 commission's mandate.   The goal of these historical investigations is to bring American  society to a new reckoning with how our past affects the current  conditions of African Americans and to make America a better place by  helping the truly disadvantaged.   Consequently, the reparations movement does not focus on payments to  individuals, but to remedies that can be created in as many forms  necessary to equitably address the many kinds of injuries sustained  from chattel slavery and its continuing vestiges.   To merely focus on finance is an empty gesture and betrays a lack of  understanding of the depth of the unaddressed moral issues that  continue to haunt this nation.   While it might be convenient to assume that we can address the  current divisive racial and political climate in our nation through  race neutral means, experience shows that we have not escaped our  history.   Though the Civil Rights Movement challenged many of the most racist  practices and structures that subjugated the African American  community, it was not followed by a commitment to truth and  reconciliation.   For that reason, the legacy of racial inequality has persisted, and  left the nation vulnerable to a range of problems that continue to  yield division, racial disparities and injustice.   Reparations are ultimately about respect and reconciliation--and the  hope that one day, all Americans can walk together toward a more just  future.   We owe it to those who were ripped from their homes those many years  ago an ocean away; we owe it to the millions of Americans- yes they  were Americans--who were born into bondage, knew a life of servitude,  and died anonymous deaths, as prisoners of this system.   We owe it to the millions of descendants of these slaves, for they  are the heirs to a society of inequities and indignities that naturally  filled the vacuum after slavery was formally abolished 154 years ago.   Let us also do with the spirit of reconciliation and understanding  that this bill represents.   Finally, if we truly want to build better, brighter future, we can't  do it on a rotten foundation. Therefore, for the house that is America,  we must repair the damage caused by the original crime that separates  us. A house divided against itself cannot stand.   The H.R. 40 Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for  African Americans must be created by executive order. Today we call on  President Biden to right this historical wrong and take a monumental  step towards reparative justice.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the House  amendment to S. 3092, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  Improvement, Reform and Efficiency Act of 2021.   This legislation addresses the federal government's approach to  wildfires by setting a standard for implementing proactive plans of  action for responding to wildfires, and by requiring reports on the  effectiveness of FEMA programs.   These plans must include studies on providing housing assistance to  survivors of major disasters to resolve challenges, such as the lack of  proof of ownership, and to contract the National Academy of Sciences to  study potential solutions to address the availability and affordability  of insurance for disasters.   As the consequences of climate change become our new reality, it is  our responsibility to be prepared in accordance with those changes.   Climate change exacerbates wildfires and vice versa, like a vicious  cycle that can't be extinguished.   According to a report from the United Nations Environment Prgramme,  the number of wildfires worldwide is projected to grow 50 percent by  the year 2100.   The UN Environment Programme experts also reported that governments  are not prepared for this shift.   This is no longer a matter of prevention, but rather a matter of  preparation for what is ahead of us and for generations to come.   Across the nation, wildfires have disproportionately affected low- income families and people of color.   Disaster insurance for those in rural areas, low-income  neighborhoods, and immigrant communities are often inaccessible, even  though they are most at risk.   Native Americans are six times more vulnerable to the impacts of  wildfires than their white counterparts due in part to the fact that  they were forced to settle in fire-prone areas.   The FIRE Act would assess the need for the federal government to  produce maps that identify wildfire zones.   This bill would also allow Indigenous tribal governments to apply for  grants to better equip emergency operations centers.   Disaster prevention insurance has increasingly become inaccessible,  especially to low-income families.   Disaster insurance is often beyond the reach of family budgets that  are burdened with the skyrocketing prices of rent and food.   In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, tens of thousands of families  were displaced after their homes were destroyed.   According to community advocates, about 50 percent of those  households impacted by Harvey were low-income households and many of  those damaged homes were in Black and Latino neighborhoods.   I worked tirelessly alongside the Houston Housing authority to  reverse a FEMA decision  [[Page H8560]]  to not provide any fundings for the 428 Program, which would repair  public low-income housing damaged by the Hurricane.   In cases of disaster, S. 3092 would require initiation of a process  to determine the possible benefits or disadvantages of providing  relocation assistance, addressing the growing housing issue for victims  of disasters.   In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria that wreaked havoc on Puerto  Rico, 92 percent of homes were damaged and 98 percent of those homes  applied for FEMA's housing assistance.   According to the American Bar Association, 40 percent of those in  need of housing assistance were denied due to a lack of ownership  documentation stemming from generational inheritance of homes without  government recordkeeping.   The FIRE Act would also develop a plan to address housing assistance  for those who may lack ownership documentation in case of a disaster.   The effects of climate change are no longer a ``what if,'' but our  new reality.   Since these large-scale disasters will be inflicting damage with  increasing frequency, we must be prepared for them.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security, I rise in support of H.R. 8416, the  ``Disasters of Survivors Fairness Act of 2022.''   The Federal Emergency Management Agency's mission is to help  Americans prepare for, respond, and recover from disasters.   From day one, FEMA has been committed to protecting and serving  Americans who have been impacted by disasters.   Unfortunately, though, the toll of disasters is much greater on most  Americans than it is on those who are wealthier.   A 2020 FEMA National Advisory Committee report stated that disaster  relief programs ``provide an additional boost to wealthy homeowners and  others with less need, while lower-income individuals and others sink  further into poverty after disasters.''   It is unfair that any survivor of disasters must suffer because of  disparities in FEMA disaster response that have gone unchallenged for  far too long.   For example, FEMA records show that low-income homeowners were denied  30 percent of the time compared to higher-income owners, who were  denied 13 percent of the time, a 17-point difference.   Unfortunately, these disparities reveal the experience of African  American and Hispanic Americans.   Threats posed by natural disasters intensify existing social and  racial and ethnic inequities. After a natural disaster, people in  disadvantaged communities have worse outcomes due to stresses or  exposures to other risks associated with a disaster.   Low-income people and people of color are more likely to live in  disaster-prone areas, live in lower-quality housing that is less safe  when disasters occur, and have chronic illnesses that make them more  vulnerable.   As climate change accelerates and intensifies, the natural disasters  that it causes take a steeper toll each year.   Since climate change affects health in a variety of ways, disaster  mitigation and response planning must be scoped in advance to  ameliorate the consequences, hardships, and inequities.   To ensure that FEMA will lead equitable health interventions during  disaster response, we must enable it to provide evidence-based policy,  programming, and service delivery designed to protect health and  promote health equity during disaster response and recovery.   Our nation is ill-prepared to deal with successive extreme weather  events occurring nearly simultaneously, just as in 2017, when  Hurricanes Harvey, Jose and Maria hit within days of each other, while  wildfires burned in California.   One thing is certain after speaking with the people of Houston who,  unfortunately, are all too familiar with these problems: We require a  disaster recovery system that is designed to help the people who truly  need it.   H.R. 8416 would:   develop a universal application for federal disaster assistance;   remove the requirement that households must be rendered  uninhabitable;   authorize the president to provide direct assistance to individuals  and households;   remove the requirement that a household must be rendered  uninhabitable;   allow FEMA to enter agreements with state agencies to provide funding  for a website that will have information related to post disaster  recovery funding and resources; and save taxpayer dollars by ensuring  that FEMA resources are going to those who need the most help.  [[Page H8566]]    I have seen the dedication and hard work of FEMA professionals who  provide relief to victims of disasters. But the unending string of  disasters is stretching the fabric of emergency response systems across  the nation. The pain and financial hardship that they cost the American  people can be seen in headlines across the country.   We in Congress must do our part to enable FEMA to do more without  diminishing the support of communities before, during, and after  disasters.   No one was prepared for five days of subfreezing temperatures, ice-  and snow-covered roads, and a failed energy grid throughout the state  of Texas.   Texas power providers, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)  and Entergy Corporation, did not provide the needed weatherization of  power generating and delivery equipment after being warned in 2011  after a cold snap that the system would fail if these steps were not  taken.   The number of additional deaths uses mortality data from the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention to compare the number of deaths from  all causes that were reported in Texas during and after the storm with  the number of fatalities that are normally reported during ordinary  conditions.   That method is known as ``excess fatalities'' and has been employed  during other disasters, like the COVID-19 pandemic, to estimate related  death tolls.   In the aftermath of the storm millions of Texans struggled with the  effects of the deadly winter storm, people of color and low-income  communities who were disproportionately affected by blackouts and burst  pipes could now face the hardest journey to recovery, experts said.   Hurricane Harvey hit a thousand square mile of Texas, just as in the  past when Ike struck, but the telling sign of Blue Tarp Roofs are only  in low-income, black, and brown communities' years after the storms  have passed.   In the past the tools and resources available to FEMA to support  disaster reponse and recovery have been limited to meals, water, trap.   Local, tribal, territorial, and state governments had to make request  for aid to be provided.   For more substantial assistance, government contracting, and awards  must be put into place, which can take months and in some cases years  to get resources to victims.   This is too much time for survivors to have to wait for help.   The historic winter weather exacerbated pre-existing disparities like  poor infrastructure and lack of resources in marginalized communities.  Black and Latino communities who were disproportionately hit by COVID- 19 now must struggle to recover from one of the worst weather events to  ever hit Texas.   The nine-county Houston metro area impacted by Hurricane Harvey  covers 9,444 square miles, an area larger than five states. Including  New Hampshire, New Jersy, and Connecticut.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston was  underwater.   Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S.  in our nation's history.   Hurricane Harvey damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were  destroyed.   These are not simply numbers, these are families. Son and daughters,  mothers and fathers, friends, mentors, and caretakers, all who are  deserving of ample disaster response and recover efforts.   There was no way to pre-prepare for Hurricanes Harvey, Katrina, Ian,  or any of the other major disaster event.   What we can do is learn as much as possible and apply those lessons  to future disaster response and recovery efforts.   When there is a catastrophic event, like Hurricane Harvey, there are  important and valuable lessons that can help us to meet future  challenges.   My constituents in Houston understand that our capacity to deal with  hurricanes directly reflects our ability to respond to a terrorist  attack in Texas or New York, an earthquake in California, or a  nationwide pandemic.   On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that COVID- 19 was a pandemic, which had by that date reached at least 114  countries, sickening over 100,000 people, and killing more than 4,000.   It is the duty of Congress to make sure that FEMA is prepared to meet  any challenge while bringing equity to the response made during  disasters.   The work of the FEMA Office of Disaster Recovery and the Office of  Disaster Recovery are critical when disaster strikes and for this  reason, they should be a permanent part of the agency.   This is one of the reasons, I introduced the FEMA Modernization Act  (H.R. 3060) in the 116th Congress.   H.R. 3060:   makes permanent the FEMA Office of Disaster Response and the FEMA  Office of Disaster Recovery;   creates an ombudsman for each office to assist survivors and  victims';   establishes a new National Disaster Medical Triage Capacity and an  Incident Medical Recovery Management Team to set best practices for  Advanced Trauma Life Support capabilities, enable medical evaluations,  and assess health impacts that result from disasters;   creates an office of ombudsman to work within the agency to create  equity and access;   provides for accurate reporting on deaths and missing persons; and   reports data on effective casework management for the provision of  survivor benefits and services.   All survivors of disaster deserve a fair chance at obtaining disaster  recovery and relief. We owe it to those who were ripped from their  homes and left with nothing.   This bill provides the program support that is needed, since there is  nowhere in the United States immune from disaster.
