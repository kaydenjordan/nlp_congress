 Mr. President, today I wish to call attention to  President Trump's recent decisions to withdraw or threaten U.S.  withdrawal from four treaties: the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces  Treaty, INF Treaty; the Universal Postal Union, UPU, treaty; the  Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,  ``VCDR Option Protocol''; and the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations  and Consular Rights between the United States and Iran, ``Treaty of  Amity''. The President made these decisions without notice or  meaningful consultation with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,  the congressional committee charged with responsibility and  jurisdiction over treaties.   As the ranking member of that committee, I am compelled to  strenuously object to the manner in which the President has acted, but  all Senators should protest, regardless of their views on the substance  of the respective agreements. The President's actions erode the  constitutional powers of this body and our institutional prerogatives.   Article 2 of the Constitution endows the President and the Senate  with shared power over treaties. The President, it states, ``shall have  power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make  treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.''   While the Constitution does not expressly dictate a procedure for  terminating treaty relationships, Senators have long asserted that the  shared treaty power extends to withdrawal and therefore also requires  Senate advice and consent. Even though the executive branch may not  agree with this position, what is unacceptable is that Senators are  first learning about these withdrawals online or in the newspaper  instead of through proactive outreach by and meaningful dialogue with  the executive branch.   President Trump has regrettably shown exceedingly little respect for  the Constitution and for the institutional prerogatives of this body. I  stand today to highlight one area in which he has actively undermined  the Senate's constitutional role and authority. I plan to do everything  in my power to protect the Senate's role and responsibilities over  treaties and urge all of my colleagues to join in this effort.                            ____________________
