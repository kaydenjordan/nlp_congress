 Madam President, first, before my colleague from Georgia  leaves, I want to thank him for his strong statement on the fact that  we have to do defense appropriations.   I know that the Presiding Officer certainly knows all about this,  given her Active-Duty service on behalf of our Nation.   As he has pointed out, every service has been affected by this.  Speaking for the U.S. Marine Corps, part of the Marine Caucus that we  have here, and talking with Bob Neller, who is our retiring  Commandant--he has pointed out specifically that they don't have enough  to do--I mean, we are proud of the Marine Corps. I always say we do  more with less, but this time, you can't do more with less and then  less and then less, and that is precisely where we are.   I thank the Senator for making an outstanding statement. I join him  in this plea on a bipartisan basis to get these appropriations bills  done.   Thank you.
