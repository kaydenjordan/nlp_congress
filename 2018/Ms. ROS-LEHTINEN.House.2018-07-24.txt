 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Paul  Kruss and Hussain Mohammed on their recent recognition by Boys Town  Jerusalem.   Paul and Mo are the proprietors of Mo's Bagels and Deli located in  beautiful south Florida. Although some may know these two for serving  up some of the best bagels and lox in Aventura, many know them for  their world-class philanthropy and community involvement.   Most recently, Paul and Mo have joined forces to support Boys Town  Jerusalem, a phenomenal academic institution transforming the lives of  disadvantaged boys into productive members of Israeli society.   Whether it be involvement in local causes at home or ensuring success  for the next generations abroad, Paul and Mo's dedication and  commitment to helping those who need it the most is unwavering. Paul  Kruss and Hussain Mohammed are champions of noble causes, champions for  Israel, and champions for our south Florida community.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of the work accomplished by Paul and by  Mo, and I congratulate them on this much-deserved recognition by Boys  Town Jerusalem.   Mazel tov, amigos.                            ____________________
