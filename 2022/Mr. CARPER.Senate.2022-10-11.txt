 Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the 100th  anniversary of the Rehoboth Beach Patrol in Rehoboth Beach, DE. With  over a century of excellence in safety, a strong history in lifeguard  competition achievements, and a fully operational emergency medical  unit, the Rehoboth Beach Patrol is a leading beach patrol in the  Nation.   It takes a world class beach patrol to protect a world-class beach,  and over the years, the beach patrol has expanded from its humble  beginnings. The Rehoboth Beach Patrol was established in 1921 by  Benjamin F. Shaw and the Red Cross with just two guards. In 1938, it  expanded to 17 guards protecting eight beaches. Over the years, the  beach patrol added additional guards to a total of 65 and lifesaving  equipment, as Rehoboth Beach attracted more and more tourists far and  wide to enjoy its beaches.   Perhaps most impressive is that over its more than 100-year history,  the beach patrol has recorded only one drowning under its watch. The  beach patrol prides itself on ensuring safety both in the water and on  its beaches, something that a machine or camera cannot do. It is the  skill of the lifeguards, their attention, and ability to manage the  beach that keeps everyone safe and having fun.   When an organization like the Rehoboth Beach Patrol reaches a 100- year milestone, it has seen much more change than just the style of  bathing suits, it has also seen a change in the demographics of its  members. From just two men to a diverse group of lifeguards that are  half women, the beach patrol is a reflection of the changes in the  seaside town over the century.   I am honored to rise today to honor the many men and women of the  Rehoboth Beach Patrol who have sacrificed their safety in order to  protect others. They are true public servants who make Rehoboth Beach-- and our great State--a wonderful and safe place for people of all ages  to visit and enjoy. You are all a point of pride for our State, and I  wish you many more years of service to Delaware.                            ____________________
