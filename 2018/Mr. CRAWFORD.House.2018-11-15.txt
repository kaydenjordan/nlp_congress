 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to join my colleagues  in celebrating the life of Damon Nelson.   While I have only served on the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence for a short time, I grew to know, respect, and cherish  Damon as a professional and as a friend. Our work on the committee is  some of the most challenging and rewarding I have done since being  elected to this body and is supported almost entirely by a loyal staff  whose dedication to the American people is second to none.   As staff director, Damon set the tone and direction of committee  staff who work closely with us as members and others in the House. He  always greeted us with a smile and positive attitude. His leadership  ensured we were fully equipped and prepared for every caucus meeting,  hearing, or legislative issue. His staff saw him as a leader who wanted  us to have the best, most accurate information and preparation for our  work. They followed him with trust and appreciation for his approach to  his work.   As you have heard, he served in the Air Force and deployed to the  Persian Gulf War where he earned numerous medals. Over the following  years, he moved on to serve in the Capitol here. Over the next many  years, Damon moved up and eventually took the helm of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence at a tumultuous time for this Chamber  and for our country. His poise, his character, his attitude, and his  care for our country shined through in recent years as this committee  worked on some extremely sensitive and public matters. Not once did  Damon put his own interests above anyone else's. He simply sought to  serve his country through his role on this committee and in this body.    Mr. Speaker, I wish him and his family the best.                            ____________________
