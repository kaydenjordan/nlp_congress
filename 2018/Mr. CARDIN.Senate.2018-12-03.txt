 Madam President, today I wish to recognize the 30th  anniversary of World AIDS Day, which was this Saturday, December 1.  This year, we can celebrate 30 years of progress made to fight HIV/AIDS  globally and double down on our commitment to creating an AIDS-free  generation.   Last week, Congress passed another bipartisan reauthorization of the  President's Plan for Emergency AIDS Relief PEPFAR. Since launching in  2003, PEPFAR has had a transformational impact on HIV/AIDS by  catalyzing an incredible global response that has saved and transformed  the lives of those living with HIV. Through PEPFAR, the United States  has provided over 14 million people with lifesaving antiretroviral  treatment in more than 50 countries. Two years ago, I had the privilege  of meeting a 30-year-old man in Namibia named Simon who said thanked  the American people for supporting the lifesaving treatment and care  that he received through PEPFAR and the Global Fund. Individual stories  of patients, like Simon, speak to the incredible impact of our  collective efforts. They underscore the importance of maintaining  support for the programs, including PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and  UNAIDS, that made this success to date possible.   When PEPFAR began in 2003, only 50,000 children were on lifesaving  treatment in Africa; now, over 700,000 children are supported by  antiretroviral treatment. PEPFAR has enabled over 2.4 million babies of  HIV-infected mothers to be born HIV-free. It has provided critical care  and support for more than 6.8 million orphans, vulnerable children, and  their caregivers to mitigate the physical, emotional, and economic  impact of HIV/AIDS. These are only a few of the many ways we have  progressed in combatting HIV/AIDS.   Integral to reducing the number of new HIV cases and the viral loads  of those living with HIV is testing. The theme of this year's World  AIDS Day is ``know your status.'' HIV testing allows people to make  informed decisions about their future, including options for treatment  and prevention. According to data from UNAIDS, in 2017, 36.9 million  people were living with HIV. Of those 36.9 million, 75 percent were  aware of their HIV status. These numbers have steadily increased over  the years, and we must continue our work to expand access to, and  remove the stigmas associated with, HIV testing.   While there is much to celebrate, there is still a tremendous amount  of work to be done. PEPFAR reports that only 52 percent of children  ages 0 to 14 with HIV have access to lifesaving treatment, compared to  59 percent of adults with HIV. In 2017, 180,000 children were newly  infected with HIV. That is 180,000 too many.   Threats to the continued progress of critically important programs  have come from our own leadership in the White House, which continues  annually to propose enormous funding cuts for both PEPFAR and the  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. We must continue  to press the Trump administration to recognize the colossal harm of  restricting funding to these programs, including the lifesaving  treatment and evidence-based prevention interventions they provide to  men, women, and children, and the greater impact on achieving epidemic  control. I call on the Trump administration to reverse its  reinstatement and expansion of the Mexico City policy, often referred  to as the ``global gag rule,'' which impedes the ability of  organizations to provide lifesaving prevention, detection, and  treatment services. These investments must be not only continued, but  increased, as we can see an AIDS-free generation on the horizon.   While we celebrate the progress that we have made on the 30th  anniversary of Global AIDS Day, we must recommit ourselves to combat  HIV/AIDS both at home and abroad, beginning with testing. With the  commitment of partner countries, reinforced by the support of donor  nations, civil society, people living with HIV, faith-based  organizations, scientific research community and academia like Johns  Hopkins University and the University of Maryland, the private sector,  foundations, and implementing organizations like Catholic Relief  Services and Lutheran World Relief, success in the fight against HIV/ AIDS is within our grasp.                            ____________________
