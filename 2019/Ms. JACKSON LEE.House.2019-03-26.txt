 Madam Speaker, I want to speak openly to my friends  and colleagues. Take a moment to look to your right as you come into  this body, to the memorial that was put together by the Parkland  students and other gun victims. It will pain your heart and move you to  action.   It acknowledges that 722 people die every week from gun violence. It  acknowledges that teenagers may lose their lives, and it has a form to  indicate which teenager is next. It has flowers, and it says, ``Stop  killing us.''   Every Member of Congress should walk by that memorial today, commit  themselves to be decent and do decent things, and recognize that we  should have gun safety legislation.   I rise as well to say that women who are not being paid or who are  supporting families need the paycheck legislation that I will be  supporting tomorrow.   I also say that this country must not accept behavior by a President  as a norm, and the Mueller report and the facts must be had. We must do  it quietly and respectfully, and we must have our hearings to tell the  truth.   Finally, I am outraged, coming from a State that was a poster child  for the persons without healthcare, that this administration would try  to oppose the Affordable Care Act. We are going to fight it. We are  going to try to save the lives of our children and provide healthcare  for all.                            ____________________
