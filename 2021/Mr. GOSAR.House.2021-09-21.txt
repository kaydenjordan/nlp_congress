 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   This amendment includes the Grand Canyon Protection Act, falsely  named legislation, which has nothing to do with the Grand Canyon and is  a cover for a giant Federal land grab that hurts our economy and our  national security.   This land grab of over one million acres in my State will destroy as  many as 4,000 jobs and cost $29 billion in sacrificed economic  activity.   Now, I am perplexed that the majority would bring this up under the  National Defense Authorization as this reckless land grab actually  hurts our national security. We heard from the gentleman from Colorado  that these are areas where we have some high grade uranium. In fact,  the costarter of Greenpeace, Michael Shellenberger, has actually said  that if you want a green economy like the other side does, you  definitely have to have nuclear, and this is one of those ways.    But we constantly keep going down this road where we make ourselves  dependent on other countries, like Russia, Uzbekistan, and those areas.  Isn't it interesting that we want to subjugate ourselves to foreign  interests and foreign oversight? That is not the way we should be doing  it. We should have our own way of doing it.   Last but not least, the way uranium is actually leached into the  atmosphere is by air and by water, which are the portals that these  breccia pipes have contained. Actually, taking the breccia pipes out of  this area actually makes it easier for penetration of water in our  subsurface areas.   I urge this not be adopted and once again return it back to our  States for any other jurisdiction.
