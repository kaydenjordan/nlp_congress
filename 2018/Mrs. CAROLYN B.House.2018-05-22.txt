 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong opposition to S. 2155.   It is important to remember why we passed Dodd-Frank in the first  place. We were suffering from the worst financial downturn in our  country. This country suffered $15 trillion in household wealth that  was lost. Eight million people lost their jobs and 6 million people  lost their homes due to unfair and deceptive banking practices.   Dodd-Frank put in place protections for consumers.   Prior to the crisis, predatory lenders saddled unsuspecting borrowers  with toxic mortgages that they didn't understand and could not afford.  Too often, these predatory lenders targeted communities of color, and  when these toxic mortgages blew up, it devastated these communities.   In response, we passed Dodd-Frank, which imposed tough new rules on  mortgage lenders and beefed up our efforts to crack down on lending  discrimination.   This bill would actually roll back some of these important  protections. The bill would undermine fair lending laws by exempting  the majority of lenders from the new reporting requirements on lending  discrimination.    MALONEY of New York. The bill would also weaken the  protections for mobile-home buyers by allowing retailers of mobile  homes to accept kickbacks in exchange for steering borrowers into  predatory loans that they can't afford. It is a terrible practice that  Dodd-Frank outlawed.   The list goes on and on and on.   While the bill does contain some provisions that every House Democrat  has supported, taken together, the bill goes too far in weakening the  key mortgage rules that Dodd-Frank put in place. So I urge my  colleagues to come together in a strong ``no'' vote.
