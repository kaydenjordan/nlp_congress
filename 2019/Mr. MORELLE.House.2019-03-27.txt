 Madam Speaker, in honor of the final week of Women's  History Month, I am proud to join a group of bipartisan colleagues in  introducing the National Women's Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act.   As the National Women's Hall of Fame celebrates its 50th anniversary,  this will help ensure the financial viability and longevity of this  iconic historical landmark for years to come.   I am especially pleased that our very own Louise Slaughter will be  inducted into the hall of fame this year: a fitting tribute for one of  the most inspiring women I have had the privilege of knowing.   Louise will take her place alongside some of our Nation's  trailblazers in the city that forever altered the course of women's  rights in our Nation.   I am delighted that this legislation will help ensure that Louise,  and so many other remarkable women in the hall of fame, will continue  to inspire generations to come.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to diligently working toward its  passage, and I encourage my colleagues to support this important bill.                            ____________________
