 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Interior  Department appropriations bill, which the Senate is currently debating.   Before Senator Murkowski leaves the floor, I want to thank her so  much. It has been such a pleasure working with her on this and doing it  in a bipartisan way, and I am going to talk a little bit about the  historic nature of this; that we have accomplished something that  hasn't been done in 10 years. This is something I think we are both  very proud of and that I think the Appropriations Committee members are  very proud of. I begin by thanking her for the important work she has  undertaken to ensure that this bill arrived on the Senate floor with  strong bipartisan support.   We all know the Interior bill is not an easy bill, and there is no  doubt we faced contentious issues putting it together. It is  extraordinary that working together under her leadership, we have  produced a bill that was unanimously reported by the Appropriations  Committee.   I also recognize Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy for clearing  the path for us to bring this bill to the floor. Their shared  commitment to reestablishing regular order for the Appropriations  Committee is why the Interior bill is on the floor of the U.S. Senate  today. For the first time in nearly a decade, I salute them as well on  this.   The bill funds the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs  and provides resources for new healthcare facilities in schools for  Tribes across the country that are working to improve health and  education outcomes. This funding helps fulfill our trust and treaty  responsibilities to American Indians and Alaska Natives.   This bill includes strong levels of funding for conservation programs  that preserve and protect our Nation's most special places, including  our public lands. It fully funds wildfire suppression needs, providing  more than $2 billion to protect communities and natural resources in  New Mexico and across the West.   The Interior bill supports our Nation's arts and culture programs  from national institutions here in Washington, from the Smithsonian  Institution, the Kennedy Center, and the National Gallery of Art to  local arts and humanities and programs in small towns across the United  States. This funding creates jobs and supports economic vitality in our  communities.   Over the last week, we have seen the administration claim that the  legislation sent over by the House has too much funding for these and  other priorities. I strongly disagree. It is Congress's responsibility  to safeguard the environment, protect our air and water, fulfill our  trust and treaty responsibilities, and conserve public lands the  Federal Government holds on behalf of the American people.   These responsibilities require a reliable stream of resources to  carry that out. This Senate bill accomplishes those goals and, in doing  so, remains faithful to the bipartisan budget agreement this Congress  passed and the President signed early this year.   We reject the shameful and inexcusable cuts proposed by the Trump  administration to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of  Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Education, and to most Federal  land management agencies, cuts that would put our environment at risk  and prevent us from providing core services to Tribal communities.   In addition to rejecting these cuts, Senator Murkowski and I worked  together to satisfy requests from our colleagues to increase funding  levels where we could, given our allocation. We also followed the  chairman and vice chairman's direction to keep out extraneous  authorizing matters and any item considered a poison pill. We all know  one Senator's poison pill is another Senator's antidote. We couldn't  please everyone because the tough issues that have impeded this bill  from floor consideration in the last decade have not gone away, but we  did the best we could.   Now, this bill is not perfect. It includes several troubling  provisions rolling over from prior years, including provisions relating  to the listing status of the sage grouse, the lead content of  ammunition, biomass energy policy, and certain Clean Air Act  exemptions.  [[Page S5126]]  While I cannot endorse these provisions individually, they are ones we  have carried previously to move this bill across the finish line.   What the Appropriations Committee has brought to the full Senate is  an Interior Department appropriations bill that is almost exclusively  appropriations.   I am proud that we propose for fiscal year 2020, proud that we  propose for fiscal year 2019. In addition to the programs I have  already highlighted, let me tell you about a few more accomplishments  in this bill.   This bill rejects the administration's elimination of the Land and  Water Conservation Fund and instead provides $425 million equal to the  enacted level. These funds will improve recreational access through our  Federal lands, protect iconic landscapes, deliver grants to States and  local governments to create and protect urban parks and open spaces,  preserve the battlefields of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and give  farmers and ranchers easements so they can steward their private lands  in the face of development pressures.    Rather than following the administration's misguided proposal to  eliminate funding for the National Endowment of the Arts and  Humanities, this bill actually provides an increase of $2 million for  each endowment, bringing the total to $155 million for each. I am  particularly proud that these funds will expand arts and humanities  programs, create jobs, and support cultural institutions in every  State.   The bill includes a 4-percent increase for the Indian Health Service  and includes $10 million in new grant funds to help Tribes address  opioid addiction and substance abuse challenges in Indian Country, as  Chairman Murkowski talked about a little bit in her speech.   This bill fully funds the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program to assist  local governments to improve their schools and roads and pay for public  safety and law enforcement.   This bill maintains funding for the EPA at the fiscal year 2018- enacted level to protect our environment and public health. We have  taken a strong position rejecting the devastating cuts the President  has proposed for the third year in a row. Our bipartisan track record  on EPA funding makes it loud and clear that such extreme proposals will  continue to be viewed in Congress as dead on arrival.   Now, I feel strongly that keeping EPA funding flat year after year is  insufficient to meet the true needs of EPA's clean water programs,  clean air programs, State and Tribal assistance grants, environmental  enforcement, and a score of other critical public health and  environmental programs. While I recognize the bill before us is a  compromise, I will continue to pursue increased funding for these  critical EPA programs in future years.   I recognize there is always room for improvement, and I welcome all  of our colleagues to speak with me or Chairman Murkowski if you have an  idea on how to improve funding in this bill.   As I conclude, I want to emphasize how tremendous it has been to work  with Chairman Murkowski on this bipartisan bill. Even when we disagree,  we have open discussions and listen to one another. That is the way  Congress is supposed to work, and I am proud to be Senator Murkowski's  partner on this bill.   I look forward to working with our colleagues on this bill over this  week so we can pass an interior appropriations bill that the American  people can be proud of.   As Chairman Murkowski talked about, we have had the assistance of a  very able staff on both sides--on the minority side, headed up by  Rachael Taylor. The whole staff on both sides is very capable and very  able. My side was headed up by Rachael Taylor, Ryan Hunt, Melissa  Zimmerman, and Teri Curtin. Over on the majority side, we thank Leif  Fonnesbeck, Emy Lesofski, Nona McCoy, Chris Tomassi, and LaShawnda  Smith.   They work night and day, and when we run into problems, as we know,  they can be invaluable in helping us find the solutions to the problems  we all face when we get into some of the contentious issues.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Teddy  Draper, Sr.--a brave Navajo code talker and a beloved teacher who has  helped keep the Navajo language alive.   Mr. Draper was born in Canyon del Muerto--a beautiful and ancient  canyon within the Canyon del Chelly National Monument--near Chinle, AZ.  Mr. Draper was a longtime and popular Chinle resident and passed away  December 14, 2017, at age 96. He was one of the last Navajo code talker  survivors.   As a young boy, Mr. Draper grew up speaking Navajo and helping his  family  [[Page S5127]]  raise cattle, sheep, and turkeys in Canyon del Muerto. He didn't attend  school until age 14. ``I barely knew a word of English,'' he said. At  that time, the reservation's U.S. Government-run boarding school in  Fort Wingate, NM, punished students for speaking Navajo. Time after  time, ``I had to kneel in the corner,'' he said, and he tried to run  away.   The Marines recruited Mr. Draper from high school to join the Navajo  code talkers. He served in the Fifth Marine Division and fought at Iwo  Jima.   Iwo Jima was a critically strategic battle for the Allies. The island  served as a Japanese air base and safe haven for naval units, and the  Allies wanted to secure it to support bombing missions and emergency  air landings. During the first 2 days of the 36-day battle, six Navajo  code talkers worked around the clock, sending and receiving more than  800 messages--all without error. According to Marine division signal  officer Major Howard Connor, ``Were it not for the Navajo, the Marines  would never have taken Iwo Jima.''   During the battle, a bomb on Mount Suribachi killed two of his fellow  soldiers and cost Mr. Draper most of his hearing. Atop that same mount,  Mr. Draper radioed, on February 25, 1945, ``We have raised the flag; we  have taken the hill.'' The ``first raising of the flag'' on Mount  Suribachi is famously memorialized in a wartime photograph and by the  Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, VA.   After the war, Mr. Draper volunteered for occupation duty, and became  so fluent in Japanese that he served as an interpreter. Mr. Draper  said, ``When I was going to boarding school, the U.S. government told  us not to speak Navajo, but during the war, they wanted us to speak  it!'' During combat, he determined that ``if I can get back to the  reservation safely, I want to become a Navajo language teacher and  educate young Navajos.'' That is exactly what he did. Mr. Draper  dedicated himself to preserving the Navajo language--Dine bizaad-- teaching many years at Rough Rock Community High School. He lacked  teaching materials, and so he created his own, producing a curriculum  and two workbooks that continue to be the staple of many Navajo  language classes today.   Despite his loss of hearing from the war, Mr. Draper was not awarded  the Purple Heart until 2004, after years of appeals. In 2001, he  received the Congressional Silver Medal, along with other Navajo code  talkers. In 2013, he received the Arizona Indian Living Treasures  Award.   Mr. Draper leaves 12 children, 57 grandchildren, and more than 20  great-grandchildren. Mr. Draper also leaves a remarkable legacy of  commitment to country and community, and I honor his life today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Pedro  Gonzalez--a brave World War II veteran who endured the Bataan Death  March and 3\1/2\ years in captivity in the Philippines and in Japan.  Mr. Gonzalez passed away January 6, 2018, at the age of 96.   Mr. Gonzalez was born in Las Cruces, NM, and later moved to Los  Lunas, where he graduated from high school. Shortly after graduation,  in 1940, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He was assigned to the 19th  Bombardment Group in the Philippines.   On December 8, 1941--7 hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor-- Japanese bombers attacked U.S. military stations in the Philippines.  Mr. Gonzalez had learned earlier that they had attacked Hawaii, and,  when he first heard planes that morning, he thought there were U.S.  reinforcements. They were not.   Mr. Gonzalez and American troops fought valiantly to defend the  Philippines, but they ran low on ammunitions, supplies, food, and  manpower and were forced to surrender in April 1942. Fifteen thousand  Americans and 60,000 Filipinos were taken prisoner.   These prisoners of war then began the 60-mile long Bataan Death  March. Mr. Gonzalez was only 20 years old. He recalled they had ``no  food, no water,'' that men were beaten and beheaded, and bodies were  strewn in the road. During the march, one of his commanding officers  told him, ``Pete, you keep that smile on your face and you're gonna  make it back.'' During part of the journey, the men were hauled in box  cars, packed as tight as could be. Mr. Gonzalez stood right at the edge  of the door and survived, but it was said that five to six of the men  in his boxcar died.   Mr. Gonzalez suffered cerebral malaria, dengue, beriberi, shrapnel  wounds, a broken back, a dislocated knee, and broken fingers but he  survived the years of captivity. After he returned home, he was awarded  a Silver Star for valor in combat and two Purple Hearts for his  injuries.   I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Gonzalez during filming of a local  Public Broadcasting Corporation documentary honoring the 70th  anniversary of the Bataan fall. He was a gentle, soft-spoken man who  was humble about the bravery and fortitude he exhibited during those  harsh years.   After the war, Mr. Gonzalez moved to Albuquerque, began a family, and  worked at what was then called Sandia Base, which later merged with  Kirtland Air Force Base. After, he worked for the Department of Defense  as an inventory specialist for nuclear weapons and as a financial  officer for different branches of the military, retiring in the 1980s.  After retirement, he stayed involved with veterans' organizations and  served as local commander of a chapter of former prisoners of war.   Mr. Gonzalez is preceded in death by his wife and is survived by two  sons and their spouses.   Mr. Gonzalez is part of American and New Mexico history. He fought  for his country and, through bravery, determination, and grit, survived  the brutality of the Bataan Death March and captivity. I honor all that  Pedro Gonzalez achieved and experienced to preserve international peace  and stability.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to honor David Earl Patterson, Sr.,  a man who gave selflessly to his family, the Navajo Nation, and his  country.   Mr. Patterson was born November 11, 1922. He was Tachil'nii--Red  Running Into the Water People Clan, born for Kinlichii'nii--the Red  House People Clan. He attended Catholic school in Shiprock NM, and  remained a devout Catholic his entire life.   Mr. Patterson entered the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943 and was one of  about 400 Navajo code talkers trained on radio communications. He  served in the Marshall Islands, the islets of Roi and Namur, the  Kwajalein Atoll, Saipan, and Iwo Jima. Navajo code talkers played a  critical role in the Battle of Iwo Jima. During the first 2 days of the  battle, the marines had six Navajo code talkers who worked around the  clock during the first 2 days of the battle. They sent and received  over 800 messages, all without error. Their marine commander said  later, ``Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have  taken Iwo Jima.'' Mr. Patterson received an honorable discharge in  1945.   Mr. Patterson was humble about his wartime contribution to our Nation  and did not talk much about his World War II experience. The United  States honored him and his fellow Navajo code talkers with the  Congressional Silver Medal of Honor in 2001.   After the war, Mr. Patterson married Marion Patterson, and they  raised seven children. He was a beloved husband, father, and  grandfather.   He attended college in Oklahoma and New Mexico and became a social  worker for the Navajo Nation until his retirement in 1987, working  decades for the welfare of his people. Even after retirement, he served  until 2012 as a foster parent in the Shiprock schools until 2012.   Mr. Patterson was a passionate bowler, a baseball aficionado, and a  bingo player. Bowling at every New Mexico bowling center was on his  bucket list, and he found time to coach Little League Baseball and  Softball in Shiprock.   Mr. Patterson lived a full and generous life until his passing on  October 8, 2017 at age 94. He was one of the last surviving Navajo code  talkers.   I am honored to pay tribute to Mr. Patterson, a family man and a hero  who never stopped giving to his community and people.  [[Page S5128]]                                ____________________
