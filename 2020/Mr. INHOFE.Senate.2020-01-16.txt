 Mr. President, as chairman of the Armed Services  Committee, my top priority is ensuring the effective implementation of  the National Defense Strategy. I rise today to speak about the  importance of Africa as a key front in our global efforts under the NDS  to compete with China and Russia, defend U.S. national security, and  combat radical terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS. The NDS says  competition with China and Russia is ``the central challenge to U.S.  prosperity and security.'' This is where DOD is rightly focusing its  attention. But China's and Russia's growing influence isn't restricted  to Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Recent actions by China and Russia  clearly demonstrate that both countries view Africa as a critical  battlefield to fulfill their global ambitions and challenge U.S.  interests.   Over the past 20 years, I have conducted 164 African country visits.  I can tell you it is no coincidence that China established its first  overseas military base in Djibouti--strategically located on one of the  most important maritime transit routes in the world. I visited Djibouti  last February and saw first-hand China's military base and their  encroachment on the Port of Djibouti. Elsewhere, China is using cash  and debt to trap countries and force them to put their infrastructure  and potentially their very sovereignty on sale. For example, 90 percent  of African exports depend on ports and China is funding, building, or  operating at least 46 port projects in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition  to giving China a potential stranglehold on African prosperity, it also  provides China access to critical maritime routes and chokepoints.   At the same time, Russia is using its armed forces, mercenaries, and  the sale of Russian arms to buy influence, exploit Africa's natural  resources, and to prop up leaders sympathetic to Russian interests and  hostile to those of the West. And while the NDS states that competition  with China and Russia should be DOD's top priority, it makes clear that  we cannot afford to lose sight of the continuing threat posed by  radical terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS.   Africa has been and must remain a key theater for our  counterterrorism efforts. Today, more than a dozen terrorist groups  with ties to al-Qaida and ISIS, like Al-Shabab, are operating across  the continent. Many of these groups have ambition to attack Americans  and our partners, as we saw last week when Al-Shabab militants in Kenya  killed a U.S. servicemember and two DOD contractors. Without pressure  the threat these groups pose to the United States will grow unchecked.  And this isn't a recent development--I have seen this come up time and  time again on my visits to the continent. It is why I pushed the DOD  for years to stand up an Africa command. People forget that we didn't  always have a dedicated military presence in Africa, despite its  strategic importance. It was managed through three separate combatant  commands. I worked with DOD and then-President Bush to change that, and  in 2008 we officially stood up United States Africa Command AFRICOM.   Despite the breadth of security challenges we face on the African  continent every day, AFRICOM has consistently suffered resource  shortfalls. On any given day, there are about 7,000 DOD personnel  serving in Africa. Africa is home to 1.3 billion people and is larger  geographically than China, India, the United States, and most of  Europe--combined. In light of these significant resource and  geographical challenges, the men and women of AFRICOM perform critical  missions every day to check Chinese and Russian influence, combat  terrorism, and strengthen the capabilities of our partners. AFRICOM  provides an enormous value to the Nation for an extremely modest level  of investment--the very definition of ``economy of force.'' Despite  this, I understand that DOD is reviewing our military presence in  Africa and is considering significant cuts.   Given what is at stake for both U.S. national security and effective  implementation of NDS, we must have a meaningful, albeit limited, U.S.  presence in Africa. Any drawdown of our troops would be shortsighted,  could cripple AFRICOM's ability to execute its mission and, as a  result, would harm national security. Rather than talking about drawing  down troops in Africa, we should finally assign forces to AFRICOM on an  enduring basis--including an SFAB--in order to provide the command with  predictable resourcing so it can be most effective in defending U.S.  national security.   I urge the Secretary of Defense to keep this in mind as he makes  decisions on the future of our presence and role in Africa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed  Services I report favorably the following nomination lists which were  printed in the RECORDS on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous  consent, to save the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar  that these nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information  of Senators.
