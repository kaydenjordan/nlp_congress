 Madam Speaker, I rise today to put a human face on the  detrimental impact this government shutdown has on real people, many  who are our most vulnerable, especially our children who deserve for us  to lead with compassion.   Our families depend on the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, HUD. Right now, Madam Speaker, landlords are being asked  to spare families from eviction because HUD funding expired and they  are desperately trying to find reserve funds to help our residents.  This is not right.   In Wayne County, Michigan, there are low-income families, elderly and  disabled residents, and over 450 housing units whose contracts have  expired with another 150 expiring this month. Make no question, they  cannot fly to Mar-a-Lago to stay warm in the middle of winter.   The shutdown has caused HUD to halt health and safety inspections,  putting our most vulnerable citizens yet again in harm's way. These  folks will suffer due to Trump's shutdown.   Madam Speaker, the President gets to sleep soundly while he plays  political and partisan games and the lives of Americans are put in  harm's way. I uplift my neighbors and ask that they know that people  here do care about them.                            ____________________
