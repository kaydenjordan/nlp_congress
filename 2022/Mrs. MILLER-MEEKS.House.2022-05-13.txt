 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Charter School Week.   National Charter School Week is a time to recognize that every  student  [[Page H4924]]  should have access to high-quality education. It is also a time to  celebrate the educators who work tirelessly to make sure that that  happens.   Every family should have the ability to choose the best education  that fits the needs of their child, regardless of ZIP Code. Charter  schools are an important part of school choice.   Last year, I joined Senator Tim Scott to introduce the CHOICE Act.  This commonsense bill would provide families with greater options with  regard to their children's education.   When I left home to go to college at the age of 16, I did so to  pursue the best educational opportunities available. I believe that  students should always have the opportunity to succeed, no matter where  they live, and I will always fight for them.   I would also like to take a moment to wish a happy birthday to my  sister.   Happy birthday, Mariette.                            ____________________
