 Mr. President, today many of us will join with  Maryland students and other students throughout this region to demand  that this Senate and the House of Representatives take commonsense  action to reduce gun violence in America--gun violence that has  resulted in massacres at concerts, slaughters in churches, and, of  course, mass deaths at schools throughout the country, and the death  toll we see in the streets of America every day.   I am going to read the names of 17 Maryland young people, people  under age 20, who have died just in the last year as a result of gun  violence in Maryland.   Andre Galloway, 16 years old; Lavander Edwards, 16 years old;  Dashanae Woodson, 17; Shaquan Trusty, 16; Thomas Johnson, 16; Anthony  Cheeks, 17; Tyrese Davis, 15; Jeffrey Quick, 15; Xavier Cole Young, 14;  Kymici Brown, 17; Larry Aaron, 19; Terry Joseph Bosley, 17; Iyanni  Nachae Watkins, 13; Shadi Adi Najjar, 17; Artem Ziberov, 18; Dustin  Khoury, 17; and Laila Goodwin, 4 years old. That is not the entire list  of people under age 20 who were shot and killed in Maryland. In the  State of Maryland, in 2017, 481 souls were lost to homicide, and in  2016, 436 Marylanders were lost to homicide, in all cases by gun  violence.   The time to act has long passed, but for goodness' sake, let's join  with the students and Americans crying out throughout this country to  say enough is enough and enact commonsense gun safety legislation.
