 Mr. President, the fact that the United States is  debating and voting on this bill attacking women's healthcare right now  is an absolute disgrace.   We are 27 days into President Trump's completely unnecessary  government shutdown. Workers are not being paid. Families are huddled  around their tables, wondering which bills to pay and which expenses to  cut. Our national security is being impacted. Our parks are filling up  with trash. Our economy is losing billions of dollars. The list goes  on. It needs to end.   I urge my colleagues, vote no against this bill today that would  erode women's healthcare and take away our constitutionally protected  rights. Demand that Republican leaders let us vote to open the  government, and then let's get back to work getting our country back on  track.   I yield the floor.
