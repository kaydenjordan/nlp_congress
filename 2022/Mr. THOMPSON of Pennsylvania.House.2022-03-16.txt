 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate National Small Business Development Center Day. SBDC Day  unites nearly 1,000 Small Business Development Centers across the  country and the hundreds of thousands of clients they serve.   Pennsylvania is lucky to have 16 SBDCs across our Commonwealth, and  they are ready to assist entrepreneurs and small business owners with  the knowledge and tools needed to make smart decisions and prosper.   The Pennsylvania SBDCs are a public-private partnership with the U.S.  Small Business Administration, the Pennsylvania Department of Community  and Economic Development, and 16 universities and colleges.   Small Business Development Centers are there to provide resources for  entrepreneurs of all ages and backgrounds, from underserved communities  to veterans.   Madam Speaker, I grew up working for my family's small sporting goods  business. I know firsthand the drive, dedication, and determination it  takes to succeed.   If you are a small business owner, entrepreneur, or are looking to  get started, be sure to check out a Small Business Development Center  near you.                            ____________________
