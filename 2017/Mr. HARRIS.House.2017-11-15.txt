 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise President Trump and  my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate for coming together to  develop the first major tax reform plan that our Nation has seen since  1986.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we are considering is going to deliver real  tax relief to middle class families and small businesses.   However, there is more work to be done. Here in the U.S., we don't  settle for good enough. Congress can make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  even better for the American people by including a repeal of  ObamaCare's individual mandate.   No American should ever be forced to purchase something that they  don't want. That is not freedom. That is not the American way. For 3  years now, Federal Government bureaucrats have forced Americans to  purchase insurance they can't afford and don't want.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to repeal ObamaCare's individual  forced mandate.                            ____________________
