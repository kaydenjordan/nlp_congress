 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4367, and that I may include  tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I begin by thanking the chairwoman of the full committee,  Ms. Granger, for her leadership and her tireless efforts to bring these  appropriation bills to the floor.   I also thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, my good friend,  Mr. Cuellar, who has worked with us in good faith on the bill despite  some disagreements on policy.   Lastly, I have enjoyed my time sitting next to the ranking member of  the full committee, the gentlewoman from Connecticut, not once, but  twice in the last few days.   The bill before us today provides $62.8 billion for the Department of  Homeland Security, an increase of $2.1 billion above the fiscal year  2023 level.   In addition, the bill also includes $20.3 billion for disaster  response and recovery activities, including to support communities  after the devastating wildfires in Maui and Hurricane Idalia.   One of the most pressing challenges this country faces is a border  security crisis that has raged under the Biden administration. Two  million migrants illegally crossed the border in each of  [[Page H4629]]  the last 2 years, and we are on track for that same amount this year.  Just yesterday alone, there were 11,000 migrant encounters. Let me  repeat that--nearly 11,000 migrant encounters in 1 day.   Regardless of your definition of border security, it is clear that  the policies of this administration are not working. The reason is  obvious. The White House is sending a message to cartels and migrants  that the border is open, and there will be no consequences if you cross  illegally.   This bill forces the Biden administration to do what it has not and  will not do on its own--act to address the border security crisis. The  funding and policy provisions included in this bill are in lockstep  with the provisions of H.R. 2, which together will put us on a path to  securing the border.   Unlike recent Homeland Security appropriations bills and the  President's request, this bill returns to a tried-and-true border  security approach by investing in methods to both secure the border and  deter those who have no legitimate basis for entry.   This bill includes $2.1 billion for physical barriers with explicit  conditions that the funds be put on contract quickly. The chief of the  Border Patrol and other border security professionals have confirmed  time and time again that walls work.   The bill also provides nearly $500 million to hire more Border Patrol  agents to reach an end strength of 22,000 agents. The bill increases  funding levels for border security technology, so our agents and  officers have the latest, most effective equipment to detect and deter  illegal activity.   Stopping fentanyl and other narcotics that have been ravaging our  communities is a priority for all of us, so this bill provides $305  million for nonintrusive inspection equipment at our Nation's ports of  entry. Detention is a deterrent to those who seek to abuse our  immigration system and falsely claim asylum.   As a result, the bill provides funding for 41,500 detention beds,  which is 16,500 more than this administration requested, to ensure that  ICE has adequate capacity to detain those with final removal orders or  who pose a risk to public safety, as well as migrants who illegally  cross our borders.   To counter the growing strength of Chinese influence in the Indo- Pacific, the bill provides an additional $335 million to the Coast  Guard for fast-response cutters. Also, to increase our presence in the  Arctic, the bill provides funds for the Coast Guard to acquire a  commercially available icebreaker to extend U.S. sovereignty and  counter China and Russian expansion into the polar regions.   Simply put, the bill before us today ensures that the men and women  of the Department of Homeland Security, who work tirelessly on our  behalf, have the resources and the tools that they need to protect this  great Nation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), a distinguished member of our Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thought we were here to talk about  the Homeland Security appropriations bill, and I look forward to having  further discussion and reviewing these amendments.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 723, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, this bipartisan en bloc amendment  before you is comprised of 23 amendments offered by my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle.   This en bloc contains proposals that would strengthen the underlying  bill, and I want to highlight just a few.   The en bloc will provide additional funding to bolster investigations  for exploited children with Secret Service and Homeland Security  Investigations.  [[Page H4645]]    It will increase the nonintrusive inspection equipment at CBP ports  of entry to improve detection of fentanyl and other opioids that plague  communities across our country.   It would also increase funding for FEMA grant programs, for  firefighters and other first responders, and for physical security for  nonprofit organizations at risk of terrorist attack.   Lastly, I want to highlight a proposal that would strengthen our  National Urban Search and Rescue Response System.   I was on the ground in Maui last month and learned firsthand the  critical role these teams play in saving lives and protecting  communities in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.   The base bill includes a modest increase for this program, but I  strongly support the proposal to further increase funds for this force- multiplying Federal asset.   Again, I thank my colleagues for their participation in this process,  and I urge Members to support this bipartisan en bloc.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Chair, I believe we are on the bipartisan en  bloc amendment.   To that point, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner) for an encore performance on another amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  DesJarlais) having assumed the chair, Mr. Murphy, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4367),  making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the amendment offered by the gentleman  from California is well-meaning, but ultimately misguided. We are  averaging nearly 10,000 encounters at the southern border on a daily  basis, near record levels. My bill addresses the challenge by funding  an additional 1,800 Border Patrol agents to relieve the burden on our  overworked agents along the southwest border.   Taking funds dedicated to the Border Patrol agents and instead using  them to hire additional customs officers dilutes our efforts to secure  the border between the ports of entry. Additional officers may be  needed to help with legitimate trade and travel that crosses the  border, but we have to address the immediate crisis caused by this  administration's disastrous border security policies.   If you turn on the television, you can see the flood of migrants  heading north on trains, crossing the border in an uncontrolled  fashion. It must stop, which is why we desperately need additional men  and women in green uniforms to help us gain operational control of the  border. I reluctantly urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to strike several  provisions that are crucial to ending the open border crisis that this  administration has created.   While I have heard it just portrayed as somehow being cruel and being  done by names that are called MAGA or other things, if I am not  mistaken, it was just this morning on the news that I happened to see  the mayor, I believe a Democrat, from New York saying they can't take  any more; the Governor of New York, a Democrat, saying they can't take  any more; the Governor of Massachusetts declaring a state of emergency;  the Democratic mayor of Chicago, same issue.   I guess it is our problem, and we are attempting to fix it. The Biden  administration continues to subvert the law and implement policies that  are detrimental to our border security, our national security, and our  overall sovereignty.   This bill includes several provisions to mitigate the misguided and  ineffective policies of the Biden administration that have been  exploited by transnational criminal organizations, human smugglers, and  cartels.   For example, the bill prohibits funds to implement the  administration's prosecutorial discretion guidance, which encourages  DHS attorneys to administratively close nonpriority cases, allowing  aliens to continue living in this country without having any legal  basis to do so.   Additionally, this bill includes a provision prohibiting asylum  officers from making determinations about an alien's credible fear  claims instead of actual immigration judges.   These are only two of the main provisions in the bill that seek to  reverse the damage done in the past 2\1/2\ years and halt the migration  crisis in its tracks.   To strike these provisions would be to tell our constituents that  Congress approves of this administration's catastrophe at the border.  Nothing could be further from the truth.   While they may not admit it, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle know that what is happening at the border right now is nothing  short of a catastrophe.   Mayors and Governors throughout this country alike are speaking out  on the impact of the illegal migration crisis on communities across the  Nation and are calling on this administration to acknowledge and  resolve the problem at the border. This amendment would only make the  disaster worse.   Mr. Chair, I urge defeat of the amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the amendment before you seeks to  strike a provision in the bill that requires the prioritization of  detention and appropriate GPS monitoring technology for aliens going  through immigration proceedings.   As we continue to see record levels of migrant encounters under this  administration, and our nondetained docket continues to grow  exponentially, we must use every available tool to compel the  Department to enforce the law.   Striking the provision will give the Biden administration a free pass  to continue releasing migrants into the country, a total disregard of  the law. We cannot allow the administration to continue the status quo  that has ravaged our communities.   Mr. Chair, I urge defeat of the amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate my distinguished  colleague and am always there to work together in a bipartisan fashion  to try to fashion something.   She is right. It is long overdue for Congress to address this  situation, but unfortunately, this is about appropriations and not  authorizations.   Therefore, Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, we set out to make precise and  calculated cuts in this bill due to CISA's rapid growth over the last  few years. The top line serves effectively as a strategic pause and  significant budget growth. It is $19 million above the fiscal 2023  enacted level, but $130 million below the President's requests.   This provides CISA the opportunity to mature its operations  commensurate with its historic budget growth. This amendment would cut  CISA's operation and support budget by 25 percent on top of what we  have already done.   We had a debate on a cut of this magnitude during full committee  consideration, and I said then, as I do again now, passing this  amendment would make our homeland less secure. This mis-, dis-, and  mal-information language is strong, and I want to commend the gentleman  from Georgia for his valuable edits to those provisions during markup,  which we made sure we addressed in a more holistic way.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it is with the utmost respect I speak  to my colleague. We have had lengthy debates about this in full  committee. I understand and appreciate the desire that he has to defund  or at least severely reduce the budget of this agency.   However, we are at a time in America where it serves as a  clearinghouse for those rogue nations and bad actors that prey upon  Americans on a daily basis. This is something that is not only  important for everybody who works in the cyber communities and cyber  systems, but also for the schools, hospitals, water and sewage  facilities, the gas pipeline, and all those things throughout our  country that don't have a safety net. They have to rely on CISA for  their information in the hope and support because unfortunately the  companies that provide the software do nothing when they are hacked by  these outside influences and actors.   All this agency could do and hope to do is promote that  clearinghouse, if you will, that platform for which we can all come to  an understanding. Bad actors exist and we must prevent it.   I understand and appreciate and will work closely with my colleague  to make sure the things he talks about as far as the attacks on First  Amendment rights never occur in any agency of the United States.   Mr. Chair, at this time I must urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I understand and join in the outrage  shared by my colleagues over the CISA mis-, dis-, and malinformation  scandal.   No administration and no government should ever be in the business of  labeling or attempting to convince social media companies that First  Amendment-protected speech is or is not disinformation.   The government is not the arbiter of the truth, a position that even  the ACLU agrees with. That is why we worked diligently to address  government censorship concerns in this bill, and I stand by our  language.   However, this amendment is not targeted at the policies of the Biden  administration that we disagree with. It is targeted at a person who  wasn't in office when CISA engaged in mis-,  dis-, and malinformation activities. While we might not agree with her  policies, the CISA Director has a history of dutiful service to this  country, including a long career in the military.   Director Easterly is a West Point graduate, two-time recipient of the  Bronze Star, retiring from the Army after more than 20 years in  intelligence and cyber operations.   While I empathize with the sponsor on the sentiment behind this  amendment, I cannot support it, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the ranking member.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I disagree. I understand  and appreciate the concerns of my colleague and certainly feel that,  again, they have been addressed in what we could do within the confines  of an appropriations bill. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I empathize with wanting to hold this  administration accountable for its many failed border and immigration  policies. I also join in the outrage shared by my colleagues over the  CISA mis-, dis-, and malinformation scandal.   Labelling Americans' First Amendment-protected speech as mis-, dis-,  or malinformation is not a role for any government agency, whether  there is a Democrat or Republican in the White House. However, this  amendment targets a career civil servant who was not in charge of  creating the policy on which we disagree.   We worked diligently in our bill to address the security failures and  censorship concerns associated with this administration. I stand by our  language.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the ranking member.    Mr. Chair, I don't want to make any arguments  other than to say that I urge a ``no'' vote on this, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, Texans have every right to defend and  secure their borders, particularly during a time when the White House  has abandoned attempts to secure the border and enforce our immigration  laws.   Due to the Biden administration's failed policy, States along the  border, including Texas, are seeing their resources being severely  depleted. They are overrun. Therefore, Governor Abbott did what most  responsible, reasonable public servants would do and launched Operation  Lone Star. The goal of Operation Lone Star is to stop cartels and  criminals from smuggling deadly drugs, weapons, and people into Texas.   As of last week, the multiagency effort resulted in 457,500  apprehensions and more than 34,400 criminal arrests, with more than  31,300 felonies reported. In the fight against fentanyl, Texas law  enforcement has seized over 429 million lethal doses of fentanyl.   Due to the rapid and dangerous migrant street releases in Texas, the  Governor has recently had to deploy additional buses to Eagle Pass and  El Paso to assist those border communities overwhelmed by the influx of  migrants. This is a constantly compounding issue that gets forgotten in  the beltway because it is out of sight and out of mind.   This administration is putting politics over people, and it has  completely abandoned these areas along our southwest border. If this  was happening in my backyard, I would want my State to step up, too. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), my friend.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the  request for a recorded vote on amendment No. 24 be vacated to the end  that the amendment be withdrawn.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I appreciate my colleague's concern  about the rampant Federal spending by the Democrats and this  administration. However, this amendment is not the way to address the  larger problem we face.   This bill makes targeted cuts to wasteful spending, eliminates  funding for woke programs, and prohibits funding for policies and  programs that encourage illegal immigration. In contrast, this  amendment would indiscriminately cut the top-line spending of the  Department of Homeland Security by $8.7 billion, which is a 14 percent  reduction to the discretionary funding in this bill.   These cuts would not be targeted to specific programs or activities.  Instead, it would be left to the Biden administration to decide how and  where to apply these reductions. Unfortunately, this administration  would likely align such reductions into its proposals in the  President's budget request.   The first cut the administration will make is to eliminate the $2.1  billion for the border wall, followed by the 16,500 additional  detention beds that were funded in this bill.   Funding for Border Patrol staffing would be slashed, as would funding  for additional ICE deportation officers.   All the critical border security investments and immigration  priorities we have included in this bill will be stripped out in favor  of continuing the status quo.   Let's ensure that this bill we pass on the floor does what the Biden  administration has failed to do--act to address the border security  crisis, which has been raging for the last 2\1/2\ years.   Let's remember that true border security comes with a price tag, and  I think we should all be willing to pay.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the concerns of the  gentleman from Montana, but I maintain that I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Tiffany) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Miller-Meeks, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  4367) making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. today.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 49 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until today,  Thursday, September 28, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
