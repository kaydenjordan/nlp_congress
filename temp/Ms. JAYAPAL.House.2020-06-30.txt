 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for yielding and  for this transformational bill that has been put forward, a deeply  necessary investment in our country's infrastructure.   My amendment would ensure that our Nation has a well-equipped  workforce to build climate resilient infrastructure projects. And it  does this by adding a critical requirement to study labor, workforce,  and equity considerations.   Climate change is compelling us to boldly innovate, and workers will  need training to acquire new skills to implement emerging technologies  that keep us and our communities safe. As this is unchartered  territory, we will need to study how to best support our workers so  they are prepared to meet that challenge head on.   We also need to make sure that Federal investment improves, not  worsens existing inequities in our economy. Let's fully identify  effective strategies to guarantee that jobs are first available to  populations that face the greatest barriers to employment and are most  vulnerable to the very risks of climate change that we must address.   Finally, Mr. Chairman, I have one of those bridges in my district,  and we desperately need help. We need revenue to rebuild our Nation's  infrastructure. I have a major bridge in my district that was abruptly  shuttered.    Mr. Speaker, I have a major bridge in my district that  connects west Seattle to downtown, and it was abruptly shuttered after  growing cracks were discovered in a routine inspection. Repairs and  possible replacement will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and the  people that live in that part of my district--very populated--have no  way to get out of that, except for one little place on the south end of  that area.   So we desperately need to find these issues before they come up, and  we need to invest.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, my amendment would set aside an additional  $9 million for airplane noise mitigation and other projects to support  aviation-impacted communities.   In my district, the rapid growth of Sea-Tac Airport to meet demand  has impacted the day-to-day life of many of my constituents who live  nearby. In large part, that has been due to increased noise.   While we cannot stop rising demand, we can protect our communities  with additional funds for noise insulation and by studying  environmentally sound ways to reduce aviation impacts.   The FAA has not taken this issue seriously enough, failing to respond  to my constituents' concerns in community meetings and refusing to  release congressionally mandated studies on reducing airport noise.  That is why my amendment would compel the FAA to devote more resources  to aviation-impacted communities across the Nation.
