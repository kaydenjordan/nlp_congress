 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  Peter E. Luitwieler, an American hero and a true friend to our  country's veterans.   Mr. Luitwieler served in military intelligence during the Vietnam  war, and in January of 1968, when his compound was surrounded by enemy  troops and the machine gunners abandoned their posts, Mr. Luitwieler  and a brave marine manned the machine guns for hours, keeping the  enemies at bay and protecting the lives of their team. For this act of  bravery, he was awarded the Vietnamese equivalent of the Bronze Star.   After he retired, Mr. Luitwieler dedicated his time to fellow  veterans. He now serves as a program manager for Warrior Partnerships  of Eastern Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Veterans Connections, and he is a  mentor to veterans going through the Tulsa Veterans Treatment Court,  going above and beyond to enrich the lives of Oklahoma's veterans.   Mr. Luitwieler is an incredible example of the great men and women  who have served our country every day. He is the First District's March  2019 Veteran of the Month, and I am honored to recognize him with this  award.                            ____________________
