 Madam Chair, as Co-chair of the Congressional  Cannabis Caucus, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment  No. 36, to the Fiscal Year 2024 Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies bill. This amendment would help veterans  participate in a legal state medical cannabis program, ensure services  are not denied, or limit health care providers' ability to make  appropriate recommendations of this treatment option for veterans.   Currently, VA physicians aren't allowed to complete medical forms  relating to their patients' cannabis usage nor can they assist their  patients in enrolling in medical cannabis programs.   This amendment would authorize VA physicians and other health care  providers to provide recommendations and opinions regarding  [[Page H4002]]  the use of medical cannabis to veterans who live in states with  existing medical programs.   Millions of American veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress and  depression. Moreover, of the nearly one million veterans who receive  opioids to treat painful conditions, more than half continue to consume  beyond 90 days.   Time after time, data has revealed that the mortality rate from  opiate overdoses among VA patients is nearly double the national  average. In states where patients can legally access medical cannabis  to treat painful conditions, often as a less addictive alternative, the  hands of VA physicians should not be tied.   Cannabis is currently legal in most states and territories for  medicinal or adult use and the VA health system must keep up. I am  proud to co-lead this amendment and want to give a special thanks to my  Cannabis Caucus Co-chairs, Representatives Mast, Blumenauer and Joyce,  for their partnership on enacting comprehensive cannabis reform.   I urge my colleagues to vote and support this bipartisan, common- sense amendment that would benefit our armed service members.
