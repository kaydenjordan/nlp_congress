 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw  attention to an invasive pest that is wreaking havoc on farms and  forests nationwide and is giving Pennsylvania agricultural producers a  major headache. I am talking about the spotted lanternfly. This native  Asian insect has been found in at least 14 different counties in  Pennsylvania and has spread to our neighbors in Maryland and New Jersey  as well.   The spotted lanternfly feeds on sap, leaving all the plants that it  touches weakened. The residue that the spotted lanternflies leave  behind promotes mold growth which destroys many plants and crops. The  spotted lanternfly has a diverse appetite, feeding on more than 70  different kinds of plants. From fruit trees to hardwoods and nursery  industries, so many of the sectors of Pennsylvania's agricultural  industry are subject to these pests.   In Pennsylvania alone, it is estimated $18 billion in agriculture is  at risk. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has issued a  checklist that all residents should consult to check for spotted  lanternfly egg masses. These things include camping equipment,  firewood, outdoor children's toys, like playscapes and sandboxes, and  more. By the end of the year, most adult spotted lanternflies will be  dead. However, residents are encouraged to rid their property of any  egg masses that they find by dowsing them in alcohol.   Thankfully, research is being done to look into the best ways to  combat this pest and eradicate it from the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute  of Food and Agriculture recently awarded the Pennsylvania State  University a $7.3 million grant to support a team of researchers from a  variety of disciplines. It is a good investment if we can save $18  billion worth of agriculture damage.   These funds will be combined with an additional $5 million in  investments from growers and landowners--private citizens who agreed to  work with researchers on this project. Researchers and extension  educators from Penn State will be joined by additional experts from the  USDA Agricultural Research Service, the USDA Animal and Plant Health  Inspection Service, Virginia Tech, University of Delaware, the  Universities of Rhode Island, Temple, Rutgers, Cornell, and the  Northeastern IPM Center.   With continued education and research into this invasive pest, we can  get closer to finding a solution to dealing with the spotted lanternfly  and alleviating Pennsylvania's agricultural producers of this threat.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  October as German-American Heritage Month. I am proud to co-chair the  Congressional German-American Caucus with my good friend and colleague  Congressman Bill Keating. The mission of the caucus focuses on  highlighting German contributions to our country.   This past summer, Congressman Keating and I introduced H. Res. 446, a  bipartisan resolution recognizing the importance of the alliance  between the United States and Germany and to underscore our shared  commitment to democracy. The resolution reaffirms our support of the  Wunderbar Together initiative, which brings together more than 250  partners nationwide for more than 1,000 different events to celebrate  German American contributions to culture, science, arts, business, and  more.   Today, there are more than 50 million Americans of German descent  living in the United States. Our relationship is one of common values,  shared interest, and rich history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join Congressman Keating and I  in supporting H. Res. 446 and celebrating our longstanding relationship  with Germany as friends and allies.                            ____________________
