 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 110th  anniversary of the Alamo Iron Works strike in San Antonio, Texas. Back  then, those organizers were fighting for better wages and working  conditions, like workers are today. They started a tradition of labor  strikes in the summer in the city of San Antonio.   Mr. Speaker, 20 years later in 1933, the Finck Cigar strike began  when 400 young Mexican-American women went on strike for better working  conditions and won.   In 1936, garment workers at the Dorothy Frocks Company in San Antonio  began striking for higher wages. They went to jail that August of 1936,  and still won.   The next summer, in 1937, 80 workers at the San Antonio Laundry  Company walked off the job. They demanded a 9-hour workday instead of  14 hours and won.   Remember, when rightwing extremists pass antiworker bills, they are  arguing that their bills are trying to take us to the good old days of  Texas past. We know the truth: The history of San Antonio and the  history of Texas is a history or workers organizing and winning.                            ____________________
