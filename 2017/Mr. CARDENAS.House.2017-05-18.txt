 Mr. Speaker, I am privileged and honored to be a Member  of this House, and it is very frustrating for us to come here week  after week and to not do the business of the people of the United  States of America. One of those impediments is that we have a President  of the United States who is trying to force and push this Congress, and  many others in his administration, to do things that are not right for  the people and this country.   I think it is important for us to understand that when and if you get  an opportunity to read the legislation called TrumpCare, you will  realize that really what it is about is Trump doesn't care about your  healthcare. Please, just read it. I apologize for talking about the 24  million-plus Americans who will lose their healthcare if this bill were  to become law. I apologize because I need to remind each individual  that they will likely lose the ability to see a doctor if this bill  becomes law. Please, please, help us. Please, focus on what is going on  here in Washington and what is not going on here in Washington for  everyone's sake.                            ____________________
