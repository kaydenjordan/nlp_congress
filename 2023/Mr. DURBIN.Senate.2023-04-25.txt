 Mr. President, I have two statements for the Record that  I want to enter into the Record, but I would like to say my debt of  gratitude to the Senator from Massachusetts.   Members of the Senate go to parades and salute the military, and we  give speeches on the floor about how much we appreciate them and their  sacrifice. This is an illustration of the Senate at its worst. We  should be standing behind these men and women who have given their  lives to our country, who will risk their lives for our country, some  earning Bronze Stars, Purple Hearts for doing it.   Listen, I want to tell you, if we are respecting these men and women,  we should give them the promotions they have worked their whole lives  to achieve and, in so doing, keep our military the strongest in the  world. I respect these men and women, and I think what is happening on  the floor of the Senate is not only dangerous but it is insulting. That  is the only word that can be used for one Senator to hold up 184 men  and women and their promotions in the military. I never thought I would  see that day in the U.S. Senate.   Whatever the reason, it is time to bring the charade to an end. We  can debate the policy in the committee and on the floor, wherever we  wish; but when it comes to these individuals, do not hold these men and  women in the military hostage to the political debate on the floor of  the U.S. Senate.   I commend the Senator from Massachusetts for raising these issues.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, if you thought the dangerous theatrics of  the Trump years were behind us, I have some bad news. This week,  Speaker McCarthy plans to gamble with the paychecks of millions of  families, as well as the stability of our Nation's economy.   Instead of accepting one of the most basic duties of government-- avoid default--Speaker McCarthy is choosing high stakes risk. He is  threatening to default on America's debt for the first time in history  unless Democrats agree to slash funding for working families, veterans,  law enforcement, and small businesses across the country.   Now it goes without saying: This proposal is going nowhere in the  Senate. And Kevin McCarthy knows that. So the fact that he is still  moving forward with it shows that he does not know the damage he could  inflict on the American people. He is willing to hold our entire  economy--and the fate of millions of Americans--hostage because, as  long as he keeps the most radical fringes of his party happy, Kevin  McCarthy has nothing to worry about. But for everyone else, a Federal  debt default would be disastrous.   It would wipe out trillions of dollars in household savings; it would  lead to millions of Americans losing their jobs and businesses grinding  to a halt; and it would crater our economy, likely throwing us into a  recession.   Now all this chaos and destruction could be avoided today, if we  wanted. Congress could pass a clean bill to pay our debts on time and  uphold the full faith and credit of the United States. But of course,  with the MAGA majority in the House, it is never that simple. Instead  of sitting down with lawmakers across the aisle to find a sensible path  forward, Speaker McCarthy is manufacturing a crisis. And really, he is  giving the American people two unacceptable options: Either suffer the  consequences of a disastrous debt default, or face devastating cuts to  the services and programs millions of people rely on every day.   Just look at the proposal House Republicans will vote on this week.  It is nothing more than a MAGA wish list that leaves every American  behind, except the top 1 percent. To start, Speaker McCarthy's proposal  would decimate funding for our Nation's veterans. It would cut hundreds  of millions of dollars for expanding veteran's care, right after we  just passed the PACT Act. And it would threaten housing and food  security for our Nation's heroes.   And they are not alone because Speaker McCarthy's proposal would also  gut funding for police officers and first responders. It would wipe out  nearly 30,000 law enforcement jobs within the Justice Department alone.  And it would require the government to furlough every single Border  Patrol agent.   Can you imagine that? For years, Republicans have been saying  Democrats want to defund the police and open our borders. And yet, here  they are, supporting a proposal to abandon law enforcement and weaken  border security.   Additionally, Speaker McCarthy's proposal would ship thousands of  manufacturing jobs overseas, to countries like China. And perhaps worst  of all, it would punish working families who are already struggling to  get by. This Republican proposal would jeopardize healthcare coverage  for 10 million Americans. And it could eliminate food assistance for  more than 1 million families--including children--who are at risk of  going hungry.   Now, this MAGA wish list is not bad news for everyone. In fact, there  is one group of people in particular who would benefit from it. Can you  guess who it is? I will tell you: the ultrawealthy. Speaker McCarthy's  proposal would actually increase our deficit by allowing billionaires  to avoid paying their fair share in taxes.   And it is not like they need any help. Today, there are a thousand  billionaires in America who pay an average tax rate of 8 percent. Think  about that. That is a lower tax rate than most school teachers and  firefighters. Then again, it shouldn't be any surprise that Speaker  McCarthy is siding with billionaires over working families.   After all, where was he just over a week ago? Was he meeting with  working families and small business owners on Main Street who are  worried about keeping their doors open? No. He was on Wall Street,  meeting with wealthy traders and executives of big banks. And he  personally assured them that Republicans will do everything they can to  cut funding for hard-working families trying to make ends meet.   Now, here is the bottom line: We can--and should--have a debate on  America's tax policy and Federal budget priorities. It is a debate  Democrats win because we believe in investing in working families and  ensuring the wealthy pay their fair share. Plain and simple. But now is  not the time nor place for this debate because in the next several  weeks, we have one responsibility: avoiding debt default--and the  economic calamity that would follow. That is our obligation to the  American people. And it is an obligation we have never once failed to  meet in 230 years.   But today, sadly, many Americans are concerned that Speaker McCarthy  is in over his head. Frankly, I share those concerns. He is leading a  caucus that traffics in chaos and brinksmanship. And it is not clear  that he can control the chaos.   So here is our promise, on behalf of congressional Democrats: We are  ready to get to work. Let's avoid a disastrous debt default--as we  always do. And then, let's engage in a fulsome debate on Federal  spending priorities. The sooner we prevent a debt default, the sooner  we can come together in good faith to work on behalf of the American  people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we do a lot to protect our identity and  financial security from scammers and thieves. We guard our PIN numbers  and passwords. We shred bills and financial documents. We are on guard  for phishing attacks and cyber scams.   But there is another, growing threat to our financial safety that  many Americans are unaware of. Across the country, we are seeing a  surge in armed robberies of letter carriers. In many of the attacks,  the robbers steal  [[Page S1338]]  an ``arrow key.'' That is a master key that unlocks the blue collection  boxes you drop your mail into, as well as cluster mailboxes in  subdivisions and other multi-unit mailboxes. With an arrow key, a  robber can open mailboxes and steal whatever is in there, including  packages and prescription medications. And often, they steal checks.  This can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other serious  crimes.   Here is how it works: The robbers use the dark web and messaging apps  to sell the stolen checks. The cyber criminals who buy the stolen  checks then use nail polish remover to wash and rewrite the checks for  any amount they choose. A $15 check to your doctor can become a $15,000  check to someone you have never heard of.   Listen to these figures from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service:  Between 2018 and 2021, robberies of letter carriers more than tripled,  and robberies involving a gun more than quadrupled.   And between March 2020 and February 2021, the Postal Inspection  Service received 299,000 reports of mail theft, a 161-percent increase  in mail thefts in just 1 year. And the problem is getting worse. In  Chicago, at least a dozen postal carriers were robbed at gunpoint  between early March and early April this year. Police say the robbers  were armed with semi-automatic handguns. I have met with letter  carriers in Chicago. They tell me they are fearful about what is  happening. They worry that they could be next. And the looming threat  of armed robbery is making it even harder to fill letter carrier  vacancies.   And this is not just a Chicago problem. Last year in Orlando, FL, two  men were caught on video approaching a letter carrier at a condo  complex. The postal worker was found robbed and beaten with a severe  head injury. In January of this year, a 66-year-old letter carrier was  kidnapped and robbed in Charlotte, NC. The list goes on and includes  nearly every State in the country. These are not simply random attacks.  Police say organized crime groups and gangs appear to be driving the  increase in letter carrier robberies.   We have seen something like this before. In 2011, after a similarly  disturbing trend, I urged the former Postmaster General to implement a  rapid alert system to inform letter carriers of any crimes committed in  their vicinity. The alerts were a warning to letter carriers to be  vigilant, and they helped. But now, the alerts have stopped. Now, I  have serious concerns about many decisions by the current Postmaster  General, but this decision seems especially wrong-headed.   Yesterday, I met in Chicago with members of the National Association  of Letter Carriers' Illinois chapter. I told them that I was sending a  letter to both Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Attorney General  Merrick Garland. I am asking the U.S. Postal Service and the Department  of Justice to work together to prevent robberies of letter carriers-- and punish those who commit the robberies. They also need to crack down  on the cyber thieves who buy and sell checks, arrow keys, and other  property stolen from the Postal Service.   And the Postal Service can act right now to reduce this surge in  robberies by making some simple changes on its own. They should restart  crime alerts to letter carriers. USPS also can reduce the financial  motivation driving many of these robberies by investing in new  technology that would enable two-factor authentication for dropboxes  and cluster mailboxes.   Letter carriers are proud of their long tradition of braving rain,  snow, and sleet to deliver the mail. But they cannot brave this threat  on their own. USPS and DOJ must step up to better protect letter  carriers and the tens of millions of American families and businesses  that depend on the U.S. Postal Service.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
