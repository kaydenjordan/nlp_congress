 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks today with a  few words to specifically urge American seniors and the  immunocompromised to continue to protect themselves against COVID-19 by  ensuring that you are fully vaccinated, including a booster shot and by  wearing a high-quality mask.   As States around the country begin to unwind mask and vaccine  mandates, I implore America's seniors to remain vigilant against this  virus. First, get boosted. The vaccine is the most powerful tool we  have to protect yourself against COVID-19 infection. We know that the  vaccine continues to be highly effective at preventing serious illness  and death from COVID-19, but we also know that thousands of Americans  have died from breakthrough cases of COVID-19, and the vast majority  are over the age of 60.   In Massachusetts alone, 2,200 vaccinated individuals have died of  COVID-19, and more than 93 percent of those deaths were over the age of  60. We are 2 percent of America's population. So you can multiply that  2,000 to get an idea as to what has happened with people who are  ``fully vaccinated'' but who are older and who still contract the  coronavirus.   So we have to just make sure that everyone gets this message  straight. For many Americans, they are going to be told: You don't have  to wear masks. But for many others there has to be a strong message:  You should continue to wear your mask to protect yourself.   And although I have called upon the CDC to track and share this data  about the deaths over the age of 60, they just haven't done so. So if  we extrapolate the Massachusetts number, there may very well have been  already over 100,000 Americans--overwhelmingly, seniors--who have died,  despite the fact that they have received two shots of the vaccine. So  let's just make sure that we deliver that message correctly. Keep your  mask on.   This is a very good mask. There are KF94s. We have a very good N95  mask here that is absolutely certified by NIOSH. But many of these  other masks that people are wearing just aren't going to give you the  protection, which you need, so we need a strong message that goes out  to seniors especially but to anyone who is immunocompromised and to  children who have not been vaccinated. When this ``You can take off  your mask'' era begins, let's just understand that there are going to  be very many vulnerable people out there.   So from my perspective, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention has also reported that the unvaccinated seniors were 90  times more likely to die of COVID-19 than those who received the  vaccine booster. But I will say it again: If you haven't already, get  vaccinated and get a booster.   An average of 2,300 people died from COVID nationwide in the past  week per day--overwhelmingly, people over the age of 60--and each death  is a tragedy for their families or their communities. They are our  grandmothers, our grandfathers, our parents, our veterans who fought  for democracy. They are irreplaceable members of our lives, and we have  already lost too many to COVID-19.   But we have a powerful way to help, and that is to wear a mask.  Again, if you put on these masks--here is a KF94--this will give you  most of the protection you need. But please do not take it off because  everyone else is indoors now saying the mask mandate indoors is off-- not if you are in this vulnerable category. It should not be.  Understand that the risk is still there.   Here is the second point. I am urging you to continue to protect  yourself, wear a high-quality mask. The CDC updated in January its  masking guidance to recommend that the general public and especially  seniors and those who are immunocompromised use higher quality masks,  like the N95s, the KF94s, and the KN95s. We are seeing welcome  decreases in rates of new infections right now, but these populations  are still the most vulnerable to COVID. Just because younger people may  be using their masks less, it does not mean that those at higher risk  should stop being vigilant. Continue to use a high-quality mask to  protect yourself when you are indoors and around others.   Getting a high-quality mask should be an easy thing to do, but with  less-than-robust information, sometimes limited supplies, and a lot of  counterfeits abounding, it has been harder than it should be for  consumers to stay educated and protected. That is why I am pleased to  see the Biden administration distribute 400 million nonsurgical N95  masks from the Strategic National Stockpile to the public. The masks  are available at retail pharmacies and community health centers, so go  get one. Ask a friend or a family member to bring one to you.   Make sure you are wearing a protective mask. Understand that surgical  masks give you less protection. A cloth mask gives you much less  protection. Just understand that, especially if you are in a vulnerable  category.   I want to say this over and over again. If you are over 60, you are  in that category, so just protect yourself. That small item can be what  it is that protects you and your family members.   Just make sure the masks we use are the best, the most accessible,  the most affordable, and the most reliable that they can be. It is not  always convenient, but we need to continue to protect ourselves. I urge  those Americans over the age of 60 and those who are immunocompromised  to continue to mask up.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, now I would just like to move on quickly to a  different topic.   As we watch President Putin amass tens of thousands of soldiers on  the border of Ukraine, we must confront the fuel that powers this show  of military might--specifically, fossil fuels.   Our global addiction to oil and natural gas from Russia and from  Saudi Arabia keeps us locked into dangerous cycles of conflict and  corruption, but we have a way out. We can build a pathway to a more  prosperous future, a more peaceful future. We can build cities powered  by cheap, clean electricity, build all-electric vehicles for our roads,  and build homes that are healthier and more energy efficient than ever  before.   By putting 25 million new electric vehicles on our roads, we can stop  all oil imports from Russia and Saudi Arabia into the United States of  America. That is 25 million all-electric vehicles. That is a direct  message to the business model of Russia and of Saudi Arabia. That is  the U.S. Congress passing legislation that propels the all-electric  vehicle revolution here and sets a model for the rest of the country.   But rather than invest in that clean, affordable, healthy future, our  country and the global economy are being held hostage by the American  Petroleum Institute and their Big Oil buddies. Rather than supporting  energy policies that secure our independence and our future, Big Oil  pushes policies that secure their profit margins. At the same time that  we get crocodile tears from Republicans over American fossil fuel  leases, those same leases are feeding the American Petroleum Institute  and not the United States of America.   In 2021, we exported one out of every four barrels of oil we  produced, and we are exporting them abroad because in 2015, the  Republicans voted to end the decades-long oil export ban in the United  States. It was the Republican votes that put company profits over  consumer protections and climate policies. So our energy prices rose at  home while we were left to deal with the  [[Page S762]]  health and climate crisis created in this rush to export and profit. At  the same time, we continued to import Russian and Saudi oil. That is  what we are doing right now--propping up those regimes and supporting  their financial reserves.   The journey to energy independence simply does not run on fossil  fuels. How does it run? It runs on solar; on wind; on battery storage;  on clean, zero-carbon energy; on a clean energy future for our country.  We can reimagine a future that is free from fossil fuel conflict. We  can reimagine a future powered by the light of the Sun, not by oil  controlled by the barrel of a gun. We can tell Russia we don't need  their oil any more than we need their caviar. That is a message we can  send by passing legislation that unleashes this clean energy  revolution. We can reimagine a future where American ingenuity,  manufacturing, and jobs drive our allies forward into a global clean  energy revolution.   This future isn't far off beyond the horizon. It is right in front of  us, and it is already putting Americans to work and keeping lights on  across this country.   In 2010, we had 1 million jobs in solar, wind, and energy efficiency.  By 2020, that more than doubled to more than 2 million jobs. Now we  have all of those millions of workers out there, and we can double it  again and double it again. We can create millions of new clean energy  jobs for millions of Americans across this country.   In 2008, we only had 26,000 megawatts of solar. Today, we have  upwards of 264,000 megawatts of solar and wind capacity combined on our  grid.   The electric vehicle revolution is already on its way. Automakers are  pledging to produce 40 million new electric vehicles just in the United  States. That is 2 million barrels of oil that are out of our system  forever that we don't need. That is the oil from Russia that we import  today. That is the oil we import today from Saudi Arabia. That is what  we have to do in our country. To put that in context, just 10 years  ago, there were only 73,000 electric vehicles sold all year in the  United States.   We can do this. Our opportunity is great. We have a chance to use the  Build Back Better bill to send a message: We are going to save money,  save energy, save industrial communities, save all of us from a world  made unstable through fossil fuel creating crisis after crisis on this  planet.   This is the power of the American-led clean energy revolution.  Looking at the alternative, with troops paid by fossil fuel money on  the border of Ukraine, I know what kind of future I want and I think  the American people want to fight for.   We have to destroy the business model of Russia and Middle Eastern  countries that have been sources of problems for American national  security for more than a generation. That is the opportunity we are all  presented with right now. That is why Build Back Better--that is why  President Biden's vision of wind and solar, all-electric vehicles,  battery-storage technologies, and clean energy technologies by the  millions being deployed in our country, will create millions of new  jobs, reduce greenhouse gases, and improve our national security.   This is the healthcare, the environmental, the national security, and  the moral issue of our time. If we haven't learned another lesson from  Ukraine, it should be that the time is now for us to act so that 10  years from now, the next generation of young Americans can look back  and say we did act, we did destroy that business model.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, I just want to say that I sincerely  respect the Senator from Alaska's concerns about the Russian seafood  imports, and I believe it is unfair. I believe it is improper that  Russia has banned American seafood imports since 2014. So I agree with  you. And Alaska and Massachusetts are the two fishing giants of the  United States of America. We are.   However, I have heard from seafood processors in my home State with  concerns about potential sudden effects of a new immediate ban on  imports on their workforce, including hundreds of union workers in the  seafood processing industry. That would be right now.   So, with that in mind, I am going to object to passage of this bill  at this time, but I would say to my friend from Alaska that I would  invite a collaboration on this subject because I think we can resolve  it so that it benefits not just Alaska, which is very important, but  also Massachusetts and every other State. And, again, I think we can,  in fact, bring all the stakeholders together, do it very briefly maybe  over this break that we are about to begin here in the Senate.   I am very grateful to the Senator from Alaska for raising this very  important issue, and I want to assure him and all of the Alaska fishing  industry that we want to have conversations that protect the American  seafood industry and its workers and I want to partner with him toward  that goal and maybe just use the next 10 days or so to accomplish that  goal. So at this point I would object to the motion.
