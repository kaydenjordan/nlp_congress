 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the coronavirus launched an unprecedented attack on  Americans' health in the best economy our Nation has experienced in  decades. America responded with an unprecedented effort to contain the  virus, led  [[Page H1924]]  by President Trump and the healthcare community. Congress responded by  working with the President to deliver not one, not two, but three  bipartisan measures to combat the health and economic damage of COVID- 19.   The battle continues amidst signs that in some regions we are  flattening the curve and beginning to reopen the economy safely as  health conditions on the ground permit. This fourth bill replenishes  the crucial help for Main Street businesses and local healthcare  providers, while devoting more resources to producing more tests and  distributing them more quickly.   It adds $320 billion in crucial funding to the Paycheck Protection  Program to help keep our local businesses afloat. It boosts funding for  local healthcare providers by another $75 billion. It expands our  States' testing capacities and ensures more resources for our Nation- wide effort to continue locking down this virus. It is targeted. It  will have an immediate impact, and it deserves strong bipartisan  support.   Once President Trump signed the CARES Act into law merely 4 weeks  ago, then moved with historic speed to provide forgivable loans to  small businesses, it soon became clear more dollars are needed to keep  workers on local payrolls.   So far, the Paycheck Protection Program is helping nearly 1.6 million  local businesses, impacting and helping save 30 million jobs for local  construction, retail, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, and  service businesses. Despite media portrayals, the average loan is  around $200,000--that is Main Street--and more often than not, it is  provided by a community bank. These dollars are reaching small  businesses. And when funding ran out, Republicans and President Trump  urged Congress to quickly replenish them.                                time  1145    It is unfortunate that Speaker Pelosi decided to hold up this bill  nearly 16 days while small businesses and their workers desperately  fought to hold on, especially minority-owned businesses in underserved  communities. They suffered, and during this unnecessary delay,  America's jobless numbers climbed to 26 million.   How many jobs could we have saved if partisan politics had not reared  its ugly head?   This emergency funding is just that; it is funding. It doesn't adjust  the design of the Paycheck Protection Program nor does it address the  flawed unemployment design that pays some Americans more than they make  at work. It takes what is working for businesses and healthcare  providers and replenishes it, which is why it has earned the support of  a number of organizations like the American Hospital Association and  the National Federation of Independent Business.   Today's bill makes it possible for families to stay connected to  their work. Local businesses can keep their lights on. And once we get  to the other end of this, we will return to a safe, healthy America for  our seniors, our children, and our grandchildren.   I will conclude with this: The President is right. We can continue to  apply maximum pressure on the coronavirus while reopening our economy  safely and responsibly. Not only can we, we must, if we hope to prevent  hurting working families and the jobless with an unnecessarily extended  economic recession marked by shortages of needed day-to-day supplies  and serious healthcare problems created by long-term unemployment.   This isn't a choice between lives and livelihoods. We must do both.  With the President, State and local leaders, healthcare providers, and  local businesses all working together, I am convinced we can.   How? The way we tackle every adversity our Nation has faced: with  American ingenuity, know-how, and common sense.   Today, we help our small businesses and healthcare heroes. Tomorrow,  Congress and President Trump will continue to work together to identify  practical ways to help businesses create safe, healthy workplaces,  jump-start this economic rebound, and accelerate a return to work for  those who are jobless or furloughed. I urge all my colleagues to  support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I respectfully remember a different history where only one fund was  out of money, those for our small businesses. The President asked for  us to move quickly, and it was blocked in the Senate by those who said  there is no proof small businesses need this money. And I remember the  Speaker herself saying there is no data that shows small businesses  need money. Those critical funds were blocked and held up for 16 days.  This agreement we have today could have been agreed to in 5 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot), the leading Republican on the Small Business Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the lead Republican on the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Granger), the top Republican on the Appropriations  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the Republican leader of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a member of the Small Business Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of this emergency legislation that prioritizes to replenish emergency  relief for all small businesses and hospitals across the Nation.   The Paycheck Protection Program has, without doubt, been instrumental  in helping small businesses in Puerto Rico and America keep their  employees paid through this unprecedented crisis.   Lenders in Puerto Rico approved more than 2,800 of these loans,  disbursing a total of $658 million before the funds ran out. We have  got less than .17 percent of all the Nation's PPP loans, making us  jurisdiction number 52.   I expect this bill now would allow the rest of those small businesses  to get it and to get it now.   The island's economy has been greatly impacted, just like the people  here on the mainland. And now with more than 150,000 employees that are  out of work and the small businesses that are out of business, it is  imperative that we support this bill and immediately provide vital aid  to American businesses across the Nation, which are the lifeblood of  our economy.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Let me fact- check the absurd claim that Congress has left State and local  governments behind.   We fund one-third of State budgets year-to-year. We have already  given $150 billion direct aid to State and local governments. Some  Democrat governors haven't even sent it down to their local  communities.   $260 billion in State unemployment; $100 billion for State and local  hospitals in healthcare; $45 billion for State and local disaster aid;  $30 billion for State and local schools and colleges; $25 billion for  State and local mass transit; and more Medicaid money for our State and  local governments. That claim is simply absurd.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Fulcher).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Neal for his leadership and  close working relationship on these key issues.   Look, this bill is 16 days too late, despite all of the denials you  heard. We could have agreed on this bill in 16 minutes, Republicans and  Democrats, but it got held up for all sorts of extracurricular stuff.  We should have come together. It was delayed. Real people lost their  jobs as a result.   Secondly, I want to thank President Trump, Vice President Pence, the  entire Cabinet, and everyone in the government who has done a  remarkable job standing up the small business program in 7 days, in  sending out individual rebate checks in 18 days rather than 70 months  that it took the last time there were rebate checks. I want to thank  that leadership in this coronavirus crisis, both on the healthcare side  and with the economic challenges we face.   I want to thank Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has done a  remarkable job leading the Republicans in the House through each of  these key emergency aid bills. I want to thank the leadership that  supports him, ranking members who work with our Democratic colleagues  to put together a bill we think is critical and urgent.   There is a guiding quote that I have kept as my computer screen saver  for many years here in my office. It reads: ``I cannot give you the  formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which  is: Try to please everybody.''   This bill doesn't try to please everybody or do everything. It  focuses on replenishing small business loan programs that local  businesses and their workers desperately need. It provides more funding  for our hospitals and healthcare workers who man the front lines of  this pandemic. It commits more of your tax dollars producing and  distributing tests to communities that need them. These are immediate,  urgent priorities right now, and we need to act right now.   I would point out, also, Mr. Speaker, that those who say we are not  committed to State and local communities, this Congress, Republicans  joined Democrats, sending $150 billion down to our State and local  communities.   Unlike some Democratic Governors who are holding their dollars at the  State capitol and refuse to share it with local communities, our  Governor in Texas announced more than a week ago he was developing an  approach to make sure all of our communities on the front line are  getting help. Governors who are withholding that aid to small  communities ought to be ashamed of themselves.   Finally, let's continue, after this work is done today, to work  together with President Trump to apply maximum pressure to the  coronavirus, help businesses create safe, healthy workplaces. Let's  jump-start the economic rebound and accelerate a return to  [[Page H1947]]  work for those who are jobless or furloughed.   I urge strong and bipartisan support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
