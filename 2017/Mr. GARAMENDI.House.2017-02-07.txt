 Mr. Speaker, well, let's see, I got a phone call from  my district--one of several dozen today--and they all are kind of about  the same thing: What is going on in Washington? What are they doing in  Washington? What is happening? What is happening with ObamaCare, the  Affordable Care Act? What are they going to do about this wall? People  are concerned. People want to know what is happening in Washington.   I suspect a good many of us are trying to figure out what the next  steps are. It seems like every other moment something new is erupting  from the White House, another tweet or another executive order, and we  have had a lot of them. And so what I want to do today is to kind of go  back and take a look at what has transpired over these last 2\1/2\  weeks. What has happened in Washington these last 2\1/2\ weeks?   Besides a lot of confusion, angst, and concern, some very, very  important things are happening, and here is my take on it. I am going  to kind of put a title on today, and I am going to say: What has  Washington done to you, not for you. What has Washington done to you?   Let's start with the very first day that President Trump was  inaugurated. Well, it was all about the Affordable Care Act, otherwise  known as ObamaCare. So he set out to begin the repeal of ObamaCare, or  the Affordable Care Act.   Oh, by the way, they are one and the same. It depends which way you  are looking at this thing, but the repeal of the Affordable Care Act  has dire consequences on Americans.   Some 30 million Americans could be affected, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, or in my State, we are looking at maybe 5  million people could lose their health coverage, their insurance, as a  result of that. There is $16 billion that immediately flows to the  State of California for the expansion of the Medicaid, Medi-Cal program  in California. That would be gone. And those people that are on that  program would simply not be able to get care.   It goes beyond just those who are in the exchanges. The exchange in  California is working quite well. Maybe a 1\1/2\ million people in  California are covered through the exchange, and they have options in  most every part of the State.    In my part of the State, there are some shortcomings because services  are not readily available, but there are 34 clinics managed by nine  organizations that provide medical services in my district. Every one  of those clinics rely upon ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act, for  the services that they render. If the Affordable Care Act disappears,  we repeal ObamaCare, those clinics are out of business.   And what does that mean? It means that thousands, literally hundreds  of thousands of people in my district would no longer be receiving  medical  [[Page H1060]]  services through the clinics, through the Affordable Care Act's  expansion, or through the Medi-Cal program. This is serious business.   There is another piece to this, and I would like to put up some  charts on that, but let's just go back and quickly review the benefits.  The benefits are:   5.1 million seniors receive savings on prescription drugs. You know  that famous drug doughnut hole; it has almost disappeared as the result  of the ObamaCare Affordable Care Act.   32.5 million seniors receive free annual preventions, health  checkups, every year. What does that mean? It means their blood  pressure is checked out, their potential for diabetes, for other  chronic illnesses, and they get the medicine for diabetes. They get  better health care, and the cost of Medicare is reduced.   Also, it strengthens consumer protections for seniors in Medicare  part D, and at least 85 percent of Medicare Advantage Plans' revenues  go back towards providing senior services. That is just for seniors.   So there are many, many benefits in the Affordable Care Act beyond  just those that are getting new insurance policies. It is a big deal  for seniors. They are able to get an annual checkup. They are able to  get their drugs much cheaper, able to provide them with the necessary  pieces of it.   One of the very first acts that has been taken up here by Congress is  the budget resolution passed by both Houses. It is now in effect, the  first budget resolution, and that budget resolution tells the Budget  Committee and the Ways and Means Committee: Repeal the taxes that are  associated with the Affordable Care Act. It is a lot of money,  somewhere between $700 million and $1 trillion of tax cuts directly  associated with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare.   Who gets the benefit of those tax reductions? Well, the top 1 percent  would receive some 70 percent of the benefit.   What does that amount to? Well, it amounts to--did I say 1 percent?  The top one-tenth of 1 percent would receive the great majority of the  benefit, or $200,000 tax reduction for the super-superwealthy. The rest  of them, the top 1 percent, get 57 percent of that $700 billion, and  that is over a 10-year period. And everyone else, that would be the  other 99 percent, will share in a much smaller portion, the remaining  43 percent.   For an average family, it probably amounts to maybe a tax reduction  of $160. However, those are the people that are able to get their  insurance through the exchanges, and so they are getting a really bad  deal because the average exchange, for example, in California, is  somewhere over $2,500.   So this is the tax repeal. It is a massive tax cut for the super- superwealthy.   It turns out that to pay for the Affordable Care Act, a very  progressive tax was put in place, and it does provide benefits for  those who are uninsured, the Medicaid population across the Nation, as  well as providing the buy-down of the insurance policies that are  available through the various exchanges.   Keep in mind, when people talk about repealing the Affordable Care  Act taxes, what they are talking about is a massive redistribution of  wealth in this Nation and a furtherance of this income inequality that  has been such a problem in our society and in our economy.   So the repeal of the Affordable Care Act does many, many things, most  of which would be quite a problem for working men and women, for the  seniors, for the elderly.   I didn't mention here that a good portion of that Medicaid population  goes to provide long-term care in nursing homes for seniors who are not  wealthy. I don't have the exact percentage, but some people say it is  50, 60 percent of Medicaid benefits across the Nation wind up providing  services in the long-term care facilities.   Is that important to seniors? Oh, yeah.   Is it important for children of seniors, you know, those people that  are in their forties and fifties whose parents are in their seventies  and eighties? They are deeply concerned about this particular issue of  the Medicaid expansion being eliminated by a repeal of the Affordable  Care Act, and then they wind up in a situation of having to take care  of Mom and Dad, trying to figure out how to do it on their insufficient  income.   So we need to understand that the very first act undertaken by the  President was to set in motion a very serious rejiggering, a  reoperation of the entire healthcare system in this Nation, so much so  that the standard insurance companies that provide policies to the  great majority of Americans are going: Whoa, wait a minute. You  eliminate the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, and we don't know how to  price in the marketplace for the coming year.   Right now, those insurance companies are in the process of figuring  out what their policies are going to be, how they would price them.   One of the things the Affordable Care Act does is to provide an  opportunity for those that have preexisting conditions, serious  healthcare problems, for those people to be able to get insurance;  therefore, the risk is spread. Now, if the Affordable Care Act  disappears, would this be part of the replacement? We don't know.   Our colleagues on the Republican side keep talking about repeal and  replace. We don't have a replacement plan yet, but what we do have is a  probability of a massive tax cut for the very wealthy. We are also  looking at chaos in the insurance system.   So let's be aware of what is going on in Washington when we talk  about repeal and replace and when you talk about ObamaCare--which, by  the way, is also known as the Affordable Care Act.   I have, today, some of my colleagues joining us. I notice that two of  them are here. We could go alphabetically, in which case--well, let me  see, P-Q-R. That means Panetta comes first.   My new colleague from the Monterey Bay area of California will join  us here. He wants to talk about some of these issues that confront  Americans and explain to all of us what this Congress and what the  President is doing to Americans.   I welcome Mr. Panetta to his very first Special Order hour that I  have been able to work with him. I know you have spoken on the floor  before, and we look forward to your comments tonight. I thank the  gentleman very much for joining us.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Panetta, thank you so very much for joining us  this evening. Thank you for your statement of your life and your  family's work. We know your father. Leon has been a dear friend of mine  and most of us here in the House. You're going to really be a  tremendous addition to this House. Your experience as a prosecutor and  in local government and county government positions you very well to  bring the message.   Certainly, the Salinas Valley is one in which immigrants are the  history, and they are the reality of today. Thank you so very much for  watching out for them, for your passion, and for your extraordinary  background in making all of us aware of what happens when sanctuary  cities, immigration laws, and others are just tossed around without  much thought about what the impact is in the community and to families,  as well as to the economy of the community. I appreciate that and hope  you will come back and join us on another Special Order.   From the other side of the country, we have Mr. Raskin, another new  Member of the House of Representatives. Welcome. You have a fascinating  background, and I look forward to your comments today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Raskin, thank you so very much.   Indeed, your experience as a professor teaching constitutional law  will be a very valuable asset to this House, and particularly in the  context of what is transpiring on the floor with the repeal of so many  of the regulations that are protecting Americans in so many different  ways, and certainly with the incredible array of outlandish executive  orders emanating from the White House, not the least of which is the  immigration issue.   So as we journey through this period of disruption and chaos, I am  certain that we will count upon you to provide us with insight into the  way in which all of this fits into the very clear framework of the  Constitution.    Mr. Speaker, there are so many other things to talk  about here, and I probably have another 20 minutes to do it. I doubt  that I will take all that time, unless my colleague from Iowa wants to  engage in a colloquy about some issues of the day which we might find a  very exciting and interesting thing to do, Mr. King. I see you await  your turn here.   Over the last week, Congress--the last 2 weeks now, 3 almost--has  enacted a series of repeals of regulations that had been passed in the  Obama administration. On the floor today, not more than an hour and a  half ago, three additional repeals of regulations took place. These  were under the Congressional Review Act, a law that is some 25 years  old now that allows the Congress to literally repeal regulations that  are out there.   I will give you a couple of examples. Today, one of them dealt with  the planning process for the Bureau of Land Management. About a quarter  of a million acres of land are under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of  Land Management. This is public land. It belongs to all of us. This  land is your land. Well, this is the land that belongs to the American  people. The repeal today of a new public review process on land  planning is--I don't understand it. I was once deputy secretary at the  Department of the Interior, and I oversaw the Bureau of Land  Management. I was operating under the law that was old in the 1990s.   But here we are with this repeal of a new process, a process that  actually invited into the land planning for the Bureau of Land  Management where are the roads going to go, how are they going to  manage the various uses of the land, whether it is agriculture, for  cattle, or for recreation, or hunting, whatever, that they invite into  that process all of the local agencies. The county, the State,  environmental groups, hunting, fishing, cattlemen, agricultural groups,  whoever would have a stake in that, they were invited into the process.  It shortened the process from 8 years down to something probably in the  2-or 3-year range to go through this entire thing, and, for reasons  that I will never understand, the repeal eliminated the use of good  science and economics.   So I don't understand what is going on here. This is a good process  so that the public would be invited. Yet, the Congressional Review  Act--should the Senate agree and the President sign this particular  review--the Bureau of Land Management will never be able to go back and  enter this process of land planning again.                                time  1800    They cannot issue a new regulation. What is happening here is  nonsense. There is mountaintop removal in coal country, where mountains  are simply wiped off the face of the Earth and all of that dirt is  piled into the nearby streams. We have that regulation.   Providing clean water for the communities and the rivers for  recreation or fishing or any other thing is gone and no longer  available to protect the communities. It goes on and on.   I know one thing that the President did the very first day was an  executive order to eliminate the reduction in the mortgage guarantee  fee. This is a fee paid by homeowners--usually low-income homeowners-- who, because of their income, because of their financial status, cannot  get a regular mortgage unless there is a guarantee. He said this was  for the benefit of the homeowner. Baloney. This was for the benefit of  the bankers.   We already know that he has appointed three people to his cabinet  that are from Wall Street, particularly from Goldman Sachs, and another  one from another agency on Wall Street. He was going to do away with  Wall Street. No, he brought Wall Street into the cabinet. We are going  backwards on this.   I am going to take a deep breath--I need it after all of that--and I  am just beginning to get wound up and haven't gone through the other 20  things that are on my list.   I did notice that this is my day to welcome to the floor of the House  of Representatives new Democratic members. Mr. Raskin is from the  marvelous State of Maryland. I have two Californians here. Ro Khanna is  from the Silicon Valley.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna) to share with  us his take on his first 33 days in Congress.    If I might ask a question of the gentlemen. He  represents the Silicon Valley--at least a large portion of the Silicon  Valley--and the issue of net neutrality has been bouncing around here  for some time.   Basically, the FCC, as I understand it, has decided that there would  be net neutrality, which, as I understand it--and perhaps the gentleman  can explain it better than I, so I will let him do so--may be the next  thing that this new chairman intends to do away with.   Has the gentleman followed that?    Oh, the tweets.    Oh, the tweets.    Oh, the tweets.    Oh, the tweets.    Oh, the tweets.    I thank the gentleman for the explanation and the  purpose of net neutrality. In a way, it is one of the things that, in a  very real way, protects the individual--by having access.   What is happening with these regulations and many of these executive  orders that the President puts out is to remove from the individual  protections that they have. I mentioned mountaintop removal in coal  country and the protections that the indigent farmer down the stream  has for clean water. That protection is gone.   You look at the mortgage guarantee. It is a small amount, but it is  an additional $500 a year that an individual would have to pay,  assuming they had to have a mortgage guarantee. Most low-income people  have to have that mortgage guarantee in order to buy a home. It is $500  out of their pockets.    So it is the protections that have been in place. There may be  others. I am sure that in the gentleman's area he may know of others,  if he would like to share with us, but I really thank him for bringing  to us his expertise in the area of communications. I know that he has  worked in this area before. He represents a part of America and  California where this is a very big issue.    I will use another analogy of flying below the radar.   A lot of this is flying below the radar because we are looking at all  of the tweets that come out in the morning, the various news programs  focusing on the President, and missing some really important things  that protect Americans.    That is so very true.   Let me just go through some of the regulations that are being  repealed here in the House over the last couple of weeks.   First of all, let's remember that the Congressional Review Act being  used to repeal these regulations has two parts to it. One, it has the  ability of Congress to repeal regulations, which I think is a good  idea. The second part of it, I think, has some real shortcomings. And  that is, once that regulation has been repealed, both Houses vote  before the President signs it, then the issue cannot be revisited by  that administrative agency.   I gave the example of the BLM, but it applies across the board.  Regulations that deal with smoking on airplanes is a regulation. If we  repeal that regulation, suddenly there is smoking on airplanes. You can  never go back and do a regulation again in that area.   I thank Mr. Khanna for joining us and for bringing his expertise to  us.   I am going to run down a quick list here. Oil and gas companies  operate around the world. Our new Secretary of State was the CEO of  ExxonMobil, the world's biggest oil company.   Did ExxonMobil pay a fee or a gratuity or corruption to a foreign  country?   We will never know now because the Congress has passed a regulation  that required oil and gas companies to disclose any fees, any money  that they have paid to a foreign government for the opportunity to  extract oil or gas from their country.   We happen to know that many of the countries in which these American  oil and gas companies operate are rife with corruption. So this is a  way for us to do an anticorruption program around the world that  involves our national oil companies. That is on the way to being  repealed.   How about mentally ill people being able to get a firearm?   I suspect 80 percent of Americans--maybe 100 percent--think that  somebody who is seriously mentally ill ought not to be able to get a  firearm.   Well, there is a mechanism. It is a national database. We call it the  NICS database. It is a database that gun shops have to inquire if an  individual is on that database for domestic violence, criminal  activity, or for mental illness.   We have had a problem with the mental illness part of this because  many mentally ill people do not get on the database for a variety of  reasons. The counties, cities, States don't provide that information.  In some cases, it is deemed to be proprietary or confidential.   But there is a way. It exists in the regulations today that would  require the Social Security Administration--when it makes a payment for  disability for severe mental illness to an individual, that  individual's name goes on this database. When that individual may want  to go down to the gun shop and buy a weapon, the gun shop would query  the database and, lo and behold, the individual comes up and he won't  able to get a gun.   It makes sense. It enhances the database. It adds to the database  individuals that are so severely mentally ill that they are able to get  Social Security disability payments.   Who is to object to that?   Well, apparently a majority of the House of Representatives and the  Senate does object to that. Probably the National Rifle Association  also. So now we have a situation in which we have a protection for  Americans being protected from the mentally ill individual that could  not buy a gun now suddenly being able to not be on the national  database for those people that are mentally ill. One more protection is  gone.   There are others, and I am going to run through them as quickly as I  can here.   I don't know whether you believe in climate change, global warming. I  certainly do. I have worked on this for  [[Page H1064]]  more than 30 years now, and it is a real issue. We know--there is no  debate about this--that methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. In  fact, it is far more powerful than carbon dioxide.   So the emissions of methane are one of the things that we would want  to reduce going into the atmosphere to add to those elements in the  atmosphere that creates global warming, climate change.   Well, the House of Representatives has passed a resolution through  the law that allows it to do so--to roll back a requirement that the  Bureau of Land Management put in place that requires oil and gas  companies that are drilling for oil, drilling for natural gas, to  control the leakage of methane from the gas well.   Wow, that is a terrible thing to do. Really? To require that an oil  company, a drilling company that is going after natural gas on  government--excuse me, your land, the American public's land--that  they, in the process of drilling for that natural gas or oil, control,  capture the methane that would otherwise leak from that well?   Well, that regulation is gone. The protections of Americans are gone.  Greenhouse gas emissions are emitted without regulatory control. Many  of these gas wells are in communities and in neighborhoods that will  also enjoy more methane emissions.                                time  1815    One more--or maybe more. Oh, yes, labor violations. Labor laws have  been on the books for well over 80 years. The labor laws are health and  safety, worker safety, requirements on hours, working conditions,  hazardous circumstances. There are many different regulations that  affect employers. They have to provide a safe working environment for  their workers. Some do. Well, I would say most work at making sure that  their workplace is safe. Some do not. Some of those who do not provide  a safe workplace have been fined by the Federal Government for those  labor violations. It is a good thing. It causes those companies to  provide a safe working environment for their employees.   A regulation was put forward by the Obama administration that said  that if a company wants to contract with the Federal Government, they  must disclose their labor violations, where they have violated the  various labor laws. It may be hours of work, overtime pay, working  conditions, hazardous circumstances, safety. They would have to  disclose it. It didn't say they couldn't get a contract, but it did say  that they would have to disclose to the public that they have not  provided sufficient awareness of the various labor safety and workplace  laws. That is on the way to being repealed.   What I want to do tonight is to simply say to the American public:  Pay attention. There are many things going on here in Congress and in  the administration that are harmful to you, the American public. The  kind of protections that you have counted on--worker safety,  environmental protections if you live downstream from a coal mining  operation, any of those things--are in the process of being repealed,  and your protections along with them. So be aware of what the new  administration and the Congress is doing to you, not for you.   I could talk about the wall and about the $15 billion to $30 billion  that is going to be spent if Mr. Trump gets his way here and builds a  1,400-mile wall. I want to just end with this, and that is choices.  Your representatives, myself, 434 of my colleagues here and 100  Senators and a President, we make choices about how your tax money is  going to be spent.   Should it be spent on a wall?   Well, let's consider for a moment spending it on a wall. This is $15  billion, the minimum amount of money, and it is not going to build much  of the wall. But for $15 billion, what could you do for it?   I am from California. I was once a regent of the University of  California and on the board for the California State University, so I  am familiar with this system. $15 billion could fund the entire  California State University system for 3 years, and that is nearly a  half a million students. You could replace all of the water pipes in  Flint, Michigan, 270 times over for $15 billion.   Choices. Do you want safe drinking water in Flint and other  communities around the United States or do you want a wall? Are you  concerned about the American military, the Navy, five Virginia-class  submarines, or one Ford-class aircraft carrier plus a submarine? Or how  about scholarships for undergraduate programs at the University of  California, which I had the privilege of graduating from a few years  ago?   27,777 4-year, full-time scholarships. That is the undergraduate  population at the University of California Davis, which I have the  privilege of representing.   There is one more place you could spend $15 billion or even one part  of $15 billion, and it is on this. These are the deadly diseases in  America. Let's see. Breast cancer, over the last decade we have seen  breast cancer actually decline. Prostate cancer has declined by 11  percent, heart disease by 14 percent, stroke by 23 percent, HIV/AIDS by  52 percent. Alzheimer's has not declined. It has increased by 471  percent, and it is going to go even more.   What could we do with $15 billion of research on a disease that  affects every American family?   We could almost assuredly find a cure for Alzheimer's. I thank my  colleagues here in the House of Representatives for increasing the  budget for Alzheimer's research from around $500 million to just under  $1 billion. That was done last year. If we can increase that funding  another $1 billion a year, the researchers indicate to us that we have  a high probability of delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years.  With another $1 billion after that, we probably could find a cure for  this disease that is going to bust the American bank. Medicare and  Medicaid, that is where the big money is going to be spent.   So my plea to our President and those who want to build a wall is: We  have choices. You want to do something for the American public? Let's  spend that $15 billion to $30 billion on education. You want to do  something for every American family? Spend some portion of that $15  billion to $30 billion by doubling the amount of money that we are  spending annually on Alzheimer's research. You want to do something for  the security of our Nation? Meet those critical needs that our military  has. Whether it is a new submarine or an aircraft carrier we can  debate, but we do know that we have expenditures that are necessary in  that area.   So, Mr. President, don't waste our money. Don't waste our tax money  on a wall. By the way, we know Mexico is not going to pay for it. Don't  get in a fight with our trading partner and our neighbors to the south  and Australia.   Be aware, Americans. Watch closely to what is happening here in  Washington. If you are concerned, so am I concerned about where we are  headed and about what this government is doing to you, not for you, but  rather to you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their  remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.                            ____________________
