 Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the  Improving Trauma Systems and Emergency Care Act with Senator Moran.   Nationally, trauma is the leading cause of death in the United States  for individuals aged 44 and younger, and according to the Coalition for  National Trauma Research, trauma accounts for 41 million emergency room  visits and 2 million hospital admissions across the country each year.   For anyone who experiences sudden, major injuries in a car crash, a  house fire, and any other dangerous incident, timely and effective  trauma care can make a significant difference. The Nation's trauma and  emergency medical  [[Page S498]]  systems are designed to provide that expert care. These systems respond  quickly and efficiently to get seriously injured individuals to the  appropriate trauma center hospital within the ``golden hour,'' the time  period when medical intervention is most effective in saving lives and  preventing permanent injury. Achieving this standard of access requires  maintenance and careful coordination between organized systems of  trauma care.   We must continually improve and invest in this essential component of  our healthcare system. In 2014, President Obama signed the Improving  Trauma Care Act into law, legislation that I introduced to add burn  injuries to the definition of ``trauma care'' and ensure that burn  centers are eligible for funding under trauma and emergency care  programs.   The legislation we are introducing today takes another important step  by authorizing $24 million each year for pilot program grants to  strengthen coordination and communication among trauma systems, improve  access to trauma care, and facilitate clinical research. The  legislation would also require the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness  and Response at the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to  support States in improving emergency medical services and trauma care  during a public health emergency. Lastly, the legislation would allow  HHS to award grants to improve trauma care in rural areas.   I am pleased to have the support of the Trauma Center Association of  America for this bill, and I urge our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to join us in cosponsoring this legislation and working toward  its expeditious passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the  Improving Trauma Systems and Emergency Care Act with Senator Moran.
