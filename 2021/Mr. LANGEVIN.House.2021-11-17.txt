 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  distinguished career of an extraordinary Rhode Islander, my friend  Randy Rosenbaum.   For 27 years, Randy has served as the executive director of the Rhode  Island State Council on the Arts, where he helped Rhode Island artists  to share their gifts and talents with the rest of the world.   From the up-and-coming artist to the well-established, the young  artists to the old, Randy lifted up the work of a diverse, new  generation of Rhode Island artists.   To put it simply, he is to the Rhode Island arts community what the  smile is to the Mona Lisa.   Randy has left an indelible mark on the Rhode Island arts scene,  increasing RISCA funding ninefold, putting the Ocean State on the map  as a film location, and supporting Rhode Island's $2 billion arts  economy.   Randy's leadership, now that he is retiring after 30 years at the  helm of RISCA, will surely be missed, but his legacy lives on through  his countless accomplishments.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Randy on his retirement, and I wish him  all the best in his next chapter.  [[Page H6328]]                                ____________________
