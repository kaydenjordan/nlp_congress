 Madam Speaker, getting back to the business of  the people, this week is National Gun Violence Survivors Week when we  honor and remember the lives that we have lost to gun violence, those  whom we have loved and miss terribly, people like my father, Guido  Mucarsel; Jaime Guttenberg; De'Michael Dukes; Joaquin Oliver; Tel  Orfanos; Jerry Wright; and all of their loved ones who now must live  with the pain forever.   The sad reality is that 58 percent of Americans or someone they know  has experienced gun violence in their lifetime. The number of gun  violence survivors increases in each passing day, tragedy after  tragedy. The mental and emotional toll on survivors is immense, and  many people are thrust into financial hardship.   These are experiences that no one chooses to endure. We must not only  remember those who have died but also those who have survived and do  all we can to help them in their never-ending journey toward healing.   To all of those who are remembering a loved one this week, we stand  with you.                            ____________________
