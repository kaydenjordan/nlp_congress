 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about  the administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate  agreement.   In 1992, under President George H.W. Bush, the Senate unanimously  approved a treaty to allow the United States to join the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since then, we have been  engaged in a global conversation with nations around the world to  tackle the challenges of climate change and ensure that we leave future  generations a planet that is not plagued by catastrophic drought,  famine, floods, wildfire, and a rising sea level.   After years of intense negotiation, the world finally reached an  international agreement that resulted in a global commitment, and 195  countries from around the world, except for 2, came together. Nicaragua  abstained; they wanted a stronger agreement. Syria was another country  that stepped aside and didn't take part, for obvious reasons.  Representing more than 90 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,  these 195 countries committed to reducing their carbon emissions to  prevent the average global temperature from rising by more than 2  degrees.   I cannot fathom why any President of either political party would  want to isolate the United States from the rest of the world, from our  allies and trading partners, by leaving this agreement.   President Trump justified this decision with concern for American  jobs and American business. Yet, since the election, American business  leaders have called him on the phone, sent a barrage of public letters,  and paid for full-page ads in newspapers, trying to get the message  through to him in any way possible that American business strongly  supports the Paris Agreement, which President Trump has walked away  from.   Tech companies and retailers, insurance companies, and even energy  companies, such as ExxonMobil and BP, support global engagement on  climate. In fact, the World Economic Forum estimated that the Paris  Agreement represents a $23 trillion investment potential due to the  growing demand in every corner of the world for clean energy. Between  consumers who want  [[Page S3271]]  clean energy and local regulations that require it, the demand for  clean energy will continue to grow here in the United States and around  the world.   While pulling out of the Paris Agreement might seem like a way to  protect jobs, for example, in the coal industry, the truth is that when  these jobs do go away, it is mostly due to other things: market forces  and automation.   I have been down in the coal mines of Southern Illinois, Central  Illinois. I have seen the way they mine coal today. For those who have  not been there and paid close attention, it may come as a surprise. It  is largely automated. Massive machinery, known as continuous miners,  literally chew away at the walls of coal, transporting it back up to  the surface for transport.   Back in the day, hundreds, if not thousands, of coal miners would  head for their jobs with little more than a pick or an ax or a shovel  or some drill. Today, it is an automated industry, and fewer jobs are  creating more and more coal opportunities because automation is a big  part.   In addition, there is a change in the global energy market. Because  of fracking in States like North Dakota and South Dakota, we have seen  an increase in the availability of natural gas at lower prices. Last  year, for the first time in modern history, we had more electricity  generated in 1 month in America from natural gas sources than from coal  sources.   We have turned a corner when it comes to the availability of  alternatives in energy. Between consumers who want access to clean  energy and local regulations that require it, clean energy is going to  continue to grow in demand.   Meanwhile, even in my own home State of Illinois, which is the fourth  largest coal-producing State in the Nation, we already have thousands  more workers in the solar industry than in the coal industry.   Clean energy jobs are growing. Remaining engaged on climate change  spurs new investment and strengthens American competitiveness for jobs  in the future. These jobs include designing more efficient solar  panels, wind turbines, batteries, and manufacturing the components for  export all over the world. Why should other nations get to lead this  growing industry of clean energy and the United States step away? We  can create those jobs right here in America--American jobs for American  workers in clean energy opportunities. We should lead the world in the  creation of clean energy jobs.   This decision by the Trump administration to turn its back on this  revolution in energy is going to cost us dearly. When the coal jobs do  decline, we have responsibilities to retrain the workers for clean  energy jobs and other opportunities in the future. The Paris Agreement  ensured that we have credibility as leaders, access to global markets,  and reduced financial risk for our citizens and businesses associated  with changing climate.   By walking away from the agreement, America is not just giving up an  environmental commitment, but it is giving up economic opportunity. We  have given away our leadership, isolated ourselves from the rest of the  world. They are not going to wait for us; they are going to move  forward and look for other leaders than the United States. This  President talked about making America first. His decision to walk away  from the Paris Agreement puts America dead last when it comes to energy  in the 21st century.   Climate change is a dire threat to the global economy and global  stability. It will cause catastrophic consequences for global health,  food security, and habitat on land and in the ocean. My constituents in  Illinois are already experiencing the adverse effects of changing  climate.   In recent years, our State--and, I might add, many others--has seen  historic storms, floods, and droughts, causing millions of dollars in  damage. Climate models suggest that if current global warming trends  continue, Illinois will have a climate similar to the Texas gulf coast  by the end of this century. For Illinois farmers, these changes to the  environment have a direct effect on their livelihood and for all of us,  a direct impact on our food supply.   Climate change also has significant national security implications  that affect our shores--ones we simply can't ignore. The crisis in  Syria, the flow of refugees from unstable parts of the world, is an  early warning of the link to climate change and how humanitarian  crises, particularly from less stable parts of our shared planet, are  going to get worse if we continue to let climate change go unaddressed.   Back in 2011, when pro-democracy protests began in Syria, many of  those joining were displaced farmers who had suffered 4 years of  drought, made worse by the effects of climate change. The National  Academy of Sciences published findings earlier this year showing that  extreme drought in Syria between 2006 and 2009 was more likely due to  climate change and that the drought was a factor in the uprisings in  2011.   Last year, Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Tom  Friedman wrote about massive migration out of parts of West Africa  through the Sahara Desert to Libya, where people were hoping to  eventually cross the dangerous trek across the Mediterranean Sea to  Europe. He wrote: ``Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by  the worst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus  overpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same is true of  this African migration wave.''   Former CIA Acting Director Mike Morell recently called President  Trump's decision to pull the United States from the Paris climate  agreement the worst decision made by this President so far.   Mr. Morell pointed out that pulling out not only cedes American  leadership in the world, but it harms our own national security by  ignoring the impact of climate change on failed and fragile states that  are homes to instability and violence. He further noted that we face  three possible threats to our existence: nuclear war, a natural or  manmade biological threat, or climate change. President Trump's  dangerous decision, if not reversed, will contribute to that threat.   Anyone in this Chamber claiming to be serious about national security  simply cannot be credible without addressing the long-term threats  posed by weak states and climate change in the decades to come.   It is amazing to me that people around the world have come together  to recognize the danger and the urgent need to act on climate change  everywhere in the world except right here in the United States of  America.   I don't understand the other political party. I can remember a time  when we would have a debate on climate change on the floor. We would be  talking about the Environmental Protection Agency, created by a  Republican President, Richard Nixon, and we would have Senators from  both sides of the aisle actively debating climate change, realizing  that it is a threat to our future. Those days have changed.   Any debate now about environment is strictly one-sided. Was the  science changed when it comes to global warming and climate change? Not  at all. Ninety-eight percent of scientists agree that we have global  warming, and the reasons for it relate directly to greenhouse gas  emissions.   So what has changed? Why isn't this a bipartisan debate anymore? The  politics have changed. They have changed dramatically with the way we  finance political campaigns in this country. Groups have emerged--one  in particular, the Koch brothers, who have made their fortune in carbon  industries and who have promised any Republican who steps out of line  on climate change this: You are in for a fight; you are going to face a  primary. Don't you dare stand up and talk about climate change here on  the floor of the Senate.   That is where we are today. We have come to a standstill, and now we  have a President who has decided to walk away from this issue. This  President has chosen politics over science and greed over  responsibility. His decision is a fateful decision for our children,  our grandchildren, and generations to come.   There may be some momentary applause in some places because President  Trump has walked away from this global agreement to deal with this  global challenge, but I could tell you the cheers are short-lived. When  we see the price that we are going to pay--and that our kids will pay-- for this gross irresponsibility, there will not be a lot of cheering.   I have said this on the floor before, and I will say it again because  I am waiting for someone on the other side  [[Page S3272]]  to come to challenge me: The Republican Party of the United States of  America is the only major political party in the world today that  refuses to take climate change seriously. I have said that over and  over, and I expect Senators from the Republican side to come to the  floor and say: That is not true; we take it seriously. But they don't.  Or I expect them to come to the floor and say: No, there is another  major political party that also denies climate change.   One Republican Senator, after I said this on the floor repeatedly,  pulled me off to the side in the corridor, looked around, and  whispered: There is a party in Australia that also doesn't believe in  climate change.   You think to yourself: So it has come to that. We have isolated  ourselves in the eyes of the world when it comes to protecting this  world for generations to come. We are going to pay a heavy price for  that, but the biggest price is going to be paid by future generations.   Can we make a little sacrifice today, drive more energy-efficient  cars and trucks, and think about ways to heat our homes and to light up  our rooms that don't consume so much energy? Well, of course, we can.  We have already done it, and we can do so much more. Walking away from  the Paris Agreement is not the path that should lead America into the  21st century.                            Healthcare Legislation    Mr. President, earlier today, Majority Leader McConnell came to the  Senate floor to, once again, be critical of the Affordable Care Act, a  law that has resulted in more than 20 million Americans gaining health  insurance. The law has lowered the uninsured rate to the lowest in  American history. This law has put an end to insurance discrimination  based on preexisting conditions or gender. It is a law that has made  sure that Americans suffering from mental health or substance abuse  addiction can get treatment. It is a law that extended the solvency of  Medicare by a decade and decreased prescription drug costs for seniors  by more than $1,000 for each senior in America. It is a law that has  helped to reduce--cut in half--the number of bankruptcies filed in  America because so many were the result of medical bills that people  just couldn't pay. I was proud to vote for this law.   Is it perfect? Of course not. Can it be improved and strengthened?  Yes, it should be. Improvements can be made the same way we have made  improvements in Medicare, Social Security, and in so many other  programs over the years, but not by repealing Social Security, not by  repealing Medicare but by sitting down on a bipartisan basis to try to  find a way to make sure that we don't deny health insurance coverage to  23 million people in America because of the repeal of the Affordable  Care Act and to find a way not to raise costs on older Americans, which  the bill that passed the House of Representatives would do, and to find  a way to make this law better for people living in rural America.   My hometown is in downstate Illinois. I, as a Congressman and  Senator, have represented a lot of small towns in sparsely populated  counties. They value many things. They sure value their schools, their  basketball teams and football teams. I will tell you what they value as  much, if not more, than anything else--their local hospital.   The local hospital makes such a difference in smalltown America. It  is not only a lifesaver--it saves you from driving another 50 or 100  miles for quality care--but it is also a source of great employment.  Probably the best paying jobs in town are at the local hospital. If you  want to keep a business or attract one, a local hospital is a good  selling point.   Do you know what the bill that passed the House of Representatives  will do to the rural and smalltown hospitals in Illinois?   Don't take my word for it. Ask the Illinois Health and Hospital  Association. They anticipate losing 60,000 jobs in Illinois because of  the healthcare repeal bill that passed the House of Representatives,  and they know that many hospitals downstate and many in the inner city  are going to be forced to cut back in services, if not close, as a  result of it.   What can we do to make this a better bill, to make the Affordable  Care Act work more effectively? Let me give you a couple of ideas.  First, we don't have anything in the law today that deals with  prescription drug prices. We are at the mercy of people--pharmaceutical  companies, investment bankers, and others--who come and control these  pharmaceutical patents. They can literally raise the cost of these  drugs beyond the reach of many families.   I had a young man come see me. He is in high school. He has been  fighting diabetes since he was a little boy. He and his mother talked  about the dramatic increase in the cost of insulin that he has faced  over the last several years. Insulin has been around a long time. This  is not a new wonder drug. It is a critical, lifesaving drug, but the  prices and costs of insulin are going through the roof, and there is no  way under current law for us to deal with it. Should we take that up?  Of course, we should.   Blue Cross Blue Shield in Illinois told me recently that they spent  more money last year on pharmaceutical costs than they did on inpatient  hospital care, and the costs continue to go up. We need good,  lifesaving drugs. We need to reward the companies that find them with a  profit. But as to those who want to gouge prices and take advantage of  people of modest income or folks who don't have insurance, there has to  be a way to answer that and to deal with it honestly.   Yesterday, I went with eight other Senators up to the National  Institutes of Health. It is out in Bethesda, MD. It is the premier  medical research facility in the world. We are lucky to have it right  here in the United States.   Time and again they told us about breakthrough drugs that were making  a big difference that started with research at the National Institutes  of Health. I asked at one point: Is it too much to ask the  pharmaceutical companies that take your basic research idea and turn it  into a profitable product to give some of those profits back to the NIH  to continue their research? They said: We have tried to do it, but the  pharmaceutical companies walk away. They don't want to give us a penny  for our future research.   Well, that is wrong. We ought to be investing in that research,  rewarding the pharmaceutical companies for their development of these  products, as well, but making certain we continue this leadership in  the world when it comes to medical research and pharmaceuticals.   The individual market on health insurance is one that troubles us  because it is the area where people who don't have health insurance  through their place of employment or don't qualify for a government  health insurance plan--like Medicare, Medicaid, veterans care, or the  like--go to buy insurance on the insurance exchange. This is where the  premiums have gone up. Now, why have the premiums gone up in that one  sector? Because when it comes to individuals, those who are older and  sicker are the first to sign up, but the healthier, younger ones are  the last.   We can sit down on a bipartisan basis and find ways to create an  incentive so that we can increase the participation in this insurance  pool and bring down the premium costs for those who are paying.   The third thing we need to do is to make sure that no matter where  you live in the United States, there is an option to choose when it  comes to buying your health insurance. One of the things we can do is  to take one of the most popular medical care programs in history--the  Medicare Program itself--and duplicate it in a public option available  to people across the United States. Do you want to buy a health  insurance program that looks like Medicare, a not-for-profit program?  This would be your chance.   So those are three ideas that I think we could bring forward in an  effort to make the Affordable Care Act even more responsive.   Senator McConnell, the Republican Leader, comes to the floor  frequently to talk about the choice to expand the Medicaid Program, as  allowed under law in many States. I would welcome the opportunity to  expand that program.   Most people do not understand the Medicaid Program. Oh, that is  health insurance for poor people. Well, in a way, it is, but it is so  much more. For example, one out of every two births in  [[Page S3273]]  Illinois is paid for by the Medicaid Program to keep mom healthy so she  delivers a healthy baby and to keep that baby healthy as soon as it is  born. It is paid for by Medicaid in 50 percent of the cases of new  births. But that is not the most expensive thing.   The most expensive thing under Medicaid is for your mom and your  grandmother who is in a nursing home, living on Social Security and  Medicare, and they need help. So they qualify for Medicaid to pay for  the medical care they need so they can continue to live wholesome  lives.   The third area, of course, is medical insurance for the disabled who  have ongoing needs. Those three areas make up Medicaid. When the  Republican proposal that came out of the House wanted to cut $600 or  $700 billion and give tax cuts to wealthy people, they took it out of  Medicaid.   So which of the groups that I just described to you would you take  health insurance away from--mothers with new babies, elderly folks in  nursing homes with no resources, or the disabled who live in our  communities?   I would think it is a step in the wrong direction to hit any of these  groups. That is why Medicaid was expanded in so many States and why we  should continue to find ways to expand it in a responsible fashion.   As I go back home and talk to people about this Republican  alternative that passed the House of Representatives, it is very clear  they oppose it.   I have challenged those Congressmen who voted for the Republican  repeal bill to find one medical advocacy group in my State that  supports their effort. There are none. The Illinois Health and Hospital  Association, the Illinois Medical Association, the Illinois Nurses  Association, and the Illinois pediatricians all oppose it.   The AARP, or American Association of Retired Persons, opposes it  because the bill removed the protection for elderly people when it came  to the cost of premiums. The AARP believes--and I am afraid the facts  bear it out--that what passed the House of Representatives will  dramatically increase health insurance premiums for people between the  ages of 50 and 64. We can do better, but we need to do it on a  bipartisan basis.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.                            The President's Budget
