 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mr.  Thomas J. Mahoney, Jr. of Savannah, Georgia, a highly-respected local  attorney and community leader. He passed away on January 20 at 80 years  of age.  [[Page H918]]    Mr. Mahoney graduated from Savannah's Benedictine Military School in  1954 and earned his law degree from the University of South Carolina.   In his first career after college, he worked as an FBI Special Agent  in Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington. During this time, Mr. Mahoney  met the love of his life, Judy, with whom he had four children.   After 2 years in the FBI, Mr. Mahoney returned to Savannah and joined  the law firm Mahoney & Cole, P.C. Through his hard work and  determination, he worked up the ranks to become its president and CEO.   He used his legal knowledge to make coastal Georgia a better place to  live, serving as the Chatham County attorney, city attorney for Tybee  Island, judge for Tybee Island, and assistant city attorney for  Savannah. He also served as the special assistant attorney general for  the Georgia Ports Authority since 1987, helping it to grow to its  current, impressive size.   Thank you, Mr. Mahoney, for everything you have done for the Savannah  community. You will be missed.                            ____________________
