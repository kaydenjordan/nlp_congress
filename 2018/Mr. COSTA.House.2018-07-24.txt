 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and it is my honor and privilege  to welcome Imam Ghazvini as the guest chaplain to the United States  House of Representatives.   For the past 14 years, Seyed Ali Ghazvini has served as imam, or  spiritual leader, of the Islamic Cultural Center in Fresno, a very  important Islamic center in the San Joaquin Valley.   In addition to leading prayers and Qur'anic study, the Imam Ghazvini  has distinguished himself as a prominent, prominent community leader.  Since the beginning of his ministry, the imam has worked intently to  facilitate meaningful interfaith dialogue and understanding throughout  the valley, among all religions.   As the co-chair of the Interfaith Alliance of Central California, he  has brought together numerous religious and social justice  organizations to host mixed-faith events and spread tolerance and  inclusivity throughout the San Joaquin Valley. I know because I have  had the wonderful pleasure and honor to participate.   It has been with great honor, again, that many of us who have been  able to participate in these interdenominational meetings have  witnessed a renewed commitment to social justice firsthand. I urge my  colleagues to welcome me in joining him and in thanking him this  morning for his opening prayer.                            ____________________
