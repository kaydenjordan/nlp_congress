 Mr. President, I rise with the understanding that the  Senate will be voting on a Republican healthcare bill next week, a bill  that has been written entirely behind closed doors.   The bill has been hidden from the American people, the press, and, as  far as I can tell, almost every Senator. I have not been allowed to see  it and neither have any of my Democratic colleagues.   I was elected to the Senate in 2014 during the same election that  Republicans regained the majority, and I remember a pledge by their  leadership that the Senate would return to regular order. Well, regular  order means public hearings on legislation. Regular order means  committees have a chance to gather input from expert witnesses,  consider a policy's potential impact, and amend bills before they come  to the floor.   Prior to enacting ObamaCare, the Senate Finance and HELP Committees  held nearly 100 hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs on healthcare  reform. In the House, where I served at the time, there were over 79  bipartisan hearings and markups that included an opportunity for our  Republican colleagues to offer input and amendments in the bill. Dozens  of Republican amendments were adopted during the House committee  markups of the Affordable Care Act. That is an open process.   What we are seeing now is a bill drafted entirely in secrecy and  hidden behind closed doors. But why? Is it because Republicans know  that this bill is not a good deal for the American people? You could  call the recent process a lot of things, but you can't call it open,  and you can't call it regular order.   Supposedly, the bill has been assembled by a working group of 13 of  my Republican colleagues, but just yesterday--just yesterday--one of  these Members complained that he had not yet seen a draft. In fact, he  went on to say--this is a Republican colleague of mine in this working  group:         It has become increasingly apparent in the last few days       that even though we thought we were going to be in charge of       writing a bill within this working group, it's not being       written by us. It's apparently being written by a small       handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership       in the Senate.    This quote makes it clear that this working group is--well, it is not  working.   When Senators in the majority party are unable to tell you who is  writing the bill, let alone what is in the bill, we have a  problem. While we clearly have a problem with the secretive, rushed  process, this process is a symptom, not the disease. The underlying  disease is that this bill, which we reportedly will see tomorrow, is  almost certainly terrible for the American people.    There are two explanations for keeping a product under wraps: Either  you want to build excitement for it or you are worried about the  weaknesses that would be exposed by the daylight. I don't believe for a  moment that Republicans are trying to build excitement by hiding this  bill. This bill is not next year's model of the Ford Mustang or Chevy  Camaro waiting to be unveiled at the Detroit auto show to great  fanfare. This bill is like a disaster that will negatively impact  millions of Americans. This bill is the iceberg that sunk the Titanic,  and Republican leadership has turned off the ship's radio and are  furiously shoveling coal into the engines.   While the Senate moves full steam ahead to vote next week on a bill  we haven't even seen yet, I am worried that my colleagues across the  aisle, along with too many political commentators and pundits, are  simply asking the wrong questions. They are asking: Will moderate  Republicans vote for it? Will the tea party wing support it? Will it  take sweetheart deals to get to 51 votes?   Well, folks, this is not a game. This is not about if and how the  majority can count to 51 votes and solve their political problems with  the far-rightwing base of their party. This is about people's lives.   There are serious policy questions we need to ask, and the American  people deserve to have answers. There are questions like these: What  are your policy goals here? How do you think this will help people  afford quality insurance coverage? What will the bill do for tens of  millions of Americans who have gained healthcare coverage in recent  years? What will the bill do for patients with preexisting conditions?  What will the bill do for the hundreds of thousands of Michiganders  covered under the successful Healthy Michigan Program? What will the  bill do for small business owners and employees? What will the bill do  for seniors who need affordable, long-term care options? What will the  bill do for individuals battling opioid addiction? These are questions  I am asking, along with all of my Democratic colleagues.   I serve on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and just a  few weeks ago we held a hearing on opioid abuse and how the epidemic is  simply ravaging our Nation.   I had the opportunity to speak with a police chief from our southern  border State of Ohio. He was very clear that if Medicaid expansion were  to go away--as we saw in the House bill and expect to see in the Senate  bill--it will make it much more difficult for local police departments  to tackle this crisis because of dramatically scaled-back  [[Page S3675]]  availability of addiction treatment. I spoke with a coroner, a medical  doctor, and an addiction expert on the panel as well.   These are professionals dealing with a public health crisis each and  every day--not people with political agendas. They all agreed that  Medicaid expansion is critical to combating addiction, improving public  health, and helping individuals suffering from addiction have an  opportunity to be productive citizens and have a second chance at life.   The bottom line is that this bill--this secretive, rushed bill that  we will supposedly see tomorrow--will move us backward and rip  healthcare away from millions of Americans. When you take health  coverage away from people, people will die.   As a Member of the House, I voted for the Affordable Care Act because  I knew that, at the end of the day, it would save people's lives. As  elected officials and public servants, there are only a handful of  votes we cast that are literally about life and death. Next week, we  will see one of those votes.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to read the bill,  whenever we get it, and then talk to doctors, patients, families,  clinics, and hospitals in their State. I also urge my colleagues to  vote no next week and to start a truly bipartisan process that keeps  what works, fixes what doesn't, but, most importantly, helps all  Americans afford quality healthcare in their communities.   I stand here ready and willing to be a partner in a bipartisan  process and to work with my Republican colleagues to improve our  healthcare system. Show us and the American people you are serious  about health reform. Let's have an open and honest process and pass a  bill that is genuinely in the best interest of the American people.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
