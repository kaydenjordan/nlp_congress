 Mr. President, I compliment our colleague from Florida  on his articulating this powerful vision for humankind, which is the  ability to look into the night sky and ponder the mysteries of the  universe, the mysteries of life, in the most complete way. America has  led this scientific adventure, this scientific journey, and we must  continue to be at the lead of this journey for all of the reasons he  has laid out today.   I thank my colleague from Florida for leading Congress in pursuing  and advocating for this vision and for developing the instruments on  the ground and the instruments in space that will advance our  knowledge.                                 Equality Act    Mr. President, I rise to speak about a different vision, the vision  articulated in our Constitution, those first three words of our  Constitution, ``We the People.''   It is this vision of a nation founded on the principle of a  government that would serve not the privileged, not the powerful, not  the few, not the elite, but serve the entire set of citizenry. Those  powerful words were put in supersized font in our Constitution. So from  across the room, you might not be able to read the details, but you can  read the mission: ``We the People''--a government of, by, and for the  people, as President Lincoln so eloquently said.    But this vision in the Constitution followed up on the principles  articulated in the Declaration of Independence. In 1776, 56 of our  Nation's best minds, our best leaders, gathered together in  Philadelphia to debate, to work out a document unlike any other in  history--a document that changed the course of world history--the  Declaration of Independence. It said: ``We hold these truths to be  self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by  their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are  Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.''   Together, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution laid  out the vision for our grand experiment in democracy, our grand  experiment in establishing a democratic republic--a nation, of, by, and  for the people, where each and every person is equal, each and every  person has the ability to pursue their happiness, to pursue  opportunity. We may not have always succeeded, but for centuries, the  story of our Nation--the American story--has been one of striving to  live up to that promise of a more perfect union, where every citizen is  equal, every citizen has opportunity, and every citizen can pursue  happiness.   Martin Luther King said in the midst of the civil rights struggle:         Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. . . .       Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice,       suffering, struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate       concern of dedicated individuals.    And it is with that type of tireless exertion and passionate concern  that we have been on this path toward equality and opportunity for all.   We have made a lot of strides. We have broken down a lot of barriers  in overcoming discrimination and in advancing opportunity for one group  of Americans after another. For women, for African Americans, for  indigenous peoples, for immigrants, for Americans with disabilities,  the journey goes on and on. But regardless of how far we have come, it  is clear we still have a long way to go.   There are still too many of our friends, too many of our neighbors,  too many of our coworkers, our brothers and sisters who don't enjoy the  same rights and protections as everyone else. They are members of the  LGBTQ community, and they continue to go through every single day  confronting discrimination simply because of who they are or whom they  love. That is simply not right. There should be no room for that kind  of hate, for that kind of discrimination here in the United States of  America.   That is why this week I have reintroduced the Equality Act. I have  reintroduced it with powerful support from Senator Tammy Baldwin and  Senator Cory Booker, who have really been the leaders who have driven  this forward here in the Senate. We have been joined now by 43  additional colleagues, so that is 46 Senators, original cosponsors, in  support of this vision of equality. That is a powerful stride from  where we were just a few years ago, when we didn't even have an  Equality Act to be presented here in the halls of Congress.   We launched this act in partnership with the House, where Congressman  David Cicilline has been the leader, and he has been joined by 194 of  his colleagues as original cosponsors.   John Lewis said during the civil rights struggle: ``If not us, then  who? If not now, when?'' All of us should be called to action in this  fight for the fundamental principle of equality, for us to stand up  together and declare once and for all that discrimination based on  sexuality and gender identity is not welcome in this country. We must  make nondiscrimination the law of the land here in the United States of  America.   It is certainly true that we have made some progress in recent years.  We passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes  Prevention Act, which expanded the definition of a Federal hate crime  to include assaults based on sexual identity or gender orientation. We  repealed don't ask, don't tell, a policy that banned LGBTQ soldiers  from serving openly in our military for 17 years and that forced more  than 13,000 servicemembers out of the military with dishonorable  discharges.   What we did was undermine the effectiveness of our military by taking  away the enormous talents and skills of those individuals. And 6 years  after repealing that policy, our military is stronger for it.   In the Affordable Care Act, we make sure that no one can be denied  healthcare because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  Then, in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the Defense of Marriage  Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, was  unconstitutional, it was discriminatory, it was in fundamental  violation of the vision of our Constitution.   Then, in 2015, the Supreme Court found, in Obergefell v. Hodges, that  love is love, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, and required  all States to recognize same-sex marriages and issue marriage licenses  to same-sex couples.   One barrier after another--one barrier after another of  discrimination, one barrier after another that presented an obstruction  to opportunity has fallen in a relatively short period of time, and  that is something all of us should celebrate in the vision of equality  and opportunity embedded in the vision of our Nation. But we cannot  allow ourselves to lose sight of the fact that as much as these have  been steps forward, we are still far from ending discrimination to the  LGBTQ community here in America.   Today, every State is required to recognize same-sex marriages and  issue wedding licenses to same-sex couples. But 30 of those States  still do not have a legal framework that ends discrimination. In 30 of  those States, the legal framework of the State does not prevent someone  from being fired from their job for being gay or lesbian or  transitioning; those States do not have a structure which prohibits a  same-sex couple to be refused services, to be evicted from an  apartment, to be banned from a restaurant, to be denied opportunities  to serve on a jury, to be turned away at the door in pursuit of a  mortgage.   We hear these stories from individuals. Ask the science teacher who  was fired after telling her principal that she and her wife were  planning to get  [[Page S2745]]  pregnant or the same-sex couple that was forced to leave a park after  kissing in public or how about the woman who was fired from her job as  a security guard in a Savannah hospital, and when she took the hospital  to court, she lost under the framework of law in that State.   Or ask the LGBTQ community in Orlando. What we see is that when we  have discriminatory laws, a discriminatory legal structure, that  engenders discrimination, and the discrimination facilitates and  engenders hate, and hate leads to violence. So we saw in Orlando when  last summer a crazed gunman attacked those who were at the Pulse  Nightclub and took the lives of 49 innocent people.   The States that have no framework are many. They cross our country-- Idaho and Montana and Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas  and Oklahoma, Arizona, Alaska and Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana,  Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, West  Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia,  Alabama and Florida--no legal structure to end this sort of  discrimination.   At some point in their lives, approximately two-thirds of all LGBTQ  Americans face discrimination because of their sexuality or gender  identification. Roughly a quarter of lesbian and gay and bisexual  working Americans have lost a promotion because of nothing more than  who they are or whom they love. And nearly--in fact, more than a  quarter of transgender, working Americans report that in just a single  year, they have been fired or not hired or denied advancement.   There is no Federal framework to end discrimination. Today, only 20  States and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning  discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the  workplace, in housing, in public accommodations. Another three States  have a partial set of protections. But instead of seeing the remaining  States that still have a framework that provides for discrimination, we  have seen more and more discriminatory legislation--laws like North  Carolina's HB2, the so-called bathroom bill, which said that  transgender individuals had to use a bathroom that matches their birth  certificate and which blocked local jurisdictions from passing  antidiscrimination measures to protect LGBTQ citizens; or Senate bill  149 out of South Dakota, signed into law in March, saying that LGBTQ  people who want to adopt or foster children can be rejected by State- funded agencies based on the religious beliefs of the agency.   Already this year, there have been more than 100 discriminatory  pieces of draft legislation offered in State legislatures across our  country.   As long as people in our Nation are afraid to put their spouse's  photo on their desk at work, as long as citizens are worried about  being evicted from their apartment, as long as Americans can be denied  service at a restaurant or a hotel room or kicked out of a public park  or denied the right to use a bathroom just for being who they are or  for whom they love, we need to keep fighting. We need to keep pushing  to end discrimination.   Imagine, if you will, when you open a business in America, the  principle, since the 1964 Civil Rights Act, has been that you open the  door to all. You don't let in a person with one color of skin and slam  the door on the next who has darker skin. You don't let in one gender  and slam the door on the other gender. You don't let in one ethnicity  and slam the door on the other ethnicity.   These fundamental provisions of equality, where the door is open to  each citizen by those who provide services to the public--that is the  foundation for each individual to be able to live their life fully, to  be able to fully pursue their potential, to fully pursue their  opportunity, to fully pursue happiness as envisioned in the Declaration  of Independence.   A former Senator of this body, who served here when I was an intern  in 1974, who served here in 2009 when I came to the U.S. Senate, Ted  Kennedy said: ``The promise of America will never be fulfilled as long  as justice is denied to even one among us.'' Yet justice is denied  every day--every day--in 30 States across our Nation where the door of  discrimination is slammed shut on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and  transgender individuals.    We the people in America understand that it is time to stop slamming  the door of discrimination shut and open the door to full opportunity  and full equality as envisioned in our founding documents. Sixty  percent of Americans support same-sex marriages. More than half oppose  North Carolina's bathroom bill and other similar bills that  discriminate against transgender individuals.   According to one study by the Public Religion Research Institute,  more than 70 percent of Americans support comprehensive Federal  legislation. Public opinion is in support of moving forward--moving  forward to keep the door of opportunity open and to stop slamming the  door of discrimination in the face of our citizens. It is time for us  to stand up for our fellow citizens, time for us to speak out against  this discrimination, time for us to declare once and for all that every  American, no matter who they are or whom they love, deserves to live  free from fear, free from violence, and free from discrimination. It is  time for us to stand with our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers,  and our brothers and sisters in the LGBTQ community. It is time for us  to move forward and create nondiscrimination legislation based on the  same sound foundation that has served so well in regards to addressing  discrimination in other parts of our society, and that is the 1964  Civil Rights Act. It is time to consider the Equality Act in the Senate  of the United States.   At a time when so much discrimination, so many daily assaults occur  on our fellow citizens, shouldn't we be holding a hearing to have these  citizens speak up and share their stories? Shouldn't we be holding a  vote to determine whether or not we truly believe in our constitutional  vision? Shouldn't we have to confront the fact that we still have  discrimination in housing, in employment, in schools, in restaurants,  and in theaters? In fact, in every walk of life in America, in 30  States, we still have this discrimination without a legal framework in  those States to provide protection.   Under the Equality Act, sexual orientation and gender identity  receive the same clear level of protection that race, religion, gender,  and ethnicity already enjoy, thanks to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The  Equality Act will help us fulfill the promise of America, as Ted  Kennedy presented it, that justice under the law is not complete when  it is denied to even one among us.   I am a steadfast believer in our Nation's founding principle that all  of us were created equal, that we are ``endowed by our Creator with  certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the  pursuit of Happiness.'' But you don't have liberty if the door of  discrimination is slammed in your face when you seek an apartment. You  don't have liberty when the ugly face of discrimination blocks you from  an opportunity to serve in a job. You don't have pursuit of happiness  when you face a discriminatory framework in 30 of our 50 States.   We all ought to have the same freedom to be who we are, to love whom  we love, to pursue our lives and careers free of discrimination. I will  not rest until that is true for everyone in our country. I say to my  colleagues: Let us all not rest until we complete this vision of  opportunity and equality for all.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
