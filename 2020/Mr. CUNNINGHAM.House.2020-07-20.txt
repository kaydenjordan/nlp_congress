 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Representative  Palazzo's and my bipartisan amendment, which would ensure that the  National Guard servicemembers aiding in our response to COVID-19 have  the care that they have earned when they return home.   Under current law, National Guard soldiers and airmen on Federal  orders are entitled to 6 months of transitional health coverage after  they are demobilized. However, the servicemembers activated in response  to the coronavirus are not eligible.   This amendment, which is identical to my bill, the Support Our  National Guard Act, would expand this important benefit to the over  45,000 National Guard servicemembers serving on the front lines of this  pandemic. These brave men and women are sacrificing to ensure our  Nation overcomes this unprecedented crisis, and they deserve our  unconditional support.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring our  obligation to our National Guard and vote in support of this amendment.
