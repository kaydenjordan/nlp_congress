 Madam Speaker, friends, colleagues, and distinguished  guests in the gallery, we are gathered here today on the 36th  anniversary of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing to honor 241 American  heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice.   The 241 names--220 of which are my fellow Marines--will be forever  etched in our hearts and on the walls of the Beirut Memorial in  Jacksonville, North Carolina.   Although you may not recognize these names, they are the names of  sons, brothers, fathers, and friends. They are the names of true  American patriots who came in peace and were stolen from us by an act  of pure evil. They are the heroes who gave their lives so we could keep  ours.   Semper fidelis means ``always faithful.'' It is the motto of the  United States Marine Corps. Today, we remember the 241 fallen heroes of  Beirut. Today, we remain faithful.   Madam Speaker, I ask that all Members and distinguished guests in the  gallery rise for a moment of silence.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, we are here today to honor the 241 American  heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice on this very day 36 years ago in  Beirut, Lebanon.   For my family and so many families, today is deeply emotional.   When I enlisted in 1979 as a young man, I wanted to serve and be part  of something bigger. That led me to the United States Marine Corps and,  like every marine, I took an oath to God, country, and to the Corps.   Semper fidelis is not just a slogan or a creed; it is a way of life  that only those who have earned the eagle, globe, and anchor can fully  understand. Semper fidelis is part of the very fabric of every marine,  past and present.   I served as a first lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. In  1983, my battalion was ordered to Beirut, Lebanon, in support of the  1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment and the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit.   I vividly remember the evenings we sat on the roof of the Marine  barracks with the American flag flying over our head. The barrage of  small arms gunfire and mortar rounds made it very clear that we were in  harm's way every day.   On this very day 36 years ago, a terrorist affiliated with Hezbollah  and financed by Iran drove a truck bomb into the barracks we called  home.   241 American servicemen were killed, 220 of which were my fellow  marines. 241 sons, brothers, fathers, and friends never returned home.  241 came in peace, and 241 lives were stolen from us by an act of  absolute pure evil.   It was the deadliest day for the Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo  Jima.   It is by the grace of God that I was able to come home to my wife,  Denise, who was expecting our first child. My battalion had shipped out  10 days before the bombing.    Mr. Speaker, today is not about me. People may not recognize the 241  names listed here, but they are the names of the 241 who answered the  call of duty 36 years ago.   Today is about those 241 soldiers, sailors, and marines who laid down  their lives to protect our freedoms, and today is about every veteran  who has nobly worn the uniform of our Armed Forces.   On this somber day, I look out at the flag flying above the U.S.  Capitol and feel the same reverence I felt standing below the Stars and  Stripes on the roof of the Beirut barracks in 1983. Though I will never  know exactly why I was spared when so many were not, I understand that  our first duty is to remember and be faithful.   Mr. Speaker, three of my fellow marines, Representatives Gallagher,  Carbajal, and Moulton, joined me to offer legislation to remember the  faith and loyalty of the 241.   Fellow marine, Representative Gallego, joined me to offer legislation  to provide a sliver of justice for the Gold Star families who lost  their loved ones. Our bill, the OORAH Act, passed both the House and  Senate, and for that I am very grateful.   But, Mr. Speaker, there is still work to be done here. Terrorists and  those who support them financially must be held accountable for their  terrible actions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for participating in this Special  Order to remember the sacrifice of those who answered the call of duty  to defend our freedom in conflicts across the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird), my  fellow Hoosier and decorated Vietnam veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia  (Mrs. Miller), my friend and colleague.                                time  1945     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bergman), my friend, colleague, and fellow marine.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends, colleagues, and  distinguished guests in the gallery for their participation in my  Special Order.   As a Beirut veteran, I am deeply moved by their remarks, and I know  their words will comfort the Gold Star Families across this Nation.   Today, on the 36th anniversary of this horrific attack, and every  day, we must strive to ensure that all are remembered, and all are  honored. We remember their loyalty, their selflessness, and their  courage. We are humbled by their tremendous sacrifice.   We must hold them closely in our hearts and hometowns. We must live  in gratitude for the precious gift they have given to us here today.   Most of all, we must uphold our promise to honor our fallen. We must  remain always faithful.   Mr. Speaker, I will always remain faithful. God bless America, and  Semper Fi.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
