 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her work in  this area, which is desperately needed.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on today's Transgender Day of  Remembrance.   For 20 years, November 20 has marked a solemn day in the LGBTQ-plus  community. Vigils are held in communities nationwide in honor of all  the transgender people who were senselessly and dementedly killed for  simply being who they are.   I told my transgender friends and families: Never seek to change who  you are. Be exactly who you are.   Transgendered women of color are especially vulnerable to violence  and are 4.3 times more likely to become homicide victims than all  women, according to the Human Rights Campaign.   This year alone, at least 22 transgender and gender-nonconforming  Americans have been killed in the United States. Ninety-one percent of  them were Black women.   I am sad to say that three transgender people of color were murdered  in the greater Kansas City area, two in my congressional district.   Brooklyn Lindsey was a 32-year-old Black transgender woman. Those who  knew her say she was intelligent, had a good sense of humor, and was  loved by many. By many accounts, she was outgoing and happy. She  enjoyed dancing, helping others, and wanted to be a life coach.   On June 25, she was found shot to death on an abandoned porch in  Kansas City, Missouri.                                time  1900    Jamagio Jamar Berryman, also known as Ja'leyah Jamar, was 30 and a  Black gender nonconforming person. Ja'leyah was passionate about fixing  and working on cars, designing hair, and spending quality time with  family.   They were shot and killed in Kansas City, Kansas, on September 13.  They left behind a 5-year-old daughter named Ja'Mya, their parents,  seven siblings, nieces and nephews, and many others who loved them  deeply.   And most recently, Brianna ``BB'' Hill was a 30-year-old Black  transgender woman who was fatally shot in Kansas City, Missouri, on  October 14. Brianna was a beloved member of her community, a fan of the  Kansas City Chiefs, and loved spreading joy by sharing funny videos on  her Facebook page.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development has removed  requirements for applicants for homeless funding maintain  antidiscrimination policies and demonstrate efforts to serve LGBTQ-plus  people and their families.   The Department of Defense has implemented a ban on transgender  troops.   These are just a few instances that shows that the United States of  America--at least the administration--is in the midst of a nervous  breakdown.   Change is still needed to protect the LGBTQ citizens nationwide.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the for gentlewoman for allowing me to speak.
