 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an  educator who touched the lives of thousands of Montanans with his love  for our State as well as his knowledge and passion for Montana  politics. As one of Montana's foremost political scientists, Dr. Craig  Wilson was well known across the State and across both sides of the  aisle.   For 34 years, Professor Wilson spent his days in front of students in  a classroom at Montana State University Billings, helping them  understand the world in which they lived.   He conducted reliable and respected surveys that engaged Montanans on  issues that mattered most to them. His method was honest and  straightforward, a welcome approach in today's politics.   Craig was a loving husband to Kristianne, a proud father of Collin  and Evan, and a doting grandfather to Blair and Jett.   Dr. Wilson was an educator in and out of the classroom. He was dearly  loved and will be missed.                            ____________________
