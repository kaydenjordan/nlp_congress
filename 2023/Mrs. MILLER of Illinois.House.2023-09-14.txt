 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the historic  impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden.   Congress must hold Joe Biden accountable for serving as the kingpin  over a series of shady foreign business deals involving his family  members. Bank records and extensive evidence show that the Biden family  received $20 million in cash, diamonds, and sports cars from China,  Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and other foreign entities.   Joe Biden was directly involved in this foreign influence-peddling  scheme, and when Biden's son demanded $5 million in cash from a Chinese  official, he wrote, ``I am sitting here with my father. . . .''   Congress has a duty to the American people to protect taxpayers from  this type of foreign corruption.
