 Madam Speaker, I rise today in the strongest  possible support for the impeachment of Donald J. Trump. When Trump  made a last desperate attempt to steal the Presidency, to reject the  will of the people by encouraging insurrection, he became the first  President to incite an attempted overthrow of the institutions he is  sworn to protect.   That is a horrifying first, and his actions necessitate another. He  should be the first President impeached and removed from office in the  history of our country. I voted to impeach him once, and I am willing  to do it again.
