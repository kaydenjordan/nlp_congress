 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.  Aside from the public health impact, this outbreak also threatens grave  economic damage. Already, economists have lowered global forecasts with  the dimmest outlooks predicting a fall from nearly 3 percent to just 1  percent growth due to the uncertainty and disruptions inflicted by the  virus.   Small firms, in particular, can expect hardship from this public  health crisis. From the local barber shop or neighborhood cafe to the  innovative technology startup, a pandemic can mean fewer customers,  supply chain disruption, and workforce reductions.   As the coronavirus spreads, so, too does misinformation and alarm.  Because of stigma and xenophobia, many Chinatown restaurants and stores  in my city of New York were already feeling economic pain before even  one person in the city tested positive for the virus. Merchants in  Chinatown have reported sales drops as high as 80 percent.   Provisions in this bill would mean all small businesses harmed by the  virus could apply for emergency loans, with low interest rates, to help  them meet financial obligations. Just as the SBA helps small firms get  back on their feet after a hurricane, wildfire or earthquake, the  agency can be critical to helping local economies recover from this  public health crisis.   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairwoman Lowey for working to  include these provisions, which are modeled on legislation I introduced  late last week. I encourage a yes vote.                            ____________________
