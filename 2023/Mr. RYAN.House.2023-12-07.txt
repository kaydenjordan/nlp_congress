 Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank and honor the brave first  responders who risked their lives to save Hudson Valley families after  a catastrophic gas explosion in Wappingers Falls injured 15 in our  community last month, several severely.   Officer Devin Ludwig, Investigator Andrew Hettinger, and Firefighter  John Marko Nuculovic ran back into extreme peril to carry out victims  trapped inside the smoldering rubble.   John himself refused medical attention for injuries sustained during  the rescue until all others were out safely.   Firefighter Raquan White pulled an injured victim from the scene, and  with backup medical personnel still en route, took it upon himself to  transport the victim to a nearby hospital for immediate care, saving  their life.   Officer Corchado, Wappingers Falls Fire Chief Enson, Detective  Sergeant Farrell, Lieutenant Reverri, Deputies Kemlage and Aronow, and  contractors from J. Mullen & Sons are among the countless other heroes  who displayed exceptional courage that day.   Our Hudson Valley community and those affected in particular owe you  a deep debt of gratitude that we will never be able to truly repay.                            ____________________
