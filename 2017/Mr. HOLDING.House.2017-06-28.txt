 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the tremendous  amount of growth in North Carolina, specifically in and around the  Second Congressional District.   According to the Census Bureau, North Carolina's population has  increased 6.4 percent since 2010. That number increases to over 16  percent for just Wake County which encompasses about half of the Second  Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that North Carolina is a fantastic place  to live and work, especially for young people wanting to raise a  family. In fact, Fortune magazine recently surveyed tens of thousands  of millennials nationally about the best places to work, and the  results speak for themselves. Two of the top 10 businesses in the  United States call Wake County home.   SAS, a global analytics software firm, and Kimley-Horn, a provider of  professional services, placed at number two and number eight on the  list respectively.   That is great news for the future of North Carolina.  [[Page H5242]]                                ____________________
