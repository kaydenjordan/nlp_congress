 Madam Speaker, day 25. There is no reason for  President Trump to keep the government shut down over his demands for  an ineffective border wall.   On day one, the Democrats passed legislation to reopen our  government. Today, we are taking further action, bringing forward a  continuing resolution to fund the government through February 1, giving  the President and the Senate GOP yet another opportunity to end the  shutdown, while allowing time for us to do our work and negotiate.   President Trump should stop holding the health, the safety, and the  paychecks of the American people hostage.   We need border security, and Democrats stand strong on that issue,  but we will not waste taxpayers' dollars. We will not waste billions of  taxpayer dollars on an ineffective wall.   Mr. President, Congress, open our government.                            ____________________
