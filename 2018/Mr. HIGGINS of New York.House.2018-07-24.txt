 Mr. Speaker, I have proudly stood before  this House on many occasions to honor the life and legacy of south  Buffalo native John Granville. John was a young diplomat with the  United States Agency for International Development and, tragically, was  murdered by Islamic extremists in Khartoum, Sudan, in 2008.   At the time of his death, John was working with the people of South  Sudan to prepare them for elections and their eventual independence as  the newest country in the world in 2011.   A decade after John's death, the Granville family is still fighting  the international justice system to hold the Government of Sudan  accountable for his death.   The Trump administration's Department of State is now considering  removing Sudan from the list of state-sponsored terrorists. If the  State Department allows for that removal, Sudan's responsibility for  John's death and the escape of his convicted murderers must be a  condition for the State Department's action in this matter.                            ____________________
