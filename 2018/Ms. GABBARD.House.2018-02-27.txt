 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Waters for her  leadership in opposing this bill and standing for the protection of  everyday Americans.   We can't forget that it was only 10 years ago that millions of  hardworking families watched their life savings entirely wiped out.  They lost their homes. They couldn't afford to send their kids to  college. And all of this heartache, this pain, this suffering that they  went through was the direct result of risky predatory lending practices  and too-big-to-fail banks that did not have sufficient capital in place  to support and absorb their financial losses.   It was in the aftermath of this financial disaster in 2008 that  Congress passed protections to prevent this from happening again, but  here we are today where these big banks now believe that we should  simply forget the past mistakes that they made and, instead, only  evaluate their current activities to determine certain capital  requirements. I guarantee you those families that have suffered have  not simply forgotten about what they went through and what they are  still struggling to overcome and recover from.   By ignoring critical indicators of past activities, this bill would  allow big banks, like Wells Fargo, for example, who defrauded the  American people just in the last several months by opening millions of  fake accounts, to get away with a slap on the wrist. And the American  people are set up to take the fall for their actions.   Now, supporters of this bill claim that current capital requirements  stifle lending and hurt our banks and the economy, but the facts say  otherwise. In 2016, bank profits reached an all-time high, and today  business lending is up 75 percent since 2010. Our country's banks added  more than $700 billion in capital to absorb potential losses and  protect Americans and our economy from financial disaster.   Higher capital requirements don't restrict lending. They simply  ensure that big banks that are even bigger today than they were in 2008  can absorb their losses without depending on taxpayers for a bailout.   The American people deserve a financial system that works for them  and their families, not one that bets against them to boost Wall Street  profits. We need to pass legislation that increases these capital  requirements of banks with assets greater than $50 billion and continue  to enact and strengthen reforms that will protect our economy and  American families from another massive collapse. That is why I am  strongly urging our colleagues to reject this dangerous bill and,  instead, work together towards efforts to build a financial system that  serves the American people, not special interests or Wall Street banks.    Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security has  confirmed that 21 State electoral systems were targeted in the 2016  election, revealing vulnerabilities and jeopardizing the integrity of  our elections and our democracy as people lose confidence that their  vote matters and that it will actually and accurately be counted.   In 2016, DEF CON, the world's largest hacking conference, revealed  startling vulnerabilities in our election's infrastructure. We must  take action now to safeguard our electoral infrastructure and ensure  that each and every American vote is counted accurately.   I am introducing the Securing America's Elections Act, which will not  only provide the American people with a voter-verified, reliable, and  independent paper record of their votes that can be implemented before  the 2018 elections but will also address the effectiveness and security  of our electronic voting software.   We must act now to secure our elections and renew our citizens' faith  in the integrity of those elections.                            ____________________
