 Madam Speaker, as we reflect upon yet another horrific  fire season in California and the West, we cannot allow ourselves to  forget or get complacent.   This week, we have had several good meetings here in D.C. with  various groups talking about the need for better forest management.   This is more or less what the average forest looks like that is  unmanaged. You can hardly see through it. You could never ride a horse  through it. An owl can hardly fly through the thing. So what does this  mean, an overcrowded forest? It means fire danger.   These trees compete for a limited amount of water supply. Insects  attack and weaken trees because they don't have enough water and soil  nutrients.   The right amount of trees per acre would look something like this.  See, we are not cutting all the trees from Mexico to the Canadian  border, we are leaving some behind, a healthier more sustainable  forest. We will have much more success and much less fire danger.   Indeed, over a million acres in my district burned this year--a  million acres. That is terrible for water quality, air quality, for the  wildlife, and for the habitat. We could do so much better and put  people back to work managing our forests in a way that is better for  everybody with access to the forest. Let's get on it.                            ____________________
