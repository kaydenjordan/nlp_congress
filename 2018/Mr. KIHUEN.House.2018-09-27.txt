 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the life of my  friend, Loretta McKinney Harper.   Ms. Harper was a high school counselor at Desert Pines High School,  where she counseled thousands of students over her 17 years there. But  Ms. Harper was more than just a counselor. She was a friend, a mentor  to her students, and an inspirational community leader.   Ms. Harper cared deeply for her students and auctioned off personal  memorabilia to assist her undocumented students with their DACA filing  fees.   Ms. Harper attended Know Your Rights training sessions so she could  stand up for them when they were unable to do so for themselves.   Ms. Harper instilled in her students a sense of civic duty and  bragged about her students who registered to vote as soon as they  became eligible to do so.   Ms. Harper was a true patriot who loved our democratic process.  During elections, Loretta devoted countless hours to voting  registration, volunteering on campaigns, and getting out the vote. Her  energy inspired others.   Sadly, on September 18, 2018, Ms. Loretta Harper passed away.   Today, I stand here to honor Loretta as a shining star of community  service. Ms. Harper was driven by her love of her community and a  burning desire to make it better.   Mr. Speaker, as I reflect on her contributions to our community over  so many years, I can attest that she left her community in a better  place. I will miss my friend.                            ____________________
