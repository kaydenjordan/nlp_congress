 Mr. Speaker, I will begin by thanking the  gentlewoman. I am a fourth generation New Yorker. I am a Jew. I am a  vet. And you are a hero. It has been such an incredible honor to serve  with you. Thank you for so much.   I also thank Congressman Ruiz for partnering on this effort I would  like to speak on today.   I rise today in support of our amendment to increase appropriations  for Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act grants, because when  it comes to our law enforcement, the last thing that we should ever do  is pinch pennies.   There are few in this Chamber, heck, a few in this country, who know  what it means to put your life on the line every single day for years  in the service of others. Well, that is what the NYPD does every single  day, and they do not get the appreciation that they deserve. That is as  true today as it ever has been.                                time  1215    What law enforcement across the country deserves is our support, not  just with our words, but with our budgetary decisions, because while  our Nation confronts the realities of systemic racism both in our  history and in our everyday life, the future that we must build is one  based around unity. It is one where there is trust between the  community and those who protect us.   It is a future, though, where we also acknowledge that law  enforcement officials are up to three times as likely to die from  suicide as they are in the line of duty.   Our officers have faced daily horrors during this pandemic. We have  called them essential workers. They have always been essential.   Something must be done in these hallowed Chambers.   That is exactly what this program is for. It allows police  departments to use these funds in a way that works best for their  officers. That is why I am honored to offer this amendment yet another  year with Dr. Ruiz.   Each and every day, officers in my community on Staten Island and  South Brooklyn are hugging their children, hugging their partners,  their spouses good-bye, not knowing if they are going to return home.  That is a stress that they live with every day that none of us can  relate to.   This program must be advanced in honor of their service.
