 Mr. Speaker, this week Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi  welcomed members of the Churchill family and the distinguished  Ambassador from the United Kingdom to the United States Capitol in  honor of the 144th anniversary of the birthday of the Right Honorable  Winston Churchill. It is always a touching and fitting ceremony here in  the people's Capitol.   I recall well one of the most fateful assignments of our predecessor  body, the Continental Congress, when a special committee was formed,  something Congress is great at. That special committee included John  Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson, and Jefferson was  assigned this great task of drafting the Declaration of Independence.   Well, Mr. Speaker, he completes his work, and he comes back to the  committee and he outlines his 27 grievances against the King. He has  worked on it for days. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams review that  work, and they make 80 changes--80 changes.   It just shows that, no matter how good the author is, once it is  turned over to a committee, there will be change.   Of those 80 changes, about 25 percent of the Declaration of  Independence that we know today, one of those changes speaks to the  heart of the friendship, the underlying friendship, between the British  and American people, for one of their changes was Jefferson's poignant  lament, which reads as this: ``We might have been a free and great  people together.''   So that was taken out of the document, even though Jefferson outlined  the 27 grievances why America should separate itself from Great  Britain.   I like to reflect on that when we fast-forward to Winston Churchill  coming to America in 1946 and speaking at Westminster College in  Missouri, when he toasted what he called the fraternal association of  the English-speaking peoples.   He said in that talk: ``But we must never cease to proclaim in  fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man  which are the joint inheritance of the English-speaking world and which  through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the habeas corpus, trial by  jury, and the English common law find their most famous expression in  the American Declaration of Independence.''    So, on this 144th anniversary of the birth of Winston Churchill,  someone who was of both, American and British, I salute his birth. I  salute that special relationship between the United Kingdom and this  great country.                          Recognizing Alice Andrews     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of  Alice Andrews, a good friend who was recently awarded the 2018 Neil  Compton Award for her tireless work in conservation in Arkansas.   Born and raised in El Dorado, Alice received her undergraduate degree  in fine arts from Henderson State University, where she fell in love  with arts and the environment.   She is more than a 40-year member of the Ozark Society and has served  extended terms as Ozark Society president and conservation chair.   Alice has worked for decades to preserve water, air quality, and  wilderness areas throughout Arkansas. Her lifetime of service to the  State of Arkansas and environmental conservation will not be forgotten.   I join all Arkansans in congratulating Alice on this achievement and  wish her much continued success.                         Farm Bureau Patriot Project     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Arkansas Farm  Bureau for participating in the American Farm Bureau Federation's  Patriot Project. Arkansas is one of only four States currently  participating in this project.   The Patriot Project is a program that connects military veteran  beginning farmers and ranchers who are starting their careers with  experienced Farm Bureau farmers, who act as mentors.   The Arkansas Farm Bureau works to identify military veterans and Farm  Bureau mentors and facilitate long-term educational and professional  mentorship relationships. The military veterans should be actively  farming and using their own resources while their mentor guides them  towards success.   I thank Randy Veach, president of the Arkansas Farm Bureau, for his  leadership in bringing this program to Arkansas, and I extend a warm  hand of gratitude to the Arkansas Farm Bureau for its worthwhile  commitment to our veterans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I thank the ranking  member of the committee as well for her work on this issue over the  years. I appreciate Mr. Duffy's leadership, and I appreciate Mr.  MacArthur, Mr. Graves, and their work on this issue because the House  has done its job, Mr. Speaker.   We painfully passed this bill over a year ago. We have done our work.  We have a bill that represents a compromise of coastal States and not  coastal States. We have taken into account all these issues about  climate change and floods and hurricanes. We have taken all that into  account, but we have had no action from the Senate.   What we are here for today is because the Senate has not taken one  step to constructive reform of the National Flood Insurance Program.  That is why we are here.   So I think we should be working together. We need the ranking member  and the chairman down the hall in the Senate asking them, why can't  they get their act together? Where is Senator Crapo, where is Senator  Kennedy to read this bill and take into account the incredible work  that we have done on a bipartisan basis here?   So it is very hard for me, Mr. Speaker, to support a 7-day  reauthorization status quo for the eighth time. It is just very hard to  do that because it is not right. We need the reforms that are in this  bill. We need the pressure on the Senate to come up with their own  reforms if they don't like our reforms.   I happen to like our reforms. I like the fact that I see more of what  is happening in Arkansas where we have two private insurers now, Mr.  Speaker, for floods. They cover $2 million instead of $250,000. They  cover replacement cost instead of actual cost. That is the kind of  reforms and progress we can make if we take account of the hard work of  this House and get the Senate to join us in significant flood reform.   So, it is with a lot of regret, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support the  reauthorization of this program for 7 days. We need the Senate to wake  up and take action.
