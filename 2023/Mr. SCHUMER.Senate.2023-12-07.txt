 Mr. President, yesterday morning, Democrats came to the  floor of the Senate to try and pass the assault weapons ban and other  lifesaving gun safety legislation. Sadly, Republicans stood in the way  of the Senate passing lifesaving legislation to get rid of the scourge  of gun violence in America.   Just hours later, we learned of yet another shooting on the campus of  the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Our prayers are with the victims  of the shooting at UNLV and their families, our prayers are with the  students and staff of the university reeling from this horror, and  thanks to the brave law enforcement officers who responded to the  shooting and prevented even more deaths. The pain from these shootings  in these communities never truly fades.            30th anniversary of the long island rail road massacre    Mr. President, I still remember the pain I felt when I first heard  about the Long Island Rail Road massacre which happened in my own  backyard.   Today, December 7, marks 30 years since the Long Island Rail Road  massacre. It is heartbreaking that the horrors of a tragedy 30 years  old still feel like it happened yesterday.   I remember the reports well: the 5:33 p.m. rush hour train from Penn  Station, filled with commuters, average working Americans going home  after a hard day's work to see their families. Moments later, a gunman  unleashed carnage--6 dead, 19 injured. Many more lives were shattered,  changed forever.   Among those killed and injured were the husband and son of Carolyn  McCarthy, a nurse from Mineola. Following the shooting, Carolyn began  to advocate for tougher gun laws. Carolyn understood that something had  to change.   So after Carolyn's Congressman at the time announced he would be  voting to repeal the assault weapons ban that I had championed--I  carried the law in the House--she took matters into her own hands and  ran for a seat in the House and won on that issue. She served in  Congress for 18 years with me  [[Page S5832]]  and many of my colleagues in this building and remained a vocal  advocate for stronger gun safety laws.   So now, in memory of those lost and those injured 30 years ago today  on the 5:33 p.m. Long Island Rail Road train, I ask for this Chamber to  observe a brief moment of silence.   (Moment of silence.)                             Supplemental Funding    Now, Mr. President, last night was a sad moment for the Senate, for  the country, and for our friends in Ukraine and Israel and around the  world. With our values and democracy on the line, Senate Republicans  killed a much needed bill with funding for Ukraine, for Israel, and  humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza, and for the Indo-Pacific.   If there is a word for what we need now most, it is to be serious.  Republicans need to be serious and stop game-playing. It is absurd that  we are even in this situation to begin with.   Let me retrace the steps that got us here and then how we can get out  and get something done.   First, we all know how important Ukraine aid is. Both sides have long  claimed to support it. To quote a recent speech from my friend the  Republican leader, Leader McConnell, ``helping a democratic partner . .  . against an unprovoked attack from a common enemy is obviously in  America's interest.''   In another speech here on the floor, Leader McConnell added that  ``now . . . is not the time to ease up'' on helping Ukraine defending  their sovereignty. Interestingly, he didn't mention anything about the  southern border that day.   Second, it was Republicans who threw an unnecessary wrench into  Ukraine funding by tying it to the extraneous issue of border. We all  agree that border security is important. President Biden included  strong border provisions in the proposal he sent us. But we also know  it is a complicated issue--very complex--that has escaped bipartisan  solution for years.   I am certainly willing to have that difficult conversation. I was a  leader of the Gang of 8 that produced the last real border compromise a  decade ago. But it is not realistic for Republicans to suddenly hold up  Ukraine aid, which they claim to support, and then suddenly demand that  we take up border, which has been a problem for years, and then solve  it in a matter of days. Nevertheless, we Democrats were willing to give  it a try.   And that is my third point. For 3 weeks, Democrats have sat down at  the negotiating table with our Republican counterparts to see if  something on the border was possible. We talked for 3 weeks, and,  actually, negotiations ended up moving backward after Speaker Johnson  said the only thing his Republican caucus would accept was Donald  Trump's extreme border policies as embodied in H.R. 2. So Democrats  tried to negotiate in good faith, but after the Speaker pushed H.R. 2,  talks remained at an impasse.   Fourth, to work our way out of this morass, we Democrats offered our  Republican colleagues a golden opportunity: an offer for a vote on an  amendment on any border policy of their choosing. And all they would  have needed to pass it were 11 Democratic votes. They rejected our  offer.   I must say, it defies credulity for Republicans to demand border,  hold up Ukraine because of the border, and then reject an offer to vote  on a border amendment of their own crafting here on the floor.   It may well be that Republicans can't even agree among themselves on  a proposal. Either way, they rejected our offer and voted down the  bill.   So where are we now that that has happened yesterday? Well, we are  left with only two paths forward to break the logjam: Either  Republicans can take us up on an amendment offer or we can restart  negotiations.   Now, if we are to negotiate, it has to be in good faith. Republicans  need to show they are serious about reaching a compromise--not just  throwing on the floor basically Donald Trump's border policies.   Again, Republicans need to be serious and stop the game-playing. They  have been game-playing when they pushed Donald Trump's radical border  policies, when they said border is the ransom they want, and when they  moved the goalposts during negotiations.   We need to stop playing around and get serious about the immense  challenge in front of us. Both sides must accept that we have to  compromise on things important to each side if we have any hope of  passing the supplemental.   Let me state: We Democrats very much--very much--want an agreement.  We are willing to make compromises and concessions to meet our  Republican colleagues, as long as they are willing to do the same.   Let me conclude, again, with how important this is and with the  warning that the Republican leader issued in recent months that if we  aren't willing to invest in the defense of democracy right now, we are  going to be forced to pay a much higher price down the line. It is  better to defend democracy with American resources today, instead of  American lives tomorrow. That is the danger of allowing brutes like  Vladimir Putin to win the day. So the time is now for us to show the  world we are willing to defend democracy in its hour of need.    Democrats are serious about reaching a reasonable, bipartisan  compromise to pass this security package. The question is if  Republicans are now willing to do the same.                                   Hanukkah    Mr. President, finally, on Hanukkah, Jewish people around the country  and around the world will celebrate tonight the first night of  Hanukkah. This year, more than most years, Hanukkah comes at a moment  of grief, of trial, and of fear for many Jewish Americans. And,  perhaps, for that, it is all the more meaningful. The story of Hanukkah  is a story of perseverance--perseverance in the face of unspeakable  hatred.   We have been taught about how the Jews of a different age--forced  from their land, forbidden to practice their religion, their temple  destroyed and desecrated--gathered to pray in secret, banded together  in the hills and fields, and fought off their attackers. And once they  endured, they set about the hard and slow and painful work of  rededicating the temple and lighting once again the eternal flame of  hope.   I believe that America should do the same thing right now: rededicate  ourselves to that noble promise of being a land of tolerance for all  people--all people. Anti-Semitism, frighteningly, is on the rise.  Islamophobia is on the rise. Hatred and discrimination remain a  festering wound in the soul of our country. We must rededicate  ourselves to stand against anti-Semitism and all forms of  discrimination. We must rededicate ourselves to rebuilding a more  perfect Union, one that preserves tolerance and equality for every  single American.   I have faith that the forces of intolerance will lose in the end,  just as they did in the days of Hanukkah, when Judah Maccabee led the  Jewish people against an oppressive majority.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 410.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, December 7, be waived.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first let me thank Chairman Reed of the  Armed Services Committee for his great leadership, Ranking Member  Wicker, and all the members of the committee and the conferees for  their good work in the past few weeks.   So, in a few moments, I will lay down the NDAA conference report.  There was a lot of hard work on both sides, and we have reached  agreement for this year's Defense authorization bill. It is never  easy--harder now than ever before.   I will file cloture on the NDAA later today. Members can expect to  take votes on this early next week.   At a time of huge trouble for global security, doing the Defense  authorization bill is more important than ever. The annual Defense bill  is a prime example of both sides cooperating on a strong bipartisan  package to strengthen America's national security, to take care of our  servicemembers, and to keep the United States the leader in innovation.   When we began the December session, I said the Senate faces three  important tasks: ending the hold on military nominees, which we did  earlier this week; getting NDAA done, which we are doing today and  early next week; and, then, the biggest and hardest of all is passing  the supplemental.   We want to get that done as well. It is critical. We are going to  keep working.                          Vote on Motion to Proceed    I move to proceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 2670,  the National Defense Authorization Act.   And now I ask for the yeas and nays.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to recommit the conference report to conference  with instructions.    I ask that further reading be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    I have an amendment to the instructions at the desk.    I ask that further reading of the amendment be dispensed  with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask that further reading of the amendment be dispensed  with.    I ask that the mandatory quorum call for the cloture  motion filed today be waived.    I move to proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Executive Calendar No. 352.
