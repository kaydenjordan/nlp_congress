 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, which extends the State Children's Health  Insurance Program, SCHIP, for another 5 years.   In 1997, Congress created S-CHIP in partnership with the States to  meet the healthcare needs of lower income kids. Last year, nearly  100,000 Hoosier kids received health insurance thanks to this critical  program. I am proud that this legislation will continue to protect  vulnerable children in the Eighth District of Indiana.   This bill also extends 2 years of funding for federally qualified  health centers, family-to-family health information centers, and other  important public health programs. This funding provides important  healthcare services, resources, and information for families in the  Eighth District and across America.  [[Page H8461]]    I urge my colleagues to support passage of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY  KIDS Act.
