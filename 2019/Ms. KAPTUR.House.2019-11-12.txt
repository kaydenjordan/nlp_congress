 Mr. Speaker, this week, freedom lovers around the world  celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.   Constructed in 1961, the infamous Berlin Wall symbolized Soviet  brutality and forced separation between liberty and tyranny. Yet, no  wall could contain the persistent surge for liberty by the captive  people of Central and Eastern Europe.   In Poland's shipyards, a workers' solidarity movement, led by  visionary and valiant labor leader Lech Walesa, brought democracy to  the Polish people and millions of others as the Soviet Union collapsed.  [[Page H8777]]    In Leipzig, Germany, 100,000 protestors and their peaceful  demonstrations led to the once-unimaginable reunification of a  civilized Germany.   Yet, as democracy spread, many assumed liberty's work in the region  was done and that the roots of democracy were firmly entrenched.   Tragically, yet again, maligned Russian influence haunts the region  as Putin wages his illegal war in Ukraine, today's scrimmage line for  liberty on the European continent. Outmoded ethno-national narratives  are being fed that, in the past, led to centuries of bloody conflict.   Mr. Speaker, now more than ever, democratic nations must unite so  that liberty, justice, and equality is for all people across our globe.                            ____________________
