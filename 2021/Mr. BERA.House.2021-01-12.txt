 Mr. Speaker, just over a week ago, we all took the oath of  office, all of us, Democrats and Republicans, and part of that oath was  to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, both  foreign and domestic.   It is quite clear what happened last Wednesday: a domestic attack on  our government, a domestic attack on this body. Republicans have  already acknowledged who instigated the attack. The lead instigator was  the President of the United States.   Now it is our solemn duty to uphold that oath, to defend our  Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There is  nothing more solemn than what we have to do.   If my colleagues don't want to invoke the 25th Amendment--that is one  mechanism--we will give you an opportunity tomorrow to impeach the  President. That is our duty. That is what we have to do. Let's uphold  our oath.
