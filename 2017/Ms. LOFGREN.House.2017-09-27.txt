 Mr. Speaker, this Chamber must act to protect DREAMers  now in limbo because of President Trump's decision to end the DACA  program.   DACA recipients are rigorously vetted. They are high-contributing  young people who were brought to this country as children. They are  cherished members of communities across the country, and they are as  American as any of us in all but their paperwork.   President Trump's decision to end the program means that these  inspiring young people stand to lose their futures. Soon they will be  forced out of work and school, faced with the specter of deportation to  nations many of them have no memory of. The President has created a  moral emergency for our country.   This House must allow a vote on a clean Dream Act. It is a bipartisan  bill that gives these young people a real opportunity to get right with  the law and earn a path to legal permanent residence.   We all know that if this bill were put on the floor, it would pass.  The bill deserves a vote. There is no doubt about the public support.   Recent polls from CNN and ABC show that 82 to 86 percent of the  American public supports Dream Act-type legislation; 82 to 86 percent.  There is almost no issue we work on that has that much support from the  American public.
