 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8542, the Mental  Health Justice Act of 2022.   ``In lieu of law enforcement officers in emergencies.'' I am going to  say it again, because that is the exact language used repeatedly in the  bill. ``In lieu of law enforcement officers in emergencies.''   Mr. Speaker, this bill is dangerous. This legislation gives Federal  grants to States, Tribes, and localities to hire mental health  providers to respond to certain emergencies involving an individual  with an intellectual disability or developmental disability; an  individual experiencing a mental health crisis; or an individual under  the influence.   There is nothing wrong with mental health professionals assisting law  enforcement in appropriate circumstances. Communities around the  country are adopting these models with law enforcement, mental health  providers, and prosecutors.   I would be open to supporting legislation limited to training mental  health providers to assist law enforcement in appropriate situations,  but that is not what this bill does.   A sentence in the bill begins by stating that ``mental health  providers may coordinate with law enforcement.'' Sounds acceptable, but  it continues to read, ``which may include operating independently''  from law enforcement.   Let's be clear. The purpose of this legislation is to provide  financial incentives to deploy mental health providers to inherently  dangerous situations in lieu of law enforcement and operating  independently of law enforcement. That is a policy that will endanger  the mental health professional, the suspect, the person experiencing  the mental health crisis, and the person who called 911.   A crime scene or a home experiencing a domestic violence dispute is  not the setting to provide mental health care.   In the first half of 2022, the leading circumstance of law  enforcement officers killed with firearms was in response to domestic  violence calls.   Nobody can confidently tell us they know in advance which domestic  violence call should get a mental health response instead of a law  enforcement response.   Mental health professionals are not trained for the inevitable  physical confrontations that occur in these situations. The priority in  an emergency situation is to secure the scene and all individuals  involved, which is a law enforcement function. Once the scene is  secure, I will be the first person calling for mental health services,  whether it is addiction-related, trauma, or mental illness.   There is a time and a place for mental health care, but it is not  rolling up to a scene without the training and tools to defend yourself  and at-risk civilians. A first responder typically does not have the  time and information to know when it is appropriate to provide mental  health services.   Who are we expecting to make the distinction on mental health? The  911 dispatcher? An elected official inserted into the emergency  dispatch process?   Every additional second layer of bureaucracy will cost lives. The  risks are even greater in rural parts of the country, like my home  State of North Dakota, where backup is often measured in hours, not  minutes.    Ask a mental health provider if they want to be deployed without law  enforcement at 1 a.m. on the side of Highway 85 between Dickinson and  Watford City.   As if the public safety concerns aren't enough, the bill provides  additional financial incentives for the actions that may not be in the  best interest of the individual, the community, or comply with  established laws of the jurisdiction.   The bill provides additional awards for referrals to community-based,  voluntary support services without consideration of the specific needs  and circumstances.   Community-based care could be the appropriate setting, but there are  circumstances where inpatient care or incarceration are simply more  appropriate.   The bill also provides incentives for decarceration rates of certain  groups of individuals. Again, decarceration may make sense at times. I  have advocated for it in lots of circumstances, but it is  [[Page H8083]]  case specific. I have seen it before. Police arrest on a domestic  violence charge, release, and respond to a murder 2 hours later.   These decisions should be made at the local level based on specific  circumstances with State and local input.   This bill attempts to treat the subject of the 911 call with fairness  and dignity. That is something we should all strive toward. The flip  side is that this bill does not account for the person who made the 911  call.   These policies will not work in the real world. It will only make  dangerous situations more dangerous. The unintended consequences of  this bill are extensive, and emergency situations will become more  dangerous than they already are.   This is why we need committee process to work through these  challenging issues. Criminal justice reform is hard. There are lots and  lots of unintended consequences. I have legitimately worked on it my  entire adult life. But my Democratic colleagues skipped that process  because their focus is on frontline elections in the House, not  frontline communities battling rising crime rates.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Pence), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from the National  District Attorneys Association in opposition to this legislation.                                                    National District                                           Attorneys Association,                                 Washington, DC, September 21, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: I am reaching out       on behalf of the National District Attorneys Association       (NDAA), the oldest and largest national organization       representing state and local prosecutors in the country. With       more than 5,500 members nationwide, NDAA is recognized as the       leading source of national expertise on the prosecution       function and is a valuable resource for the media, academia,       government, and community leaders. Today, I write with       concern about H.R. 8542, the Mental Health Justice Act, as       part of the policing package moving through Congress.        NDAA is strongly supportive of increasing funding for our       partner law enforcement agencies, implementing new grants       focused on reducing community violence, and assisting       investigators in solving cold cases to better support victims       of violent crime. However, prosecutors have significant       concerns about the fourth legislative proposal which would       establish new grants to ``hire, employ, train, and dispatch       mental health professionals to respond in lieu of law       enforcement officers in emergencies.''        Currently, law enforcement, prosecutors, and mental health       professionals across the country are proactively and       organically forming multidisciplinary teams and engaging in       the co-responder model to better handle incidents involving       individuals suffering from mental health crises. For example,       jurisdictions have paired law enforcement officers, mental       health clinicians, and community advocates together when       responding to an individual's mental health emergency called       into a 911 dispatcher. This partnership is the first line of       response and is then followed by coordination on the back end       between additional health professionals and prosecutors to       ensure a plan can be enacted to provide the individual in       crisis with a plan of rehabilitation that also ensures there       is no public safety risk to the community. The language in       the Mental Health Justice Act would undermine these       collaborative efforts which have been shown to reduce violent       crime, limit harm to responding law enforcement officers, and       improve community trust in the criminal justice system.        Further, the legislation takes unprecedented steps to       impose new grant conditions that require mental health       professionals and community grantees to decrease       incarceration and restrict partnership with law enforcement       agencies. NDAA has long stated that any diversion or       rehabilitation program, such as those led by co-responder       teams, must include tools to ensure consequences are imposed       if there are incidents of re-offending by the individual       receiving treatment. Local communities are best suited to       decide which models work best and these onerous new       requirements could restrict or discourage programs from       forming that serve the dual purpose of rehabilitation and       community safety. These new conditions would undermine this       principal and require our mental health partners to create       new barriers between law enforcement and the clinical       professionals working together to improve our Nation's       response to ongoing mental health emergencies.        For these reasons, NDAA urges the House of Representatives       to strongly reconsider including the Mental Health Justice       Act as part of the important police funding package moving       through the chamber. We thank you for your tireless efforts       to improve the criminal justice system and look forward to       working alongside you and your staff to ensure law       enforcement and the mental health community have the tools       needed to keep our communities safe.            Sincerely,                                                     John J. Flynn,                                                    NDAA President.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close. The only time you know a traffic stop is routine is when it is  over. The only time you know it is only a mental health service call is  after the scene is secure.   Far too often, and more complicated, are addiction-related issues and  mental health-related issues, but none of those preclude the fact that  a weapon is there or domestic violence has occurred.   When you continue to coordinate this stuff for cash-strapped  departments across the country with decarceration, you will have real  consequences.   For well over 25 years, victims' rights groups have fought all across  this country to get domestic violence offenders held for the weekend on  misdemeanor charges, and there are reasons for that. You need them to  sober up; you need everybody to cool off; and victims need the  opportunity to get out of the house.   These bills do nothing to do any of those things. These bills will  make communities more dangerous from one end of the country to the  other.   This bill sounds really good. Cooperation, coordination, all of those  words sound fantastic. I will be the first one championing mental  health and addiction services to anybody in lieu of custody, in lieu of  prison, in lieu of jail time, but I want to do it after the scene is  secure and we know there is no weapon onsite and nobody is in danger,  when we know the victim is not in danger, the community is not in  danger, and the person who is experiencing addiction, mental health,  whatever crisis it is, is not in danger.   This bill doesn't do that. This bill does the opposite of that. We  should reject it and get back to work on the hard work of passing  reasonable, real, strong criminal justice reform.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
