 Madam Speaker, I rise to share the facts and give an  update on what is happening in the Jammu Kashmir region. Jammu Kashmir  was given special treatment in the Constitution of 1947 in India. It  was created by the ``Temporary Provisions with Respect to the State of  Jammu Kashmir.'' It is known as article 370.   It was supposed to be a stop-gap measure because the government had  not been formed yet. For 70 straight years, this temporary article has  forced citizens of Jammu Kashmir to live under different laws than all  other Indians; different rules for citizenship, property ownership.   Earlier this year, the Indian Parliament confirmed that article 370's  temporary status should end. It ended. It gave the people of Jammu  Kashmir the same rights as all Indians. It was a landslide, 125-to-61  in the Rajya Sabha and 370-to-70 in the Lok Sabha. This action is  solely about equality for all Indians.   Hopefully, this can be a step toward peace in Kashmir.                            ____________________
