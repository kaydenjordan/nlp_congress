 Mr. President, as the new year began, an  exceptional life tragically ended. The State of Arkansas lost a  powerful voice and community leader when Qubilah Jones passed away, age  45, after a 14-year battle against lymphedema.   Qubilah was born in Corpus Christi, TX, but her legacy and her heart  are in Jonesboro, AR. Qubilah was a daily companion to countless  Arkansans as the host of KLEK's ``Community Conversations,'' a morning  show where she interviewed hundreds of leaders about faith, government,  and community involvement.   Qubilah had a God-given gift for words, and she was a relentless  advocate for northeast Arkansas. She was a pillar of her church, New  Mount Zion Baptist Church, where she produced the church newspaper. She  was a curious soul who returned to education later in life, put in the  work, and ultimately earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from  Arkansas State University and Grand Canyon University. She was the  driving force behind community celebrations such as KLEK's award- winning Juneteenth in Jonesboro Celebration. She was a proud and active  alumna of her sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. And perhaps above all, she  was a loving mother to her son, Quante Jeffrey.   For these accomplishments, and for the more than 2,000 hours of  community service that Qubilah performed, the city of Jonesboro named  her Volunteer of the Year in 2017.   More incredible still, Qubilah accomplished these things while  battling lymphedema, an incurable disease that slowly sapped her  mobility and strength. She spoke often on her radio show and podcast  about living with a serious illness, providing advice and consolation  to those who had their own cross to bear. But even as the disease took  its toll on her body, it could not wipe away her warm smile or  infectious laughter. Qubilah's sister, Gwen  [[Page S145]]  Henderson, put it well: ``as she declined in mobility, she never  declined in spirit.''   Qubilah's battle against disease set her up for one last act of  service--one of her greatest. After witnessing the suffering that  lymphedema can cause, she became a restless and passionate advocate for  the Lymphedema Treatment Act, a bill to ensure that compression  treatment items essential to managing the disease are covered by  Medicare. I was proud to cosponsor that bill, along with 73 of my  Senate colleagues. And on December 23, just 1 week before Qubilah  passed from this life, that bill became law. Countless Americans  suffering from lymphedema will get needed relief as a result. It is yet  another part of Qubilah's extraordinary legacy of service.   The city of Jonesboro, the State of Arkansas, the U.S. Senate, and  all those touched by Qubilah's words and deeds mourn the loss of the  ``Voice of Jonesboro.'' May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
