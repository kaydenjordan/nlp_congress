 Mr. Speaker, I first want to indicate my  appreciation to President Biden and Secretary Walsh, for, yes, diving  in and stopping a union worker/freight industry collision and  understanding the importance of providing benefits to our hard workers.   Yesterday, at the Teamsters, I indicated how important it is that  workers have benefits, and the ability to go to the doctor. That is the  fight that we must continue. I am glad it has been derailed, but we  need to continue to fight to get a permanent solution for our workers.   I rise today as well, Mr. Speaker, to introduce and acknowledge the  SHIELD Act, to shield doctors and nurses and other reproductive  healthcare providers from harassment, litigation, and draconian laws. I  ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation that would  protect pregnant people and the medical personnel who provide  reproductive healthcare services to them and will prevent interference,  restriction, and retaliation against doctors, nurses, nurse midwives,  nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others who evaluate,  diagnose, advise, treat, or provide other services in order to protect  them, to give healthcare, and to stop women from standing outside the  door of doctors' offices and not getting care. I ask my colleagues to  support the SHIELD Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is a devastating time for the  people of Pakistan.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to share this with my colleagues and to ensure  that their story is in the public eye because it is a story that  addresses devastation like you have never seen before. I guess the  story that is so devastating is the 600,000 women who are on the verge  of giving birth in conditions that are so devastating.   The week of September 2, members of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus  made their way as quickly as they could to the rain-torn, flood-torn  region of Pakistan. We arrived on Sunday morning and immediately were  able to secure a transport into the flooded areas.   As the government indicated, this is not overflowing rivers, this is  sheer rain that generated into flooding. In the Sindh region,  Balochistan, the southwestern region--sheer rain turned into floods  that were unspeakable.   The water was unspeakable, it was of biblical proportion. The size  and the width and the depth was unspeakable. It was a monstrosity. We  took an aerial survey. You could not see land. It was only water as far  as the eye could see.    In fact, tragically and unfortunately, we could imagine that whole  communities were covered with water, that bodies are yet unfound. Even  though the death toll is upwards of 1200 to 1300, with one-third or  more of those being children. Can you imagine seeing the video of the  currents rushing and tearing children away from desperate parents'  hands or families being caught in the current and children being pulled  away by the rushing waters?   We saw, as was displayed by the government, whole buildings and  hotels coming down to the ground. There were 200 bridges destroyed and  water going through those bridges. We could, of course, see that it was  irreparable harm. Even as we were surveying we saw a bridge that was  breached, which divided people that were on that one little line of  bridge as their safety net because they were surrounded by water, and  then they were separated because the bridge broke in half because the  water was so powerful.   In the midst of that, we got a report that military forces had to  flood towns of 250,000 people. They had to flood towns so that a city  of 1.1 million people could survive. We landed in the city of Dadu, and  there are now 400,000 homeless people in Dadu. Overwhelmed. There are  600,000-plus homeless people in Pakistan.   I know that America is a Nation that has always extended its generous  arm. If there is ever a moment--as we have done around the world in  earthquakes--Pakistan's earthquake of 2005 and floods of 2010--as we  have done around the world when the nations around the world have  fallen upon disastrous times.   As a Member of Congress, I went into that horrific tsunami that  impacted Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, you could not recognize  those nations. The tsunami had come and taken out all of the coastal  land. People were drawn into the sea, and you never saw them again.  Houses were destroyed. The United States joined with the United Nations  and was there to help.   The United States has helped when there have been issues of national  health crisis, we have been there. We became the leading guardians of  fighting HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa.   I do want to applaud the Biden administration on being the first  donor of the United Nation's call for help for Pakistan, $30 million.  Just as we were leaving--after we had petitioned the Federal  Government--they came with an extra $20 million.   More importantly, as I left to go to Pakistan, writing President  Biden about the issue of shelter and tents, the United States military  dropped or delivered 300,000 tents on Wednesday or Thursday of last  week to be delivered to homeless and helpless persons.   The Pakistani-American community have been outstanding, working with  consul generals across America and the Ambassador. They are now raising  funds, upwards of millions of dollars. But it is not enough.   First, Pakistan probably has $10 billion in damages and destruction,  but that number has been characterized as low because the water has not  been able to drain because there is no drainage. That means that that  water not being able to drain that damage will be caused and go on and  on and on. I am afraid of dengue fever, waterborne diseases, hepatitis,  malaria, with no medications.   While we were there we met a family that had just been plucked out of  the waters. Their dad had a kidney transplant, who had not yet received  his medicine--everything lost. We were able to press upon the  military's generosity and good heart to get him his medicine and get it  to where he is--out in an area where I saw no medical facilities.   I want the Record to know that even though this country is many miles  away, we are connected by its democratic beginnings. This is the 75th  anniversary of its independence. It has by and large had peaceful  transfers of government, a frequent government, but a democratic  government. The founding father, Dr. Jinnah, established this country-- as India was established by Gandhi in its independence--that it should  have as its form of government democracy.   I am fearful of the loss of life and children and disease will set  this country back for many, many, many years.   Let me share with you this story.   The hospital has nothing. Pakistani floods put pregnant women in  danger. Just 2 days ago this article from the Guardian came out. A  third of the country is under water, and a U.N. fund says almost  650,000 women in affected areas need maternity services. That should  give you an amazing level of fear--650,000.                                time  1800    I visit hospitals because I am an advocate for hospitals,  particularly in rural areas. And they tell me, well, we have delivered  3,000 births in a month, and I applaud that. That is a high number here  in the United States.   But I want to say this again. The U.N. says almost 650,000 women in  affected areas need maternity services to have healthy babies.   Crying, vomiting, and 8 months pregnant--I know that wives and  Members of Congress, women Members of Congress, women across America,  can understand the fragility of a woman during her pregnancy. The young  woman walked in labor pains for an hour in search of an ambulance. She  wasn't driven. She wasn't on a bicycle. She wasn't on a cart. She  wasn't on any form of scooter, any form of transportation.   When Naseeba, 23, eventually found one, she had to beg the driver to  take her. Pakistan floods had left the roads damaged and gridlocked,  making what is usually a 2-hour journey to the provincial capital of  Quetta a punishing 12-hour drive; 2 hours to 12 hours.   She left her flood-ravaged home in Nasirabad district in Balochistan  province in the morning and reached Quetta at night.   During this time, I didn't know what has happening around me;  struggling to speak. When I finally reached the hospital, the doctors  said I would not survive if they didn't operate immediately.  Complications with labor, including severe high blood pressure, meant  doctors had to rush to deliver the baby.   I would venture to say that this was a circumstance of life and  death.   Complications with the labor continued. And Naseeba said she gave  birth to a baby boy 2 days ago, but the doctors told her that the baby  requires to be incubated, but there were no incubators available, so we  had to take her baby to my mother's place, she said. I haven't seen my  baby yet.   We can only hope that that baby survived, and that the help at home  might have helped that baby breathe.   Naseeba is one of the thousands of pregnant women, according to the  United Nations Population Fund, who will bear the brunt of the worst  floods in Pakistan and are in desperate need of maternal health  services.   And so I will be asking USAID and the head of that agency, who I am  very gratified, was visiting Pakistan as we were visiting--as we were  leaving, USAID was coming on the ground. As  [[Page H7875]]  we were there, we received a briefing from USAID, and the very schools  that USAID, our humanitarian arm of the State Department, built in that  region, became the shelters for people. But that means the children are  not in school.   More than a dozen women who were interviewed in this story, were  pregnant, or had already given birth in the worst flood-affected  provinces of Balochistan and Sindh, women who said they have been  abandoned without healthcare, food, and clean drinking water to meet  their nutritional needs.   We should be very clear. A third of Pakistan is under water, with  1,400 dead, most children, and 33 million people affected, as the  country has been ravaged by monsoon-triggered floods, coming at a  totally unique time. In our briefings, they said, we have dealt with  monsoons. These are like we have never seen.   The impact on climate change should not be lost. This is clear  evidence of how stark it is. UNFPA said 73,000 women were expected to  give birth this month--that is this month of September--who need  skilled birth attendants, newborn care, and support. It estimates, as I  said, that 650,000 pregnant women in flood-affected areas require  maternal health.   Again, people living in plastic tents or camps on roadsides, near  flood waters, and the homes of millions of people have been swept away.   It is well-known that the health facilities across Pakistan are  affected; 432 are fully damaged; 1,228 are partially damaged.   Another woman, Rubina, who is 8 months pregnant, in this Guardian  story, and currently lives in a tent on a roadside, said she had  pregnancy-related complications that included body aches and anemia.  She said medications prescribed by doctors were not available, and she  could not afford to buy them from a private hospital. They did whatever  they could for her, her husband and brother.   They have lost their source of earnings and cannot provide us with  anything else; and the government hospital has nothing.   This is the story of thousands. This is not a story that is going to  end. It is a story that is going to continue.   Another woman had delivered on her way as she was walking to the  hospital, and the infant was brought into the hospital via ambulance,  but the woman couldn't come because of the high level of water.   Many women could not even come to the hospital, and midwives had to  be called.   We are doing all that we can.   And this is a call out to our American humanitarian agencies, as I  indicated. Healthcare is the most crucial, along with food, and it is  clearly an urgent emergency condition.   One young woman left her home after it was submerged in flood water  in the Sindh province. And as I said, many people are living in schools  built by the United States. This young woman gave birth to a baby girl  named Shamma, which means light. We get food sometimes, but not at  other times. I am unable to feed my infant because I am so weak. And  so, baby formula is needed because women are not able to breastfeed.   Roshan, another displaced woman who had given birth a month ago:  Everyone is falling sick here. I feel faint. I have constant headaches.  Our children do not have clothes. There is only one piece of cloth for  my newborn that I wash every day to use again.   And UNFPA has warned that many women and girls are at increased risk  of gender-based violence as almost one million houses were damaged in  the catastrophic floods. I am convinced that that is another crisis.   As Samina, who took refuge, along with thousands of other pregnant  women, in Larkana said, there can be no greater pain than having to  leave your home. I cannot tell you how difficult it was to leave. I am  expecting a baby soon, but in a state of homelessness.   The government is working very hard to try and reach these persons  but, in the midst, they face a financial crisis which they are working  very hard to try to cure with work with the World Bank and, of course,  with the International Monetary Fund. But it is not going to be enough.   And so, our visit, we are grateful, highlighted the crisis which is  being faced. It was a visit covered with a desire to be as quick on  humanitarian aid as we could, and to bring the story forward as to what  is transpiring.   In addition, we wanted to make sure that those who could not get back  to their province and are here in the United States could secure a  temporary protected status because of the devastation of their country.  We hope, joined with Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, that our request will  be given reasonable consideration.   As I indicated, as I started, we are dealing with an extreme climate  change, horrible exhibition of the devastation that could come about.  It is extreme. The reasons for the flooding are linked to climate  change and the resulting extreme weather.   It is important to note that Pakistan produces only about 1 percent  of the pollution, the carbon footprint linked to global warming; while  we, in the United States, produce 11 percent; China, 27 percent; India  produces 6.6 percent, and the EU, 6.4 percent.   But researchers say the catastrophe probably started with  unprecedented heat waves because, in April and May, temperatures  reached above 104 degrees in Pakistan for sustained periods in many  places in the region.   In fact, when we were briefed by the head of the climate agency, they  said that temperatures went up as high as 127 degrees Fahrenheit. Those  are killing temperatures. On one sweltering day in May, the city,  Jacobabad, topped 123.8 degrees. This is not normal. This area is not  accustomed to heat like this. And recorded as the hottest place on  Earth was in Pakistan.   The intense heat also melted glaciers in the northern mountainous  regions. And now many would wonder, glaciers? Yes.   One of the other places in the world where glaciers are are the  mountains in Pakistan. And so when those glaciers, those northern  mountainous regions, increasing the amount of water flowing into  tributaries that eventually made their way into the Indus River,  compounded by the rain--the Indus is Pakistan's largest river and runs  the country's length, from north to south, feeding towns, cities, and  large swatches of agricultural land along the way.   But let me add something else because Pakistan is an agricultural  country, and the largest percentage of work in Pakistan is agriculture.  The region where the flooding took place was where they grew one of  their most bountiful products, and that is wheat.   The farmers managed to gather their wheat and to store them in their  homes, preparing for the market, or preparing for next year. But the  floods came and wiped away their homes and their food source and the  moneys that they would get from selling. But even more devastating,  this may go on for years because they lost their seeds.   So imagine that: Mighty waters flowing down from the glaciers,  melting because of this unusual heat, this out-of-the-world heat; then  rivers overflow, but then add to the monsoon or monsoons, and then, of  course, the flooding that has taken away millions of homes, impacted 33  million people, and taken away their food.   We, as Americans, have faced our levels of disaster. Our heart goes  out to the people in Eastern Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Eastern  Kentucky; Central Mississippi; Dallas, Texas; Death Valley, California;  and this does not include the thousand-year flood events that impacted,  in recent years, New York and New Jersey.   We should be well-aware of the impact of climate change. And I am  very gratified that I have seen my constituents in the energy industry  face up to this and realize that the carbon footprint must come down,  down, down. I want to continue to work with them as they recognize that  it will be a disaster if we do not work, both nationally and  internationally, on stopping the carbon footprint and addressing the  question internationally and nationally of the question of climate  change.   The rains in Pakistan have resulted in unimaginable changes in the  landscape. Reports are backed up by new images taken by NASA's MODIS.  Satellite sensors show the result of heavy rain and an overflowing  Indus River that has formed a 62-mile lake in the Sindh province where  there was farmland. In this region, the monsoon rainfall has been 500  percent over average.  [[Page H7876]]    Let me try to lay this out for you. I indicated the Indus River is  the natural river. But the leaders of government explained, it was not  the Indus River that overflowed its banks and caused the damage miles  away from its banks; though there are many Pakistanis who live on the  bank because it is the source of their food, source of their income,  source of their livelihood.   But what the NASA's MODIS showed us is that an unnatural lake was  created by the huge monsoons, the glaciers melting, and created an  unnatural lake that formed a 62-mile lake in the Sindh province where  there was farmland, so where there had not been any water before.                                time  1815    They also told us that the area that we were in, the Sindh province,  did not receive a lot of rain, which speaks to the reason why they had  no drainage. They did not have a lot of rain.   The issues of the day caused the Indus River to be an ocean. You  could see no start and stop. Then, it caused a man-made lake to occur  that would, in fact, be there enough of a time to, in fact, continue to  be devastating.   Let me give you some facts that have not been gone over. This began  in mid-June 2022, at the beginning of the monsoon season, which, as I  said, there have been monsoons, but these were a monstrosity,  unbelievable proportions.   Heavy rains began flooding areas of Pakistan. Estimates range from  double to several times the normal monsoon rain. They were just sitting  and waiting. Is it going to end? Is it going to end? Mr. Speaker, 6.4  million estimated people requiring humanitarian assistance--again, 33  million people affected: 44 percent Sindh province, 28 percent  Balochistan, 13 percent in Khyber, 50 percent in Punjab.   As of September 13, just shortly after we came and left, 1,396 people  have been killed, and, of course, 12,278 people have been injured as a  result of the flooding. We don't know if people will die of their  injuries.   More than 900,000 livestock have been killed, and there are people  today, right as we stand here, who are refusing to leave because they  have their livestock, and there is no place for them to go.   Mr. Speaker, 3.1 million people have been displaced. I have already  indicated that there are hundreds of thousands that are homeless-- 650,000 people, women needing maternal services, on the verge of giving  birth, but 70,000 are giving birth this month. This is, without  question, a challenge that far surpasses the capacity of the Pakistan  Government, although willing, to be able to do this on their own.   The climate minister told a public radio interview that an area the  size of Colorado is now submerged, that 66 districts, equivalent to a  county, are underwater. According to satellite imagery, the flooding  has created, as I indicated already, this huge lake.   Pakistan is equipped with water pumps to respond to monsoons and  helicopters for rescue purposes, but there is no place to send the  resources.   Again, I do want to note that the Pakistani Government has been  working with the resources they have--147 camps for populations  displaced by the floods. Cash assistance was being organized to give to  the families.   The Pakistani Government has allocated $173 million to aid flood- affected people. On August 30, the United Nations and the Government of  Pakistan launched a joint flood response plan, and the United States,  as I said, was the first to give the funding from all other countries.   They gathered $160 million for food security assistance, agriculture,  livestock, shelter, nonfood items, non-nutrition programs, primary  health services, water and sanitation, and shelter for displaced  persons. It is not enough, and there are people that cannot be reached.   Money is also coming from the various elected officials, like the  Prime Minister, the Central Emergency Response Fund, the World Bank,  the Asian Development Bank, the European Commission's department for  European Civil Protection, and UNICEF. Governments from around the  world have made an effort to help, but I believe it is going to be  important for the United States to raise its voice again.   As I said, the United States has always been there, and I am very  glad to say that 1.4 million pounds of USAID relief commodities were  airlifted to Pakistan by CENTCOM, $4 million in dedicated aid from the  U.S. Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance.   As I indicated, 300,000 tents--30 million had already been given on  the very day, August 30, that the United Nations asked for. CENTCOM has  operated nine flights transporting USAID items, including approximately  30,000 kitchen sets, 10,000 plastic tarps, 1,400 rolls of plastic  sheeting from USAID's warehouse.   Again, 300,000 tents after the Pakistan Caucus had engaged and worked  with the administration that I am very glad to say came forward. Then  an additional $20 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the  flooding was announced on September 9.   I do thank, again, USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who announced  this effort, and we hope that this will continue.   As noted in The Washington Post, the ``U.S. ramps up aid for Pakistan  floods with military airlift.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Washington Post article of  September 9, 2022, and the article from the Guardian dealing with the  plight of a pregnant woman.                 [From the Washington Post, Sept. 9, 2022]        U.S. Ramps Up Aid for Pakistan Floods With Military Airlift         Dadu, Pakistan.--The United States is ramping up support       for Pakistan and beginning a days-long military airlift into       the country as it struggles to battle devastating floods that       are expected to take years to recover from.        The military began airlifting supplies into Pakistan this       week as part of the additional $20 million the Biden       administration is providing for humanitarian aid here,       Samantha Power, the head of the U.S. Agency for International       Development, announced on Friday.        The announcement comes as it is increasingly clear that       Pakistan is incapable of providing even the most basic relief       to the more than 33 million people affected by the crisis.       The majority of those who have fled their homes are living in       makeshift shelters, and many report they are not receiving       food, clean drinking water or medical attention.        The airlift will establish a ``beachhead'' inside       Pakistan's flood zone, Power said during a visit to affected       areas Thursday. She said the plan is to begin staging       operations closer to those in need so humanitarian supplies       can be distributed more efficiently.        ``It may go beyond this, but for now we are looking at       shelter supplies to accommodate 300,000 people,'' she said.       She admitted the number is a small fraction of those       affected, but hoped other countries would follow suit and       move operations inside Sindh province, one of the worst hit       areas.        The airlift is expected to last just over a week with two       to three U.S. C-17s--massive cargo planes--landing daily in       Sukkur, a town in Sindh province nearly encircled by       floodwaters. The planes will bring tens of thousands of       pounds of tents, field rations and kitchen sets into the       country.        While a number of countries have pledged millions of       dollars in humanitarian aid money to Pakistan, aid groups on       the ground are struggling to source the materials they need       and reach the worst-affected parts of the country.        Floodwaters moving south are cutting off key roads and       highways, turning towns into islands and blocking the       delivery of aid.        Power said she hopes the assistance will also help reset       perceptions of the United States in Pakistan.        ``I think during the war in Afghanistan, there was an       impression among some Pakistanis that the U.S. saw Pakistan       only through the prism of Afghanistan,'' she said.       ``Hopefully this is a chance through this cooperation [with       the Pakistani government] to strengthen the relationship       between the two countries.''        U.S.-Pakistan relations have gone through periods of       intense strain, despite decades-long humanitarian and       military ties that predate the U.S. presence in Afghanistan.       The enmity that many Pakistanis feel toward the United States       was clearly visible earlier this year when former Pakistani       leader Imran Khan began to strengthen his base of support by       claiming his ouster was part of a U.S.-backed conspiracy.        Although anti-Americanism remains a popular rallying cry in       Pakistan, the government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz       Sharif, who replaced Khan, has moved to improve relations       with the United States.        The U.S. military's top commander, Army Gen. Michael Erik       Kurilla, visited Pakistan in August and acknowledged the       country's ``commendable efforts in fight against terrorism''       and its ``efforts [to promote] regional peace and       stability,'' according to a Pakistani military statement.        The visit came shortly after the killing of Ayman al-      Zawahiri, the leader of alQaeda, in a U.S. drone attack on       his Kabul residence. The Taliban condemned the attack and       accused Pakistan of allowing the United States to use its       airspace to fly drones over Afghanistan. Pakistani       authorities refuted the Taliban's allegations.        ``The partnership that we continue to deepen builds on       years of cooperation between  [[Page H7877]]       our two peoples and between our two countries,'' Power said       at a news conference in Islamabad Friday.        During Power's visit to the heart of Pakistan's flood zone,       she asked local officials and families affected by the floods       to estimate the disaster's long-term economic effects, in       particular those linked to the loss of crops, livestock and       infrastructure.        It is clear that recovery from these historic floods will       require a concerted effort by the donor community and       international financial institutions for the coming years,''       Power said. The support announced Friday, she continued, ``is       another mark of our long-standing commitment to the Pakistani       people.''                                   ____                     [From the Guardian, Sept. 13, 2022]    `The Hospital has Nothing': Pakistan's Floods Put Pregnant Women in                                   Danger         A third of the country is under water and a UN fund says       almost 650,000 women in affected areas need maternity       services.        Crying, vomiting and eight months pregnant, the young woman       walked in labour pains for an hour in search of an ambulance.        When Naseeba Ameerullah, 23, eventually found one, she had       to beg the driver to take her. Pakistan's floods had left the       roads damaged and gridlocked, making what is usually a two-      hour journey to the provincial capital of Quetta a punishing,       12-hour drive.        She left her flood-ravaged home in the Naseerabad district       in Balochistan province in the morning and reached Quetta at       night.        ``During this time, I didn't know what was happening around       me,'' said Ameerullah, struggling to speak. ``When I finally       reached the hospital, the doctors said I would not survive if       they didn't operate immediately.''        Complications with the labour, including severe high blood       pressure, meant doctors had to rush to deliver the baby.        ``I gave birth to a baby boy two days ago but the doctors       told us that the baby requires to be incubated but there were       no incubators available so we had to take my baby to my       mother's place. I haven't seen my baby yet,'' she said.        Ameerullah is one of the thousands of pregnant women,       according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), who       will bear the brunt of the worst floods in Pakistan and are       in desperate need of maternal health services.        The Guardian interviewed more than a dozen women who were       either pregnant or had already given birth in the worst       flood-affected provinces of Balochistan and Sindh; women who       said they have been abandoned without healthcare, food and       clean drinking water to meet their nutritional needs.        A third of Pakistan is under water, with at least 1,400       dead and more than 33 million people affected, as the country       has been ravaged by monsoon-triggered floods washing away       bridges, roads, livestock and people.        UNFPA said 73,000 women were expected to give birth this       month who would need skilled birth attendants, newborn care,       and support. It estimates that almost 650,000 pregnant women       in flood-affected areas require maternal health services to       ensure a safe pregnancy and childbirth.        The floods have brought other health dangers as well, such       as a rise in diseases that affect young children.        On a drive from Larkana to Dadu districts in Sindh province       to Jaffarabad and Naseerabad districts in Balochistan, people       could be seen living in plastic tents or camps on roadsides       near the flood waters because the homes of millions of people       had been swept away.        Across Pakistan, more than 1,460 health facilities are       affected, of which 432 are fully damaged and 1,028 are       partially damaged and access to health facilities, healthcare       workers, and essential medicines and medical supplies is       limited, according to the World Health Organization.        Rubina, a woman who is eight months pregnant and currently       lives in a tent on a roadside in Jaffarabad, said she had       pregnancy-related complications that included body aches and       anaemia.        She said medications prescribed by doctors were not       available and she could not afford to buy them from a private       hospital.        ``My husband and brother did whatever was possible in their       capacity. They have lost their source of earnings and cannot       provide us with anything else and the government hospital in       Jaffarabad has nothing,'' said Rubina.        Dr Sultan Ahmed Lehri, the medical superintendent of Bolan       medical complex hospital in Quetta, said there had always       been nutritional deficiencies in pregnant women in many       districts in Balochistan, and the existing situation would       get worse because of the floods.        ``If steps are not taken by the government this can turn       into a huge crisis. The government needs to work on this       issue on a war footing and reach out to women and the broader       population,'' said Lehri        He added: ``We are witnessing heavy mental toll and trauma       of the floods on women as well. We need to treat that as       well.''        Haseena, another pregnant woman who lives in a tent close       to Rubina, said she required blood because she was anaemic       and that there were many others like her.        ``We don't get any medicine here and food so how can we       expect to get blood transfusions? We drink water from the       rivers where animals are dead,'' she said.        And while thousands of men and women live in tents on the       roadside, there are no toilets.        ``This a tragedy which we can't even talk about,'' Haseena       said.        Dr Imran Baloch, a medical superintendent in Jaffarabad,       said a lot of women gave birth in cars and on roads, and some       on the way to the hospital because the roads were broken,       making the journey much longer. There were also cases of       premature deliveries.        ``A woman had delivered on the way as she was walking to       the hospital and the infant was brought to the hospital via       ambulance but the woman couldn't come because of the high       level of water. Many women could not even come to the       hospital and midwives had to be called. We are doing what we       can.''        An official in Balochistan, requesting anonymity, said:       ``We have seen a shortage of medicines in many flood-affected       regions, but I fear it may get worse if not tackled soon and       it will affect women, children and the entire population.''        The situation is almost the same in Sindh as in       Balochistan. Durnaz Soz Ali, 22, left her house after it was       submerged in floodwater in Qambar Shahdadkot in Sindh       province.        Ali, who now lives in Larkana in a school with hundreds of       displaced people, said: ``I was nine months pregnant and even       in my pregnant state, I carried some of the belongings and       walked for hours.''        Ali gave birth to a baby girl and named her Shamma, which       means light. ``We get food sometimes but not at other times.       I am unable to feed my infant because I am weak.''        Roshan, another displaced woman from Qambar Shahdadkot who       had given birth a month ago in Larkana, said: ``Everyone is       falling sick here. I feel faint and have constant headaches.       Our children do not have clothes. There is only one piece of       cloth for my newborn that I wash every day to use again.''        UNFP A has warned that many women and girls are at       increased risk of gender-based violence as almost 1 million       houses were damaged in the catastrophic floods.        Samina, in Sindh province, who took refuge along with       thousands of other pregnant women in Larkana, said: ``There       can be no greater pain than having to leave your home. I can       not tell you how difficult it was to leave. I am expecting a       baby soon but in a state of homelessness.''     Let me show you what people are facing and how  people are struggling, and this is, as someone would say, with your own  eyes.   These little, small pieces here, those are human beings. This was  their refuge. This is water. This is water as far as the eye can see.  They were making a life, barely, on a bridge. That was the only dry  land.   I can see they were on both sides, but they were able to get notice  to run on this side so that they could be together, but they are  stranded as this water breaks the bridge. It breaks the bridge. Water  as far as the eye can see.   This is what we saw. These are not little bushes in a lake. These are  the tops of trees, the green that you see. Most of the land is covered.  Some people are stranded on these little patches of land. It looks like  a beautiful, blue ocean, no land, and the fear of what is under this  massive ocean.   As I said earlier, there are pumps in normal times because there is  no normal draining, but there is absolutely no ability to deal with  something as massive as this. It is speculated that it will not come  down for another 6 months--stagnant water, disease, raging across  Pakistan.   This is just to let us look at a little bit of dry land in Dadu,  working with the military, giving out food items to an elderly woman  without food resources and a little child looking up, babies in hands  who are obviously in need of resources.   It was an emotional time for the Pakistan Caucus and the Members who  were there showing our love and affection because we want people to see  the leadership that has worked to establish dry land and to try and  work without resources for their community.   The face of this little one tells it all. There are no schools. There  is not much food, and there is not much housing. You could not have a  dry eye in watching the conditions of our fellow human beings.   We gave out food, but we gave out little lollipops to the children. I  will tell you, they were clamoring for that more than anything else.  But that is what I think is our biggest concern, between mothers having  provisions for giving birth and feeding these little ones.   I asked one little boy, does he want to go to school. There are no  schools in that region. The schools that, as I said, were built by  USAID were, in fact, used to ensure that there is shelter. We need more  tents. We need more healthcare. It was interesting. The heat was  extensive and intensive while we were there.   In my conversations, it was so good to be able to maybe not speak  with language that we both understood but  [[Page H7878]]  with the gesture of welcoming and appreciating their plight as we were  giving out food gifts to people who had nothing.   It is a moment in history that I did not want our colleagues to miss,  and it is a recognition that we have work to do. I wanted our  colleagues to help me and to help us find a way to be constructive, so  I used a number of $10 billion.   We have gone way beyond that, as I indicated. The economic impact of  the floods is now estimated to be at least $30 billion as of September  13, 2022--just the difference from when we went at the beginning of  September of $10 billion and even as we were in meetings, all the  government officials were surmising that it had to be more. You can't  displace 33 million and it is only $10 billion. An estimated 2 billion  of crops and livestock could be lost due to flooding.                                time  1830    Remember what I said. The region is a lifeline for Pakistan and for  their product that they might be able to provide to other destinations.  They lost 30 percent of their rice crop and 70 percent of their cotton  crop, the country's third largest export, making up 11.8 percent of the  country's total export. That is income; that is opportunity. Ten  percent of the sugarcane, lost. Estimates show that 800 million in  textile exports would be lost, 3.6 million acres of crops have been  affected, according to Pakistan authorities, and 735,000 livestock have  perished. These are numbers coming from Pakistan.   Food is still needed. This is going to be a long, long journey. It is  difficult to see this, but let me try and bring this to the attention  of my colleagues.   The red area says 4 million children are under 5 years old, and this  red that you can see shows that these are severely impacted areas. This  takes up a very large part of the country. Seven hundred thousand  people 65 and older are impacted. Five hundred thousand women are  currently pregnant. Those numbers have gone up, I know.   Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record the Pakistan Floods Report  from September 2022.                       [From SKT Welfare, Sept. 2022]                           Pakistan Floods Report         According to the government of Pakistan, a third of the       country--equivalent to an area the size of the UK--is under       water, in what the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has       called a ``climate catastrophe''. Whole villages have been       cut off, with rescuers struggling to reach them. At least       1,300 people have been killed and 12,703 injured.        The people of Pakistan are in dire need of food, clean       water, makeshift shelter and non-food items such as hygiene       kits. SKT Welfare is on the ground, trying its best to reach       those affected by the floods.        More than half a million more houses in Pakistan were       reported damaged or destroyed in the past week, with the       National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reporting more       than 1.17 million damaged houses and nearly 566,000 destroyed       houses as of 8 September. By nearly all available metrics,       Sindh has been most affected by the heavy rains and flooding       that have swept the country this monsoon season--particularly       notable given that Sindh and Balochistan are historically       drought prone areas. Nearly 88 per cent of all damaged or       destroyed houses--over 1.52 million houses--are in Sindh, and       the province has also recorded the highest number of human       casualties: 577 people killed and 8,321 people injured, out       of a total of nearly 1,400 deaths and more than 12,700       injuries, including at least 496 children killed and nearly       4,000 children injured across Pakistan. Gender-based violence       (GBV) as well as child protection and other protection       concerns have reportedly more than doubled since the pre-      monsoon period, according to the Protection Sector.     Mr. Speaker, let me draw upon these final efforts  and words so that you can know that now, after we have come back, the  clarion call of crisis is out.   ``U.N. chief calls for massive help as Pakistan puts flood losses at  $30 billion.''   The U.N. Secretary General called for massive help as he visited the  country last Friday. Record monsoon rains and glacier melt created this  catastrophe. He is now calling on the international community, and we  do need it. The country is enormously dependent on our help. It has  been, in many instances, helpful during the Afghan evacuation of recent  time, and most people are unaware of the military lives lost of the  Pakistani military in fighting terrorism.   The very fact that this dam has been seen by NASA, this lake, shows  that this damage is going to be far reaching. Pakistan must reach out  to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, to be able to  address this tragedy.   My friends, this is not normal. If I can leave you with anything  here, it is that we are, in fact, our brothers' and sisters' keeper and  that as we see the clear evidence of a climate catastrophe, a mountain  of horror, unspeakable devastation, it brings your mind back to the  floods of the Biblical times.   As we stand here today, children are not rescued, and 33 million  people are in the eye of the disaster. Again, we are waiting,  tragically, for the potential of massive disease that will shut  Pakistan down.   I cannot conclude without acknowledging my great appreciation to the  Pakistani-American community diaspora, some of whom traveled to  Pakistan. The doctors, businesspersons, and people preparing now to  take huge amounts of goods or dollars to be able to help.   But as I speak about that, let me tell you what UNICEF has said. With  1.1 million houses washed away and vital infrastructure destroyed, such  as schools, UNICEF's representative in Pakistan, Mr. Fadil, explained  that 18,000 schools have been destroyed and thousands of schools are  now fully shuttered. That means children who have lost education for 2  years are also losing learning opportunities.   These are the things that cannot be fixed immediately, nor can they  be fixed with only emergency help.   That is why I ask for the following: One, a major focus and research  on dissecting the climate catastrophe that occurred that would generate  the kinds of monsoons that caused 33 million people to be displaced.  The State of Texas is about 29 million. That would mean the wiping out  of an entire State, 33 million displaced. There are towns that are not  as large as 650,000. Equal that to the women that are pregnant without  medical care.   We can all imagine and know what 1,300 dead are and more possibly  being found. And we can also understand when the Army Chief of Staff  reminds us in his story of the mother who came holding the infant that  was hungry and said: ``Here, I cannot feed my baby.''   The government is fearful of a food security crisis. I have already  said to you that cotton is gone, wheat is gone, income is gone, and  therefore what is next.   This is what we need. International funding that will be complemented  by Pakistani funding from the Pakistani diaspora. I believe we need a  massive infusion of tents, the quality of which the United States has  begun to bring and drop into Karachi. More need to come. I also believe  that food goods are going to have to be airlifted into hard-to-reach  areas and into the camps that have been established.   Then, of course, I am begging for the international medical  community, the World Health Organization, to airlift medical facilities  into the region. They have got to set them up on levels of dry land,  with the ability to treat waterborne diseases and the separate  abilities to help deliver babies and take care of the elderly.   My friends, I have tried to provide a reason for us to come together.  Pakistan is still in danger. Flooding may take up to 6 months, and we  were even told that there may be more rains coming.   We know what happened to the people of Kentucky. We watched the  devastation of their story. We don't take lightly what can happen in  difficult times. We realize that people have suffered all over the  world.   With my own eyes and those of my colleagues, I documented that  Pakistan is suffering. Oh, it is a country far away, but I know the  capacity and the heart of the American people. I know the effectiveness  of the United States military and the effectiveness of our own  humanitarian aid and the State Department, USAID, and I know the  compassion of President Biden and the administration. Let us work  together with the United States Congress.   I thank the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the chair  of the Committee on Homeland Security for their contributing efforts,  and, of course, the Committee on Foreign Affairs as we look at  collaborative ways to be of help.  [[Page H7879]]    I thank my colleagues, the bipartisan Pakistan Caucus and the Members  of the Senate who likewise have been advocates for the region. This is  Southeast Asia, a very important region. Pakistan has to be able to be  stood up. The death toll cannot increase, and the agony of the people  just cannot continue.   Join me in my efforts to provide more resources, healthcare, food,  housing, tents, and the care of yet-born babies and the restoration of  the land. That is being a good neighbor, a good Samaritan. As a Nation,  the United States has always been a problem-solver.   I thank my colleagues for listening, and I thank the Pakistani  diaspora for their heart. Yes, we went because our hearts were torn  with grief.   With everything we gave to the people, we also wanted to give them  hope that America was there to be a friend. As I spoke and my words  were interpreted, I said: We are here from the United States Congress,  but we are Americans. When the word ``America'' was said, the people  applauded and smiled. Maybe the only words that they grasped was:  America was here to help.   Again, I thank my colleagues for listening, and I know and feel that  we will gather together and provide the comfort and resources needed by  the people of Pakistan.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 15, 2022, on page H7879, in the first column, the  following appeared: will gather together and provide the comfort  and resources needed by the people of Pakistan. Mr. Speaker, I  yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, on September 6,  2022, I returned from a congressional fact finding mis-      The online version has been corrected to read: will gather  together and provide the comfort and resources needed by the  people of Pakistan. Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2022, I returned  from a congressional fact finding mis-    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2022, I returned from a congressional  fact finding mission to the areas most impacted by the devastating  floods in Pakistan.   I have seen the devastation and human suffering firsthand, and I want  to clarify that Congress must act and be proactive in matters related  to climate change, including both in the United States and abroad.   The Jackson Lee CODEL conducted a survey of the impacted area by air  and visited food aid stations and victims.   The support provided by the United States will be essential to the  recovery effort, which will likely take many years. An important form  of assistance to Pakistan today is the awarding of Temporary Protected  Status to Pakistanis in the United States, which is a temporary  immigration status provided to nationals of specifically designated  countries that are confronting an ongoing armed conflict, environmental  disaster, or extraordinary and temporary conditions.   This is why I lead a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security  requesting Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Pakistanis in the  United States, allowing them to remain while the nation and the region  recover from this tragedy.   Congress created Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the Immigration  Act of 1990. It is a temporary immigration status provided to nationals  of specifically designated countries that are confronting an ongoing  armed conflict, environmental disaster, or extraordinary and temporary  conditions.   The events in Pakistan are the very definition of why TPS was  created. As the world finds its footing to learn to adapt to the rapid  and extreme changes in climate, we must not look abroad and say that  would not happen in the United States--we should never forget  Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Harvey, or Maria.   The reasons for the flooding are linked to climate change and the  resulting extreme weather. It is important to note that Pakistan  produces only about one percent of the pollution linked to global  warming, while the United States produces 11 percent, China 27 percent,  India produces 6.6 percent, and the EU 6.4 percent of total emissions.   Researchers say the catastrophe probably started with unprecedented  heatwaves. In April and May, temperatures reached above 104 degrees for  sustained periods in many places in the region. On one sweltering day  in May, the city of Jacobabad topped 123.8 degrees. This is not normal.  This area is not accustomed to heat like this, and the recorded as the  hottest place on Earth was in Pakistan.   The intense heat also melted glaciers in the northern mountainous  regions, increasing the amount of water flowing into tributaries that  eventually make their way into the Indus River. The Indus is Pakistan's  largest river and runs the country's length from north to south,  feeding towns, cities, and large swathes of agricultural land along the  way.   It is not clear exactly how much excess glacial melt has flowed into  rivers this year, but scientists visited some high-altitude glaciated  regions in July and noticed high flows and muddy water in the Hunza  River, which feeds into the Indus.   People across the United States are deeply saddened by the  devastating loss of life, livelihoods, and homes throughout Pakistan.  In the United States, over the last five weeks, we have experienced  five 1,000-year flood events impacting communities in every region of  the nation.   Unfortunately, many Americans can relate to the pain and loss the  people of Pakistan are experiencing. There have been six 1,000-year  occurrences in the United States over five weeks, causing flood events  in Eastern Illinois, St. Louis, Missouri, Eastern Kentucky, Central  Mississippi, Dallas, Texas, and Death Valley, California, and this does  not include the 1,000-year flood events that impacted New York and New  Jersey last year.   The United States responded that the Pakistani government's request  for assistance was the right thing to do and for the right reasons.  Climate change is not a one-nation issue--it is a global threat that  will touch every life with pain if we do not remain steadfast to change  and adapt to the new normal of extreme weather.   The consistency of extreme weather demonstrates these changes over  the last several years should not be seen as temporary. Weather is not  just what happens right in front of you; it is also about what is  happening hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles away from where we  are standing.   The rains in Pakistan have resulted in unimaginable changes in the  landscape. Reports backup by new images taken by NASA's MODIS satellite  sensor shows the results of heavy rain and an overflowing Indus River  that has formed a 62-mile lake in the Sindh Province where there was  farmland. In this region, the monsoon rainfall has been five hundred  percent above average amounts.   The United States remains steadfast in its support for affected  communities throughout Pakistan. In addition to the $30 million in  urgently needed humanitarian assistance announced today, the United  States also provided over $1.1 million in grants and project support  earlier this month to ensure direct service reaches those communities  most impacted and to help mitigate and prevent the effects of future  floods. The massive loss of crops and displacement of people puts the  region at risk of famine if we do not act.   My trip to Pakistan was an opportunity to convey our nation's resolve  to stand by the people of Pakistan as they recover from the flooding  and to gather knowledge that will inform the Committee on Homeland  Security on the factors related to this extreme weather event that is  most relevant to the flooding events we are seeing occurring across the  nation with greater frequency.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
