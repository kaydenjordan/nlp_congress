 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today, I am voting against the erosion of constitutional  rights of law-abiding Americans.   In the long history of mankind, freedom and liberty are not lost  overnight. It comes by way of a slow and gradual burn.   We have seen an unprecedented assault on our First Amendment through  the legacy media and social media giants censoring the thoughts and  opinions of individuals of the right while propping up their favorite  candidates and covering up stories that could be detrimental to their  public personas.   Policies are then implemented that are antireligious freedom, anti- due process, anti-free assembly, and, today, anti-Second Amendment, the  right to bear arms. These rights shall not be infringed.   Instead of making families and communities safer, this backward, gun- grabbing attempt does nothing to harden school security, address our  mental health crisis, or reverse the depreciation of our morals and  values.   No, it does nothing for that, but it tears at the fabric of our  Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect the Constitution and  vote ``no.''
