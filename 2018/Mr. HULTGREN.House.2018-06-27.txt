SEC. 4. SAVINGS CLAUSE.         Nothing in this Act or an amendment made by this Act       abrogates or otherwise affects the primary responsibilities       of any National Laboratory to the Department.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of bipartisan legislation I  introduced with my good friend from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter) to give  our national labs the tools they need to better work with outside  entities, develop new technologies, and let new business ideas come out  of our world-leading research facilities.   As you have heard today with the prior bills passed on the floor, the  House Science, Space, and Technology Committee has done tremendous  bipartisan work to support our national laboratories and research  infrastructure.   I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson--both from Texas-- for their bipartisan work on this package, and I was pleased to see my  prior past research infrastructure legislation dealing with upgrades at  Fermilab, Argonne National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National  Laboratory included in that package.   Our national labs are often referred to as the crown jewels in our  research ecosystem here in the United States. Secretary Perry has  referred to them as national treasures. These labs house some of the  largest, most complicated research equipment in the world, which no one  business or research university would ever be able to support.   Our national labs also maintain a number of user facilities where  university researchers, other Federal agencies, and the private sector  can work with these tools, so long as this work does not interfere with  the mission of the department or the lab.  [[Page H5782]]    The problem we have with many agreements is simply the time that it  takes to negotiate and finalize an agreement. Currently, after a lab  makes a determination on an agreement, that agreement must then go  through a separate review by the department. While I wholeheartedly  agree in our need for thorough oversight, what we are attempting to do  is to set a threshold so that smaller agreements do not need to go  through this additional review process.   All national labs, except one, have been set up under a government- owned, contractor-operated model. What my bill would do is strengthen  this arrangement by giving the labs the necessary trust they need to  remain nimble, being able to react to the needs of the private sector  and with other researchers being able to come in.   When many researchers need to use a facility for just a few hours,  they, obviously, will not wait around 90 days for the government. The  private sector does not move at the pace of government, nor should we  expect it to. This legislation would cut out some of the red tape of  working with the lab, so that the private sector could take good ideas  and do what they do best: innovate and react to the market.   With the increased reporting requirements for these agreements, I  believe this strikes the proper balance for oversight with the  department and the intentions of Congress in creating the government- owned, contractor-operated model for the labs.   I am grateful for the Secretary at our recent hearing signaling his  willingness to work with this idea. I believe it fits with the  administration's priorities in removing red tape where it is not needed  and freeing the private sector up to innovate and bring new ideas to  the marketplace.   So I thank my colleagues for their work on this legislation. I also  thank the chairman for his cosponsorship of this bill, as well as his  leadership on the package of bills authorizing the Office of Science  and other DOE activities.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support passage of  this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to yield 5  minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the very effective and  helpful chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and  also cosponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my good friend from Texas (Mr. Veasey)  for his support on this bill. I especially want to thank my really good  friend from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, for his important support on this bill. It really  is a commonsense bill. It is one that has passed previous Congresses  with strong, bipartisan support.   Our labs are a treasure, but they are also a great benefit for  innovation. This allows that innovation to continue working, again, on  smaller agreements, for those to be able to move more quickly, when,  oftentimes, business need to move that quickly. The labs can do this,  but if they had to go through the whole cumbersome process of coming  through Washington, they wouldn't be able to.   So, again, this is commonsense and bipartisan, and I thank all of the  cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
