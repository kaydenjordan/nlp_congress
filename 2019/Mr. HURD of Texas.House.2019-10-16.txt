 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   I am proud to rise today in support of this bipartisan resolution  that opposes this disastrous decision to remove U.S. Forces from  northern Syria and abandon our allies, the Kurds, to a Turkish  invasion.   Since 2014, the U.S. and our allies in the global coalition to defeat  ISIS have fought side by side with the Kurds to end the caliphate and  degrade the threat of terrorism to our homeland.   Today, ISIS is beaten, but it is not broken. They remain a threat  that requires continued engagement by both the United States and our  partners.   Just as the Kurds had our backs against ISIS, we need to have theirs.  Instead, we are abandoning not just the Kurds but also our coalition  allies in Syria. We are eroding all the progress we have made. We are  showing our friends and our enemies that a partnership with America  means nothing.   We are providing ISIS with the opportunity to reemerge and once again  threaten the United States. We are allowing Bashar al-Assad and  Vladimir Putin to play the role of humanitarian saviors in Syria.   As an undercover CIA officer, I chased terrorists around the globe  and saw firsthand the threats facing our Nation from the Middle East.  One of the things I learned when I was in the CIA was to be nice with  nice guys and tough with tough guys, not the other way around.   Because of this decision, and all the actions and inactions that led  up to this decision, we have let our friends down; we have hurt our  national security; and we have ceded leadership in the region to Russia  and Iran.   I hope we can change our course, but I fear it may be too late.
