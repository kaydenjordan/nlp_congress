 Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure for me to be here in my  role as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. I am also pleased to  have a couple of our new Members here today.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), a new  member of the Joint Economic Committee.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this budget  resolution as a first step in the process to repeal and replace  ObamaCare. It is undeniable that ObamaCare has failed. It has broken  promise after promise to the American people.   Constituents in my district in central Illinois are watching their  premiums skyrocket by an average of 15 percent. This chart next to me  here shows, all across the country in State after State, premiums have  skyrocketed. Citizens also face deductibles that are so high that they  try to get by without going to a doctor.    One constituent from Roseville, Illinois, whose insurance costs have  gone up 75 percent, stated to me recently: ``This is crazy. Almost half  of my paycheck goes to insurance. How do they expect us to afford  this?''   These burdensome costs stifle families and our small businesses'  ability to participate in and help grow our economy. We have a mandate  from the American people to fix this broken system and to rescue  citizens from escalating healthcare costs.                                time  1300    The goal is not to pull the rug out from underneath anyone. In fact,  we are working to provide a stable transition to better, more  affordable health care. We must have something that is economically  sustainable and fiscally responsible, something that actually works.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to replace ObamaCare  with a system grounded in economic reality--a market-driven, consumer- centered healthcare system that provides Americans with more choices,  lower costs, and greater flexibility. That is why we are working on a  replacement system that will expand consumer choice through health care  focused on their needs; a system that will spur innovation in health  care; attract new doctors and healthcare providers; and protect  patients with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Chairman, we must help Americans gain access to insurance they  can afford. Passing this legislation is one step towards helping people  and fulfilling our promise to the American people.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. We owe it to our  citizens.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Here we are more than 3 months into fiscal year 2017, debating a  budget which is not really a budget resolution. Even the majority  admits it is nothing more than a shell to help them repeal the  Affordable Care Act. It doesn't contain any way to grow jobs and it  doesn't contain any new ideas to grow our economy.  [[Page H505]]    With all of the majority's rhetoric about deficits over the last  decade or more, this budget explodes the deficit and adds $2 trillion-- as in T--to the national debt, only to set the stage for repeal of  healthcare assistance to millions of Americans.   What is more, the Congressional Budget Office has told us that repeal  of the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit by $353 billion  over 10 years. Now, many of my colleagues have noted the devastating  effect of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the effect that it  would have on millions of Americans' health. Thirty million Americans  would lose insurance, including 4 million children. The cost of  prescription drugs would go up for our seniors. Young people would lose  the coverage on their parents' health care. Women wouldn't be  protected, and men with preexisting conditions. Pregnancy would no  longer be covered.   The Affordable Care Act has made critical progress for Americans.  Millions have gained health care that they never had before. Our  uninsured rate is now at 8.9 percent. It is the lowest rate in the  history of our great country. It is nearly halved from before the  Affordable Care Act took place, as you can see from this chart. This is  something we should be proud of. We have allowed more and more and more  Americans to have health care when they need it. It is literally a  life-and-death situation to millions of Americans.   This reckless repeal of the Affordable Care Act will also cause  economic havoc. It not only hurts people; it hurts our economy. Now,  just last month, our economy added 144,000 private sector jobs--the  75th straight month of job growth in the United States of America. That  is something we can all be proud of. That is the longest stretch of job  creation since 1939 in our Nation's history.   That is in stark contrast to the way things were at the time that the  last Presidential transition took place. When Barack Obama took the  oath of office, our economy was shedding a staggering amount of jobs.  In December of 2008, the economy lost 695,000 jobs. The next month,  another 598,000 jobs gone. We were losing, over a period of time,  roughly 700,000 jobs a month. The banks were teetering, lending had  halted, the auto industry was exploding, our Nation was in economic  turmoil. The combination of a bursting asset bubble and bank panic  brought this country to the edge of collapse. It was the worst  financial crisis in global history, according to the head of the  Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke--in global history.   Today we have a very different story. Thank you, President Obama. Our  unemployment rate, which had soared up to 10 percent, is now at 4.7  percent. That is a great achievement. In 2016 alone, our country added  2.2 million jobs, bringing the total to over 15 million new jobs  created over the last 7 years. Instead of shedding jobs and losing jobs  under the prior administration, we were gaining.   Just look at this chart. We moved from the deep red valley of  political devastation, economic loss of jobs and suffering, to moving  out of our economic troubles to a continued growth of blue job  creation. In the job creation and in our economy, we also expanded  health care to help our people. Just look at this chart. It tells the  story--the deep red valley of economic devastation caused by the last  Republican administration and the steady job growth under President  Obama.   We are now seeing stronger job growth after years of stagnation. Over  the past year, average hourly earnings rose to 2.9 percent; another  great success. But now we are considering a heartless and, I would say,  reckless plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act; a move that threatens  to undo our progress and will turn millions of lives absolutely upside  down across this great Nation.   A report issued this month by The Commonwealth Fund outlined the  disastrous economic consequences of the majority's plan. In just the  first year of repeal, our economy will lose nearly 2.6 million jobs and  over $255 billion in economic output. Over the course of 5 years, our  economy will lose over $1.5 trillion in output.   These devastating job losses are not limited to the healthcare  industry. As was pointed out by many Democratic speakers, our whole  industry is intertwined. You can't cut the Affordable Care Act without  also impacting not only people, but also the delivery of services  through our hospitals, and also Medicaid and Medicare. It is all  intertwined. It is reckless to move forward and say: Oh, we are going  to come up with a good plan.   Well, where is it?   You have had years to come up with it. We have never seen it.   We will lose not just two-thirds, over 1.6 million, of jobs just in  health care, but also in related industries--construction, retail, and  other sectors. What is more, this repeal plan would also place massive  financial burdens on our State budgets.   The Commonwealth Fund report estimates that in just the first year,  States would lose out on $8.2 billion in tax revenue. Over 5 years, our  States would lose over $48 billion in tax revenue. That means hits to  our schools, our roads, our first responders, and our neighborhoods.   Of course, repealing the Affordable Care Act will hurt the millions  of people who have directly benefited from it. People have come up to  me and told me on the street: I finally have health care; I have health  care for my children; I know if they get hurt, they are going to be  taken care of.   People in my home State of New York will be hit very hard. Over 2.7  million New Yorkers have healthcare coverage today that they did not  have before because of the Affordable Care Act. Now their health care  is on the line, for they are among the 30 million who would lose health  coverage under the majority's repeal plan.   This not only hurts people, it cost economic development--a loss of  $89.7 billion in gross State product for my State of New York alone.   This is the way it is all across the country. Americans of every  political stripe, who work hard and play by the rules and think they  finally have health care, who have at long last gained it, are now  worried about what is going to happen to them tomorrow. They deserve  better. They deserve what they already have. They, at least, deserve a  plan.   We should not repeal. We shouldn't repeal it in the first place. But  if you are going to repeal it, let's be responsible about it and have  what it is you are going to put back in place to help people. It is  reckless to repeal it.   In the most advanced, most economically prosperous country in the  history of the world, our people deserve the certainty that they can  have access to health care for themselves and their families. With all  that is at stake--health care for millions, the loss of 2.6 million  jobs, economic havoc--it is simply irresponsible to move forward with a  budget, and reckless to repeal the Affordable Care Act without any real  solution to help people.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against this  budget resolution, which is nothing more than a plan to take health  care away from Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Francis Rooney), a new Member of this  Congress, and a new member of the Joint Economic Committee.   Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak about  and oppose the travesty known as ObamaCare.   The need to replace this program was obvious on day one. It is a  failed socioeconomic experiment perpetrated by people who don't believe  in individual choice and don't understand free market competition. In  fact, we can see less than half of the folks that were supposed to sign  up have done it because it is a bad deal for them. Nothing promised  under this medical health insurance program has proved true. Care costs  have gone up, premiums and deductibles have skyrocketed.   We have another chart here, if I might, that shows a projected 25- plus percent increase in premiums in 2017. My State of Florida is 19  percent. Coverage has been circumscribed and reduced. This business  about keeping your doctor has proven to be another falsehood. You can't  afford to keep your doctor. You can't afford to keep your insurance.   The entire program was flawed from the beginning. It is a top-down,  government-run boondoggle. All it has done is  [[Page H506]]  create monopolies for a bunch of insurance companies. I have heard  heart-wrenching personal stories from so many families in southwest  Florida who have suffered severe financial burdens and have had reduced  and dropped coverage because of ObamaCare.   Paying more for less is bad policy. It is bad economics. It is a raw  deal for Americans. Now we have the opportunity to do three things to  turn the page and put this disaster of ObamaCare behind us. We have the  opportunity today to enact the resolution, which will lead to repealing  ObamaCare. We have the opportunity to have Dr. Price take the helm of  Health and Human Services and begin a substantial administrative  overhaul. And we have the opportunity to put in the replacement plan  that has been talked about, described in A Better Way for America,  which provides a seamless transition into a new form of health care,  leaves no one without coverage, and assures the continual coverage of  preexisting conditions. But it will offer consumer choice the American  way. It will make coverage affordable and competitive.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.   Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. It will stimulate competition for  insurance coverage across State lines for moving an archaic and  artificial barrier, which shouldn't be there in the first place.  Lastly, it will encourage innovation in the delivery of health care in  advances in treatment.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, first, I would  like to apologize to two dedicated members of the committee on which we  serve: Mr. Beyer and Mr. Delaney, who have been sitting here, waiting  for a long time. But Mr. Nadler tells me he has an absolute pressing  emergency and must go first.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler).    I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from the great State of Virginia (Mr. Beyer.)    I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney), another distinguished member of  the Joint Economic Committee.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, there are several perspectives, important perspectives, to  health care and health insurance: one, value delivered to patients in  terms of insurance plan options, choice of doctors, access to  treatment, and, most importantly, health outcomes; two, health  insurance premiums and healthcare cost sharing; three, budgetary cost  to the Federal and State governments; four, supply of healthcare  services, including by doctors and hospitals and through medications;  and fifth, indirect costs to the economy, such as reduced job creation  and labor force participation.   The Affordable Care Act fails on all five counts, and that is why we  are here today, to start the process of repealing and replacing it. The  program is dysfunctional, and its costs have become and will become  more unsustainable.   Supposedly, the central objective for passing the ACA was to insure  those who did not have coverage. I was there.   Yet, the increased government sprawl shown in this chart in health  care is striking.    The Joint Economic Committee chart from the time of the law's passage  illustrates the law's mind-numbing complexity. Unsurprising to anyone  skeptical of bureaucratic solutions, the Obama healthcare system has  not worked.   Instead of empowering innovators, doctors, patients, ObamaCare has  implemented a complex scheme that relies on unelected bureaucrats. And  this chart demonstrates that clearly.   Mr. Chair, ObamaCare means fewer choices. In fact, Kimberly, a  constituent in my district, recently told me that she had a brain  tumor. She said:         Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance, so I       am left to change doctors who I have seen for 30 years and       switch to new doctors who I don't trust and cannot provide       the same healthcare benefits that I have received in the       past.    Traumatic for her.   Remarkably, the enrollment failure is happening, despite penalties on  individuals failing to obtain coverage and on employers failing to  provide it.   Even with billions of dollars in subsidies, in my opinion, this  illustrates that many would likely prefer to trade their subsidies for  more flexibility, the choice of their own doctors, and useful  alternatives.   ObamaCare also means higher premiums. Ohioans, on the individual  marketplace, have seen increased premiums by 111 percent since passage  of ObamaCare, and now in my State, the average premium is over $5,000.   Republicans agree that the system needs reform, but ObamaCare cannot  be reformed. The argument that parts of the American healthcare  insurance system were not working previously, and that more people now  have health insurance, is irrelevant to the decision to repeal  ObamaCare. Nobody claims that the former system was perfect. I  certainly don't.   Certainly, the government can increase coverage with subsidies,  increase coverage with mandates, but what has it done to the underlying  health care that is being provided?   The extent and method by which ObamaCare increases coverage has  caused huge and unnecessary collateral damage to all others in the  marketplace, all others with respect to patient choice of their  doctors, the quality of the care that they are receiving, the supply of  health care, and, certainly, State and Federal budgets.   The focus of ObamaCare advocates has been almost exclusively on  increasing the number of insured by government subsidy and mandate. I  get that. I understand that, but not on maximizing healthy outcomes.  Those aren't the same things.   Health insurance is not an end in itself. Effective treatment to  healthcare problems is.   Private investment is so needed to push forward medical discoveries,  innovation, accelerate drug development, personalize medicine, and  harness technology to coordinate our health care and help administrate  it.   There is a better way. You will hear from the other side of the aisle  that Republicans have no plan to replace ObamaCare. Here are the plans.  It is just not true. The goal of the Republican plan is not to go back  to the way things were before ObamaCare; it is to move forward.   We want to facilitate a well-functioning market in health care, and  health insurance as well. In the United States, we let the marketplace  work things out. Republicans want to fix those obstacles and make it  better.   Among the features of the Better Way is: portability, patient- centered care, insurance across State lines, medical liability reform,  new mechanisms for small businesses and individuals to power together  to negotiate, flexibility for our Governors, a patient-centered,  patient-focused program.   The government has a role and a responsibility to provide support for  those who can't afford it, for those who fall through the cracks. A  refundable tax credit is part of our plan, addressing preexisting  conditions is part of our plan, and keeping dependents up to 26 on  their parents' plan is part of our plan.  [[Page H508]]    But the deeper points to recognize are: One, there is no reason why a  free market could not offer insurance to individuals that provides  continuous coverage throughout their lives. There is no reason that  helping the poor should not limit the choices and flexibilities of  everyone else, which ObamaCare has done, much less interfere with the  larger economy.   Moreover, the law has had an impact on employment. I see it every  week. Economics Professor Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago  estimated that the ACA taxes will affect nearly half of the working  population in America, reducing average wages, hours worked, and GDP.   And based upon CBO estimates, the overall impact of the ACA on the  supply of labor will become progressively worse as time passes.   ObamaCare took certain problems in healthcare insurance--a large  number of uninsured, lack of individual coverage for preexisting  conditions, higher premiums for individuals--and used them as an excuse  to create socialized medicine.   The repeal of ObamaCare will take us off that path and replacement  will offer shortcomings to other problems.   Going forward, Republicans stand ready to provide support away from  ObamaCare through a transition. And getting an improved healthcare  system in place improves consumer choice.   I understand the anxiety that many are feeling right now listening to  the Democrats tell them that health care is going to be yanked out from  under them.   When I was a kid, my dad, a steel worker, lost his job. We lost our  health care. We lost our insurance. I know what that anxiety is like.  And I want to assure everyone today, that is not what we are doing here  today.   I know what we are doing here today. We are empowering patients. We  are empowering doctors, not bureaucrats. We are giving them more  choices, more opportunities, and a better healthcare system.   Mr. Chair, I ask that we support this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for the Joint Economic Committee has expired.   The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 6 minutes remaining. The gentleman  from Kentucky has 2 minutes remaining.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.
