 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Officers Corey  Helms and Dylan Cole of the Monroe, North Carolina, Police Department,  who, on December 26, risked their lives to save two families trapped in  a burning home.   Officer Helms was first to arrive but was pushed back by the thick  cloud of smoke. Officer Cole arrived next, and together, the two men  attempted to  [[Page H127]]  find a ladder to rescue the five people trapped on the second floor.  Unable to find a ladder, Monroe's two heroes disregarded their own  safety by charging into the burning home and up the stairs before  carrying and guiding the young families to safety.   Officers Cole and Helms rescued two adult sisters and their children,  ages 3 years, 10 months, and 5 months. There were no injuries as a  result.   Officers Corey Helms and Dylan Cole are living examples of what it  means to serve and to protect. Please join me in honoring these two  brave officers and all the men and women of the Monroe Police  Department who work on our behalf every day. God bless them.                            ____________________
