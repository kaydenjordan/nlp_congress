 Mr. Speaker, for personal reasons, I cannot be  present for the vote on H. Res. 990. If present I would point out that  if Republicans were really serious about assessing the efficiency of  ICE, they would have heeded the multiple calls from me and my  Democratic colleagues to hold hearings on President Trump's dreadful  family separation policy that has resulted in thousands of families  being ripped apart, including the isolation of children and babies. As  to the resolution's language that states ``supports the efforts of all  Federal agencies, State law enforcement, and military personnel who  bring law and order . . .'', I strongly support that and the important  agency missions including of money laundering, narcotics  investigations, cyber crimes, terrorism prevention, and customs  enforcement. If present, I would have inquired of my Republican  colleagues if they could get the same statement of support of Federal  law enforcement agencies from President Trump, given his behavior and  statements in Helsinki and the same disdain he has expressed for  Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
