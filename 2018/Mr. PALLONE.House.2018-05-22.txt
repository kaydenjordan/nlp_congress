 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 292, the Childhood Cancer  Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act.   I want to particularly thank our lead Democratic sponsor, Mr.  Butterfield of North Carolina, for promoting this bill.   Nearly 16,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. each  year. Those children are forced to bravely battle a disease and carry  burdens that no one their age should. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act  gives those children and their families hope by encouraging improved  research as well as survivorship programs for children with cancer.   This legislation urges the National Institutes of Health to find new  opportunities to expand research into pediatric cancer and  survivorship, such as supporting the collection of biospecimens, as  well as supporting research on the causes of health disparities in  pediatric cancer survivorship.   The bill also allows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  to award funding to help States strengthen their infrastructure to  track the epidemiology of pediatric cancer.                                time  1530    This improves childhood cancer surveillance and helps to guide public  health decisionmaking as well as research inquiry.   Finally, this bill recognizes that expanding research that leads to  treatments and cures is only part of the equation in improving the  experience of children diagnosed with this disease. We must ensure that  quality care is available to meet their needs for the remainder of  their lives.   Unfortunately, the battle with pediatric cancer extends beyond  beating the disease. As many as two-thirds of pediatric cancer  survivors suffer from long-term effects of their disease and treatment,  including secondary cancers and organ damage.   That is why this bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to establish a pilot program to develop, study, or evaluate  model systems for monitoring and caring for childhood cancer survivors  through their lifespan, as well as to develop best practices for long- term followup services for pediatric cancer survivors.   I will continue to support efforts like this to improve outcomes for  cancer  [[Page H4353]]  patients and survivors. However, unlike with this legislation, such  efforts should proceed through the regular order process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), the lead Democratic sponsor, who is  always out front on so many important healthcare issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), the vice ranking member of the House Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I just want to urge support for this  legislation. The support is obviously bipartisan, and I urge all my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to S. 204, the Federal  Right to Try Act. This is dangerous legislation that threatens FDA's  authority over ensuring that medical treatments are safe and effective.  This bill needlessly exposes vulnerable patients to the risks of  unproven medications.                                time  1600    We heard last night in the Rules Committee from my Republican  colleagues that we must accept and pass this legislation because the  Senate is unable to pass a bill that passed the House earlier this  year. That House bill was bad enough, but this Senate bill is much  worse. I cannot fathom why my Republican colleagues are surrendering to  the Senate and agreeing to pass a more dangerous version of the right- to-try legislation.   The Senate bill, like the House bill, establishes an alternative  pathway for experimental treatments that eliminates any review from the  Food and Drug Administration and scientific and medical experts of an  independent review board. This will provide fly-by-night physicians and  clinics the opportunity to peddle false hope and ineffective drugs to  desperate patients.   At a hearing before our committee, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb  cautioned that S. 204 risked ``exposing people to unwanted side effects  from experimental therapies.''   Now, supporters of this bill would have you believe that this  legislation is targeted at those with terminal illnesses, but this is  simply not the case. S. 204 would, in fact, apply to a much broader  range of patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases or  conditions. And the term ``life-threatening disease or condition''  could include chronic and often manageable diseases, such as diabetes  or chronic heart failure.   If all patients with diabetes and other chronic but manageable  illnesses were eligible, it would greatly expand the scope of the  legislation well beyond the scope of most State laws and FDA's expanded  access program. This exposes an even greater number of patients to risk  and undermines our clinical trial program by diverting patients from  trials that could support full approval to the alternate pathway.   Commissioner Gottlieb also cautioned Congress that this legislation  risked ``undermining a regulatory process that has been carefully  crafted over many years to strike a very careful balance.'' The  Commissioner noted that S. 204 would not subject all participants to  the alternate pathway to critical regulatory requirements, such as  labeling products as investigational, charging limitations, and  restrictions on promotion and commercialization of such treatments.   S. 204 could also impede the FDA from taking action against  manufacturers and others that violate other provisions of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under this bill, if a bad actor is not in  compliance with good manufacturing practices or does not protect  against intentional alteration--adulteration, I should say--or allows  dishonest or misleading labeling, the FDA will not be able to take any  enforcement action.   But, more importantly, Mr. Speaker, this Federal right-to-try bill  simply is not necessary, in my opinion. FDA has an expanded access  program and has an approval rate of nearly 100 percent.   To be clear, FDA's high approval rate is not just a rubberstamp for  these applications. Of the applications FDA receives and approves, it  also adjusts applications for 11 percent of patients to improve patient  safety protections. This could include modifying the dosing,  strengthening informed consent, or improving safety monitoring.   We must protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous treatments  that might make their lives worse. Without this critical review, there  will not be any oversight to ensure that patients are not being taken  advantage of or put in harm's way.   The main reason this bill is being pushed is to chip away at FDA's  authority to ensure the safety and effectiveness of our drugs.   FDA oversight of access to experimental treatment exists for a  reason: it protects patients from potentially snake oil salesmen or  from experimental treatments that might do more harm than good.   By removing the FDA oversight, you are counting on physicians and  manufacturers to serve as the gatekeeper and protector of our patients.  I simply don't buy that that is going to work.   Supporters of this bill want to blindly believe that there are no bad  actors out there, but imagine someone like Martin Shkreli promising a  dying patient a cure that could save their life. Under this bill, FDA  would play no role in determining whether or not Martin Shkreli could  provide that drug to that dying patient.   If S. 204 is signed into law, patients will be taken advantage of and  will be harmed. Bad actors exist, and this Republican bill gives them  the opportunity to prey on desperate people who are, understandably,  looking for any treatment that may help save their lives.   Now, let me also point out that the supporters of this bill claim to  be helping desperate patients who are looking for hope. If this is such  a patient-centered bill, why does every major patient organization  overwhelmingly oppose it? Where is the call from patients for this  legislation?   More than 100 patient organizations, including the National  Organization for Rare Disorders, Friends of Cancer Research, and  American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, sent a letter to  Congress just yesterday opposing this legislation. In the letter, they  stated: ``The Senate version of the legislation is less safe than the  pathway proposed in the House version and is dangerous compared to the  current expanded FDA access process.''   Four former FDA Commissioners from both parties also oppose this  Republican legislation, noting: ``There is no evidence that either  bill''--that is the House or the Senate--``would meaningfully improve  access for patients, but both would remove the FDA from the process and  create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for  vulnerable patients.''   Mr. Speaker, S. 204, I know, is a key agenda item for the President  and the Vice President; but I think it is dangerous for our patients,  and it is an unprecedented attempt to roll back FDA's oversight of  investigational treatments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with more than 100  organizations that have come forward to oppose this misguided and, I  believe, harmful legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), the vice ranking member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond briefly to the previous speaker  on the Republican side.   I don't understand how the gentleman can say that the expanded access  program will continue even under right to try.   The problem is, sure, on paper it will continue, but there wouldn't  be any reason for anyone to go to the FDA. If the FDA is now out of the  picture and all you have to do is find somebody who manufactures a drug  or treatment and get the doctor to say, ``Okay, I will administer it,''  then you don't need to go to the expanded access program.   You see, the problem is that the gentleman assumes that people will  go to the FDA and they will know that the expanded access program  exists. I think the very nature of this legislation, which basically  says that you don't have to go to the FDA, is going to mean that people  won't even know that that is an option. And if they can get somebody to  give them the drug without going to the FDA, they will just do it.   Let me just say this. I know the gentleman referred to the FDA's  bureaucrats. I guess you could say that the people at the FDA are  bureaucrats, but the FDA existed because, for many years before then,  in the 19th century and early 20th century, all kinds of snake oil and  things were advertised and promoted in the papers and in magazines,  saying that this is going to cure that, this is going to cure that, and  people demanded that there be some kind of Federal oversight as to  whether drugs or treatments actually are effective, whether they have  harm, whether they are toxic. That is why the FDA was started.   So I guess I just don't understand, because the bottom line is there  is very little evidence that there is any significant number of people  who are denied treatment or drugs because of the expanded access  program. At least then they know that some agency has looked at this to  see whether it is harmful, whether it has some negative impact.   The great concern that those of us on the other side of this issue  have is that without the FDA, there is no guarantee that what somebody  gets as a form of treatment is actually going to be meaningful, not be  harmful.   So I don't want to prolong my response to the gentleman, but I do  think that you have to understand that those of us on this side of the  aisle actually think that the FDA has a purpose and actually performs  an important function, and I don't think we should deny that. I think  it is unfortunate that there are those who think that somehow the FDA  is not doing its job.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to respond to the previous  Republican speaker. He made three comments that disturb me.   One, he said that people should be able to try things, try the drugs  or the treatment, when the benefits outweigh the risks. But how are  they going to know that when the FDA isn't involved?   When the FDA goes through various phases of clinical trial, not only  phase  [[Page H4362]]  one, which determines whether something is toxic, but beyond, to  determine whether it is effective or whether it has harmful effects,  then you do know. The FDA basically will tell you: Yes, the benefits  outweigh the risk, and that is why we have an approval process in  general for drugs, and that is why we have the expanded access, so that  the FDA can look at it and say: Okay. Maybe you are going to risk this,  but we want to make sure that you have some protection.   The gentleman said that the FDA process is complicated or time  consuming. First of all, there is an emergency process where you can  simply get on the phone or the doctor gets on the phone, and within 24  hours you can be approved.   But on the other hand, if it is not an emergency, the average  approval time is 4 days. So I don't know how he can say that this is  time consuming.   And then the last thing he said is that there is consent, that the  doctors and the manufacturers have to agree. But who is going to  enforce this?   Right now, because the FDA has to go through the expanded access  process, the FDA has the enforcement. They can say: We are going to  grant this; we are not; we are going to provide some safety or other  protections.   But if the doctor and some fly-by-night manufacturer decide that they  want to give you this drug or treatment, who is going to enforce that?  How do we know that the doctor is legitimate? How do we know that the  manufacturer is not selling snake oil?   Once the FDA is out of the picture, there is no way for the patient  to know whether the doctor is unscrupulous, whether the manufacturer is  unscrupulous. There is no review. There is no enforcement whatsoever.   So, again, this is the problem once you take the FDA out. I  understand there are some that don't like the FDA, don't think maybe  they should be involved. But in the absence of the FDA, I don't know  how you possibly could know whether this thing is going to help you,  whether the benefits outweigh the risk, whether there is a bad actor  involved, either with the doctor or the manufacturer.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues on the other side to understand why  so many of us over here have been so upset by this proposal today.   As I think I said before, the House bill was bad enough. The Senate  bill is worse for at least two reasons.   One is our concern, on the one hand, that rather than these drugs or  treatments without FDA approval would be handed to just terminally ill  patients, that the Senate bill says that it would apply to people who  have life-threatening situations.   And the FDA and the commissioner of the FDA have stated quite clearly  that they are concerned about the expansion from terminal to life- threatening, because it could be that people who have diseases like  diabetes, severe diabetes, or chronic heart disease, for example, could  make the argument that their situation is life-threatening, and,  therefore, they can go and get these experimental drugs without FDA  approval.   So that is a huge loophole that is very disconcerting.   The second thing is that the prohibition, if you will, on promotional  activity with these investigational drugs is taken out by the Senate  bill.   So the worst thing of all, we talk about snake oil and advertising,  is now is some unscrupulous doctor or manufacturer now going to promote  this and say: Well, if you take this, this may save your life?   So that is why the Senate bill is worse.   But I want to go back to the whole idea. The problem that I have with  all this is that once you take out the FDA, and the FDA is not involved  anymore, the way this bill is set up, how do I know, if I am the  patient and I hear from some doctor or through some promotion or  whatever, that there is something that might help me, and I am  desperate, how do I know that the doctor that I go to or the  manufacturer who is promoting this drug, that this is actually not a  bad actor, not somebody who is taking advantage of the situation  because there is no FDA approval?   In other words, who is going to determine whether this person's life  is threatened or whether they are terminally ill? There is no FDA. Who  determines that?   Who is going to determine whether this drug has any effectiveness at  all?   Well, some of my Republican colleagues say: Well, it has to go  through phase one, but phase one clinical trials could have 20 or 30  people. They are sometimes very small.   The FDA doesn't really have any ability to control those clinical  trials. Sure, they have some oversight over clinical trials, but there  are clinical trials that take place all over the country with very few  people, and sometimes the drug manufacturers who are experimenting with  these trials, with these small groups, are not necessarily known  manufacturers or large ones that we know will be safeguarding these  drugs or treatments.   So I just think the problem is, when we talk about snake oil and bad  actors, it is almost as if the Republicans assume there are no bad  actors.   Because if you assume that there are, which I do, and there are bad  actors who are going to promote something that is not going to be  effective or is going to harm somebody, and that there is a  manufacturer who is not someone we know, who is going to determine  whether or not they are a bad actor or what they are doing?   You need to have some kind of enforcement. You need to have somebody  who is supervising this. Otherwise, it is any man for himself decides:  I will try this drug. It went through phase one. Maybe it is not toxic.   So I really worry that this debate on the other side of the aisle is  not taking into consideration that there always are going to be people  who want to take advantage of the situation and sell something that  they are going to make a buck on that is not necessarily going to have  any real oversight in this situation.   So that is my fear. That is my fundamental fear about this bill, that  these situations are going to arise, nobody is going to be in charge,  nobody is going to know what is going on, and then the person is going  to either die earlier or have some awful impact, and then they are  going to say: Oh, how come the FDA didn't approve it? Or maybe they are  going to assume the FDA approved it, and there is no FDA. They are  gone.   Mr. Speaker, in any case, I would urge my colleagues to oppose what I  consider very harmful legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
