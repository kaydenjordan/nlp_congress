 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, there are few alliances as critical to America's  national security, to global stability, and to our Nation's values as  the U.S.-Israel relationship. Israel and America share common values  and together are committed to the principles of democracy and  individual freedom. The United States will always stand by our ally,  Israel, period.   Let me be clear. Military assistance to Israel is critical to  America's national security. It is an investment in our security as  well as Israel's. That is why I am opposed to imposing conditions on  that assistance.   Since even before its independence in 1948, Israel has sought to  achieve a secure peace with its neighbors on the basis of the principle  of self-determination for both the Jewish people and for the  Palestinian people. The Jewish people deserve to live in peace and  security in their ancestral homeland, and Palestinians deserve the  opportunity to chart their own future of peace and opportunity in a  land of their own. That was the foundation of the peace process in the  1990s and subsequent efforts by Israeli Governments to achieve peace  with security.   It makes clear in this resolution that both parties ought to take  meaningful steps to end mistrust and avoid obstacles to peace. This  includes encouraging both sides not to take any steps that make the  pursuit of peace harder. Unfortunately, that has not always been the  case, and the attacks on Israel undermine daily--and if not daily, too  often--the ability to achieve an agreement helpful to the Palestinians  as well as the Israelis.   I want to thank my friend and leader of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Chairman Engel, Representatives Lowenthal, Pocan, Deutch,  Price, Schakowsky, and Gottheimer, representing a broad spectrum of  feelings about how we deal with and support our ally, Israel. But they  have come together, as well as all of the members of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, to work hard to ensure that this resolution  reaffirms Congress' strong support for the U.S.-Israel relationship,  while contributing positively to helping Israel achieve the peace and  security it seeks with the Palestinians.   The resolution says that settlements and annexation are inconsistent  with that objective. I hope Members will support this resolution. I  disagree with my friend from New York, that this is not policy that has  been adopted by Republican administrations as well as Democratic  administrations. To say this is an Obama policy that we are  overturning--which is apparently much of what the focus of this  administration is, overturning the policies of their predecessor--is  incorrect. George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush believed that a  contrary policy would undermine the realization of peace between two  peoples.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will on a bipartisan basis overwhelmingly  support the restatement of America's policy.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for yielding me time, and I thank him for his leadership.  And, of course, I thank Terri Sewell, who is from Selma, Alabama, who  has been a fighter for voting rights all of her life. I thank her for  sponsoring this bill along with myself and so many others.   It was in Selma in 1965 that another friend and one of our dearest  colleagues,   John Lewis, was nearly beaten to death for having the  audacity to demand the right to vote, the right to register, the right  to participate in a meaningful way in our democracy. That year, after  that Bloody Sunday in March of 1965 and the later march to Montgomery  that followed soon after, Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act to  protect against voter suppression and voter disenfranchisement.   One of its core provisions required that the Federal Justice  Department preclear any changes to voting rules in jurisdictions that  have a history of discrimination and voter suppression. Let me, as an  aside say, that these elections are Federal elections, so very frankly,  my constituents have an interest in making sure that constituents of  every other district have an opportunity to have their voice heard.   This is not a State's rights issue, as the administration puts forth.  This is an issue of America's values as a democracy, which is that all  Americans--and that was not always the case, we had to amend the  Constitution of the United States in order to effect that end--that all  Americans have the right and ought to be facilitated in exercising that  right to vote.   Sadly, we know that, notwithstanding the 13th, 14th, and 15th  Amendments, State after State, jurisdiction after jurisdiction, not  solely in the south, adopted policies aimed at preventing the exercise  of the franchise, of preventing the ability to register to vote and to  neuter the vote being cast by redistricting efforts that in effect put  people in a place where they could not elect the person of their  choice.   As a result, millions of Americans after the Voting Rights Act was  adopted were finally able to vote and have their voices heard in their  democracy. However, we ought to be chastened as we consider this  legislation in knowing that for 100 years after the 13th, 14th, and  15th Amendments were adopted, for 100 years, for a century, it was  still necessary for the   John Lewises and the Martin Luther Kings to  march. Some gave their lives to redeem that promise that so many gave  their lives to ensure.   Unfortunately, the Supreme Court struck down the formula for that  preclearance process in 2013 and charged Congress with updating it. We  have responded this day to that charge. Under the previous Republican- led Congress, that charge was ignored.   Again, I would ask my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle  to think of their failure to act. Ronald Reagan said to Gorbachev,  ``Tear down this wall.''   Today, we have an opportunity to tear down the wall of discrimination  and exclusion to millions of Americans who have been confronted with  policies that make it more difficult for them to vote.   I hope the Senate will join us in tearing down this wall of  discrimination, oppression, and exclusion. I continue to believe that  the decision made by the Supreme Court was a bad decision, which did  not reflect the reality of the success of the preclearance provisions  in the Voting Rights Act.   Indeed, Justice Ginsburg pointed out in her dissent that, ``Throwing  out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop  discriminatory changes is like throwing out your umbrella in a  rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   Today, the Democratic-led House will vote to restore the full force  of the Voting Rights Act. And I hope every Republican will join us if  they want to ensure that discriminatory practices do not prevent  citizens from voting.   We have given this bill the designation of H.R. 4. I said in a press  conference a little time ago, H.R. 4, H.R. for the people. Whether you  spell it F-O-R or F-O-U-R, this is for the people, for our democracy,  for justice, for inclusion. We have given this bill the designation of  H.R. 4, appropriately, because it is one of our most important pieces  of legislation. Along with H.R. 1, the For the People Act, which  contained a number of provisions strengthening ballot access, making  voter registration automatic, and expanding early voting, H.R. 4 is  part of the Democrats' effort to protect Americans' fundamental right  to vote.    H.R. 4, my colleagues, restores the full protections of the Voting  Rights Act. As you take your card and contemplate putting it in the  slot and pushing either the green button or the red button, reflect  upon those who died, not only in the civil rights movement, but those  who died on foreign shores defending freedom and democracy. Because as  you vote today, you will be voting to defend or to ignore the  fundamental formula for democracy, which is having people's votes  count.   By updating the preclearance formula requiring reasonable public  notice before changes to voting laws or regulations; permitting the  Attorney General to request the presence of election observers anywhere  there is a threat of racial discrimination at the ballot box--these are  not just State elections, I tell my friends; these are elections, which  impact my constituents in your State and every other State, when they  elect Members of Congress, in the United States Senate--and increasing  accessibility and protections for Native Americans and Alaska-native  voters.   Again, I want to thank Representative Sewell for her leadership in  this effort and   John Lewis and so many other heroes; my friend  Jim  Clyburn, the Democrat whip, who fought for voting rights; for all those  of African American descent who fought for voting rights; for Native  Americans, the first two women of whom we have in the Congress now.   I thank Chairman Nadler for working closely with Terri Sewell and  others to strengthen this legislation by including language to ensure  that jurisdictions that purge voter rolls or reduce early voting  opportunities are subject to preclearance requirements.   It is very nice to say, Well, you can file a suit after the election  is over. You may not have the money to do that, and, in any event, it  is a fait accompli. It is too late. That is why preclearance has been  honored for half a century, and that is why it is so sad that the  Supreme Court set it aside.   And, of course, I want to thank, one more time, my dear friend, John  Lewis, who throughout his lifetime has held up the beloved community.  Voting rights is part of that beloved community. In Selma 54 years ago,  John risked his future, his life and his limb, so every American could  cast a vote.   Today 434 of us ought to join   John Lewis, not walking across the  bridge with Alabama troopers waiting to beat us and confront us, but to  that little box where we have the right to vote. Nobody can stop us  from voting in that box today. Let's make sure that nobody stops any of  our fellow Americans  [[Page H9323]]  from putting their card in that voting slot and making democracy all  that our Founders promised it to be.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  apologize for a little bit of lateness here.   On Monday, Madam Speaker, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning  hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Members are advised that votes on Thursday could occur later than  usual. It is now approximately 12:30 when Members could get out. I want  to make it clear that next Thursday we may go later than the usual time  that Members are expecting to leave.   We will consider several bills, Madam Speaker, under suspension of  the rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by  the close of business today.   The House will consider H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug  Costs Now Act. This legislation would lower prescription drug costs for  every American, as well as level the playing field for American  patients and taxpayers. Last year, House Democrats promised to lower  healthcare costs by lowering the price of prescription drugs for the  people, and we are proud to deliver on that promise this coming week.   In addition, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 729, the  Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act. This bill is a  package of bipartisan legislation that protects vulnerable coastal and  Great Lakes communities impacted by the climate crisis.   Lastly, it is possible the House will consider the NDAA conference  report. Other legislation is possible, as well, as we come to the close  of this first session of the Congress of the United States.    Madam Speaker, the answer is, I hope so. As the gentleman  probably knows, we have made some proposals back. Mr. Neal has talked  to representatives from the Mexican Government about this and  representatives of the Canadian Government about the enforcement issue,  which has been somewhat the holdup.   As the gentleman knows, both the Speaker and I voted for NAFTA. We  believe that what is being worked on now is an improvement to NAFTA,  but it is only an improvement if you can enforce its provisions. As the  gentleman knows, over the last two decades plus, there has been no  successful enforcement action issued under the present NAFTA. When the  Speaker and I voted for NAFTA, we voted for it on the theory that it  could be enforced, and there was a side-bar agreement. Unfortunately,  as the gentleman also knows, the side-bar agreement did not lead to  effective enforcement.   As a result, I know that enforcement is being discussed by Mr.  Lighthizer. And I want to say that we perceive Mr. Lighthizer as  representing the administration and negotiating in good faith and as an  honest broker. We are appreciative of that fact.   But we are now, as I understand it, and don't hold me to this, but as  I understand it, we are in discussions with the Mexican Government as  to whether or not they will agree to some of the enforcement actions,  which implies there is a general agreement between the administration  and ourselves on what should be or could be included to effect  enforcement.   But in answer specifically to the gentleman's question, I will be  very happy if we can get agreement and bring this bill to the floor as  early as next week, if it is ready to come.   Now, the problem is, as the gentleman knows, there is a process that  needs to be effected, but I will tell the gentleman that the Speaker  and I both would like to see this legislation pass as soon as possible,  if, and in the context, we have effective enforcement included.    Madam Speaker, I will say to the gentleman that I don't  accept his premise that Mr. Schiff or the committee spied on anybody.  They do have records, apparently.   The gentleman asked me how deep my knowledge is. And I will tell him,  frankly, not very deep. But I do not accept his premise that either Mr.  Schiff, personally, or the committee spied on people.   They did receive information as a result of subpoenas and discovery  with reference to what was going on, what were the facts, but I would  have to get greater knowledge of the information to give the gentleman  a broader response than that in terms of volume or substance.    Madam Speaker, what we do know, by the facts, is that the  President abused his power.   The gentleman does not want to speak to that, Madam Speaker. We do  know the facts that were testified to in the committee.   The gentleman, like the President, seeks to distract.   I reject out of hand any assertion that either Mr. Schiff or the  committee spied on anybody. Did they pursue discovery so that they  could get the facts and the truth? They did.   I don't know the amount. I am not a member of the committee. I am not  a member of the Intelligence Committee. I am not privy to all the  information that may be available, but I reject, again, out of hand  that either the chairman or the committee spied on people.   The gentleman has been a Member of this body for some period of time,  and I am sure he watched what went on with Benghazi. Thousands and  thousands and thousands of pages were received by subpoena, with  cooperation by the Obama administration. The chairman of the Government  Oversight Committee had thousands and thousands and thousands of pages  of subpoenaed evidence or information.   But I will, frankly, Madam Speaker, look at this information because  I believe it is a very serious and egregious accusation that Mr. Schiff  or the committee spied on anybody.   They may not like the discovery process. They may not like the  information that was complied by the discovery process. They may be  upset that it did not absolve the President of the United States from  clearly abusing his power as President of the United States for his  personal gain. But I have no reason to believe it, and no evidence has  been offered, just a bald-faced assertion that somehow, Madam Speaker,  Mr. Schiff spied on people. I reject that and believe that to be  totally without merit.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman said he was in my position of  not having a lot of information, yet he makes conclusions, assertions,  and accusations that I believe are not based in fact.   He continues the process argument that the Republicans have made over  and over and over and over again. Why? Because they do not want to  address the facts of this case, because they do not believe, correctly,  that the facts are on their side.   I would hope that we could move on. We will see whether there are any  facts to sustain what the Republican whip has asserted. I believe there  are not, but I am not going to continue to argue process here.   There will be a time in the relatively near future when we will argue  substance, the Constitution, the laws in this country, and our oath of  office to protect and defend the Constitution of our country, our  national security, and the integrity of our elections.    Madam Speaker, apparently he got $391 million to say he  wasn't intimidated.   The witnesses to which the Republican whip referred, 75 percent of  those witnesses, three out of four, said they believed that the  offenses that were testified to by some members of the White House  National Security Council, by an Ambassador, by an Under Secretary to  Mr. Pompeo who Mr. Pompeo has said is a very credible individual, they  all testified, and based upon that testimony, witnesses concluded,  three out of four, that, in fact, they believed the offenses that were  discussed were worthy of impeachment.   So, I don't know what hearings the gentleman is listening to, Madam  Speaker, but the hearings that I listened to had three out of four  constitutional experts saying very emphatically that, in fact, if those  facts were true--and, of course, we are not going to try them here.   They are going to be tried in the United States Senate. All we do in  this body under the Constitution is see whether or not, effectively-- although it doesn't say this--there is probable cause to believe that,  in fact, an abuse of power occurred.   The three experts who testified yesterday said it was. One expert  said it was not. So 75 percent of the experts who testified and,  frankly, literally hundreds and thousands of editorial writers, op-ed  writers, citizens of this country have said this is an abuse of power.   The Senate will make that conclusion. They will decide whether or not  in the trial phase of this matter. But to indicate that the evidence is  not overwhelming that was elicited in the hearings by the Intelligence  Committee is simply to see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   One of the facets of this conversation always is that, I believe, the  Republican whip adopts premises that are not supported by the evidence.    Ambassador Sondland, a contributor of $100,000, maybe more, to the  Trump campaign in 2016, appointed by President Donald Trump and sent to  represent the United States abroad, testified that, in fact, he heard  and believed that there was a relationship between releasing the $391  million and having a visit at the White House to confirm the United  States' continuing support for Ukraine, our ally and friend, assaulted  by Russia, which, of course, Putin is pursuing.   Ambassador Sondland made it very clear that those were the conditions  for that money being released. This was not hearsay. This is not  Democrats. This is somebody who was a substantial supporter.   Apparently, the whip believes that if you are a supporter of somebody  else, you must have a bias. So apparently, Ambassador Sondland either  had a bias for or maybe he had a bias against because his testimony is  firsthand, not hearsay, and, in fact, his testimony is there was a  relationship between that.   Now, what I said, Madam Speaker, is not what the Republican whip  attributed to me. What I said was the process, not that we had made any  conclusion at this point, that the process is this House, under the  Constitution, has the responsibility if it believes, and we will see if  the Judiciary Committee concludes that, if it believes that there is  probable cause to think that bribery was committed, an abuse of power  was committed, a solicitation of a foreign government to participate in  America's elections. If it concludes that, then the process is not that  we make the decision that, yes, those are the facts. It is to be tried  in the United States Senate under our Constitution.                                time  1315    They will then conclude, like a jury in any case in our courts will  conclude, whether or not those facts lead to the conclusion that abuse  of power was committed.   I just want to make sure the gentleman characterizes what I said. A  conclusion has not yet been made. What I said was the facts seem to be  pretty clear, however. There does not seem to be much difference.   The President of the United States, himself, gave to us and the  public notes of the conversation he had: By the way, ``I would like you  to do us a favor.'' That was in the context, Madam Speaker, of the  President's withholding $391 million. And, of course, Mr. Mulvaney said  that it happens all the time; get over it.   Well, I don't know whether the American public is going to get over  it or whether the House or the Senate is going to get over it or not.  But that was the attitude of Mr. Mulvaney: Of course we did this. It is  always done. Get over it.   We will see what is concluded.   There is one more point I want to make.  [[Page H9337]]    The gentleman says that over 100 Democrats voted. Three times--in  2017, in 2018, and in 2019--prior to that July 25 phone call, Articles  of Impeachment were filed. Three times, the majority of Democrats voted  not to proceed and moved to table those resolutions. Three times a  majority of Democrats voted. There was no rush to judgment.   And, very frankly, prior to this July 25 phone call and the  whistleblower having the courage to come forward and say to the  inspector general, I think this is of concern, and the inspector  general making a determination that, yes, this was a serious matter  requiring urgent consideration and that being transmitted to here,  before that point, there was a Democratic Party that was saying,  whatever our personal feelings may be about the election or about this  President's operations in office, there was not sufficient evidence on  which to move forward.   We were having hearings, and we said, until the facts are such that  we feel it is timely and appropriate to move, we would not move.   There was no rush to judgment. 2017, 2018, and 2019 rejected a rush  to judgment, a majority of Democrats. I made a couple of motions to  table.   So, Madam Speaker, we are now proceeding, as our constitutional  responsibility dictates that we do, and we will see what happens. But  all this talk about process--and I reject any assertions with respect  to Mr. Schiff and/or the committee--is to distract.   We will focus on the facts; we will focus on the evidence; and we  will focus on what the reasonable conclusions based upon that evidence  will be at some point in time in the future if the Judiciary Committee  makes that determination that they want to recommend the House  considering such action.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, what he said was he thought there was, in fact, a quid  pro quo.   Of course, as the gentleman points out, he had a bias: a substantial  contributor to Mr. Trump, appointed by Mr. Trump as Ambassador to the  European Union.   His response to that question was--I would suggest if there was a  bias from these witnesses that testified yesterday, simply because they  support him, the same would apply to Mr. Sondland. But when asked  whether or not there was a quid pro quo, his answer was yes.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.
