 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  his leadership, and the manager of our friends on the other side of the  aisle.   The United States military, each and every soldier, each and every  member of every single branch, take an oath when they leave their loved  ones and accept the responsibility of dying for this country. If you  have been able to fight on a battlefield and become a veteran, you  still have taken that oath and you were willing to die for this  country.   With the enormous cuts that are facing our soldiers, our families in  this military construction legislation, let me make it plain for my  colleagues. They will deny those who take an oath, Active Duty, their  families, job opportunities. They will deny them housing.   Has anyone been to bases and seen some of the military housing that  needs absolute either rebuild or rehab?   Have you understood the importance of food assistance, particularly  to veterans' families depending on that?   Do they know how important it is for the soldiers to feed their  families, to keep roofs over their heads?   Do they know how important it is to provide education and training  opportunities for those who leave the United States military?   Let me remind you of the importance of their oath, and then let me  remind you of the hard-earned work that this Congress did with  President Biden to provide the PACT Act. The proposed cuts would have  drastic consequences for the PACT Act. That is the bill that recognizes  the toxicity that our brave men and women were in while they were  fighting battles. That exposure fund could lead to slashing the medical  care resources in the fund by 86 percent and fully abandoning the toxic  exposure fund next year.   Are we defaulting on our commitment to those who took the oath to die  for this Nation? I think that is worthy of shame.   Cities will be vulnerable when their veterans do not have the  resources that are necessary for them to have.    Mr. Speaker, can you imagine the burden on local  cities?   Our veterans are homeless. Our veterans are suffering, many times  from PTSD, and if we do not have the kind of support services for them  that this legislation provides, where are we in terms of the kind of  housing and other assistance that they may need?   I just simply ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, we stand  here on the floor, I am fighting for the cities and the States that  receive these dollars ultimately, because that is where the people are.   I do want to oppose the bills that are endangering our endangered  species, S.J. Res. 9 and H.R. 4366. I oppose endangering our endangered  species.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 4366, Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act, 2024.   This is a bill that appropriates funding for our military, the  Department of Veteran Affairs, and other related agencies for fiscal  year 2024.   I strongly oppose this bill's realignment of military construction  funding from priority projects to other less relevant projects.   The level of funding allocations in this bill does not help the  Veteran Affairs to support key priorities of its Administration such as  ending veteran homelessness, increasing access to mental healthcare,  and providing suicide prevention services, as well as investments in  other critical areas, including caregiver support programs, overdose  prevention, and treatment programs.   While it is important to make annual adjustments to bills such as  this, our national strategic planning cannot be based on vague  predictions; it must present a concrete plan that goes beyond the  current year.   This Congress, and other relevant elements of the U.S. government  should focus on a real integrated strategy that considers all aspects  of national security spending while also helping to protect our  veterans.   Any reckless policies that attempt to claw back billions in funding  for veterans' medical care would have negative impact on our veterans  and put their healthcare in jeopardy.   This bill should reflect efforts by the Congress to secure protection  for adequate funding to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs  will be able to continue to spend those essential resources for  veterans' medical care.   Doubling down on the Default on America Act by cutting over $142  billion in funding does nothing but hurts our veterans, farmers, and  their families by denying them access vital programs that they rely on.   Surprisingly, Republicans do not want to end there; recent reports  indicate that they want to go up to over $159 billion in funding cuts,  and even as high as $189 billion with their insatiable desire for  drastic cuts in funding for programs that support American families.   Republicans need to stand by their word and let this House and the  American people know where they stand on their support for veterans.   Any radical cuts in funding by Republicans to the Department of  Housing and Urban Development would be devastating to more than 50,000  veterans who rely on the Housing Choice Vouchers for their housing  needs.   Cutting funding to the Department of Labor by as high as 30 percent  would result in more than 4,200 veterans losing the job training,  counseling, and job readiness services they so desperately need; a  group that is already either experiencing or at risk of homelessness.   Earlier versions of Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  appropriations bill that Republicans supported in subcommittee provided  for the transfer of $4.5 billion in critical funding for veterans'  medical care to other purposes.   The Republican-backed bill, if passed, could have resulted in drastic  cuts to dedicated funding for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, burn  pits, and other toxic substances.   Republican proposed cuts would have drastic consequences for the PACT  Act Toxic Exposures Fund and could lead to slashing the medical care  resources in the Fund by 86 percent, and fully abandoning the Toxic  Exposures Fund next year.   I, along with my Democrat colleagues, will continue to work with  veterans' organizations to ensure that this bill does not pass with  these unreasonable cuts to critical programs and services that veterans  across the country depend on.   Congress cannot renege on the pledge and promises that are contained  in the PACT Act; to provide the necessary, dedicated, funding; this  bill requires nothing short of full funding for the Toxic Exposures  Fund.   Even with all these necessary measures, the 2024 Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies funding bill still  [[Page H3972]]  falls short of our commitment to veterans, servicemembers, and their  families.   This Committee should not pass a bill that cuts military construction  by billions of dollars in effort to cut down on the entire process of  funding the government.   Through the PACT Act, the Biden administration continue to deliver  its promise to better serve and better take care of our veterans of all  wars who have been exposed to harmful chemicals like Agent Orange, burn  pits, and other toxic substances.   That funding for toxic exposures should not have to compete with  other discretionary priorities; it should complement other funding  sources.   In addition to these drastic cuts, Section 258 of H.R. 4366 would  prevent the VA from using funds to implement, administer, or carry out  the Interim Final Rule (IFR) published on September 9, 2022, which  expanded access to abortion for certain veterans, a provision which  also prevents the VA from providing needed care to veterans when the  health of the woman is endangered.   Our country must ensure that the department of Veteran Affairs is  able to provide access to abortions, especially in instances where the  life or health of the pregnant veteran would be endangered if the  pregnancy were carried to term, or when a pregnancy is the result of  rape or incest.   Sections 414, 415, and 417 of this H.R. 4366 further outline  provisions that seek to limit efforts by the Federal Government to  implement a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all,  including people of color and others who have been historically  underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent  poverty, inequality, and diversity.   In its current state, this bill would prevent the Veteran Affairs  from using funds to display any but the listed flags, intended to  prevent the Veteran Affairs from displaying flags demonstrating support  for historically marginalized groups such as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,  Transgender, Queer, and Intersex veterans.   This would indiscriminately undermine same sex marriage while also  unduly complicating the routine business of the Department to provide  healthcare and other services for veterans.   The President's budget proposal presents a viable solution to provide  desperately needed funding for construction projects and the military  construction bill must prove to support the President's commitments to  our veterans.   Any real, pragmatic progress in Veteran Affairs' infrastructure  backlog requires dedicated investment in our facilities outside the  normal discretionary funding streams.   It is my sincere hope that this military construction appropriation  would ensure the quality of care at Veteran Affair's facilities for our  veterans and Veteran Affairs employees.   As our military leadership has indicated, 30 percent of our military  infrastructure worldwide remains in poor condition; cutting funding for  military construction is not a viable solution to this problem.   With the present need to address recruitment and retention problem  that currently faces our military, and to ensure a major quality of  life issue for our servicemembers, we cannot afford these senseless  cuts to military construction funding.   I cannot support the passage of this military construction bill  because our nation cannot to backtrack on our commitment to our  servicemembers and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in opposition to S.J. Res. 9, a resolution that  provides for congressional disapproval to legislatively de-list the  lesser prairie-chicken from protection under the Endangered Species  Act.   Specifically, this bill calls on Congress to disapprove the rules  submitted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service relating to  protections for endangered and threatened wildlife and plants.   The population and habitat of the lesser prairie-chicken, an  endangered southwestern prairie grouse, is under growing threat.   Originally numbering in the millions, the population of this bird has  decreased by as much as 97%, and it now only inhabits 16% of its former  habitat.   Aerial survey results from 2012 through 2022 estimate a 5-year  average lesser prairie-chicken population of 32,210 across the five- state region in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, as well as my  state of Texas.   The conversion of natural grasslands to agriculture, energy  development, fire suppression, drought, and the use of herbicides to  kill Shinnery Oak habitat are all ongoing challenges that cause habitat  loss and fragmentation.   Additional harm is caused to these birds' habitats by fencing, power  wires, and other tall structures that entice perching by predatory  animals.   The lesser prairie-chicken is a sign of healthy prairies and  grasslands because it requires huge, undamaged natural grassland  parcels to support self-sustaining populations.   This makes them a crucial indicator of the general well-being of  America's grasslands, a treasured and iconic terrain.   It is essential that we work together to uphold the Endangered  Species Act (ESA), which is responsible for the recovery of iconic  species like the bald eagle.   I urge my colleagues to support science-based decisions and join me  in opposing this bill, S.J. Res. 9.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in opposition to S.J. Res. 24, which relates to  the endangered species status of the Northern Long-Eared Bat.   S.J. Res. 24 is a resolution of congressional disapproval to  legislatively down-list the Northern Long-Eared Bat from ``endangered''  to ``threatened.''   Not only would this downgrade the Northern Long-Eared Bat's status  today, but it would effectively block the species from being moved up  to a higher endangered threat level, no matter how close the species  comes to extinction.   It would be irresponsible to use extreme legislation, not science, to  down-list the Northern Long-Eared Bat, thereby effectively scaling back  its protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).   Without ESA protections, states, industries, and other entities will  have little incentive to conserve or recover the Northern Long-Eared  Bat.   It is highly likely that the bat populations would likely dwindle  further towards extinction.   Moreover, by using the Congressional Review Act Process, this  Congress is effectively limiting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  from making similar future listings for this bat species.   This move would prevent the agency from using its discretion to take  the necessary measures for species conservation and will impede long  term recovery efforts.   Ultimately, Congressional action in this arena gives industries, not  science, the upper hand in species listings.   It is clear that some of my colleagues are doing the bidding of the  timber and agriculture industries, despite the consequences that  Northern Long-Eared Bat extinction could have on biodiversity and long- term agriculture and timber industry practices.   Down-listing this species would be especially dangerous in the  current moment because the Northern Long-Eared Bat population is  actively under threat from white nose syndrome, a deadly fungus that  has caused a rapid decline in bat populations.   The Northern Long-Eared Bat's current endangered status provides  adequate protections while wildlife scientists work to address the  underlying causes of white-nose syndrome.   More broadly, Congress should not be interfering with the work of the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under its Endangered Species Act  authority.   Species populations are constantly fluctuating based on environmental  factors, invasive species, climate change, and other emerging threats.   To remain up to date, the ESA requires periodic study and updates to  ensure protections align with the best available science.   By blocking future up-listing decisions, using the Congressional  Review Act undercuts the ESA's inherent flexibility and agencies'  science-based decision-making for species conservation.   I urge my colleagues to support science-based decisions for  endangered and threatened species and oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today to salute our friend  and patriot, Joyce Hamlett.   It is a surprise for some of us who wish that the news was not  accurate, but I cannot miss an opportunity to call her a historic  figure in this House.   Joyce made history as being named the custodian, the protector, of  the mace. I can assure you, she handles this historic responsibility  with grace, firmness, leadership, patriotism, and a love of country.   I do want to say that Joyce was a hero on January 6, 2021. It was  Joyce's face that we looked at to get the original charge of getting to  safety, of ensuring that the doors were closed. I heard her voice, and  I saw her pointing, giving instructions to make sure that as Members  finally discovered that we were under attack, we would be safe. She did  not move to protect herself. She stood fast to ensure that Members had  the right information to be able to be taken to or rush to safety.   Her family loves her. We don't realize that she has a wonderful  responsibility of her grandchildren, and they have grown up under her.  I have watched that happen.   Mr. Speaker, finally, let me say this: We will lose a great American.  I hope as she goes in another direction, there will be others blessed  by this grande dame, if you will, and this great American, a person who  will always love this institution.   We will always love Joyce Hamlett and respect her for her service to  the Nation.   God bless her, and God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
