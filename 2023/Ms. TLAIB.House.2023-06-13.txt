 Madam Speaker, for far too long for-profit charter schools  have operated without accountability. Without the necessary oversight  for charter schools, our children will continue to suffer while  taxpayers bankroll charter school fraud, waste, and abuse.   I know our children deserve better, and this is why this week I am  introducing the Charter Oversight, Accountability, and Transparency  Act, which we call the COAT Act. I am doing this with Representative  Bowman and Representative Wilson to help strengthen our country's  public education system by promoting the same type of accountability  from charter schools nationwide that the law requires of our public  school systems.   Charter schools are publicly funded, Madam Speaker, but are managed  by private charter management organizations. This bill would require  these management organizations to file financial disclosures to the  Department of Education in order to receive Federal Elementary and  Secondary Education Act funds.   Michigan's experiment with charters has led to a system of poor-run  schools for for-profit companies, failing thousands of our students.  The COAT Act is commonsense legislation that will increase transparency  and accountability to ensure that charter schools provide necessary  information to local, State, and Federal agencies to detect and prevent  fraud and abuse.                     Ending Auto Insurance Discrimination     Mr. Speaker, I don't know what our education level,  marital status, or credit scores have to do with how much our auto  insurance rates should be. The Prohibit Auto Insurance Discrimination  Act, PAID Act, that I introduced with Congresswoman Watson Coleman, who  has led this effort, as well as Congressman Takano, would end insurance  discrimination.   It would prohibit auto insurance companies from using our education  levels, occupation, employment status, credit scores, previous insurer  information, ZIP Code, census tracts, or homeownership status in  insurance rating or underwriting decisions.   Auto insurance discrimination continues to keep our residents in the  cycle of poverty, Mr. Speaker.   Your education level, ZIP Code, and marital status don't determine  whether or not you are a good driver; neither does your credit score.  Yet our neighbors, especially in Detroit, regularly face higher auto  insurance rates than other folks.   Someone with a perfect driving record--no tickets, crashes, or  claims--who has poor credit can pay hundreds of thousands of dollars  more for auto insurance, sometimes twice as much. I read somewhere that  somebody with a DUI, drinking under the influence, with a higher credit  score was paying three times less than someone with a lower credit  score but no DUI violation.   We must stop the predatory discrimination practices by auto insurance  companies. This is why I urge my colleagues to support the PAID Act to  help level the playing field and eliminate factors, proxies to  discriminate, that contribute to our growing inequality.                             Honoring Ruth Ellis     Mr. Speaker, during Pride Month, I honor a trailblazer in  our community, Mother Ruth Ellis, a former Detroit resident who was the  oldest surviving open lesbian and an LGBTQ+ rights activist.   She was born in 1899, living until the age of 101. She came out as a  lesbian around 1915. She took in unhoused LGBTQ+ youth, and her home  became known as a refuge for LGBTQ+ young people. We now lovingly call  it the Ruth Ellis Center.   Not only did she give shelter to our young people but provided books,  food, even assistance with college education. Around 40 percent of our  unhoused youth today are LGBTQ+.   My team and I were proud to secure $1 million in Federal funding for  the Ruth Ellis Center in our community to honor Mother Ruth Ellis and  her lifesaving work. Mr. Speaker, the center  [[Page H2817]]  provides safe, affordable, identity-affirming housing for those in  need, especially, again, our LGBTQ+ young people.   This month, as we celebrate Pride Month, we recognize and honor the  legacy of Ruth Ellis and the incredible advocacy of the Ruth Ellis  Center and their team.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I don't think my colleagues on the other side  are aware that it is Gun Violence Awareness Month, which should  actually be every month.   We have already had over 290 mass shootings this year. That is more  mass shootings than days in the year.   It is time for us to come together to try to address the horrific gun  crisis. It is tearing our communities apart, Mr. Speaker, by our  legislative inaction every single day.   So how do we start Gun Violence Awareness Month?   They are pushing a bill that would make mass shootings even more  deadly. You heard that right, Mr. Speaker. The plan is for them to  raise awareness around gun violence in our country, to make it more  horrific and more deadly, and to ensure it impacts more American  families than ever before by making it easier to access stabilizing  braces that have been misused and that have been used for mass  shootings.   It is not just mass shootings, Mr. Speaker. It is everyday violence  that doesn't even make the news anymore.   It is a travesty that campaign cash from the NRA, gun manufacturers,  and the pro-death lobby have blocked the major reforms we need to keep  our communities safe.   Our communities need an assault weapons ban. We need reforms on  handguns and bold initiatives to reduce the number of firearms in our  communities. Most of all, Mr. Speaker, we need accountability for the  people who are causing this violence because the gun violence crisis is  enabling more people in power unwilling to do anything to stop the mass  murder of countless Americans, especially our children.    I look forward to supporting future legislation that truly does fight  the crisis with the urgency it deserves instead of pouring more fuel on  the fire like this disgusting Republican bill.
