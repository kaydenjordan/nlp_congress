 Mr. Speaker, today President Trump went to a  foreign country and criticized his own country, the United States of  America, while bowing and scraping to a foreign dictator, Putin.   Americans must ask this obvious question, and it is: Why does  President Trump refuse to criticize Vladimir Putin about anything?   It must be because Putin knows something about President Trump that  President Trump doesn't want the rest of us to know. If that is true,  then President Trump has put his own well-being and interests above  those of the Nation.   And that, Mr. Speaker, is the essence of betrayal. His actions have  betrayed the confidence and the trust of the American people and could  be called treasonous.   Sadly, Trump's supporters must look at themselves and think whether  or not they were sold out by the dog whistle ``Make America Great  Again.'' They must now realize that the President has subjected himself  to domination by the leader of the international white nationalist  movement, Vladimir Putin.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York for the time today to address this august body.   Let me first compliment the gentlewoman from Washington, D.C.,  Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, a true legal scholar, a legal  patriot, and a fighter for justice throughout her life.   Mr. Speaker, I want to issue this quote to you: ``No President has  ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more  backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.''   Mr. Speaker, those were the first words spoken by Supreme Court  nominee Brett Kavanaugh, introduced to the American people during  President Trump's prime-time reality show announcement this past Monday  night.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to voice my deep concerns regarding the  President's nomination of Judge Kavanaugh  [[Page H6254]]  for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States of  America. It is more than a little disquieting that the first thing to  come from a newly named Supreme Court nominee's mouth was a  demonstrably false statement claiming that the search to replace  retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy was one of the most far-reaching and  thorough in the history of the republic.   The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that President Trump nominated Brett  Kavanaugh from a preapproved list of prospective right-wing ideologue  nominees prepared by the extremist Heritage Foundation, in consultation  with the cultish right-wing Federalist Society, each of those nominees  having been certified as having passed the Federalist Society, Heritage  Foundation litmus test on overturning Roe v. Wade and striking down  critical protections in our current healthcare system.   Just 10 days after Justice Kennedy announced his retirement, Judge  Kavanaugh makes the absurd statement that no President has ever  consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds  to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.   We have come to expect knowing false Trumpian statements from the  President's employees, his doctor, communications directors, his press  secretaries, but not from a nominee for the branch of government  designated to be a check on his administration.   In just a few words, Judge Kavanaugh aligned himself with the likes  of erstwhile press secretary Sean Spicer, who claimed that Trump's  inauguration crowd was larger than Obama's. He put himself in the same  league with the disgraced doctor who felt it necessary to tell the  world the spurious claim that the President was the healthiest human  being in world history.   That a distinguished Federal appellate judge felt the need to debase  himself with obvious untruths just moments after his nomination to the  highest court in the land was announced should cause each and every one  of us to fear that a Justice Kavanaugh would willingly prostrate  himself before a demanding President if called upon to do so.   Moreover, each and every one of us has good cause to believe that the  nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is a blatant attempt by President Trump  to dominate the judiciary.                                time  2045    A President with the power and the predisposition to place his heavy  hand on the delicate scales of justice would inevitably lead our dear  Nation to the precipice of a constitutional crisis. That is why it is  of such concern to me that nominee Kavanaugh felt it necessary to  flatter this insecure President during their prime time reality show at  the White House last week.   In Washington, we talk a lot about the balance of powers, but at  home, in Georgia, we feel it. We feel the 5-4 Shelby decision striking  down important parts of the Voting Rights Act. We feel Roe v. Wade  guaranteeing women the right to choose. We feel Citizens United. And we  feel Brown v. Board of Education. We recall the power of the courts to  decide so much more than individual cases. We have seen its ability to  change the course of history. When one considers the U.S. Supreme  Court's decision in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, we know firsthand  that the U.S. Supreme Court can turn the American Dream into the  American nightmare.   Without digressing, I must point out that to conclude that a  sycophantic debut is where Judge Kavanaugh's problems begin and end  would be dangerously naive. The briefest of examinations of his record  reveals numerous positions contrary to the values held by most  Americans.   He has opposed EPA protections, workers' rights, consumer  protections, and the right to choose. And his personal statements call  to question his ability to be an independent check on the President,  such as his declarations that investigations of presidents should be  deferred while that president is in office, and his opinion that a  sitting president is immune from criminal charges.   These statements should be particularly troubling for all Americans,  as the Supreme Court may soon be called upon to consider whether  President Trump can be subpoenaed to appear before a Federal grand  jury, or whether a sitting president can be indicted. Our democracy  will need an unbiased and principled Supreme Court functioning at its  finest, with due respect for the rule of law, when that time comes, and  a justice who has prejudged, as Judge Kavanaugh has, would jeopardize  that responsibility.   To avoid any appearance of impropriety, the Senate should not  consider a Supreme Court appointment from a president who is under the  cloud of investigation for conspiracy to violate the law and the  obstruction of that investigation. Judge Kavanaugh's statements clearly  make him suspect, and his confirmation would undermine the credibility  of the Nation's highest court and impugn that court's ability to  protect public confidence in the rule of law.   With this cloud hanging over Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, it is  necessary that the Senate refrain and keep with its tradition and  follow the McConnell rule. Elections are less than 4 months away and we  should allow the American people to speak at the ballot box before the  Senate is asked to confirm a nominee for the highest court in the land.  The delay would help ensure that Justice Kennedy's replacement is free  from suspicion and bias and the inability to appreciate balance of  powers concerns.   Judge Kavanaugh has gone beyond his clear proclivity for being an  activist judge out of line with the rest of the country. He has  revealed himself to be beholden to another branch of government, which  would imperil our Constitution's delicate balance of powers.   Americans deserve a United States Supreme Court justice who is up to  the task of protecting the rule of law without fear or favor, and,  unfortunately, Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is ill-considered, ill- timed, and should not move forward.
