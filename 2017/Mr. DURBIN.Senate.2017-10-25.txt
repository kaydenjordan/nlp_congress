 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and the  Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, for his statement on this Trump tax  plan. I think he really has summarized in his statement the concerns  many of us have.   We are concerned that the Trump tax plan will do several things. It  will cut funds for education in America at a time when we need it now  more than ever to prepare our people for the jobs of the future. It  endangers Medicare, a program that for almost 50 million Americans is  critical for the healthcare they receive. At the same time, it is going  to dramatically increase the deficit. For so long, we have heard from  the Republicans that their No. 1 issue was cutting the deficit, and now  they come up with a tax plan that will increase the size of our  deficit. Finally, of course, all of this is being done to create tax  breaks for the wealthy and the biggest corporations in America.   Here are the simple facts: As a percentage of our gross domestic  product, corporate profits in America have never been higher. Corporate  profits have never been higher. As a percentage of the gross domestic  product, corporate Federal taxes paid have never been lower. Profits  never higher, taxes never lower, and the Trump tax plan says: Let's cut  corporate taxes even more, and then let's cut taxes on the  [[Page S6780]]  wealthiest people even more. That is not a fair tax plan. It is not a  fair tax reform.   The Trump tax plan sadly rewards the biggest corporations and the  wealthiest individuals at the cost of cutting education, endangering  Medicare, and unfortunately increasing the deficit, to be paid for by  our children. The tax break for the wealthiest people in the Trump tax  plan doesn't go to the rich. It doesn't even go to the very rich. It  goes to the superrich--the superrich. Who am I talking about? The one- tenth of 1 percent. The highest incomes in America--way beyond the  rich. It is not a person who drives a big limousine; it is a person who  is never going to drive the rest of their lives and owns a big yacht.  Those folks--the one-tenth of 1 percent--get 40 percent of all the tax  breaks in the Trump tax plan. That may be good news for the President  and his colleagues and friends and even his family; it is not good news  for working Americans. To think that we would cut education, endanger  Medicare, and increase the deficit to give that level of income, the  wealthiest people in our country, such a tax break is hard to imagine.   Sadly, one of the provisions in the Trump tax plan creates an  incentive for companies to move jobs overseas, because they will have a  lower tax rate if they do. Think about that. A President who has told  us over and over again that we want to ``make America great again''  creates a tax program to incentivize businesses to locate overseas and  make their profits overseas. That makes no sense whatsoever, but that  is the Trump tax plan. I am glad Senator Schumer brought that up.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr.  Heinrich), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), and the Senator from  New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Rohingya are one of many ethnic  groups, largely Muslim, who have been living for centuries in Burma and  now in Myanmar, with the majority of them in the western coastal  Rakhine State.   Deep-seated misconceptions about their roots and faith have led to  decades of discrimination, about which many of us are aware because of  press reports. They have been denied citizenship, had their movement  restricted, and have been deprived of basic healthcare. It is no wonder  that the Rohingya people are considered to be one of the most  persecuted minorities in the world.   Today, as a result of a military crackdown against them in the  Rakhine State--an overzealous, disproportionate response to attacks on  security outposts by some militants last October and then again this  August--countless Rohingya have been brutally killed, and more than  600,000 have fled to overwhelmed and desperate camps in neighboring  Bangladesh.   The scorched-earth tactic by the Burmese military has left hundreds  of villages literally burned to the ground, and the reports of rape,  starvation, mass killing--even reports of security forces burning  people, babies, alive--have been horrifying. Satellite images and maps  indicate that the destruction by the Burmese military is not episodic,  it is systematic.   In Bangladesh, aid groups have been unable to keep up with the influx  of refugees. The unprecedented scale of the crisis and the lack of  infrastructure in the makeshift camps have created significant gaps in  access to food, medical care, and even safety and shelter.   The international community has condemned the violence against the  Rohingya, and rightly so.   Countries around the world--reputable international human rights  organizations such as the Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International,  and even the U.N.--have denounced the military's campaign against the  Rohingya.   In a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva last month,  the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein,  called the Burmese military operation against the Rohingya people ``a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing.''   Many of my colleagues in this Chamber joined me when I introduced S.  Res. 250 to condemn these atrocities, and a large group of us also  wrote to the administration recently to urge Secretary Tillerson and  Administrator Green to help resolve the crisis and provide critically  needed aid.   Just yesterday, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, my  friend and colleague, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, labeled the  crisis a ``genocide.'' Yet Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of  Burma, the Nobel laureate, has largely done and said too little.   I have followed Aung San Suu Kyi over the years. I joined many of my  colleagues in praising her struggle for democracy. After 15 years under  house arrest, she and the National League for Democracy won a landslide  victory in the first national vote since Burma's transition to civilian  rule in 2015, more than two decades after her party was denied its  victory in the 1990 election.   I admired her so much for her nonviolent struggle for political  freedom and human rights. And while I recognize she still has a fragile  relationship with the Burmese military, which still has considerable  power, I am sadly disappointed in her lack of leadership when it comes  to the plight of the Rohingya people--her fellow countrymen--men and  women who are in a desperate situation.   She claims she is committed to restoring peace and the rule of law.  Yet she has spoken of so-called allegations and counterallegations  instead of addressing the widespread, well-documented abuses by her own  country's security forces.   I was glad that Aung San Suu Kyi in 2016 appointed investigators, led  by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who recommended this  summer that Burma review a 1982 law that strips most Rohingya of  citizenship. Yet the Burmese Government has yet to implement any of the  Commission's recommendations and further continues to deny access to  the Rakhine State to other U.N. investigators, journalists, and NGO  groups. Some officials have even accused the Rohingya of faking rape  and faking the burning of their own homes. What a preposterous claim.   I recognize the dramatic progress Burma has made over the years. It  will take a long time to overcome many of the challenges in such a  young democracy, and I understand that Aung San Suu Kyi, as State  Counselor, has a limited role under the power-sharing agreement with  her military, which has largely been responsible for the violence I  have described. But I would urge her to live up to her own words upon  delivering her Nobel Peace Prize lecture in 2012 to address the  historic and brutal suppression of the Rohingya and support ethnic  reconciliation in Burma. In fact, Aung San Suu Kyi quoted the following  passages from the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1948, as the  answer to why she fought for democracy and human rights in her home  country in Burma. She said:         [D]isregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in       barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind,       and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy       freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want       has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common       people,        [I]t is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have       recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and       oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule       of law.    These are wise words used by Aung San Suu Kyi when she received her  Nobel Prize. They are words that apply today to this crisis within her  own country.   I am committed to doing what I can in Congress to hold those in the  Burmese military personally accountable for the reprehensible human  rights violations against the Rohingya.   I want to note that I have also had the opportunity over the October  recess to meet with some members of the Rohingya community who have  resettled in my home State of Illinois over the years.   About 1,500 Rohingya people live in the Chicagoland area. Among them  is Nasir Zakaria. He helped found the Rohingya Culture Center in  Chicago--the first Rohingya community center in America. The center  helps provide a safe, familiar space for Rohingya people new to the  country, as well as critically needed resources, such as translators,  ESL and computer classes, help with paperwork, and much more.   When I met Nasir and the other members of the community about a week  ago with my wife, they told me about the phone calls and photos they  receive late at night from family and friends fleeing the violence,  looking for safety in Bangladesh.  [[Page S6822]]    I also heard from community members who recently returned from a  medical mission to Bangladesh. They showed me the photos they brought  back. One food line to feed refugees was literally 1 mile long.  Healthcare is limited. Safe drinking water is limited. Cholera is  detected. It is a horrible situation for these people who have been  tossed out of Myanmar and now are trying just to survive nearby  Bangladesh. The stories are horrific, and they are all the same.    Here is an image of this exodus that was printed in the New York  Times. It shows families fleeing Burma across the border to Bangladesh  with smoke rising in the background from the villages that they lived  in being burned.   The stories I heard were of helpless, poor families walking on foot  through jungles, crowding in boats along the Naf River, leaving behind  everything with accountings of rape, killing, and arson by the Burmese  military. They arrive in Bangladesh sick, exhausted, and desperately in  need of the most basic things--food, clean water, medicine, a safe  space to rest their heads.   Here is another image, which is heartbreaking. It is an indication of  what happens in the refugee camps when food arrives, this time in a  camp known as Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.   A UNICEF report last week stated that 58 percent of the refugees who  have poured into Cox's Bazar are children, noting that they are in hell  on Earth. They are acutely malnourished, they need clean water and  vaccines, and they are at risk of exploitation by traffickers. This is  unacceptable.   I understand that Bangladesh and Burma have discussed a repatriation  plan recently, but many refugees don't have any documents. They were  literally burned out of their homes. We need to call on the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees. Filippo Grandi was in my office last week,  and he stressed how important it is for us to speak up and to help on  this issue, that we ensure the voluntary right of return and we ensure  the safety of those who do return and we make sure that the paper  requirements for return are reasonable for people who are literally  homeless and stateless at this moment.   Many are wary of returning without an assurance of full citizenship,  given the risk of further persecution or the threat of being placed in  camps in Myanmar when they return. I don't blame them, because the  atrocities committed against the Rohingya over the past months and  weeks are not new by any means.   Nasir Zakaria in Chicago told me that more than three decades ago,  when he was only 14, he was kidnapped by militants targeting the  Rohingya in Burma. He never saw his parents again.   Nasir eventually escaped to Bangladesh, made his way to Malaysia,  where he worked for 18 years in construction before he finally made it  to the United States with a green card in 2013. He learned English,  worked as a dishwasher in a hotel near Chicago, supported his wife and  three children, met others in the community, and helped to create the  Rohingya Center that I visited.   Here is a picture of Nasir Zakaria with his son, Mohamed, in their  Chicago apartment. You can see the American flag in the background. He  is very proud of this Nation that he now calls home.   The Rohingya Culture Center provides critical resources to more than  400 families in the Chicago area, one of the largest concentrations of  Rohingya refugees in America. More than three decades after Nasir first  escaped Burma, the Rohingya continue to be attacked and demonized.   Let me close by saying that we met today with the Myanmar Ambassador.  Seven Senators sat down with him and expressed the sentiments that I  have included in this statement.   First, let me give Mr. U Aung Lynn, the Ambassador, credit for coming  to the meeting. He knew what we were going to raise. Yet he came, he  took notes, and he assured us that he would respond to this; that we  would be able to come back in a week or two for a progress report on  what is being done; that he would allow or plead for access of U.N.  personnel, as well as NGO groups, into the northern Rakhine area  currently being denied access; that he would personally make it clear  to his government we want those responsible for these atrocities held  accountable. We want to make certain, as well, that those who are  repatriated have a fair chance to return to a safe atmosphere in  Myanmar and, ultimately, for citizenship.   It was a long list of requirements and requests that we gave to the  Ambassador. He took them all in a positive way and told us he would be  back to us in a matter of a week or two with a progress report.   Let me close by appealing to Aung San Suu Kyi to help resolve this  crisis. I am counting on her. I do believe she is a good person. I hope  that she will respond to this crisis in her own country the way she  stood up with so much courage before.   I plan to meet with this Ambassador in a few weeks to chart the  progress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on a  bipartisan basis to end this ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people in  Myanmar. We cannot allow the Burmese military to commit these  atrocities.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
