 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 2 years ago, I spoke to a gathering of  friends of Israel. At the time, I was working to advance pro-Israel  legislation to combat the BDS movement.  [[Page S2747]]  This was a far-left effort to create worldwide anti-Israel boycotts. I  was struck, at the time, by the opposition to the bill from the far  left, and I said the Democrats had to stand up to the growing chorus of  anti-Israel voices in their own ranks or we would all come to regret  it.   Well, fast-forward to today. Our friends in Israel are now in their  second week of a difficult counterterrorism campaign. They are  responding to unprovoked rocket attacks raining down on their people.  Predictably, the radical fringe has leapt to excuse the acts of terror  and, of course, blame Israel, as usual. But, now, disproportionate  pressure is not only being placed on Israel by far-left activists. Now,  sitting Members of Congress are actually joining in. One Democratic  House Member has lately called Israel an ``apartheid state.'' Another  said it is guilty of ``terrorist acts.''   For a long time, Republicans and Democrats have stood together in  standing with Israel. I am proud of all of the work we have  accomplished together, like improving Israel's Iron Dome defenses,  providing precision-guided munitions and Joint Strike Fighters, and  collaborating on counter-tunneling technology to thwart terrorists.  These bipartisan efforts have paid dividends for Israel and for the  United States.   As recently as 2014, during the last major conflict between Israel  and Hamas, most Democrats stood unhesitatingly with Republicans to  unequivocally condemn Hamas and support Israel. But, now, rather than  having Israel's back, senior Democrats have actually pressured Israel  to end its defensive operations. They have called for a ceasefire and  urged leaders to strive for peace through a negotiated two-state  solution--as if Israeli Prime Ministers from across the political  spectrum haven't made good faith efforts in the past toward peace.   Of course, in this case, Israel is not fighting the Palestinian  Authority. They are not up against the Palestinian Authority. They are  not at war with the Palestinian people. They are fighting Hamas.  Everybody around here surely knows by now that Hamas is a terrorist  group that opposes a two-state solution. They want Israel destroyed.  That is who this fight is between--Israel and Hamas--not the  Palestinian Authority, not the Palestinian people. It is between Israel  and Hamas, Israel versus terrorists.   So let's dispense with this ``both sides'' nonsense. Only one side  has taken credible steps toward peace, and even when rocketed by  terrorists, Israel takes extraordinary pains to avoid harming  civilians. This includes giving advance warning to Palestinian  civilians in the places they are about to strike. It calls them up in  advance and says: Get out of there. We are about to strike.   Frankly, Israel is taking more care to protect Palestinian civilians  than is Hamas, which intentionally hides behind innocent people in  violation of the laws of war and then exploits their deaths to advance  the cause. Hamas doesn't represent Palestinians any more than it  represents the rest of the region's Arabs, which is to say, not at all.   For decades, administrations mistakenly assumed the road to Middle  East peace led through agreement between Israel and the Palestinians  and that nothing else could be addressed until this was resolved. In  reality, the previous administration facilitated the Abraham Accords--a  historic step that helped Israel normalize relationships with majority- Muslim countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Sudan.  Morocco normalized its relationship as well. This progress toward  peace, based on shared geopolitical and economic interests, came in  spite of intransigence from leaders in Gaza.   Now the Biden administration wants to deny this historic progress. A  few days ago, the President's spokeswoman argued incredibly that with  respect to the prior administration, ``We don't think they did anything  constructive''--really?--regarding ``the longstanding conflict in the  Middle East.'' Really? The recognition between Israel and four Arab  countries is not progress? Give me a break.   Now, as Israel battles terrorists, the Democratic chairman of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee indicated this week that he might try  to obstruct the supply of precision technologies that helps Israel  avoid civilian casualties. How does that make sense? And remember that  Chairman Meeks only chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee because the  far-left primaried the previous chairman--a staunch Democratic  supporter of Israel--right out of his seat in Congress. You can see  where the far left is trending. This effort to block arms sales is  basically the same play that some Democrats ran with Saudi Arabia and  the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. Let's just think about that.  Fortunately, the latest reports suggest the chairman may be backing  down from this. I certainly hope so.   Yet the White House still can't give a straight answer on whether and  when we will help Israel replenish the Iron Dome system that protects  its citizens. Leading Democrats are even talking about easing sanctions  on the Iranian regime, which helps fund terrorist proxies like Hamas  and keeps their rocket arsenals full. They come from Iran--and the  administration still proposes to cut our own U.S. defense funding after  inflation.   So, listen. Israel's enemies are watching--make no mistake--not just  Hamas but Hezbollah and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. We  cannot send the signal that terrorist attacks on American allies will  be met with mealy-mouthed attempts to blame both sides                                   Abortion    Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter, when President  Biden nominated Xavier Becerra to run the Department of Health and  Human Services, it was clear what the Nation was getting--a hardened  culture warrior with no health or medical expertise. Where Secretary  Becerra did have experience was in trying to impose a far-left social  agenda.   He fought and fought in Federal court to make religious nonprofits  pay for things that violated their consciences until he finally got  creamed in the Supreme Court by a ruling that was 7 to 2. Before that,  he had fought and fought to force crisis pregnancy centers to advertise  abortion, trying to coerce a certain kind of leftwing speech out of  private groups. The Supreme Court slapped him down then as well. That  was the resume Secretary Becerra brought to his current position.   Last week, in a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce  Committee, the Secretary either forgot about Federal law on abortion or  revealed that he just didn't care what was on the books. When a Member  of Congress used the common term ``partial-birth abortion,'' the  Secretary coyly suggested he didn't know what that meant. He tried to  get the Congressman to use the more clinical verbiage that helps the  far-left conceal this grotesque subject. Then, when pressed, Secretary  Becerra claimed ``there is no law that deals specifically with the term  `partial-birth abortion.' ''   Well, the Secretary may wish that were the case, but it isn't. That  is completely false.   U.S. Code, title 18, section 1531 is the Federal ban on partial-birth  abortions. It uses the exact term seven times. It defines the banned  practice in all of its barbaric detail. Back in 2003, I was proud to  join with almost two-thirds of the Senate when we passed this  mainstream law. Our Federal ban on this awful procedure remains widely  popular with the American people. It is the bare, bare minimum. Yet  President Biden's HHS Secretary is either ignorant of the Federal law  or wants to pretend that it actually doesn't exist.   Remember, the far left has kept America one of just seven countries-- seven--in the world that allows elective abortions on demand after 20  weeks. Countries across Europe, like France, Spain, Germany, Norway,  and Denmark, all limit elective abortion to before 20 weeks. The far  left wants America to be an outlier on the global fringe, and President  Biden's HHS Secretary either doesn't know or won't admit that the  phrase ``partial-birth abortion'' even appears in Federal law. A  misstatement like that is embarrassing enough, but the radicalism that  lies behind it is even worse.                                   Protests    Mr. President, on one final matter, after careful consideration, I  have  [[Page S2748]]  made the decision to oppose the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced  proposal for another commission to study the events of January 6.   As everybody surely knows, I repeatedly made my views about the  events of January 6 very clear. I spoke clearly and left no doubt about  my conclusions. Federal law enforcement has made at least 445 arrests  and counting relating to crimes committed that day. Hundreds of those  people have been charged. Law enforcement investigations are ongoing,  and Federal authorities say they expect to arrest at least 100 or so  more. Bipartisan investigations are also underway and have been for  months at the committee level here in the Senate.   There is, has been, and there will continue to be no shortage of  robust investigations by two separate branches of the Federal  Government. So it is not at all clear what new facts or additional  investigation yet another Commission could actually lay on top of  existing efforts by law enforcement and Congress.   The facts have come out, and they will continue to come out. What is  clear is that the House Democrats have handled this proposal in  partisan bad faith, going right back to the beginning, from initially  offering a laughably partisan starting point to continuing to insist on  various other features under the hood that are designed to centralize  control over the Commission's process and its conclusions in Democratic  hands.   I have been an outspoken critic about all of the episodes of  political violence that our Nation has seen over the past year. I  support the strong existing investigations and justice for any  American--any American--who has broken the law.
