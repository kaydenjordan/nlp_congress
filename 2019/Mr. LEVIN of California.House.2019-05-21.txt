 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 1812, the Vet Center Eligibility Expansion Act.   Madam Speaker, I was proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation  with my friend from Tennessee and ranking member of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee, Dr. Roe.   We must do more to address the epidemic of suicide among veterans in  this country. We can start with ensuring all servicemembers have the  mental health support they need.   Currently, most National Guard, Coast Guard, and Reserve  servicemembers are precluded from receiving readjustment counseling  services at vet centers. Guardsmen and Reservists often face  emotionally challenging deployments to natural disasters, drug  interdiction missions, national emergencies, or civil disorders that  can have serious mental health consequences.   This bipartisan legislation is an important step in closing the  mental healthcare gap for those servicemembers who compose four of the  20 veteran suicides we see each day in this country. As we continue to  see veterans turn to suicide, often on the grounds of VA facilities, we  must have an all-hands-on-deck approach, and this bill can play a  critical role in this effort.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2326, the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder  (Ret.) Transition Improvement Act of 2019.   Madam Speaker, I was proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation  with my friend from Texas, Mr. Jodey Arrington. Mr. Arrington was a  friend of Mr. Mulder and represents his hometown of Plainview, Texas.   William Mulder, or Bill as his friends knew him, passed away nearly 2  years ago on June 9, 2017. He was a decorated Navy SEAL of 20 years  whose awards included three Bronze Stars with Valor. He was also a  father, husband, brother, and friend.   This legislation honors him by better equipping servicemembers for  the challenges and opportunities they will face as they transition from  Active Duty military service to civilian life. Far too often, the men  and women of our Armed Forces lack the support and coordinated  resources they need to return to civilian life and we cannot leave them  behind. We owe it to those who have served and their families to ensure  that they have everything they need to connect with community  organizations, to pursue educational opportunities, to launch new  careers, or to start their own businesses. That is why we must improve  the Transition Assistance Program.   This bill would extend a pilot program for off-base transition  training, allowing veterans and their spouses more time and convenience  to digest and access resources.   It would also create a grant program for organizations to provide  multiple transition assistance services such as resume assistance,  interview training, and job recruitment training from a central source.   We can also improve the program by expanding access to better  employment data at the Departments of Labor and Veterans Affairs, which  this bill does.   And, finally, it is important that we are constantly evaluating the  effectiveness of the Transition Assistance Program, which is why this  bill would require a 1-year independent assessment and a 5-year study  of the program.                                time  1600    We have a solemn duty to ensure that our Nation's heroes are able to  readily access the best possible services when it comes time to  transition back to civilian life.   I do not believe that we are living up to that duty right now, but  this bipartisan bill will help change that. I strongly encourage my  colleagues to vote in support today.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), my friend, and our original cosponsors: Mr. Cisneros;  ranking member of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, Mr. Bilirakis;  Mr. Cunningham; and Mrs. Lee.   Together, we can do more than pay lip service to our veterans. We can  give them the support and the resources they have earned and deserve.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2045, the Veterans' Education Transition and Opportunity  Prioritization Plan, or VET OPP Act of 2019.   Madam Speaker, I was proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation  with my friend from Ohio, Mr. Wenstrup. We have a responsibility to  provide America's servicemembers with the best possible resources and  opportunities as they transition back to civilian life, and we must do  more to meet that responsibility.   Education, employment, housing, and transition assistance programs  are critical to veterans' economic success. But many veterans aren't  receiving these opportunities because of bureaucratic red tape at the  VA. These programs are currently lumped with compensation programs  under the Veterans Benefits Administration.   As chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Economic Opportunity  Subcommittee, one of my top priorities is ensuring that veterans are  receiving their benefits as efficiently as possible, and it is clear  that the current structure at the VA isn't meeting this need.   This bipartisan bill will allow us to deliver economic resources more  effectively by creating a new Economic Opportunity and Transition  Administration at the VA and bringing more oversight and accountability  to economic programs for veterans.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.
