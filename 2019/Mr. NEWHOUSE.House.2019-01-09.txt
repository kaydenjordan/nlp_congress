 Mr. Speaker, today, on National Law Enforcement  Appreciation Day, I rise to honor Frank Rogers, who has served the  public in his role as Okanogan County sheriff for the past 16 years. In  his own words, Sheriff Rogers ``bleeds cop.''   He spent the past three decades in the northern part of my district  working to improve his community and promoting camaraderie among  different law enforcement agencies. From solving burglaries and violent  crime cases to helping evacuate those affected by devastating  wildfires, Frank has been dedicated to his friends and neighbors. Also  known as Sheriff Batman, he acted as a superhero for the people of  Okanogan County.   Sheriff Rogers signed off for the last time on December 31, and I  know he is excited to spend more time with his wife, Minette, and his  family. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on a  successful career and wishing him all the best in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for  yielding me some time.   Well, Mr. Speaker, here we are again. Last night, the Rules  Committee, under its new chairman, Mr. McGovern, voted to bring four  spending bills to the House floor, four bills that have never had a  hearing in this body, have never had a markup in this body, and now,  under Democratic control of the House, will have no amendments made in  order.   These bills may sound familiar to my constituents because these are  the exact same bills that House Democrats forced votes on last week,  only now we will be considering them one by one, rather than in a large  package.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Rules Committee over the last 4  years, I can tell you I had the distinct honor of listening to the now- chairman of the Rules Committee spend hours, literally hours, berating  those of us in the majority for not allowing amendments on bills.   So, Mr. Speaker, you can understand my full expectation as Democrats  took control of this body that we would be seeing open rules allowing  for vigorous debate on amendments and healthy, open dialogue and  transparency on these important pieces of legislation. Unfortunately,  that is not the case.   If I could, Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote the now-chairman who  spoke of his frustrations with the Rules Committee in recent months.   First of all:         The Rules Committee ought to be a place where people who       have good ideas, whether you agree with them or not, have       legitimate ideas, ought to be able to have the opportunity to       be able to offer them. Increasingly, we're moving away from       that.    Secondly, Mr. Speaker:         I'm always intrigued by the excuses why we can't be open .       . . and decry this very closed process.    And lastly, Mr. Speaker:         I hope if we're lucky enough to take over this place, I       hope that we're more accommodating.    Well, Mr. Speaker, they were, in fact, lucky enough. The Democrats  took control of this body and very well could be allowing amendments  today. But, unfortunately, that is not the case.   For instance, last night, I offered three amendments to two of the  bills before us, all three of which were accepted unanimously in the  115th Congress in the House Appropriations Committee, again, on a  bipartisan basis.   Unfortunately, the chairman isn't allowing a single amendment on the  Republican or Democratic side to be offered on any of these four bills,  including bipartisan amendments like those that I had offered.   I thank my good friend from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for his effort to  push these amendments to be made in order. It is sincerely  disappointing to see the chairman and House Democrats manage  legislation in the very manner they so vehemently decried.   Mr. Speaker, I will be voting ``no'' on this rule and ``no'' on these  spending bills.    My constituents' priorities deserve to be represented  in the people's House. Unfortunately, in this bill, they are not.
