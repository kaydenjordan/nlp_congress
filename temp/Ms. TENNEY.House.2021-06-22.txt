 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor New York Mills Police  Officer Guy Danella, who retired from law enforcement after 23 years  this past month.   Guy, a native of my hometown of New Hartford, began his service in  law enforcement in 1998, with the Oneida County Sheriff's Department as  a corrections deputy. During that time, Guy realized he wanted to  continue his career as a police officer and became a deputy sheriff  with the road patrol in 2000, where he spent 2 years on the DWI patrol.   In 2004, Guy began his career with the New York Mills Police  Department, where he would serve for the next 17 years. During his  service with New York Mills, Guy became a field training officer,  helping to mentor new officers, and was honored with a number of  service awards, including the Meritorious Service Award, Exceptional  Service Award, and the Patriot Award.   It was an honor to meet with Guy and his amazing daughter, Alex. I  hope she fulfills her dream to go to law school someday.   Guy, we thank you for your many years of service to our wonderful  community and for helping to train our next generation of heroes. Our  community is truly grateful.                            ____________________
