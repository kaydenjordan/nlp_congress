 Mr. President, the coronavirus continues to spread, with  more than 500 confirmed cases in the United States in two-thirds of the  50 States. Given the inconsistency and delay in testing, we don't know  if the number of confirmed cases actually reflects the number of actual  cases in the United States.   We now know that when the coronavirus first appeared on our soil, the  Centers for Disease Control produced kits that did not work properly  and sent many of these tests to our hospitals and medical labs. The  administration turned down tests from the World Health Organization,  even though 60 countries accepted them, and we have no answer as to  why.   It took weeks to get an accurate test out, and then it took weeks for  the Federal Government to approve certain sites to run those tests,  like the Northwell facility on Long Island that I recently visited. It  took weeks to ramp up the number of Americans tested, and we are still  far behind other countries like South Korea in the number and  percentage of the population we are able to test for coronavirus.   The most powerful tool in responding to a virus is to know precisely  where it is and how it is spreading, but because we don't have a  complete handle on testing, many of our hospitals, doctors,  researchers, and public health officials  [[Page S1616]]  are flying blind, and we are still far behind where we ought to be in  understanding how far the virus has already spread.   Now, instead of taking responsibility and working quickly to rectify  the early errors, the Trump administration--and, especially, the  President himself--downplayed concerns about the virus. The President  falsely said a vaccine would be ready soon and implied that it was OK  for Americans to go to work even if they had the virus. The President  falsely blamed the Obama administration for a policy change that slowed  testing. What he said was regarded as totally false.   Rather than spend the weekend in Washington to get a grip on the  crisis, the President was once again golfing at Mar-a-Lago. I don't  want to guess at the number of times this President has criticized  other Presidents for doing the same thing. The Federal Government's  initial response to the coronavirus was slipshod at best. It has  greatly hurt the country, and it falls at the feet of the President.  The buck stops with him.   Now, I know President Trump will dismiss these criticisms and accuse  Democrats of playing politics. That is what he always does when there  is legitimate criticism, because in President Trump's world, there is  no such thing as a legitimate criticism of his administration. But I  would tell President Trump: We don't criticize your administration for  the sake of it. We criticize because we want the administration's  response to get better, and we are afraid that if we don't speak up, if  we don't point out the problems publicly and push the administration to  change its method of operation, it will not change at all, and the  crisis will continue to worsen.   Now more than ever, we need President Trump to lead our government's  response to the coronavirus competently and consistently. We are all  rooting for that.   As the economic effects of the coronavirus are beginning to worsen,  there have been rumors that the Trump administration may pursue  policies to stimulate the economy. Let me be very clear. The best way  to ensure economic security for the American people right now is to  deal with the coronavirus itself competently and full on--something we  haven't yet seen. Getting a handle on the crisis and containing the  spread of the virus is by far the best way to address any effects on  the economy. If anything, the administration must prioritize the health  and safety of American workers and families certainly before corporate  interests. In that respect, Speaker Pelosi and I have suggested several  policies that the administration should pursue to help American workers  and families: paid sick leave for workers impacted by quarantine orders  or responsible for caring for children impacted by school closures;  enhanced unemployment insurance for workers who may lose their jobs  from the economic impacts of the epidemic; food security to ensure  vulnerable populations do not lose access to food during this epidemic;  clear protections for frontline workers, like our healthcare  professionals and workers who are responsible for cleaning public  facilities; widespread and free coronavirus testing, as well as  affordable treatment for any noncovered coronavirus-related costs;  protections against price gouging; and increased capacity of our  medical systems.   The administration must move quickly and seriously to address the  expanding threat to the health of the American people and the severe  impacts of the coronavirus on the financial security of American  families.   Again, the best way to deal with the problem here--health and  economic--is to address the problem head-on and deal with the kinds of  problems we have seen in the administration in its slipshod and erratic  response. That must vanish.                                   S. 2657    Mr. President, now on the Energy bill, this week the Senate will  continue to work on a bill that would update our Nation's energy  policy. Since the bill has been taken up, Senators have filed hundreds  of amendments, and I hope we can have a fair process that will allow  the Senate to consider amendments from both sides of the aisle.   I voted yes on the motion to proceed to the Energy bill because I was  hopeful we would have a fair and robust amendment process.  Unfortunately, this has not happened. The majority leader is rushing to  conclude the bill, even though there is no particular urgency to finish  this week. I salute Leader Manchin, who has worked very hard on this  bill, as well as Chair Murkowski. I have differences with the bill, but  they worked hard in a bipartisan way.   But we also have an emergency that warrants legislative action as  soon as possible, and that is climate change. At the moment, Leader  McConnell is blocking an important bipartisan amendment that would help  clear it. I have urged Leader McConnell to allow a vote on an amendment  led by Senator Carper, a Democrat, and Senator Kennedy, a Republican,  that would require the EPA to phase out the use of HFCs, or  hydrofluorocarbons. HFCs are dangerous greenhouse chemicals found in  everyday appliances--air conditioners, refrigerators, and the like.  They are thousands of times more damaging to our atmosphere than carbon  dioxide. Phasing out these HFCs is very important, and it will go a  long way in fighting climate change and protecting the environment for  future generations.   I believe the Senate should be allowed to vote on the Carper-Kennedy  amendment. A bipartisan group of Senators back it, and even the chamber  of commerce backs this amendment. So far, Leader McConnell has not  allowed a vote on it.   Now, we don't have a caucus position. There are different views  because of the good work done by Senator Shaheen and Senator Manchin on  other parts of the bill, but I will be voting no on cloture this  evening unless we can work out a compromise in the next few hours to  get a vote on this critical amendment.   The Energy bill is a rare opportunity to make tangible progress on  climate change as well--an existential threat to our planet. I hope my  Republican colleagues and Leader McConnell, in particular, see the  better side of reason and allow us to vote on bipartisan amendments.   I yield the floor.
