 Mr. Speaker, it is my task this morning to encourage  my colleagues to adhere to the rule of law.   In keeping with that, my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee--Mr.  Nadler, the ranking member, myself, and Mr. Cohen--introduced H.R.  5476, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, to protect  the work of Special Counsel Mueller and to allow his work to proceed.   In the recent days, Mr. Mueller's prosecutors found information that  generated questions about criminal activity. No prosecutor can ignore  that kind of evidence. He referred it first to the Deputy Attorney  General, Mr. Rosenstein, to approve his potential referral of that  information, and he did approve it. It was referred to the Southern  District of New York.  [[Page H3352]]    We now come to find out that the President's attorney has been  investigated for a long period of time. We found out a surprise: one of  his clients was Sean Hannity, who was already being investigated.   This is an insurance that the President will not fire the special  counsel and allow his work to continue. That is an Article I  responsibility, a constitutional responsibility, and I encourage my  colleagues to join us to provide that insurance.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the manager of this bill, Mr. Poe, again,  for his continued leadership on issues of protecting the victim.   I know that everyone has either gone to their bank, been at a store,  or gotten that call that says that: ``Are you Mrs. Jones? You live in  Texas. There is someone now in a department store in New York using  your identity, your card, your credit card,'' and nothing but fear  comes your way. It may not be even on the basis of you having lost your  credit cards, but it may be on the basis of the dastardly act of  stealing your identity.   Probably there is nothing more, besides family and faith and country  and God, that disturbs you most than to lose who you are. And so the  legislation of H.R. 2905, the Justice for Victims of IRS Scams and  Identity Theft Act of 2018, is a valuable legislative initiative  because, every year, billions of dollars are stolen from hardworking  Americans as a result of identity theft.   Tax season, as it begins today, or ends today, is a particularly  dangerous time as scammers pretending to be IRS representatives trick  victims into giving them money. Some of the most vulnerable victims are  senior citizens or individuals who are not familiar with the likes of  government responsibilities or actions.   The bipartisan bill, H.R. 2905, the Justice for Victims of IRS Scams  and Identity Theft Act of 2018, helps ensure that Congress has the  information it needs to make sure that law enforcement agencies are  employing tactics to hold these criminals accountable and deter future  crimes.   I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young) and the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) for their astute leadership on  this bill and for recognizing that victims are left helpless and  hopeless sometimes.   As tax season comes to a close, millions of Americans are at risk of  being exploited by emerging schemes where scam artists pretend to be  IRS agents and harass victims into providing personal information and  money. The IRS estimates that more than $65 million has been lost to  phone tax scammers in the past 5 years. These attacks are most common  during the tax season, in March and April. Those are dollars that many  valuable and important programs or responsibilities of our Federal  Government could utilize, dollars that certainly don't belong to  criminals.   Often, scammers present themselves as the IRS and trick people into  sending their money and personal information. As technology advances,  so do the scammers. The IRS warned of a sophisticated phone scam  targeting taxpayers, including recent immigrants, which has been making  the rounds throughout the country.   Scammers claim to be IRS employees using fake names and bogus IRS  identification badges. They may know a lot about their targets, and  they usually alter the caller I.D. to make it look like the IRS.   By debating this bill on the floor of the House today, Mr. Speaker,  we hope that we are sending a far-reaching warning for those who may be  watching or those who are watching to tell others: Please understand  that the IRS has made it clear they do not do business that way.   Victims are told they owe money to the IRS and they must be paid  promptly through a gift card or a wire transfer. That is not the way  IRS does business. Victims may be threatened with arrest or deportation  or suspension of a business or driver's license.   Seek immediate help through counsel, through calling, directly, the  IRS or your public servant that is nearby.   In many cases, the caller becomes hostile and insulting. If the phone  isn't answered, the scammers often leave an urgent callback request.  That is not the way the Federal Government does its business, or the  IRS.    Scared and confused, many victims comply with the scammer's request  out of fear of the repercussions. Please do not adhere to these heinous  and vile actions against you.   The Justice for Victims of IRS Scams and Identity Theft Act of 2018  requires the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury  to report to Congress the efforts to combat the serious identity theft  problem. The bill requires the DOJ to report on the status of  prosecutions of identity theft crimes. It asks for recommendations  regarding how this crime is committed, how to improve collaboration  with other Federal agencies, and how to improve law enforcement  deterrence and prevention of such offenses.   It also requires the Department of the Treasury to provide a report  detailing its current efforts to assist in the prosecution of identity  theft when a criminal impersonates IRS personnel and the resources they  need to facilitate the prosecution of these offenses.   Please remember--I will say it again--the IRS does not do business  this way. Be wary and reach out for help.   This information will provide a helpful insight into how law  enforcement agencies are addressing the heinous problem that Congress  wants to resolve, and we want to stamp out identity theft and the IRS  scammers.   We need to ensure that Americans are being protected from these con  artists who target and terrify Americans and that these thieves are  held accountable for their criminal activity, and that is why I ask my  colleagues to support H.R. 2905, the Justice for Victims of IRS Scams  and Identity Theft Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, let me thank Mr. Young from Iowa for  his presence here. And let me thank Ms. Sinema, who has always been  astutely concerned about the fairness to those who may be victimized by  these dastardly acts. I reiterate again that they are conmen and - women, and Ms. Sinema knows well the importance of protecting her  constituents, so I want to congratulate her and Mr. Young for this  legislation.   Again, I want to emphasize how important it is that we take important  measures to protect all forms of identity theft. But I want to use the  terminology ``victims'' because, as I have said, senior citizens,  people who are there alone; and, of course, families, individuals who  are not experienced; first-time filers, for example, of their IRS  filing; and people who don't have, or know, anyone to call, they are  particularly in the eye of the storm.   I, again, reiterate--if you are listening to us--do not respond to  those kinds of intimidating calls. Please call the IRS. Yes, you can  call the IRS or your public servant that is nearby, or seek some relief  in some other manner.   Identity theft can occur in many settings. It can occur in public  places where criminals watch you from a nearby location as you punch in  your credit card number, or listen in on your conversation if you have  to give your credit card number over the telephone. It can also occur  if you receive applications for pre-approved credit cards in the mail,  but discard them without tearing up the enclosed materials. A first  notice to everyone: those items should be shredded.   Many people's information is stolen when they are inquiring to spam  emails that promise them some benefit, but request identifying data. In  some cases, criminals reportedly abuse computer technology to steal  large amounts of personal data.   With enough identifying information about an individual, a criminal  can take over that individual's identity to conduct a wide range of  crimes. You don't want to get that phone call. Maybe it is not a store  in New York, but it might be a store in Istanbul, or somewhere beyond,  that your credit card is being used.   False applications for loans and credit cards, fraudulent withdrawals  from bank accounts, fraudulent use of telephone calling cards, or  online accounts, it is important to be reminded the world is getting  smaller and these credit card accounts can be used all over the world.  The consequences of identity theft can be severe and can leave a person  with no funds to pay for everyday living costs. Identity fraud can have  a significant effect on your credit history.   If an identity theft uses your existing credit or applies for new  credit, this could leave a footprint of debt or missed payments in your  credit report, even to the extent that this individual generates a  bankruptcy. Even if the criminal applies for credit and is rejected,  this can still have a negative impact on your credit history, as each  application for credit is recorded.   It is with these concerns that I applaud this legislation and ask my  colleagues to support the present legislation that is H.R. 2905, the  Justice for Victims of IRS Scams and Identity Theft Act of 2018. The  victims are our most important cause.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, every year, billions of dollars are  stolen from hardworking Americans as a result of identity theft.

It is with these concerns in mind that we act on this legislation  today. I support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Tonko so very much  for yielding. He was a dear, dear friend of Louise.   I rise today to really highlight the sunshine that Congresswoman  Louise McIntosh Slaughter really was to all of us. I am reminded of  that day when those two planes landed in Rochester, New York, her  beloved community. It was a bright, sunny day, but it was almost  amazing as the buses drew up to the place of her funeral and the lines  and lines of Rochester citizens, her constituents, who were lining up  two by two, waiting to come to honor her.   That was a true testimony to what Louise Slaughter and Bob, her  husband, were to that community. They loved that community, and that  community loved her. Eighty-eight years of youth, because she was  young, vibrant, and ready.   I am delighted to acknowledge so much that she did in the areas of  women's rights and empowerment, the arts, healthcare, the battlefield  preparedness, economic revitalization, the environment, and social  justice, and, of course, her work dealing with the issue of genetics  that, really, a lot of people in Congress didn't even understand, but  Louise with her expertise in microbiology, there she was educating all  of us.   As far as her leadership on the Affordable Care Act, she was one of  the soldiers and generals who made sure that it passed, and as well her  great work in dealing with the Violence Against Women Act and the STOCK  Act to make sure that we, as Members of Congress, did the right thing  financially.   But I want to emphasize the tutoring that Louise Slaughter gave to  me. I want to thank her staff who is sitting back in this Chamber, and  her staff in her home district. But if they came to the Rules  Committee, either when Louise was a member or senior member or the  ranking member or chair, her astuteness and genius, her sharp wit, her  reminding members that she was the chair, that we could learn from her  if we decided to do so.   I know personally, as a frequent visitor to the Rules Committee,  Louise Slaughter was in charge and the first woman chair of this  powerful committee. I learned fast from her. I cannot thank her enough  for teaching a new Member at that time of the works and the goings-on  and the protocols of the Rules Committee and how to do it right.   She never lost her humor and her wonderful Southern twang. Of course,  who would be better leading Seneca Falls than Louise McIntosh  Slaughter?   I thank her for her fight for women's rights and as well for taking  me to Niagara Falls as a member of the Homeland Security Committee.   So, finally, as I close, I am reminded that Congresswoman Slaughter  had an iron fist in a velvet glove, and I loved it. I loved her wit,  and I loved the fact that she was a true American.   So my prayer is that the Lord bring comfort to the many people, those  who Louise knew and those who felt they knew Louise Slaughter, who know  that a mighty oak has fallen and are heartbroken at her loss. I ask  that God bless her, may God rest her, and as well may God bless her  constituents as God blesses the United States of America.   Farewell, Congresswoman Louise McIntosh Slaughter, you will never be  forgotten, and you will always be remembered.   I want to thank my colleague Paul Tonko, for organizing this session  honoring our shared friend.   I rise today in remembrance of my dear friend and our beloved  colleague, Congresswoman Louise McIntosh Slaughter of New York, a  trailblazer for women, whose powerful voice was quieted this past March  16, 2018.   Louise Slaughter lived a long, full, and consequential life and got  the most out of the 88 years she graced this world.   She will be remembered in this House for her service to her  constituents and her colleagues, her formidable intellect, her mastery  of the legislative process, and her graciousness and kindness to all  who came in contact with her.   After serving four years in the New York State Assembly, Louise  Slaughter was elected to the 100th Congress in 1986 to represent the  30th Congressional District of New York, which at the time included  downtown and eastern Rochester, most of eastern Monroe County, all of  Genesee County and northern Livingston and Ontario counties.   Reelected to the 15 succeeding Congresses Louise Slaughter carved out  a legacy of leadership and accomplishments in the areas of women's  rights and empowerment, the arts, health care, battlefield  preparedness, economic revitalization, the environment, and social  justice.   Born in the coal mining town of Lynch, Kentucky and educated at the  University of Kentucky where she earned degrees in microbiology and  public health, Louise Slaughter understood the connection between  public health and a vibrant democracy, and fought to ensure passage of  the landmark Affordable Care Act.   In the 112th Congress, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter introduced and  shepherded to passage Pub. L. 112-105, the ``Stop Trading on  Congressional Knowledge Act'' or ``STOCK Act,'' which prohibits the use  of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading  by members of Congress and other government employees, and requires  many financial transactions by members of Congress to be reported  within 45 days.   Mr. Speaker, since her first years on Capitol Hill, Congresswoman  Louise Slaughter was an advocate for women all over the world.   Among her many accomplishments, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter co- authored the landmark Violence Against Women Act, ensured the first  federal funding to the National Institutes of Health to research breast  cancer, and was a co-founder of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus.   It is particularly fitting and altogether appropriate that this  tireless champion of women, children, and families represented an area  near Seneca Falls, the location of the first women's rights convention  in 1848.   The dean of New York's Congressional Delegation, Louise Slaughter was  the first woman to chair the powerful House Rules Committee, and the  first woman to serve as Ranking Member of that Committee, and in both  roles she carried the banner and led the fight for progressive values  and to make our good country better.   I will always remember and be grateful to Congresswoman Louise  Slaughter for her help in my duties representing the people of the 18th  Congressional District of Texas.   I worked closely with Congresswoman Louise Slaughter and drew upon  her counsel and assistance to shepherd scores of bills and amendments  to passage that have been beneficial to my constituents.   Louise Slaughter was incredibly generous with her knowledge and  experience and served as a mentor to new members of Congress, including  me.   I will never forget that Louise Slaughter's advocacy continued until  her last days with us, including National Women's March in Washington,  D.C. on January 21, 2017.   Mr. Speaker, Louise Slaughter was an iron fist in a velvet glove.   A native of Kentucky, Louise Slaughter never lost her Southern twang  and charm.   Louise Slaughter effortlessly mixed humor with logic to win over  skeptics.   And then after disarming you, Louise Slaughter made her move.   Through her words and deeds, Louise Slaughter worked to make the  lives of all Americans better.   Louise Slaughter was a dear friend and her loss leaves a void in my  heart.   It is my prayer that the Lord brings comfort to the many people-- those whom Louise knew and those who felt they knew Louise Slaughter-- who know that a mighty oak has fallen and are heartbroken at the loss.   I thank her family for sharing her with us and the country.  [[Page H3389]]                                     time  1830
