 Madam Speaker, as we sit here in the Chamber of the United  States House of Representatives today, the Secretary of Homeland  Security has announced that he is ready to end the use of Title 42 at  our southern border. This is as we speak, while in March, we have had  100,000 apprehensions in the first half of the month, barreling towards  200,000, of which half have been able to be turned away under Title 42.   When the Secretary ends Title 42, there will be a deluge at our  southern border. This is known, which is evidenced by the fact that the  Secretary is already working with FEMA behind the scenes and quietly to  deal with the emergency that is no doubt about to occur at our southern  border. This is going to cause massive injury to migrants, cartels  empowered, Americans endangered, fentanyl pouring across our border,  all because the Secretary refuses to do his job.   This is an inexcusable dereliction of duty by the Secretary of  Homeland Security. It is an impeachable act to not carry out his  constitutional duty to defend the border of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join together to condemn the  Secretary, condemn the administration, and demand that the Secretary  actually do his job to secure the border and not end Title 42, even as  Americans continue to wear masks on airplanes during a public health  emergency.                            ____________________
