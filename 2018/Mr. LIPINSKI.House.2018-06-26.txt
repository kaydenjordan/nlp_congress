 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of this amendment to provide $30 million for DOD's  MD5, the National Security Technology Accelerator, within the Office of  Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy.   The 2018 NDAA authorized support for national security innovation and  entrepreneurial education programs, including MD5.   MD5 aims to educate and build a network of innovators and  entrepreneurs equipped with the expertise to successfully develop,  commercialize, and apply DOD technology. It is a way of bringing  American ingenuity and ingenuity and entrepreneurship from Silicon  Valley to problems faced by the DOD.   MD5 initiatives educate veterans and other students in technology  innovation and entrepreneurship and provide a unique pathway for  veterans to leverage their expertise while learning cutting-edge  business innovation methodology.   The program also increases postmilitary opportunities for  servicemembers and helps them apply their knowledge to new national  security problems.   Through MD5, DOD is growing a cadre of entrepreneurs who are adept at  creative problem solving and the formation of successful ventures that  deliver economic, national security, and social value.   Passage of this amendment would mean a $5 million increase from MD5  fiscal year 2017 and 2018 levels. The funding increase would enable  them to scale up their entrepreneurial education programs, including  the highly successful program Hacking for Defense, otherwise known as  H4D.                                time  1745    H4D is a course currently taught at 11 universities across the  country, with many more in the process of coming onboard. It pairs  student teams with problem sponsors from across the DOD and  intelligence community to apply Lean Startup methodology developed in  Silicon Valley to rapidly solve challenging, nonclassified national  security problems.   Of the 205 students across the Nation who have already been through  Hacking for Defense classes, 66 percent plan to continue working on  their problems after the course is over. Nine companies have been  formed by H4D alumni, and six of them have received DOD or private  equity funding to continue working on their projects.   That is, the DOD and/or private equity have found their attempts at  solutions for these critical national security problems potentially to  be viable.   H4D not only delivers American innovation to problems that the DOD is  facing, but also inspires smart young innovators, some of whom were  Active Duty servicemembers or veterans, to apply their talents to  solving national security problems.   These experiences serving their country and boosting our national  security will influence them for the rest of their careers, as well as  greatly benefit the country.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge support for this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for accepting this  amendment. I thank her very much for her work on this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I also thank the ranking member for his work on this. I  appreciate it. This is a great opportunity with this amendment to make  a small investment to support a program that will strengthen our  national security and the next generation of problem-solvers for the  DOD, and I yield back the balance of my time.
