 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Caitlin Clark of the Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team for winning  the 2023 Naismith National Player of the Year award, the AP Player of  the Year award, the Wooden Award National Player of the Year, and the  Honda Sport Award for Basketball.   Caitlin is a native of West Des Moines, Iowa, and attended Dowling  Catholic before taking her career to the next level with the University  of Iowa Hawkeyes. Her exceptional play this season captivated audiences  far beyond the Hawkeye State.   As a junior, Caitlin averaged 27.3 points and led the Nation with  five triple-doubles, including a 41-point, 12-assist, 10-rebound effort  in Iowa's NCAA tournament win over Louisville to advance to the Final  Four.   The ESPN telecast of the Hawkeyes' win over Louisville averaged more  viewers than any NBA telecast on ESPN this season as Clark became the  first player in the NCAA tournament history to record a 40-point  triple-double.    In a recent interview, she said: ``I want my legacy to be the impact  that I can have on young kids and the people in the State of Iowa, and  I hope I brought them a lot of joy this season.''   Madam Speaker, Caitlin is most certainly a joy and an inspiration to  all Iowans and numerous Americans.   We can't wait to continue watching Caitlin on the court and wish her  the best of luck in the future.   Go Hawks.   Madam Speaker, I wish a very happy birthday to my nephews, Matthew  and Joseph Martina.                            ____________________
