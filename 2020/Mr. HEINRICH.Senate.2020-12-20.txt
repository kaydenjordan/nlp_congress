 Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent in 2019 due to  a family medical emergency for rollcall votes Nos. 195, 196, 197, 198,  199, 200, 201, 202, and 203. Had I been present, I would have voted yea  on votes Nos. 195 and 197 and nay on votes Nos. 196, 198, 199, 200,  201, 202, and 203.                            ____________________
