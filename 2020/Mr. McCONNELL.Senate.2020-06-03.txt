 Madam President, our Nation is caught within a number  of grave problems at the same time.   This week, in cities all across America, the pain of racial injustice  has been compounded by violent riots that have drowned out peaceful  protests and hurt innocent people. Millions of working families  continue to face the historic economic fallout from the coronavirus  pandemic, including unemployment levels not seen in decades, and, lest  we forget, the actual pandemic itself is still with us. The virus  continues to claim hundreds of American lives every day, challenge  healthcare professionals, and paralyze schools, universities, and  employers that are eager to reopen. Of course, there is also the  important business we would have needed to have addressed even before  the pandemic.   So, for all of these reasons and more, while the Democratic House of  Representatives may be absent--with no plans to return for weeks and  weeks--the U.S. Senate is here and working for the American people.   This week, we are filling more critical vacancies throughout our  government. Yesterday, we confirmed the Special Inspector General for  Pandemic Response. This is a brandnew position born of immediate  necessity and goals shared by Members of both parties. Yet, though our  Democratic colleagues said for weeks that CARES Act oversight was a top  priority, our colleagues chose to delay this nomination for as long as  possible. When the rubber met the road, yet again, picking small fights  with President Trump took precedence over urgent work for the common  good.   At the same time, we also hear from the very same Democratic  colleagues that they wish the Senate would spend less time on  nominations. Well, the good news is that the Senate Democrats can  change that whenever they want, but as long as they continue to visit  delays and obstruction on even these lower level executive branch  appointments, just for the sake of irritating the White House, the  Senate will continue to do our job the hard way.   Of course, in the weeks ahead, we will also tackle significant  legislation  [[Page S2660]]  for our country. We will turn to legislation to strengthen the  implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program for the workers and  small businesses that are struggling to weather this storm. We will  consider a bipartisan bill from Senators Daines and Gardner to  safeguard America's abundant public lands. For the 60th consecutive  year, we will also take up the National Defense Authorization Act to  help guide the strategic and operational priorities of our Nation's  Armed Forces in the face of evolving threats                            ____________________     Madam President, make no mistake, the foreign actors  who seek to harm the United States have not let up while we have  attended to other problems. For example, in Afghanistan, despite  agreeing just months ago to engage in further peace negotiations with  the Afghan Government and sever its ties with al-Qaida, the Taliban  has, instead, continued its violent campaign against the Afghan people.   President Trump has expressed frustration with the Taliban's failures  and is reportedly considering withdrawing from Afghanistan even more  rapidly. Yet, as we weigh our options, we must not forget the painful  lessons of the last administration's mistakes.   Former President Obama and Vice President Biden were intent on  beating a hasty retreat from Iraq, conditions on the ground  notwithstanding. Just as many of us warned at the time, their  recklessness left a vacuum that terrorists and Iran readily filled.  ISIS flourished. Tragically, the rest is history. The resulting chaos  threatened our interests and drew American efforts back into the  region.   By contrast, the Trump administration has seen a number of successes  in this difficult region. The President's strategy has secured a  territorial defeat of ISIS. It has put new pressure on Iran and given  the Iraqi people a fighting chance, which their new government seems  inclined to take.   Yet helping Iraq stand up to Iranian influence will not be an  overnight project. Iran wants to drive the United States from the  region. China and Russia would also be thrilled with a reduction of  American presence and influence there. So, as we struggle to clean up  the broken pieces of one rushed withdrawal, we need to avoid repeating  those mistakes somewhere else.   I applaud the Trump administration for its approach thus far in  Afghanistan. The President has taken constraints off U.S. forces. We  have helped Afghan forces go after the terrorists. We have ratcheted up  the costs on the Taliban, bolstered the Afghan forces that bear the  brunt of the violence, and won international support for our mission  there. We have done all of this with fewer resources and fewer  personnel than during the previous two administrations. The President's  strategy and diplomacy have helped create a path for discussions among  Afghans--the only thing that could actually secure the country's  future.   If these qualified successes continue, it would be appropriate to  further reduce our American presence as certain conditions are met, but  we must retain enough forces and influence to maintain our  counterterrorism capabilities. Given recent reports and our  longstanding experience, we cannot just trust the Taliban will sever  ties to al-Qaida and other terrorist networks. We need to be vigilant.  We need to maintain enough presence to judge whether the Taliban  complies with agreements and help the Afghan Government impose  consequences if it does not. We need to maintain enough presence to  preserve our strategic foothold against ISIS, the Haqqani Network, and  al-Qaida. We should also maintain enough presence to help prevent a  full replay of Iraq or Syria--a bloodbath and a human rights collapse,  particularly for generations of Afghan women.   Last year, a bipartisan supermajority in the Senate voted for an  amendment I authored, which warned against precipitous withdrawals from  Afghanistan and Syria in ways that could jeopardize the hard-won  progress we have attained, embolden Iran and Russia, and create more  pain for us and everyone else in the future.   Our enemies would be thrilled if the United States would grow too  tired to continue the hard work of standing with our partners,  confronting our adversaries, and maintaining measured leadership that  projects our security around the world. Our enemies would be delighted  if we would grow too weary to act in our own long-term interest. We  must not give them that satisfaction.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, back in March, as the coronavirus  pandemic began to grip our country, the Senate's historic CARES Act set  up the Paycheck Protection Program to help protect American workers  from layoffs during the crisis.   Thanks especially to its chief architects, Senator Rubio and Senator  Collins, the PPP has literally saved tens of millions of American jobs.  Our colleagues' bold policy has meant the mailboxes of working families  in all 50 States have continued to bring people their regular paychecks  instead of pink slips.   Through the end of May, this remarkable program has delivered more  than half a trillion dollars to keep American workers on payroll all  across our country.   One recent survey found that more than three-quarters--three- quarters--of all small business owners have applied for a PPP loan and  more than 90 percent of those applicants have received one.   The Senate has always committed to standing behind this popular  program. Back in April when it ran low on funds, we worked together to  add more resources, and today we are passing another piece of  legislation that makes a few targeted changes to the program.   To help workers and small businesses through these lengthy shutdowns  that are just now beginning to ease, we are increasing the loan  forgiveness period from 8 weeks to 6 months.   Since keeping workers on payroll obviously requires small businesses  to stay afloat in the first place, we are expanding firms' ability to  use these funds to meet obligations like their rent, their mortgage, or  their utility bills, but we maintain the overall requirement to avoid  layoffs to keep the strong protection for workers in place. And we are  providing payroll tax deferral for the small businesses involved.   This is a bipartisan bill that passed the House overwhelmingly. I am  proud the Senate is sending it on to the President's desk to become  law.   I want to thank Senator Collins and Senator Rubio once more for their  leadership in authoring this historic program in the first place. They  have kept right on with their essential leadership, carefully  monitoring the policy as it has taken effect.   I know they have identified further technical fixes in addition to  the issues we are addressing today, and I hope and anticipate the full  Congress will look at addressing those as well in the future.   I also want to thank Senator Daines, Senator Tillis, and Senator  Gardner for their hard work on these modifications.   The Senate delivered for workers and small businesses when we first  passed the CARES Act. We delivered again when we added more money to  this popular program back in April, and we are delivering again today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7010, which was received  from the House.    Mr. President, I appreciate the good faith efforts of  Senator Johnson to make sure the terms of the program and its  legislative intent are properly understood. In addition, I commend his  leadership in looking at the program overall, and making suggestions  about reforms should Congress determine that additional money is needed  in the future for the program. The program was designed intentionally  to get money into the hands of small businesses quickly as government  took the extraordinary and unprecedented step of shutting down the  economy because of the pandemic. However, should we need to replenish  the fund, he is absolutely correct that we should ensure that money  [[Page S2691]]  flows to small businesses and enterprises that truly need it. I look  forward to working with him and our colleagues on reforms to the  program should Congress make the decision to extend it.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I send to the  desk be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Congressional Intent for H.R. 7010         We, the undersigned Members of Congress, would like to       clarify the congressional intent for H.R. 7010, the Paycheck       Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020. The Paycheck       Protection Program (PPP) was authorized by Congress under the       CARES Act as a short-term solution to help businesses make       ends meet and continue to pay their employees during the       initial shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the CARES Act,       authorized funds for the program are set to expire on June       30, 2020, allowing for no new loans to be issued after this       date.        H.R. 7010 amends the CARES Act to provide businesses with       greater flexibility for their use of PPP loans. Section 3(a)       of H.R. 7010 changes the definition of the ``covered period''       defined by section 1102(a) of the CARES Act to be from       February 15, 2020 to December 31, 2020 instead of from       February 15, 2020 to June 30, 2020, as under current law. We       wish to clarify the congressional intent of this extension of       the covered period to December 31, 2020, and our expectations       about how the amended program will operate.        The CARES Act requires that PPP loans may only be spent on       allowable uses during the covered period. In addition to the       uses otherwise allowed by section 7(a) of the Small Business       Act, the CARES Act authorizes as allowable uses ``payroll       costs; costs related to the continuation of group health care       benefits during periods of paid sick, medical, or family       leave, and insurance premiums; employee salaries,       commissions, or similar compensations; payments of interest       on any mortgage obligation (which shall not include any       prepayment of or payment of principal on a mortgage       obligation); rent (including rent under a lease agreement);       utilities; and interest on any other debt obligations that       were incurred before the covered period.'' The intention of       the extension of the covered period in H.R. 7010 is to allow       borrowers who received PPP loans before June 30, 2020 to       continue to make expenditures for allowable uses until       December 31, 2020. The extension of the covered period does       not authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to       issue any new PPP loans after June 30, 2020, as this date       remains fixed by section 1102(b) of the CARES Act.        The extension of the covered period defined in section       1102(a) of the CARES Act should not be construed so as to       permit the SBA to continue accepting applications for loans       after June 30, 2020. Our intent and understanding of the law       is that, consistent with the CARES Act as amended by H.R.       7010, when the authorization of funds to guarantee new PPP       loans expires on June 30, 2020, the SBA and participating       lenders will stop accepting and approving applications for       PPP loans, regardless of whether the commitment level enacted       by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care       Enhancement Act has been reached.      Mike Lee,        United States Senator.      Marco Rubio,        United States Senator.      Dean Phillips,        Member of Congress.      Ron Johnson,        United States Senator.      Benjamin L. Cardin,        United States Senator.      Chip Roy,        Member of Congress.     I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motion with  respect to the Pack nomination ripen at 11:40 a.m. tomorrow, with 20  minutes of debate under the control of Senator Menendez prior to the  vote; I further ask that if cloture is invoked on the Pack nomination,  the postcloture time expire at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow; finally, if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 606, submitted  earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  preamble be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, June 4; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Pack nomination, under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:08 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, June 4, 2020, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
