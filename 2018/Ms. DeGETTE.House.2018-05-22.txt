 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 5682,  the FIRST STEP Act. While I support several provisions in the  legislation, including prohibiting shackling of pregnant inmates,  requiring that individuals be incarcerated closer to their families,  and clarifying good time calculations, I cannot support other  provisions of the legislation.   I strongly believe the House should be working to ensure that once  convicted individuals have paid their debt to society they have the  skills and support to reintegrate into society, but this bill puts in  place too many barriers to that goal.   The bill excludes undocumented individuals, including those who  remained in the United States longer than authorized from the  recidivism reduction programming. Worse, the bill also excludes some  lawful permanent residents from the program and could trigger their  [[Page H4319]]  removal. The bill also excludes those who have been convicted of drug  crimes, including marijuana related convictions.   Given that immigrant and minority communities make up a  disproportionate share of immigration and drug related offenders in the  criminal justice system, these exclusions will by their very nature  exclude those who most need the benefits of the bill.   Finally, any conversation about reducing recidivism must include  sentencing reform that would keep low risk nonviolent offenders out of  prison in the first place and address our draconian federal mandatory  minimum laws.   Mr. Speaker, we can do better, and we must do better if we are to  address this issue.
