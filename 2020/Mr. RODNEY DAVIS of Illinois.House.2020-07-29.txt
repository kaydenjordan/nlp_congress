 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise today to thank Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and  all who have worked hard in the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee to get this legislation to the floor known as ``Sami's Law.''  I, too, support this legislation. I also want to applaud the dedication  and the hard work of the sponsor of Sami's Law, and that is none other  than my good friend, the Representative from New Jersey, Mr. Chris  Smith.   I met with Sami's parents at the urging of Mr. Smith a few months  ago. Marci and Seymour Josephson, your government today will show you  that it is working for you and for all Americans, and that is because  you have a tireless advocate, somebody who I have never seen work  harder on an issue that is so important to so many young people in this  country than Mr. Smith did. There has been no one in my time in  Congress who has come to me on this floor advocating for a single issue  that can mean so much to kids like my daughter who is in college, like  my sons who are in college that is going to have an impact on their  generation as much as the advocacy of Congressman Chris Smith because  this bill is going to pass today. We are one step closer to making  Sami's Law law.   As we know, this law is going create minimum standards and  requirements for safety for passengers who utilize ridesharing  platforms. We want to make sure that digitally they know that the  driver they have reserved is the driver who is rolling up next to them  to pick them up. This verification process is essential in making sure  tragedies that took Sami's life don't happen to other families.   This bill also creates an advisory council, Sami's Law Council, to  make safety-related performance standards and recommendations to the  Secretary of Transportation.   Also a very important point: To keep bad actors out of this arena, we  are also going to ban something that I learned about, again, from  Congressman Smith, that there are bad actors that were able to purchase  Uber and Lyft stickers, put them on their car, and they were able to do  it on Amazon, and they had zero experience and zero intention of ever  legally getting the clearance to participate in those rideshare  programs.   This is going to save people in America. I support this legislation.   And my last message to Marci and Seymour Josephson: Sami's legacy  lives on after we pass this bill in the House of Representatives today.  Thank you for your tireless advocacy, Marci and Seymour, and thank you  for sending such a tireless advocate to the House of Representatives in  Congressman Chris Smith.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), another tireless advocate for  Sami's Law and the ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I don't know if I can  say anything more about my colleague.   I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Chairman  DeFazio; Ranking Member Graves; all Members who worked on this bill; my  good friend Mr. Suozzi, who was here not too long ago, another  cosponsor of Mr. Smith's bill.   This is a day that we ought to remember here in Congress as getting  back to bipartisan solutions.   As I said earlier, Sami Josephson, her life was tragically taken, but  because of bipartisanship in this institution and good policy coming  from good Members of Congress, her legacy will live on and protect many  others like her from ever being put in the exact same position of  getting in an Uber, a Lyft, or any other future ridesharing company's  vehicle without knowing exactly if that car was coming to get her.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith again for his tireless advocacy. I  thank all who worked on this. I look forward to seeing this bill pass  unanimously, I hope. It should.   But in the end, I also thank the companies who worked with Members of  Congress to put this good policy in place today that I urge everyone to  support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Graves for his leadership on this issue and also the ranking member of  the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, a good friend, Mr.  Westerman, along with Chairman DeFazio and Chair Napolitano of the  Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.   This is a great day. This is a continuation of what was started in  2014 under Chairman Shuster at the time, and it was with bipartisan  success that we began getting the water resource development bills  passed on a 2-year basis. This is another shining example of what  bipartisan work can do. We are here to talk about the successes of  authorizing all of the Corps of Engineers' programs, which is extremely  important to my district, which is surrounded by the inland waterway  system.   If we don't do our job in this institution in the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee to pass a Water Resources Development Act on a  biannual basis, then what happens is we put the effectiveness of our  farmers and our manufacturers from getting their products from their  manufacturing facilities or their fields into the inland waterway  system and out into the global marketplace in a cost-effective way and  in a way that is going to allow them to continue to provide jobs in my  district.   One aspect of this bill I am particularly grateful for is the cost  share adjustment in the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. This is a big deal  for us to  [[Page H3957]]  upgrade our antiquated lock and dam system along the Illinois and  Mississippi Rivers. This is a success story.   I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves. I do also want to  thank the staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee.  They worked hard. All of them deserve a round of thanks, and I  appreciate the efforts on not just this bill, but every other piece of  legislation that goes through that great committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I am glad to see  the process is working today.                                time  1445
