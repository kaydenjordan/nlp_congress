 Madam Speaker, this morning, I heard moving testimony from  some of the young people leading the fight against climate change,  including Greta Thunberg. It was inspiring to see the faces leading the  next generation.   We must work together across the aisle to confront these challenges  that will be faced now and by the next generations, and our time is  running out.   In the San Joaquin Valley of California, which I represent, I have  witnessed the devastating effects of climate change for too long, the  droughts, the fires.   As a farmer, I know firsthand the struggle that our agricultural  communities go through, and I know that climate change isn't making  them any easier.   As I have said before and I will say again, mitigating and adapting  to the effects of climate change will require a multipronged,  commonsense approach. We must not fail to confront these challenges.   As today's testimony reminded us, the most devastating effects of  climate change will be the impact not only today but of the young and  future generations to come. I refuse to sit by and do nothing.   For years, in California and Washington, I have worked for meaningful  solutions to address climate change, and that will continue.                            ____________________
