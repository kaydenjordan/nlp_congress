 Mr. Speaker, Congress--and, actually, Congress today-- should act to pass the Dream Act. House Democrats are working to pass a  permanent solution to protect 800,000 DREAMers, children who were  brought here to the United States by their parents through no fault of  their own, many of them as very young children. America is the only  country they know. They have registered with the government. They pay  their taxes. They make great contributions to our society.   We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to deport these youngsters from  the only country they have ever known? Is that the morally right  question?   We can argue the economics, and I can argue that it is an economic  mistake to lose these individuals, but it is essentially a moral  question. If a Member of Congress believes that we should deport  800,000 productive people who only know this country, who were brought  here as children, then come to the floor of the House and put that on  the record. Vote ``yes'' or ``no,'' but bring up the Dream Act.   This is an important question, and it is the work of Congress, and we  should do it now.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for  yielding time to me and for her leadership and work on this important  issue.   Mr. Chairman, I support and appreciate my amendment being included in  this en bloc amendment. My amendment increases funding for three very  important and very successful programs that provide lead prevention  resources in support for those already exposed to high levels of lead.   Lead is a dangerous neurotoxin. Its effects can be permanent,  especially on very young people and those most vulnerable citizens  among us. In fact, according to the medical community, there is no safe  level for lead.   As you know, I come from Flint, Michigan, where we have experienced  the most significant lead crisis. It is one that we are still working  to overcome. Even though that crisis in Flynt is no longer in the  headlines, Flint and many other communities are still dealing with  issues caused by exposure to lead.   There is no cure to lead exposure. We have to work on prevention and  do everything we can to support those like the people in Flint and  others across the country who have been exposed so they can grow into  healthy and successful adults. This amendment will do just that.   I appreciate the ranking member, Ms. DeLauro, and I share in my  colleagues' expression of grief for her loss. I thank Ranking Member  Lowey and I thank Chairman Cole for working to include this in the en  bloc amendment, and I urge its passing.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that  would increase funding for youth employment initiatives by $10 million.   Michigan's unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, but for youth aged 16 to  24, it is more than double that, over 11 percent. Young people face  high unemployment, and the lack of opportunity to find meaning in the  world of work has implications that go far beyond just those years that  they might find meaningful employment.   Investing in those young Americans ensures that they all do better.  Providing those important employment  [[Page H7278]]  opportunities builds a strong foundation around the concept of hard  work, and I know many Members support this effort. We just need to make  sure that we find every opportunity that we can to make sure that every  young person looking for an opportunity to earn a few dollars learns  and, especially, understands the connection between their focus on work  and the benefits that they will realize from that not only in terms of  their own well-being, but the contributions they can make to their  community.   Just last month, I had an opportunity to visit a really great example  about how youth employment can make a positive impact in my home  community. I visited a community garden run by Greg Gaines, who employs  Flint area youth in summer jobs. They learn to grow crops. They learn  that hard work pays off. Over time, they see these crops come in that  they sell at the local farmers market. Very few of them will work in  agriculture, but they come to understand that some patience and some  effort and the focus on showing up on time and doing a day's good work  literally and figuratively will produce fruits that they can benefit  from.   So for 14- to 20-year-old kids in this program, obviously, it will  make a difference in terms of the way their lives and their life  trajectory goes forward, but it also sets a great example for their  peers.   This is just one of those things that we do in the Federal Government  that is an investment in our future. It is an investment in the lives  of these kids. It pays us back tenfold. We should support it with every  dollar we can find, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my friend's comments. I  understand the position he holds, and I do hope that we can work  together, eventually, to make sure that this program is more fully  funded.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the  ranking member of the full Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on Education  and the Workforce, a champion for this issue and many others.    Mr. Chairman, I would simply urge my colleagues to join  me in this. I think we all know of these individual cases where the  life of a young person is changed permanently because of an experience  that they had finding meaning in work.   Again, as I said at the outset, my view is we should try to find  every way we can to support including as many young people in that  experience as possible. This amendment would do that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the amendment that I have  offered to increase funding for the very successful Healthy Start  program, adding $24.8 million to match the President's funding request.   The Healthy Start program helps infants start out life with the  support they need to grow into successful adults. It provides prenatal  care, basic health needs, and promotes positive parenting practices for  thousands of children.   It is especially important to the people of my hometown, as I  mentioned before, and many other communities trying to work through  exposure to high levels of lead, which is a neurotoxin. Of course, we  know there is no cure, but the way we treat and the support we provide  these youngsters often gives them a chance to overcome these sorts of  developmental hurdles. Healthy Start is a critical way to do that by  helping infants and their families mitigate the effects of that lead  exposure.   Flint's ongoing process brought to light the nationwide issues that  we face in drinking water. People are more aware of these issues and  the impacts they can have on families. So it is incumbent upon us to do  everything we can not just to repair the damage, but to actually help  those who are struggling to get through these sorts of developmental  challenges.   Healthy Start is a proven program. It does that. It is one of the  reasons that I essentially take the same position that President Trump  is taking: we should have a greater investment in Healthy Start. I  don't often find myself in that position, but in this case, I am  willing to assert that on this floor.   Early childhood education gives kids, regardless of their  socioeconomic background, a chance. I think it is our duty to give  every child a fair chance to succeed. That is what this amendment is  intended to do.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I would just encourage my colleagues  to support this amendment.   I do appreciate very much my friend from Oklahoma's sincere support  for the effort. Let's hope that the amendment passes. If it does not, I  do look forward to working with him in order to ensure that every child  who could potentially benefit from this program does, in fact, have  that opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, I again urge my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
