 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 4684, the Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act.   Mr. Speaker, as the opioid epidemic grows, so does the need for  legitimate addiction treatment facilities. Southern California is home  to more than 1,100 licensed facilities and countless unlicensed sober  living homes, many of which have engaged in activities that exploit  patients and endanger communities. Some facilities engage in patient  brokering while others fail to treat the underlying cause of addiction,  putting patients at risk of relapse.   Mr. Speaker, the Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act would  require the Department of Health and Human Services to establish best  practices for sober living homes to ensure patients receive high- quality care. This bill would put an end to fraudulent behavior and  unethical practices conducted by some sober living homes while helping  those struggling with addiction rebuild and reclaim their lives.   I thank my fellow Californian, Congresswoman Chu, for her work on  this important issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
