 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, let me be clear: Last week's violent attack on the  Capitol was undemocratic, un-American, and criminal. Violence is never  a legitimate form of protest. Freedom of speech and assembly under the  Constitution is rooted in nonviolence. Yet the violent mob that  descended upon this body was neither peaceful nor democratic. It acted  to disrupt Congress' constitutional responsibility. It was also an  attack on the people who work in this institution: Members, staff, and  the hundreds who work behind the scenes so that we can serve the  American people.   The greatest statesman in the history of our country understood that  the most dangerous threat to freedom is lawlessness. A young lawyer  named Abraham Lincoln famously said, ``There is no grievance that is a  fit object of redress by mob law.''   Yet, for several hours last week, mob law tried to interfere with  constitutional law.   Some say the riots were caused by antifa. There is absolutely no  evidence of that, and Conservatives should be the first to say so.   Conservatives also know that the only thing that stops mob violence  is to meet it with force rooted in justice and backed by moral courage.  Last week, we saw mob violence met by courage, sacrifice, and heroism  from the brave men and women who protect this institution every day.  But for the bravery of the Capitol Police, the destruction and loss  could have been  [[Page H172]]  much greater. We owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.                                time  1330    The loss of Officer Brian Sicknick and Officer Howard Liebengood was  tragic and heartbreaking. We mourn their loss, remember their lives,  and continue to pray for their families and loved ones.   The officers of the Capitol Police deserve our eternal thanks. We  will never forget the dangers they faced, the determination they  showed, or the sacrifices they made.   Make no mistake, those who are responsible for Wednesday's chaos will  be brought to justice, which brings me to today's debate. I believe  impeaching the President in such a short timeframe would be a mistake.   No investigations have been completed. No hearings have been held.  What is more, the Senate has confirmed that no trial will begin until  after President-elect Biden is sworn in.   But here is what a vote to impeach would do. A vote to impeach would  further divide this Nation. A vote to impeach will further fan the  flames of partisan division.   Most Americans want neither inaction nor retribution. They want  durable, bipartisan justice. That path is still available, but it is  not the path we are on today.   That doesn't mean the President is free from fault. The President  bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.  He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was  unfolding.   These facts require immediate action by President Trump: accept his  share of responsibility, quell the brewing unrest, and ensure  President-elect Biden is able to successfully begin his term.   And the President's immediate action also deserves congressional  action, which is why I think a factfinding commission and a censure  resolution would be prudent. Unfortunately, that is not where we are  today.   Truly, this past week was one of the most difficult for Congress and  our Nation. Of all the days here, last Wednesday was the worst day I  have ever seen in Congress. Our country is deeply hurt.   So, where do we go from here? After all the violence and chaos of the  last week, it is important to remember that we are still here to  deliver a better future for all Americans. It does not matter if you  are liberal, moderate, or conservative; all of us must resist the  temptations of further polarization. Instead, we must unite once again  as Americans.   I understand, for some, this call for unity may ring hollow, but  times like these are when we must remember who we are as Americans and  what we, as a nation, stand for.   As history shows, unity is not an option; it is a necessity. It is as  necessary today as it was at the start of our country. I want us all to  think back to how John Adams and the Federalist Party handed power over  to Thomas Jefferson and his party after the election of 1800.   That election and, indeed, that era was one of the most divisive  ever. Partisans used every dirty trick in the book. They demonized each  other, dismissed reasonable dissent, and described their opponents as  seditious. Sound familiar?   The election of 1800 could have destroyed our young Nation, but  instead of breaking us, it helped bring us together, thereby preserving  the world's last best hope of freedom. After a hard-fought battle over  the electoral college in Congress, Adams conceded. A peaceful transfer  of power, the first in American history, took place.   Jefferson, for his part, put aside the division of the era and  preached forgiveness and, yes, unity. In his first inaugural address,  he famously said: ``Every difference of opinion is not a difference of  principle.''   Jefferson and Adams did not end every difference of opinion that  existed in America, nor did they try. In a free country as big and  diverse as ours, that would be impossible. What they did was more  important. They recognized the deeper unity, a unity rooted in the  famous proposition both men helped to write. At a critical moment in  history, our Founders chose peace, liberty, and partnership over  tension, division, and partisanship.   For the sake of our country, we must make the exact same choice. We  have already begun.   Last week, despite the lingering shock and amid the windows still  broken, we did what all healthy democracies do. We debated, and we  voted. In this country, we solve our disputes at the ballot box and  through debates and votes on the floor of this exact Chamber. We did  our duty then, and we must do more.   The eyes of the Nation and the world are upon us. We must seize this  opportunity and heal and grow stronger. As leaders, our place in  history depends on whether we call on our better angels and refocus our  efforts to work directly for the American people.   United, we can deliver the peace, strength, and prosperity our  country desperately needs. Divided, we will fail.   What we saw last week was not the American way. Neither is the  continued rhetoric that Joe Biden is not the legitimate President.   Let's be clear: Joe Biden will be sworn in as President of the United  States in 1 week because he won the election.   And his Presidency and this Congress will face immediate challenges  that must be addressed. I stand ready to assist in that effort with  good faith, goodwill, and an open hand.   The United States remains exceptional. We remain extraordinary. In  the coming weeks and months, we must work together, all of us, to  recharge the light of our shining city on the hill.   History has shown us a way. History has given us a path. Just as  Adams and Jefferson have shown, now is the moment that we should do the  exact same.   In these trying times, may God continue to bless America. Let's chart  a course that history will repeat but not what is happening today.
