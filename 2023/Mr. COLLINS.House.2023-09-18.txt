 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3371) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to complete  all actions necessary for certain land to be held in restricted fee  status by the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3371         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Wounded Knee Massacre       Memorial and Sacred Site Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Restricted fee status.--The term ``restricted fee       status'' means a status in which the Tribal land--        (A) shall continue to be owned by the Tribes;        (B) shall be part of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and       expressly made subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction       of the Oglala Sioux Tribe;        (C) shall not be transferred without the consent of       Congress and the Tribes;        (D) shall not be subject to taxation by a State or local       government; and        (E) shall not be subject to any provision of law providing       for the review or approval by the Secretary of the Interior       before the Tribes may use the land for any purpose as allowed       by the document titled ``Covenant Between the Oglala Sioux       Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe'' and dated October       21, 2022, directly, or through agreement with another party.

SEC. 3. LAND HELD IN RESTRICTED FEE STATUS BY THE TRIBES.         (a) Action by Secretary.--Not later than 365 days after       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--        (1) complete all actions, including documentation and minor       corrections to the survey and legal description of Tribal       land, necessary for the Tribal land to be held by the Tribes       in restricted fee status; and        (2) appropriately assign each applicable private and       municipal utility and service right or agreement with regard       to the Tribal land.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3371, the bill now under  consideration.  [[Page H4365]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3371, the Wounded Knee Memorial and Sacred Site  Act, introduced by Congressman Johnson from South Dakota, would place  approximately 40 acres of fee land within the Pine Ridge Reservation  into restricted fee status for the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne  River Sioux Tribe.   The land would be held as a memorial and a sacred site in remembrance  of the Indian people killed in the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. In  the mid- and late-1800s, there were many armed conflicts between  Tribes, settlers, and U.S. military on the Great Plains and in the  Western United States.                                time  1700    This contributed to distrust, fear, and misconceptions between  groups, and the Wounded Knee Massacre was a result of that atmosphere.   On December 29, 1890, a group of Lakota Indians, led by Chief Spotted  Elk, had made camp near Wounded Knee Creek on the Pine Ridge Indian  Reservation in South Dakota. U.S. Army 7th Cavalry troops were sent  there to disarm the Lakota.   A struggle occurred between the U.S. Army and some of Chief Spotted  Elk's band, a majority of which consisted of women and children. A shot  rang out, and the U.S. Army opened fire on the largely unarmed group.  At that time, it was estimated that approximately 300 Indian people  were killed.   In September 2022, the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River  Sioux Tribe jointly purchased 40 acres of land where an old trading  post was located. The piece of land also contains a portion of the area  where the Wounded Knee Massacre took place.   On October 21, 2022, both Tribes signed a covenant stating that this  property shall be held and maintained as a memorial and sacred site  without any economic development and prohibited any gaming on the land.   I applaud Mr. Johnson for working collaboratively with both Tribes to  develop H.R. 3371, which would place the 40 acres into restricted fee  status held jointly by both Tribes and memorializes the covenant  between them.   Restricted fee land contains the same restrictions against alienation  and taxation as land held in trust, but title is not held by the  Federal Government. It is held by the Oglala Sioux and the Cheyenne  River Sioux Tribes.   This legislation and the land it sets aside will memorialize and  honor the Indian men, women, and children who were killed in 1890.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson)  and the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes for their work on  this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the lead sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation will further allow the  Lakota  [[Page H4366]]  people to memorialize and honor their relatives and ancestors killed in  the Wounded Knee Massacre. It gives title of the land to both the  Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe while ensuring  that the land has the protections that restrictions against alienation  and taxation provide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill and yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2872) to amend the Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of  2013 to allow States to issue electronic stamps under such Act, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2872         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 1. AUTHORIZING FULLY ELECTRONIC STAMPS.         (a) In General.--Section 5 of the Permanent Electronic Duck       Stamp Act of 2013 (16 U.S.C. 718r) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``Actual Stamp'' and       inserting ``Electronic Stamp'';        (B) by striking ``actual stamp'' and inserting ``electronic       stamp''; and        (C) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:        ``(1) upon the date of purchase; and'';        (2) in subsection (c), by inserting ``under subsection       (e)'' before the period at the end; and        (3) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f) and       inserting after subsection (d) the following new subsection:        ``(e) Delivery of Actual Stamps.--The Secretary shall issue       an actual stamp after March 10 of each year to each       individual that purchased an electronic stamp for the       preceding waterfowl seasons.''.        (b) Stamp Valid Through Close of Hunting Season.--Section 6       of the Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013 (16 U.S.C.       718s(c)) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``shall, during the       effective period of the electronic stamp--'' and inserting       ``shall--''; and        (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``for a period agreed to       by the State and the Secretary, which shall not exceed 45       days'' and inserting ``until the first June 30 that occurs       after the date of issuance of such stamp''.        (c) Electronic Stamps as Permit.--Section 1(a)(1) of the       Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act (16 U.S.C.       718a(a)(1)) is amended--        (1) by inserting ``as an electronic stamp or'' after       ``Conservation Stamp,''; and        (2) by inserting ``actual'' after ``face of the''.        (d) Contents of Electronic Stamp.--Section 2(3) of the       Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013 (16 U.S.C.       718o(3)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``and'';        (2) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(F) may contain an image of the actual stamp.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the matter under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2872, sponsored by the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my friend and colleague.   This bill makes commonsense improvements to the Federal Duck Stamp  program by modernizing how waterfowl hunters across the country can  purchase a Federal duck stamp.   The duck stamp was created when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act into law in 1934. That law  required waterfowl and other migratory bird hunters ages 16 and over to  purchase and possess a valid duck stamp prior to taking of migratory  waterfowl.   Current law requires hunters to physically possess a signed duck  stamp on their person while hunting any migratory waterfowl. Even in  States where electronic licensing is used, a signed physical duck stamp  is required.   H.R. 2872 further modernizes the program by removing the 45-day  requirement to have a physical duck stamp, and it allows States the  option to sell electronic duck stamps for the entirety of the hunting  season.   Under this bill, purchasers would still receive the physical stamp at  the end of their State waterfowl hunting season, therefore preserving  the long legacy of the Federal Duck Stamp as a physical representation  of the conservation efforts of hunters for generations to come.   This is a good governance approach that will reassure waterfowl  hunters and continue the unmatched American tradition of wildlife  conservation through sportsman participation. I applaud Mr. Graves for  his work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the lead sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, the North American Model of Wildlife  Conservation, which is based on a user-pays system through the purchase  of items like the Federal duck stamp, is the envy of the world. In  total, fees paid by the sportsmen community contribute over $1 billion  per year in revenue that goes toward wildlife conservation, which is a  truly remarkable achievement.   H.R. 2872 is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that underpins the North  American model by giving hunters certainty while modernizing the  Federal duck stamp process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 663) to amend the Indian Child Protection and Family  Violence Prevention Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 663         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Child       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. INDIAN CHILD PROTECTION AND FAMILY VIOLENCE                     PREVENTION ACT AMENDMENTS.         The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention       Act (25 U.S.C. 3202 et seq.) is amended as follows:        (1) By amending section 403(3)(A) (25 U.S.C. 3202(3)(A)) to       read as follows:        ``(A) in any case in which--        ``(i)(I) a child is dead or exhibits evidence of skin       bruising, bleeding, malnutrition, failure to thrive, burns,       fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, soft tissue       swelling; and        ``(II) such condition is not justifiably explained or may       not be the product of an accidental occurrence; or        ``(ii) a child is subjected to sexual assault, sexual       molestation, sexual exploitation, sexual contact, or       prostitution; and''.

SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON APPROPRIATIONS.         No additional amounts are authorized to carry out this Act       or any of the amendments made by this Act. Each program,       project, and activity authorized by this Act or the       amendments made by this Act shall be subject to the       availability of appropriations made in advance for such       purposes.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 663, as amended, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 663, the Native American Child Protection Act,  introduced by Congressman Gallego from Arizona, would amend the Indian  Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act to reauthorize  three programs administered by the Department of Health and Human  Services and the Department of the Interior.   These programs include the Indian Child Abuse Treatment Grant  Program, the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention  Program, and the Indian Child Resource and Family Service Centers,  which would be renamed the national Indian child resource and family  service center under this legislation.   These programs are intended to prevent cases within Indian  communities where child abuse, neglect, family violence, and trauma may  occur, and to provide treatment for victims of Indian child sexual  abuse.   H.R. 663 also makes several technical changes to the underlying  statute and requires agency reports on grant awards and performance.   The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act was  introduced in 1989 by the late Arizona Senator John McCain in response  to widespread reports that Native children were being physically and  sexually abused, that these incidents were going underreported, and  that there needed to be supports in place to ensure the Bureau of  Indian Affairs could handle the situation at the time.   The act created the programs that H.R. 663 would reauthorize, and it  included provisions to provide Tribes with technical assistance  training and other resources related to the investigation and treatment  of the cases of family violence, abuse, and neglect.   The authorization for these programs expired in 1997. H.R. 663 would  reauthorize these programs and make improvements to the programs'  operations and service delivery.   Advocates cite the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence  Prevention Act as the only Federal statute that sets aside funding for  Tribal governments dedicated to child abuse prevention and victim  treatment funding for Tribal governments.   I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona for bringing attention to  this important issue, as abuse, neglect, and violence have no place in  any community.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation does the critical work of  Congress to update and reauthorize programs. This work is especially  important when the programs in question help protect children and  support Tribes in caring for their Tribal members.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
