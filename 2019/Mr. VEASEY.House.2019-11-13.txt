 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is National Women in Apprenticeship  Day, and today I celebrate the accomplishments of all women who are  working in the nontraditional technical and manufacturing fields.   During World War II, we saw women across the Nation flock to  factories to fill technical and manufacturing jobs that were vacated by  men leaving to fight for our country. We saw it in Fort Worth at what  is now the Lockheed Martin plant--just some great pictures that capture  that time period that still exist today.   But, nearly 70 years later, we are struggling to give women equal  representation in these fields.   That is why my fellow co-chair of the Blue Collar Caucus,  Representative Brendan Boyle, and I are proud to introduce the Women in  Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations Amendment Act that will  break employment barriers that face women of all races and backgrounds  entering into technical and manufacturing occupations.   Because the best way we can celebrate National Women in  Apprenticeship Day is by taking action to ensure that all Americans  have a fair shot at entering our workforce and achieving the American  Dream.   I also want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Jackie Speier, for  her work on the legislation that we will vote on later this week, the  Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019, which will  honor any female individual who held employment or volunteered in  support of the war efforts during the World War II time period back in  the 1940s.                            ____________________
