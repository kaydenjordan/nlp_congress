 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my greeting to my  friends in the Sikh community who are celebrating the 550th anniversary  of the birth of Guru Nanak Sahib, the founder of the Sikh religion.   ``Sat Sri Akal.''   According to Sikh tradition, Guru Nanak's birth and many events in  his life demonstrate that he had been marked with divine grace. During  his life, he traveled to many places proclaiming the message of one God  who dwells in each and every one of his creations and constitutes  eternal truth.   Guru Nanak set up a unique spiritual, social, and political platform  based upon equality, fraternal love, goodness, and virtue--attributes  we could use more of in our world today.   The anniversary of Guru Nanak's birth is the perfect time to reflect  on the contributions of the Sikh community to world peace and  understanding.   The strength of the United States lies in our rich diversity. We are  truly blessed with the people of many faiths and cultures, including  the Sikhs, who have contributed so much to the fabric of our American  communities and the entire world.   Mr. Speaker, ``Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguruji ki Fateh.'' Purity  belongs to the Creator, all victory belongs to Him.                            ____________________
