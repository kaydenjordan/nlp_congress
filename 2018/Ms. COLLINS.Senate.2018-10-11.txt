 Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of  Justice Lance Walker of Maine to serve on the U.S. District Court for  the State of Maine. With nearly two decades of experience as both an  attorney and as a judge in Maine, Justice Walker is well-qualified for  the Federal bench.   Justice Walker is a lifelong Mainer, where he lives with his wife  Heidi and their two daughters, Ava and Dylan. He was born in the small  town of Milo and raised in Dover-Foxcroft. He graduated from the  University of Maine and from the University of Maine School of Law,  with honors. He clerked for the Maine Superior Court before entering  private practice.   Early in his career, Justice Walker distinguished himself as a  skilled trial and appellate attorney at the law firm of Norman, Hanson  & DeTroy, one of the premier law firms in Maine. He tried cases before  juries and judges throughout Maine and in Federal Court and was  selected for recognition in respected peer-reviewed legal publications  such as Benchmark Litigation, Super Lawyers, and Best Lawyers in  America.   In 2014, Justice Walker was unanimously confirmed to the Maine  District Court by the Maine State Senate. He adjudicated a wide variety  of cases primarily in Androscoggin and Oxford Counties. A year later,  Justice Walker was nominated to serve on the Maine Superior Court,  Maine's trial court of general jurisdiction, a post to which he was  also unanimously confirmed. Justice Walker has presided over complex  criminal and civil cases, appeals, postconviction reviews, and jury  trials.   As a judge, Justice Walker has spoken with recovering addicts and  caregivers about opioid addiction and its intersection with the  criminal justice system, an issue that is of urgent importance to  communities across Maine.   The Judiciary Committee received several letters of support from  legal professionals in Maine who know Justice Walker well, including  from attorneys who have appeared before him, and from the Maine Trial  Lawyers Association. Justice Walker has a reputation for fairness and  respect for the law. As Daniel Wathen, former chief justice of the  Maine Supreme Court, wrote: ``I have known a lot of lawyers and judges  in my fifty three year legal career in Maine, and I can think of no one  who is better qualified to assume the trial bench in the federal court  system. Having served on the Supreme Court of Maine for more than  twenty years, I believe that I can recognize a good judge. Lance's  nomination is well deserved and if confirmed, he will serve with  integrity, competence, and humanity. In short, he will add to the  strength and stature of the distinguished federal bench in Maine.''   Justice Walker has the intellect, experience, integrity, temperament,  and respect for the Constitution and the rule of law that are essential  in a Federal judge. His experience in private practice and as a State  judge makes him well-qualified for the Federal district court, and if  confirmed, he will serve the people of Maine and the Nation fairly and  capably.   I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.    Mr. President, I rise today regarding remarks I made on  October 5, 2018, on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. In reference to  Justices O'Connor, Souter, and Kennedy, I misspoke and should have said  that pro-choice groups opposed two of the nominations, not each.   My remarks should have read, ``Furthermore, pro-choice groups  vigorously opposed two of the Justices' nominations.''                            ____________________     Mr. President. Along with my colleague and friend,  Senator Claire McCaskill, I am introducing the Stamp Out Elder Abuse  Act of 2018, a bill that seeks to help combat the abuse and financial  exploitation of our nation's seniors. Our bill would create a  semipostal, or fundraising, stamp that would allow Postal Service  customers to make a voluntary contribution to help raise awareness and  combat elder abuse with a stamp purchase. The proceeds from this stamp  would go to the Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS)  Administration on Community Living (ACL) and the Department of Justice  (DOJ). This additional funding for the ACL would be used to further  support the development and advancement of emerging practices to  prevent and respond to the abuse of older adults. Funding for the DOJ  would go toward improving prosecution, data collection, litigation  support, and prevention of elder abuse initiatives. Notably, this bill  would help to provide needed additional revenue to tackle elder abuse  without costing the federal government a single penny.   Abuse can happen to anyone--no matter the person's age, gender, race,  religion, or ethnic or cultural background. Each year, hundreds of  thousands of adults over the age of 60 are abused, neglected, or  financially exploited. Abuse can happen in many places, including a  person's home, a family member's house, an assisted living facility, or  a nursing home. Just as abuse can occur in various settings, there are  many types of elder abuse, including physical abuse, emotional abuse,  sexual abuse, neglect, abandonment, and financial exploitation.  Although there are different types of  [[Page S6819]]  abuse, it is common for a victim to experience more than one type of  mistreatment.   According to the National Council on Aging, approximately one in ten  Americans aged 60 years old or older have experienced some form of  elder abuse, and according to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older  Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9  billion annually. We know, however, that the true number is probably  much higher since many of these cases are never reported because the  victim is too often ashamed to report abuse, particularly when it  involves a family member. As a consequence, the true incidence of abuse  is not known. In fact, the National Center on Elder Abuse reports that  only one in 14 cases are reported to the authorities.   In my home State of Maine--the State with the oldest population by  median age--an estimated 33,000 seniors each year are the victims of  some kind of abuse or financial fraud. Moreover, in as many as 90  percent of financial cases, the senior is victimized by someone he or  she knows well. In a 2017 report of financial exploitation of Maine's  older adults, in most cases financial exploitation is perpetrated by a  family members and for those perpetrators who were family members, the  majority were the victim's child.   In a recent case in Maine, police charged a pastor in York County,  Maine, with exploiting an incapacitated elderly woman. They say the man  befriended the woman while he was volunteering at the assisted-living  community where she lived. According to police, the State determined  the woman to be incapacitated and assigned her a guardian and  conservator. The pastor allegedly took the woman to her bank, withdrew  money to have the locks changed on her former home, which had been on  the market, and he took down the ``for sale'' sign.   Police say the pastor told the woman he would help her return to her  house, even though it was not equipped for the wheelchair access she  required. He suggested his daughter could live with the woman to care  for her. Police say his goal was to ingratiate himself and have access  to this woman's financial accounts and property. Fortunately, in this  case, the conservator, who was legally responsible for protecting the  woman's assets, identified and reported the suspected criminal activity  to the police.   Combatting elder abuse of seniors is primarily the responsibility of  state and local agencies, particularly Adult Protective Services  agencies. Prevention and response to cases of abuse require coordinated  efforts, including state and local agencies, law enforcement, the  social work and medical community, and financial institutions.   The Federal government also plays an important role in providing  leadership to combat this problem. The Elder Justice Coordinating  Council, which is led by HHS and DOJ, has brought other federal  agencies to the table to coordinate efforts to protect older  individuals from abuse. In January, the DOJ took another step forward  by directing all 94 U.S. Attorneys' offices to each designate an elder  justice coordinator, who will develop strategies to protect seniors in  their districts. This will promote greater cooperation between the DOJ  and its law enforcement partners. While the best way to intervene in  the problem of elder abuse is to prevent it from happening in the first  place, when abuse does occur, it is crucial that the perpetrators of  the crimes not go unpunished.   I worked closely on the Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2018 with Philip  C. Marshall, founder of Beyond Brooke, a cause-based campaign named to  honor Philip's late grandmother, Brooke Astor, who was a well-known  philanthropist, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a  victim of elder abuse and elder financial exploitation. In 2015, Mr.  Marshall testified before the Senate Aging Committee about how his  father mistreated his grandmother and mismanaged her assets while she  suffered from Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I am pleased that the  nonpartisan Elder Justice Coalition, which represents more than 3,000  members, along with the National Center for Victims of Crime, the  National Sheriff's Association, and the National Association on Area  Agencies on Aging support the bill.   Preventing and combating elder abuse require law enforcement and  social service agencies at all levels of government to work  collaboratively with the private sector. The Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act  would assist the Federal government's role to help make that happen. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. President--I ask that letters from these organizations appear in  the Record immediately following my remarks.   There being no objection so ordered.                                   ____                                   National Sheriffs' Association,                                   Alexandria, VA, October 10, 2018.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Sheriffs'       Association (NSA) and the more than 3,000 elected sheriffs       nationwide, I write to endorse the Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act       of 2018 proposed by yourself and cosponsored by Senator       Claire McCaskill. This Act initiates a semi postal stamp that       not only raises elder abuse awareness, but also dedicates the       proceeds to elder justice programs within DOJ and HHS.        As you may know, the NSA was one of the founding groups in       the National Association of Triads, Inc. National Triads       serves as a clearinghouse of information, best practices and       early alert system for local Triads. Triad is a national       community policing concept that partners law enforcement       agencies with older adult volunteer groups and older adult       related community services to educate older adults on crime       and fraud, to reduce crime against the elderly, and eliminate       the unwarranted fear of crime.        After twenty-two years in existence, there are Triads in       more than 680 counties in 36 states. Triad serves 16 million       seniors nationwide--nearly half of America's senior       population. The National Sheriffs' Association and local       sheriffs have long recognized the need to ensure the safety       and quality of life for the growing number of senior citizens       by supporting the formation of community partnerships under       the auspice of Triad. Triad has a clear vision and a simple       mission--to keep seniors safe from crime.        The Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2018 makes a clear effort       to increase awareness and support for the elderly community.       We applaud your efforts to support prevention and education,       investigation and prosecution, and victims' services in an       effort in combat elder abuse.            Sincerely,                                              Jonathan F.

We are pleased that the bill will direct the United States       Postal Service to develop the semi-postal stamp and use the       proceeds from its sales to provide funding to augment the       elder justice initiatives at both the Administration on Aging       in the Department of Health and Human Services and at the       Department of Justice. These programs include prevention,       education, data collection, services to protect and support       victims, and demonstration projects, in addition to       initiatives to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of       elder abuse and financial exploitation. Further, the       departments will be able to use their resources to support       dissemination of the stamp.        Thank you again for your leadership on this and other elder       justice issues.
