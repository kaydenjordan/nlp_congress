 Mr. Speaker, in 1781, General George  Washington called the fortifications at West Point the most important  post in America. Holding West Point meant preventing the British from  dividing the Nation along the Hudson River Valley.   Following the war, President Washington made numerous efforts to  create a military academy. His actual first effort was within a year of  becoming the Commander in Chief. However, it fell to Thomas Jefferson  to get it done and, in 1802, the United States Military Academy at West  Point was founded as the Nation's school to teach the art and science  of warfare.   Since its inception, West Point graduates have served to preserve our  Nation's freedom in battle. From the Mexican wars to the war on terror,  West Point graduates have sacrificed their lives and their youth to win  our Nation's wars.   Off the battlefield, West Point graduates have served at the very  highest levels of the U.S. military as legislators, Cabinet  secretaries, Governors, Presidents, and CEOs leading the development of  our Nation's infrastructure and the establishment of the world's  greatest economy.                                time  1945    For young people who choose West Point over a traditional education,  it is truly a different path.   From the moment you start in Beast Barracks, a cadet lives by the  code of conduct of the military officer, recognizing that their life  becomes second to the safety of Americans.   Almost 100 West Point graduates have given their lives in this most  recent war. It is that commitment to the Nation made at such a young  age that makes the place so special.   What sets West Point as an institution apart is just about everything  that happens there: the grueling academics; the compulsory  participation in sports; the military drill; the military training; and  perhaps most noteworthy, the leadership and character development. West  Point even uses our math classes to teach cadets how to present  themselves and to hone their military bearing.   But for me, what took my experience at West Point to the next level  were the men and women who made up my class, the class of 1986.   Our motto is ``Courage Never Quits, '86.''   We came to West Point from all over the country, men and women from  every State, nearly every religion,  [[Page H2632]]  every ethnic origin; and we came together as one team fighting to get  through the Academy's rigorous education. Almost one-third who started  our class left before graduating.   Over the years, we celebrated together, served in the Army together.  Many left the military to serve elsewhere in government and business.  But each of us has tried to live by that motto, ``Courage Never  Quits,'' and boy, have we.   Our class has produced 18 general officers: four 3-star generals; we  have no 4-stars yet because we haven't been out of the Academy long  enough; in addition, we have nine 2-stars and six 1-star generals.   Our class produced a Secretary of State, a Secretary of the Army. Two  of us have served in Congress, one of whom went on to be the Director  of the CIA and, of course, Secretary of State.   We have had at least two State legislators. Three judges come from  our ranks, as well as at least four deans and chancellors of  universities.   We have served at senior levels throughout the government, from the  Department of State to the FBI, to the leadership of the Defense  Logistics Agency, to consultants to Presidents of the United States.   Twenty-two-plus members of my class are presidents and CEOs of major  corporations, from 7-Eleven to Mercedes-Benz USA.   And, yes, we, too, have had those in our ranks make the ultimate  sacrifice for our freedom. Be thou at peace.   More than anything, more than just the amazing location on the Hudson  River, more than the unparalleled history of the place, more than the  grueling academics, more than its unbelievable place in our Nation's  great story, what pushes me to serve is the knowledge of what my peers  have accomplished. Their hard work reminds me to never stop reading,  learning, growing, and serving. They are my motivation, and they are  why I will never quit.   Rangers Lead The Way.   Night Stalkers Don't Quit.   Courage Never Quits, '86.   Go Army. Beat Navy.
