 Madam President, I came to the floor this morning to  listen to the statements made by the other side of the aisle in  reaction to the proposal of Speaker Pelosi to deal with the coronavirus  and the national emergency we face.   The Republican leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, as well as his  whip, repeated their theme on the issue of the liability facing  businesses and others because of the COVID virus pandemic which we are  facing. In fact, the leader, Senator McConnell, has gone so far as to  declare that there is a ``redline''--his words, a ``redline''--to bar  any further assistance to State and local governments and other  entities until we address this so-called liability question. He has  gone so far as to say that he will refuse to fund the money that has  been proposed officially by the Democrats to help our police,  firefighters, paramedics, and teachers unless we provide guaranteed  business immunity from COVID-19 lawsuits--lawsuits that might be  brought by workers and consumers.   Senator McConnell's guaranteed business immunity is an invitation,  sadly, for irresponsible corporations to cut corners when it comes to  protecting workers as well as protecting their customers. The McConnell  redline threat will result in more people being infected by the  coronavirus and more people getting sick--exactly the opposite of what  we should be doing as a matter of policy.   We also heard today, both from Senators McConnell and Thune, that  there is no urgency in continuing to provide assistance across America  because of the economic crisis that we face and certainly the public  health crisis we face. I couldn't disagree more on both counts--the  McConnell redline on guaranteeing business immunity as well as the  argument that we have done enough. Let's sit back and wait and see what  happens. I couldn't disagree more.   Yesterday, we had a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Senator Graham held the hearing and the title was ``Examining the  Liability During the COVID-19 Pandemic.'' That hearing took place  yesterday afternoon after Senator McConnell had come to the floor and  had spoken about the concerns of businesses about lawsuits against them  related to the COVID-19 virus.  [[Page S2392]]    In fact, Senator McConnell came to the floor yesterday morning and  characterized the lawsuits that were being filed and pending because of  this pandemic, and the words he used to characterize them were very  explicit. He called it an ``epidemic of frivolous lawsuits.'' He  referred to the ``minefield'' created by these lawsuits. He went so far  as to call them a ``tidal wave''--``tidal wave,'' his words on the  floor of the U.S. Senate when it came to these lawsuits related to  COVID-19.   So I went into this with my staff and said: Tell me about this tidal  wave of lawsuits. Here is what we discovered about this so-called tidal  wave of lawsuits. As of Monday, there are 958 COVID-related cases that  had been discovered in a tracking database of lawsuits filed in the  United States--958. But then we took a closer look.   How many of these lawsuits were malpractice suits being brought  against hospitals, clinics, doctors, nurses, medical professionals?  Nine. Nine lawsuits. There have been 1.3 million Americans diagnosed as  infected by the COVID-19 virus, and 9 lawsuits have been filed.   Senator McConnell calls that a tidal wave. A tidal wave? It is barely  a ripple.   We added 27 other cases for personal injury. We are up to 36 cases  out of 1.3 million Americans who have been diagnosed as infected--36  cases. That is not to say that they are all serious or all frivolous.  No way of saying. I am counting all lawsuits of personal injury and  medical malpractice brought because of COVID-19.   We took a look at other lawsuits. There are 260 lawsuits that have  been filed by prisoners in jails arguing that they were held in an  unhealthy, unsanitary, and unsafe condition. Is that what the Senator  wants to stop? Does he consider that a tidal wave of lawsuits?   There are 171 cases brought against insurance companies. In other  words, a business is suing an insurance company over the coverage they  have in their insurance policy. Is that one of the avalanche of  lawsuits that Senator McConnell is talking about?   There are 95 contract cases and 79 civil rights cases. We took a look  at the civil rights cases being filed with mention of COVID-19, and,  you know, many of them were being filed by businesses arguing that they  should be allowed to reopen. Is Senator McConnell suggesting that we  should be prohibiting those lawsuits as well?   What it comes down to is this. There is no tidal wave of lawsuits. We  shouldn't condition helping businesses, unemployed people, and  individuals across America because of this phantom threat of lawsuits.  I am surprised that they didn't refer to a caravan of trial lawyers  coming up to the courthouses across America. It just isn't there.   Yesterday, in a hearing, we had some excellent witnesses. One of the  better witnesses, I will be happy to concede, was a person brought in  by the Republican Senators. His name is Kevin Smartt. Kevin is the  chief executive officer and president of Kwik Chek Food Stores out of  Bonham, TX. He was speaking on behalf of the National Association of  Convenience Stores.   He told the story of what he has done with his businesses and outlets  and 600 employees to make it safer for them. He has really gone, based  on his testimony, to great lengths to create a safe workplace. But  Listen to what Kevin Smartt said about the problems he faces.   Here is his testimony: ``This was a challenge [mitigating the threat]  because the guidance provided by the CDC, [OSHA] as well as state and  local governments often conflicted with one another in addition to  being vague and difficult to follow.''   What he was looking for and stated in his sworn testimony were  guidelines for a safe workplace, guidelines for a safe business place,  and they don't exist. One of the reasons came up earlier this morning  when Senator Schumer came to the floor and said: We want to see the CDC  guidelines released so businesses and individuals across America can  see how to deal with this threat in the workplace.   There was an objection on the Republican side of the aisle for the  publication of these CDC guidelines. They can't have it both ways. They  can't argue through Senator McConnell that we should have guaranteed  business immunity from liability and then basically say to the  businesses, as Mr. Smartt told us, there are no guidelines.   You see, that is a defense in any lawsuit. We live by the guidelines.  We have appropriate social distancing. We put up the plastic shields to  protect employees and customers. We have people wearing masks.   Those are all good defenses in any lawsuit that might be brought, but  the Republicans want it both ways: guaranteed immunity for the business  but no guidelines from the government as to what is a safe practice.  Mr. Smartt said that makes his job next to impossible in his important  business in Texas.   But there were numbers given to us yesterday that really did show a  tidal wave. Marc Perrone is the president of the United Food and  Commercial Workers. He testified before our committee, and during the  course of his testimony he told us that 162 of his workers--those who  are in grocery stores, food processing, and particularly in meat  processing, 162--have died from COVID-19.   Now, working in a meatpacking plant is something I know a little bit  about. I worked my way through college--12 months--in a meatpacking  plant in East St. Louis, IL. It is dirty, hot, and dangerous work,  elbow to elbow with fellow workers. I saw it firsthand. It has  changed--I am sure--over the years, but the fundamentals are still  there, and that is the danger of that workplace. The most dangerous  workplace in America--meat processing. There have been 162 deaths and  25,000 of Marc Perrone's workers who have been infected so far with  COVID-19.   So, if you want to talk about a tidal wave, we ought to take a look  at what those workers in meat processing are facing right now. Some  companies are, conscientiously, trying to do the right thing and make  their workplace better and safer and test their employees. I salute all  of them. There are good people who are leading these businesses, and  they are making good decisions, but they need the guidelines and  standards of the CDC and OSHA. And the Republicans just objected to  publishing those standards.   I want to tell you, there is a way through this pandemic in a  sensible fashion that is fair to business and fair to workers as well.  This notion that giving guaranteed immunity to businesses across the  board is the answer is just plain wrong. Those businesses--many of  them--will take advantage of that umbrella of protection from any  lawsuits. They will cut corners. More people will be infected, and  there will be more bad results.   Conscientious businesses like the one represented yesterday on the  Republican side in the Senate Judiciary Committee deserve what Mr.  Smartt is asking for--standards we can stand by and live with.                                  HEROES Act    Mr. President, let me say a word about this HEROES Act that was  released yesterday by Speaker Pelosi. Yes, she has asked for more money  to be spent. We have to decide whether it is worth spending.   Is it worth giving more direct economic payments to families across  America? I supported President Trump's call for those payments in the  first round. Does he believe, do we believe, does the Senate believe  that $1,200 is the end of the story for people who are struggling these  days, facing unemployment, facing the hardships that are part of our  economy?   The flood of people at our food banks tells us that people need more  resources to provide the basics for their family. Senator McConnell has  told us that is not an urgent need. Well, he ought to go to a food bank  in Kentucky and take a look around. He is going to see a lot of  people--not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents--facing the  hardships of this economy.   To say it is not urgent that we provide money to hospitals--I will  tell you, even in the areas of Illinois--smalltown, rural Illinois-- hospitals are struggling even if they don't have COVID virus infections  to deal with. They are struggling because of the economy and people who  are leery about going forward with elective surgery and outpatient  treatment.   One thing to keep in mind: Even if you happen to have a hospital in a  remote, rural area with little or no infection from the COVID virus, if  you want  [[Page S2393]]  to return to elective surgery, good medical practice requires that you  test the patient before the surgery to see if they are positive for  COVID virus. Hospitals I have talked to are also testing the drivers  who are going to take the patient home after the procedure.   We need testing so that these hospitals, even in areas not directly  affected by this pandemic, can get back in business and keep their  doors open. What a tragedy it is, in any State, to lose hospitals in  rural areas.   Speaker Pelosi, in her bill, the HEROES Act, calls for additional  funds for these hospitals. I think there is a sense of urgency to that.  Clearly, Senator McConnell does not.   The notion that we would honor the people who are working on the  frontlines to make sure that they would be able to continue to serve us  and to risk their lives for us in treating the patients--I think that  is a priority, and there is a sense of urgency, and I think Speaker  Pelosi was correct in including that money to give those first  responders, health workers, and others a helping hand.   And let me say that this notion that we shouldn't be helping State  and local governments--who in the world do we think is on the frontline  in the battle against this national emergency, this pandemic? It is the  doctors, of course, and the nurses, of course, but it is also our first  responders, our policemen, our firefighters, and even our teachers.   If we don't provide the resources that have been lost to the States  and localities because of this pandemic, there will be cutbacks in pay  and layoffs for sure. Is that how we are going to answer this national  emergency? I believe there is a profound sense of urgency here as well.   I notice that a couple of my colleagues are on the floor to speak, so  I will wrap up my remarks by saying we need to stick with this program  of helping America get back on its feet. We need to stand by the  individuals who are struggling to feed their families and going to food  banks to try to get by. We need to stand by those who are drawing  unemployment insurance today with additional Federal help, trying to  keep their families together while they are looking for a job and  waiting for the economy to rebound.   We need to stand by the small businesses that cannot survive if we  don't continue our assistance. This notion that because it was Speaker  Pelosi who suggested it, it has to be a bad idea is just plain wrong  and selfish.   Look at her proposals on their merits. They mirror what we have  started to do with the CARES Act and need to continue to do. As I said  yesterday, you don't build a bridge halfway across a river. You build  it all the way.   Let's build it to the point where our economy can rebound with  strength and people can get back to work. Let's stand by the workers  and their families and the businesses and support the HEROES Act that  has been introduced in the House of Representatives.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.
