 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 21, line 10, strike ``or''.        Page 21, line 15, strike the period and insert a semicolon.        Page 21, insert after line 15 the following:        (4) have received educational assistance under chapter 33       of title 38, United States Code; or        (5) graduated from a qualifying educational institution, as       defined by the Department, and have not reached 30 years of       age.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman and  ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and Representative  Wenstrup for their work on this important bill.   This legislation empowers the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with the  authority to hire the best and brightest employees.   We can all agree that you can't have a top-notch VA without employing  young veterans who want to continue serving their country after they  return from the front lines. Each and every day, our brave men and  women in uniform put their lives on the line for us, and we owe it to  them to ensure that, when they return home, they have the best care at  the VA and that they also have the best career opportunities available  to them.   This legislation is about veterans serving veterans. Young veterans  in the Fifth District of New Jersey, where I live, tell me that they  face significant challenges when they return home, even though many of  them have a desire to help serve other veterans.   I was lucky enough to hire one such veteran on my team, Mike  DeVilliers, who served in the U.S. Army. Mike is committed to helping  other veterans and has, at a local community college, where he ran a  program for student veterans. He now serves my constituents, including  our veterans and across the four counties in the Fifth District.   We should be encouraging talented and qualified young veterans like  Mike to put their skills to use and give back to their fellow  servicemen and -women. The VA is one place those skills are sorely  needed to best serve the 473,000 veterans who live in New Jersey and  the many other veterans across our country.   Mr. Chairman, approximately 60 percent of VA employees are over the  age of 45, and the Department has struggled to develop an adequate  pipeline for younger employees and emerging leaders to fill crucial and  critical roles. We have seen the negative effects of not having the  right team in place to support our veterans. While programs like  Pathways at the VA are a step in the right direction, we can do more to  improve the process and give a leg up to all veterans who wish to bring  their skills to the VA.   More than half of the post-9/11 veterans are 34 years of age or  younger, and approximately 30 percent have bachelor's or advanced  degrees; yet the Department of Labor reported that post-9/11 vets face  a higher unemployment rate than other veterans. That is simply  unacceptable.   The VA should draw from their excellent source of talent to  strengthen the care all of our veterans receive by considering more  young veterans for excepted service appointments. That is why my  amendment would make sure that the VA Secretary includes recipients of  the post-9/11 GI Bill and younger veterans who have recently graduated  from college as a distinct category qualifying for excepted service  appointments to the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Mr. Chairman, the mission statement of the VA is inscribed outside  the Department's headquarters. It reads: ``To care for him who shall  have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' This is  President Lincoln's promise to serving and honoring the men and women  who are America's heroes, and it should and must be our same commitment  today. I know of no one who stands more willing and able to serve  fellow veterans and their brothers and sisters in arms than the  veterans themselves.   There is nothing partisan about serving our veterans. This is a  commonsense solution without any new costs, and it is a perfect example  of working across party lines to help get the backs of those who have  served our country.   I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for our veterans by  supporting this win-win solution.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
