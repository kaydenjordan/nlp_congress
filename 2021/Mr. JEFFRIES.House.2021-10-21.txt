 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman and  chair of the Rules Committee for yielding and for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, the House is a separate and coequal branch of  government. We are the institution that is closest to the people. The  House has a sacred obligation under the Constitution to defend our  democracy, and we should be doing that in a bipartisan way, but  something has happened to the modern-day Republican Party.   The party of Abraham Lincoln is gone. The party of Ronald Reagan is  gone. The party of John McCain is gone. A cult of personality has risen  up to take its place.   Is that why my colleagues refuse to denounce the former President's  lie uttered today, that the real insurrection was on November 3?   Take back your party. You can start today. You can start right here.  You can start by holding Steve Bannon accountable for his blanket  defiance of a congressional subpoena.   What is wrong with Steve Bannon? There is no cult exception to the  United States Constitution. There is a legitimate, bipartisan  congressional investigation that is underway into the violent  insurrection and attack on the Capitol on January 6. It was an assault  on the Congress, the Constitution, and the country.   A lawful subpoena has been issued that Steve Bannon should comply  with. We must hold Steve Bannon accountable for his blanket defiance of  a congressional subpoena, for undermining the rule of law, and for  obstructing a congressional investigation because, in America, no one,  no one, no one is above the law.
