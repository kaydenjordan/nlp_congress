 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume. When Americans from across the country come to visit  their Capitol, they are greeted by statues of some of the most  influential men and women in our Nation's history: American  trailblazers like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham  Lincoln, who happens to hail from my home State of Illinois. I am proud  to serve as the Representative of our 16th President's former home,  tomb, and the old State Capitol where President Lincoln delivered his  House Divided speech in 1858. In that speech, Lincoln spoke out against  slavery, including the Dred Scott decision, and delivered one of his  most profound statements.   I will quote the President, ``A house divided against itself cannot  stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave  and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not  expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided.  It will become all one thing or all the other.''   While I am proud to hail from the land of Lincoln and see him, among  others, who have fought for freedom represented in our Capitol, I also  recognize that there are some symbols that were donated nearly 100  years ago that are not representative of our Nation today, a Nation  that learns from our past and continues to strive to be a more perfect  Union.   For anyone watching today's floor debate, it probably sounds  familiar. That is because we voted at least twice in the last 2 years  on legislation that would remove the bust of Roger B. Taney from the  Old Supreme Court Chamber, and it is a move that I support, but  previous legislation has gone nowhere in the Senate because its scope  was much larger and aimed to remove several statues beyond that of Mr.  Taney.   While I can appreciate that the bill before us today is more narrow  in scope and that we are continuing the important discussion about  which statues belong in the U.S. Capitol, I am disappointed that this  bill didn't go through regular order and didn't go through the regular  legislative process and come before the Committee on House  Administration that is the committee that has jurisdiction over this  issue.   Furthermore, this bill directs the Joint Committee on the Library to  carry out the removal of the Taney bust. I point out, though, how  antiquated the Joint Committee on the Library has become. It only meets  once per Congress to organize, and any actual work of the committee is  carried out by the Committee on House Administration and the Senate  Rules Committees. Moving forward, I think we need to examine the  effectiveness of the joint committee remaining in its current form.                                time  1515    I support removing the bust of Taney and believe statues like his  only divide us as a Nation and do not represent the freedoms so many  Americans have fought and died for.   It is also important to take a moment to reflect on the fact that for  the past 1,005 days, these halls, while getting more people more  recently, have been largely closed to the public. And many Americans  have not had the opportunity to come visit their Member of Congress nor  appreciate all the history, the art, and the statues that are displayed  in the Capitol.   That being said, I look forward to the people's House fully opening  come January 3 under a new majority.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before my good friend from  Maryland leaves the floor, I want to ensure that something is entered  into the Congressional Record.   That I, Rodney Davis from Illinois, was minus 3 years old when my  good friend, Mr. Hoyer, was sworn into the Maryland State Senate. To  have a friend like Steny Hoyer, to be able to go out, like I am here in  a few weeks, knowing that you have a bipartisan piece of legislation  like this that is going to make Taney a gone-y when it comes to the  statues here in the U.S. Capitol, and to know that we are talking and  being able to have that bipartisan conversation is what I came here to  do.   Steny, I know I am not supposed to address you here, but I am glad to  yield to you if you would like to say something.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Maryland for his friendship.   I thank him for sparring with me over many issues over the years. We  have had a great time with that. There is one thing I know about Leader  Hoyer and a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here, they  have a great sense of humor. They enjoy the ability to get to know one  another on a humorous, friendly level. That allows us, in my opinion,  to be able to get to know each other better, to govern together. Today  is going to be a great example of that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am still waiting a bit. I sent a text to my colleague  from North Carolina, who is supposed to come down. I apologize if this  extends the votes this evening, but I don't think we will know the  difference between 10:30 and 10:35. We will be all right.   This is a day, too, that I remind my colleagues and say thank you for  working with the Senate to narrow the scope of this bill to the  egregious statue that we talked about today, and that is of Roger  Taney.   Roger Taney helped create in our Nation's history one of the most  disgusting Supreme Court decisions that we have ever seen.   But in the end, it was the leadership of people like Abraham Lincoln,  who represented my great State of Illinois and some of the counties  that I currently represent right here in this institution, it was his  leadership that he learned here in the House that he was able to then  take on his path to become President at the most consequential time in  our Nation's history.   The history of Abraham Lincoln and the leadership it took from him  and the dedication it took to end the vile practice of slavery in this  country, it is leadership and that historical lesson that we need to  continue to teach for generations to come.   My colleague from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) talked about teaching about  the bad decisions of people like Roger Taney in courts all across this  country and institutions all across this country decades and centuries  ago. They belong in our textbooks, and they belong in our history  lessons.   This is my fear, Mr. Speaker. My fear is that we are forgetting that  even the darkest parts of our Nation's history, the darkest parts of  the Civil War, the darkest parts of world history, need to be taught,  or many in future generations will forget how far we have come.   They will forget how, right now, the leadership and the dedication of  so many people like Thurgood Marshall, Abraham Lincoln, and so many  others that have served here in our government and throughout this  country put us where we are today, where we have the most diverse  Congress in our Nation's history.   We are the House that is representative of the people. Diversity is  seen everywhere you turn here in this institution and on this floor.   That is, in part, because people stepped up like Abraham Lincoln  after the dreadful Dred Scott decision and said enough is enough and  corrected bad parts of our history.   But now, in today's day and age, you see people who didn't get the  textbooks that taught all the history, didn't get the history lessons  that they needed, defacing and destroying statues of Abraham Lincoln.  Wow.   We have to be very careful that we don't let political correctness  and uneducated decisions be put forth that will then inspire  individuals to think that somehow every great leader in our Nation who  is remembered with a statue in communities, even outside this Capitol  and throughout our great Nation, are part of a problem. We need to do a  better job.   That is the reason we need to open this Capitol back up. Part of the  best education to understand our Nation's history is allowing Americans  to get back into our hallways to be able to see the statues that we  debate about here on the floor.   We can't educate the future leaders of America on the history of our  government if they can't see, feel, and touch the history that exists  right here in our Capitol.   Today, this bill that we are going to pass is a good thing. Tomorrow,  and long after I am gone, my fear is that we will continue to have  legislation put forward that will, unfortunately, go a lot further than  removing the bust of Roger Taney. Let us, as Americans, be very  careful.   Mr. Speaker, I see that my colleague has another speaker. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is inspiring to hear my colleagues from both sides of  the aisle throughout any debate talk about their passions, talk about  what matters most to their constituents. Mr. Green has always been  passionate about what matters most to his constituents, as I hope I  have been over the last 10 years.   Mr. Speaker, I have to apologize. This might be one of the last times  that I stand up and offer remarks on the House floor. A lot of my  colleagues here must have been praying together because finally,  finally, I have lost my voice. I sound like Peter Brady from ``The  Brady Bunch.'' My apologies.   I am so thankful for the friendships that I have been able to make  over the 10 years that I have served in this institution. But I want to  make sure that I address some issues that we are talking about today in  regard to statue removals, in regard to how we ensure that history,  even all the darkest parts, are taught to all Americans, because that  is the way we learn.   I learned, because I lived it, Abraham Lincoln's history. I take for  granted what we have available in my district that epitomizes the  strength of Abraham Lincoln.  [[Page H9821]]    If you ever want to see our Nation's history in action, I invite you.  Come to my district, and I will take you to the Abraham Lincoln  Presidential Library and Museum, where many of my colleagues that have  come and taken me up on that offer have been able to walk into a room  and see an original copy, an original. They didn't have Xerox machines  or copy machines back then. They had to handwrite the original copies  of the Emancipation Proclamation.   That is what Abraham Lincoln means to our Nation's history and  society's history and the ills that even existed after Abraham Lincoln  was assassinated.   We have to do better in this country. We can do better, and we are  doing better. But in the end, we live in the greatest country in the  history of the world that sends the most diverse people to our Nation's  Capitol to stand here and debate freely how to govern our great Nation.   We will fight, and we will argue, but in the end, we will shake  hands, disagree, walk away, and understand that we are better because  we are not separated. We are not just Republicans and Democrats; we are  Americans.   When tragedy hits the country, we come together in this House, and we  stand together as Americans. I hope that continues even in the more  polarizing environment that we have seen in this House in my lifetime.   I want to make a prediction that I hope doesn't come true. I hope  that we can change that by setting an example in this House. I hope we  don't try to continue to separate ourselves. I predict there will come  a day when people will be allowed into a restaurant based upon their  political affiliation or not. That is sad. I hope I am wrong.   I see so many opportunities in our Nation right now that are taken by  those who don't want us to believe in each other. They are taken away  by social media posts that will continue to try and divide us.   I came here 10 years ago and got the ability to have dinner when I  was in freshman orientation in Statuary Hall. I looked down and saw the  plaque that sits in Statuary Hall that says Abraham Lincoln, his desk  sits here, when he served one term in the House of Representatives.   It hit me that day. It sent chills that I have some pretty big shoes  to fill, representing some of the same geography that Abraham Lincoln  did when he was here centuries ago.   I knew we had a lot of work to do, and I will tell you, this  institution has done big things over my decade serving here.   There are things like this, though, that I hope send a message to our  Nation that we will stand up against those parts of our Nation's  history like Roger Taney, the most dreadful parts of our Nation's  history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone, especially my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, to please ensure that history continues to be taught  in our Nation's schools, that we learn about people like Roger Taney so  that people in America don't repeat the same disastrous decisions that  we saw happen with the Dred Scott decision.   Mr. Speaker, I think I have said enough. I support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chairperson Lofgren of the House  Administration Committee, for her work on this legislation. I will tell  the chair that while we didn't always agree on issues coming in front  of our committee, and we didn't always agree on how to run this  institution, I always enjoyed being able to serve with her. It may not  be reciprocated, but that is okay.                                time  1545    But in the end, you have a great team that I really enjoyed working  with. I sincerely hope that this institution becomes less polarized. I  certainly hope this institution becomes an institution where we can all  govern together and make this country even greater than it is today.   Vote for this bill.   Let's get rid of Roger Taney.   Let's make him a gone-y once again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
