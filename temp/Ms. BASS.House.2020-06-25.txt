 Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman in  California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Horsford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Haaland).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle for the  ideas that you were concerned about, and the fact that you recognized  that part of your ideas we did incorporate in the manager's amendment.  And so I do look forward to working with you in the future.   I want to say to several of my other colleagues on the other side of  the aisle: This is a process. We have had many conversations, many  conversations leading up to this, and I am sure those conversations  will continue. But I am really encouraged to hear my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, number one, agree that what happened in  Minneapolis was a horrific act of violence, and that the issue of  police abuse is a real issue and that the issue of systemic racism is a  real issue.   I think it is important to note that because as these situations have  happened before when people have been killed, even when they have been  killed on video, they always seem to be up for debate. ``Well, maybe we  don't really know what happened before the camera went on,'' or,  ``Maybe somebody was a criminal.''   We are united on both sides of the aisle in recognizing that there is  a problem in this country. There is a historic problem in this country.  And I believe that we will eventually get there and move forward and  have a bill. I am happy that we will be passing this bill today, but I  don't see this as the end.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici).                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on each  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say that there is absolutely nothing in our  bill that calls for defunding the police.   In fact, I recall that this body funded first responders in the  HEROES Act and that that bill is languishing in the Senate. So maybe my  good colleagues on the other side of the aisle might call up their  Senators and ask that they move on the HEROES Act. That might be the  first thing to do.   This bill is not against police. In fact, this bill is calling for  standards and training and accreditation. In conversations that I have  had with the Association of Police Chiefs and also the Fraternal Order  of Police, they said that there are 18,000 police departments across  the United States, and they have been fighting for accreditation and  standards for years, but it takes a very long time to do it department  by department, and they encouraged this part of the bill.   Now, granted, they don't love the whole bill, but this part of the  bill, they absolutely do.   To say that the only departments that have problems are run by  Democrats is either magical thinking, fantasy, or denial. That is just  not the case at all, and I would encourage my colleague on the other  side of the aisle to actually examine his State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rush).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am so sorry that my colleague on the other side of the aisle is so  confused and has so much trouble understanding. Perhaps it might help  if he studied more history, U.S. history, to understand that why that  knee was on George Floyd's neck was because of racism in this country.   Perhaps my colleague on the other side of the aisle could go to  Alabama to the Legacy Museum so that he could understand a little bit  about U.S. history.   Perhaps my colleague on the other side of the aisle could go to the  National Memorial for Lynching and learn a little bit about his State  of Georgia, where many of the lynchings were carried out by law  enforcement officers.   When he said that 100 percent of police chiefs were against this  bill, it is just not true. I have met with police chiefs, and they  support parts of the bill. The National Organization of Black Law  Enforcement Officers support this bill. The Fraternal Order of Police  are not completely opposed to this bill.   So, I would like to work with my colleague on the other side of the  aisle to help him understand a little bit more of the history of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on  each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the  great State of California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Mfume), the newest member of the Congressional Black  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold,  transformative vision of policing in America. Never again should the  world be subjected to witnessing what we saw in the streets in  Minneapolis, the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police  officer.   The world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in our country.  This movement has now spread to many nations around the world, with  thousands marching to register their horror and hearing the cry, ``I  can't breathe,'' people marching to demand not just change, but  transformative change that ends police brutality, that ends racial  profiling and ends the practice of denying Americans the ability to sue  when they have been injured, that denies local jurisdictions the power  to fire and prosecute offending officers.   Black communities have been, sadly, marching for over 100 years  against police abuse and for the police to protect and serve our  communities like they do elsewhere.   In the 1950s, news cameras exposed the brutal horror of legalized  racism in the form of segregation. The news cameras of the 1950s  exposed the brutal treatment of people who dared to challenge the  system. News cameras exposed to the world that Black people did not  have the same constitutional protections, that freedom of speech, that  the right to assemble and protest were not rights extended to all  African Americans.   Seventy years later, it is the cell phone camera that has exposed the  continuation of violence directed at African Americans by the police  and exposed the reality that the right of life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness is not guaranteed to all African Americans at all  times.   Now, the movement for police accountability has become a rainbow  movement, reflecting the wonderful diversity of our Nation and world.  The power of this movement will help move Congress to act, to pass  legislation that not only holds police accountable and increases  transparency, but assists police departments to change the culture.   Now, I know that change is hard, but I am certain that police  officers, professionals who risk their lives every day, are deeply  concerned about their profession and do not want to work in an  environment that requires their silence when they know that a fellow  officer is abusing the public.   I am certain police officers would like to be free to intervene and  stop an officer from using deadly force when it is not necessary, and I  am certain that police officers want to make sure that they are trained  in the best practices in policing. A profession where you have the  power to kill should be a profession that requires highly trained  officers who are accountable to the public.    I am so proud to be here on this historic day, where, for the first  time in I have no idea how many years, the House of Representatives  will pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the distinguished chair of the  Democratic Caucus, and I ask unanimous consent that he may control that  time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, there is nothing new under the Sun. The Black  people have battled police brutality since policing began in this  Nation. But times have changed; our country has changed.   A few years ago, we had to explain that racism still exists despite  the election of Barack Obama, twice. Now, 76 percent of Americans  consider racism and discrimination a big problem. That is progress.   A few years ago, we had to explain why we say Black lives matter.  Now, 67 percent of Americans support the Black Lives Matter movement.   Just a few weeks ago, we had to explain the anger and frustration we  saw unfolding in the streets. But, again, 67 percent of registered  voters supported the peaceful protest in response to George Floyd's  death.    This is a powerful moment for our Nation, and there is a powerful  movement in our Nation, a rainbow movement reflecting the wonderful  diversity of the whole world. Protests have taken place in over 60  countries and on every continent. Thousands are marching in the streets  screaming, ``I can't breathe.'' They are screaming for change,  transformative change, change that finally ends police brutality.   The movement is calling us to act. What is your answer?   I will vote for passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  And today my vote will be dedicated to the parents of Tamir Rice,  because today is his 18th birthday.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose  this motion to recommit and pass the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  who is my esteemed colleague and friend and the most senior CBC member  on the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
