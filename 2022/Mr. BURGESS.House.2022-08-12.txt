 I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  [[Page H7562]]  McGovern) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, while I recognize we are engaged in a very, very  partisan exercise and a harsh partisan debate, I do want to acknowledge  the loss from our congressional family of the Representative from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski). I so appreciated your presence at her funeral  yesterday. I know it was a difficult time for many of us. We also lost  two of our congressional staffers, who, in many ways, are like family.  Emma Thomson used to work in my office as my communications director.   It has been a tough week, and now we end it with today's rule  providing for the consideration of a Senate amendment to H.R. 5376, the  so-called Inflation Reduction Act. I say the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act because you would almost need a degree in nanometrology,  you would almost need a micrometer to be able to measure the amount of  deficit reduction that is included in this failed legislation that we  have in front of us.   In fact, this is the second time we have seen this legislative  vehicle. The Democrats tried to push through a partisan budget  reconciliation. Now, what does that mean?   That means that there is zero input from the Republican side of the  aisle. Why is that important?   You have a House and a Senate that are almost evenly divided. It is  50-50 in the Senate. They relied on the Vice President's vote to get  this across the finish line. As we heard this morning at the swearing- in of our new Member, you have a bare majority in the House of  Representatives.   So don't try to tell people that this has been an exercise that is  well thought out, that has come through the committees of jurisdiction  where people have had input. No. No Republican has had any input into  this travesty that we have in front of us today.   Mr. Speaker, I sit on the Budget Committee. We did not mark up a  budget resolution for fiscal year 2022. Instead, what happened?   The budget was deemed passed in a rule vote without any--zero--floor  consideration.   This bill is a reconfigured Build Back Better Act that the House  passed last October that didn't really have the breath to rise up off  the floor, but somehow Senators cut a deal--Democratic Senators cut a  deal with themselves--and now we have it on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I stress again, this bill had no Republican input, and  it will have a negligible effect on inflation. President Biden has  stated that this bill will reduce inflationary pressures. Oh, my God,  just make stuff up. What do you mean, inflationary pressures?   That is not the same thing as actually reducing inflation. In fact,  when you look at the language of this bill, you will recognize that  there are things started but they are only for a short period of time.  In reality, we know that once something is started it never stops up  here. If you remove the sunset provisions and assume all spending in  this bill is going to be extended through the 10-year budget window,  this bill actually spends $745 billion and adds $148 billion to the  national debt. After Democrats pushed through a $1.9 trillion  reconciliation package--and we all remember when that happened,  February and March of 2021--billions of dollars more in spending is the  last thing that American consumers need in the middle of record-high  inflation.   To combat inflation, the Federal Reserve has had to raise interest  rates. They were late in starting, they dismissed inflation, and they  said it was transitory; it wasn't really happening, a figment of your  imagination. But since March they have raised interest rates by 2.25  percent, the fastest cumulative rate hike in over 10 years.   According to the Congressional Budget Office--and we really haven't  heard from them much this Congress--but according to the Congressional  Budget Office, the increase in interest rates will cost taxpayers an  extra $100 billion this year alone.   Let me describe for you what is costing Americans so much. There are  severe negative impacts in implementing government drug price controls,  which are included in this bill. However, what most people do not  understand is the effect this reconciliation package will have on  healthcare and doctor's practices in America.   At the end of this year, doctors are expecting a payment update in  Medicare that is now calculated to be zero percent. Anywhere else in  this town, a zero percent update is viewed as a pay cut because we have  8 to 9 percent inflation. Guess what?   That same inflation affecting household budgets affects your budget  running a medical practice. In addition to that, there is a 4.5 percent  Medicare conversion factor, which is reduced, and the adoption of  several changes to the evaluation and management of Current Procedural  Terminology codes.   The net effect is a big cut to the Nation's doctors. That is really  where we should have been focusing some of our efforts. Instead, we  tell our doctors and our nurses: You are our heroes. You got us through  the coronavirus pandemic--the worst pandemic in 100 years. Thank you,  heroes. Here is your pay cut. And the doctors go: Wait. What?                                time  0930    Under this legislation, we will see changes to part B drug  reimbursements that would lead to an average of a 40 percent cut for  healthcare providers. Yet, Wednesday during the Rules Committee  hearing, I offered an amendment with Dr. Murphy to actually fix this  problem. I thought: Maybe this is just an oversight. Maybe they didn't  really mean to do this.   Unfortunately, it was rejected in the Rules Committee by a party-line  vote.   The confluence of these cuts threatens the sustainability of medical  practices and will lead to physicians closing their doors. So let me be  quite clear about that: A vote for this bill is a vote to close medical  practices.   To make matters worse, the providers who would be affected work in  fields such as oncology, rheumatology, interventional pain management,  hematology, internal medicine, and gastroenterology. I never thought I  would be up here fighting to save specialty practices, especially  oncology--community oncology--which focuses on the treatment of cancer.  But as these practices close--and they will close--care will shift to  hospitals.   What happens when the care shifts to hospitals from the doctors'  offices?   Oh, it goes up by a factor of about 66 percent. So instead of saving  money, we are actually costing money.   Ultimately, the combined financial pressures will result in limited  access to treatment for patients including those in rural areas.   Following a major pandemic and a healthcare workforce shortage, we  should be encouraging physicians to keep their practices open in order  to have a more stable healthcare system that would benefit patients.  But, instead, we do exactly the opposite.   If this bill is signed into law, millions of patients could die  waiting--waiting for those new drugs and cures that will no longer be  developed in their lifetime. The last bill signed into law by President  Obama at the end of 2016 was the 21st Century Cures Act, something that  our Committee, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, worked on, this  House passed, everyone was proud of the 21st Century Cures Act. We  wanted to deliver the 21st Century Cures Act to patients who had been  long-suffering, we wanted to get them there faster, and we wanted to  get them there at lower cost. But now we are doing exactly the  opposite.   Millions of patients could die waiting for new drugs and new cures. I  have heard directly from providers that potentially millions of  patients will be affected if doctors close their doors. This bill is  anti-doctor and anti-patient, and we will, unfortunately, see those  consequences after final passage.   This reconciliation bill also includes numerous Green New Deal  provisions:   There is a tax on natural gas production that will be passed on to  consumers. Make no mistake about it. It is going to make it harder and  more expensive to heat homes, to buy groceries, and to farm the land.   This bill establishes a Department of Energy loan guarantee at $250  billion to support greenhouse gas reduction projects. I have been here  long enough that I remember Solyndra in the Obama administration. This  was a failed investment that cost the American taxpayers $500 million.   There is also an energy efficiency home appliance rebate program to  allow wealthy Americans to update  [[Page H7563]]  their homes to the tune of $9 billion, and a $1 billion program to  electrify garbage trucks and school busses.   The bill includes $27 billion in a greenhouse gas reduction fund at  the Environmental Protection Agency that will be a slush fund for  greenhouse projects--$27 billion to the Environmental Protection Agency  with no guardrails and with no oversight and we just hope that they are  going to fix problems. Good luck with that.   It also reinstates the Superfund excise tax on crude oil and imported  petroleum, and this will result in an additional $11 billion tax burden  on our oil and gas industry in the midst of record-high gas prices. It  is a telling mental image that the President was forced to go hat in  hand over to the Middle East, over to Saudi Arabia, and ask them to  pump more oil. It is not as if we ran out here, but the President went  over to Saudi Arabia hat in hand. And how embarrassing: they told him  they actually weren't able to produce any more than they were right  now.   Last but not least, this bill contains a $7,500 tax credit for  electric vehicles that must be made with a certain percentage of  minerals mined in the United States or countries with U.S. free trade  agreements. Most of the minerals come from China and Russia. There is  not a single electric vehicle currently on the market that complies  with this provision, and the European Union recently warned that this  may violate the World Trade Organization domestic content and local  assembly rules.   I could continue but let me highlight some of the tax increases that  average Americans will face.   This bill creates a 15 percent minimum book tax on companies, but it  includes exclusions for Green New Deal tax credits.   A fix to the carried interest loophole was axed in the Senate to buy  one vote and replaced with a 1-year extension of the State and local  SALT tax cap. This was done to appease one Senator. It was removed and  replaced with a passthrough loss limitation which will prohibit  passthroughs from claiming a certain amount of after loss. Democrats  have chosen to protect individuals in high-tech States over Main Street  businesses.   There is also a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks which will  harm retirement investments.   There are extensions of production tax credits for renewables--as if  we haven't subsidized them enough already.   And $80 billion--$80 billion--for the Internal Revenue Service  including 87,000 new agents--new agents who will all be members of a  Federal employees' union, likely contribute to Democratic campaigns,  but are not required to be CPAs.   I mean, where in the world do you go to make stuff like this up?   Oh, yes, the United States House of Representatives run by Democrats.   This has a 600 percent IRS funding increase over last year and a  doubling of the number of employees.   Wouldn't it be great to double the amount of employees in the FAA?   How many people have recently been stuck trying to get from one place  to another with air travel in this country?   Instead we are expanding the IRS.   Currently, the best accounting firms are struggling to hire CPAs. How  is the IRS going to attract qualified individuals? It will only create  tax technicians who could be injurious to citizens if not properly  trained.   Americans deserve better.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), who is the ranking member of the House Rules  Committee.  [[Page H7564]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), a fellow member of the House Committee on  Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), another valuable member of the House  Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  amend the rule to allow the House to consider an amendment that would  stop the IRS from hiring 87,000 new agents to target and harass lower- income Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), who is here to explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith) for the purposes of rebuttal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Nebraska.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith) for rebuttal.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as we close out this debate, once again, I acknowledge  that I have been aided on the floor during rule debate by the able  services of Rachel Huggins, who, unfortunately, is leaving my office at  the end of this month to join the Foreign Service. Our loss is the  Foreign Service's gain, but she will continue to serve her country and  serve her country well. We are so grateful for her service that she has  provided in both my office and at the Rules Committee.   Now, despite the name, this bill will do very little to reduce  inflation. According to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania  Wharton School, the bill increases inflation through 2024 while having  an overall negligible effect.   You would almost need to be an atomic physicist to be able to measure  on a molecular level how much this is going to reduce inflation, but it  is going to increase Federal spending. We know already the increase in  Federal spending is what lit the fire of inflation in the first place.   This is a bad bill. Reject the previous question so we can take up  Mr. Smith's amendment. Reject the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are hearing that this bill is a tax cut. But that  only applies if you sign up for ObamaCare and participate in all the  green tax credits. But if you don't, then this bill is a tax increase  of over $10.5 billion for those making under $200,000 a year.   Despite what you say, there is $80 billion in this bill for 87,000  new IRS agents, and this will disproportionately increase audits on  low- and middle-income earners at a time when even the best CPA firms  cannot find qualified employees.   Now, Wednesday in the Rules Committee, I tried to get an amendment by  Mr. Davidson of Ohio made in order that would require that all of these  new hires at least be CPAs. This was rejected by every Democrat in the  Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, they are coming after you. They are coming after you  with poorly trained technicians, and it is just not right.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter submitted by the  members of the House GOP Doctors Caucus.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, August 6, 2022.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi: We write to express       our strong opposition to the government drug price control       policies in your reconciliation package. As medical providers       and Members of Congress, we are deeply concerned with the       harm these provisions will cause to patients across the       country.        The GOP Doctors Caucus has continuously worked to ensure       that physician practices can stay open to continue treating       patients. We have heard directly from providers that the cuts       proposed in this bill will jeopardize patient access to care.       According to Avalere, changes to the Medicare Part B       physician-administered drug reimbursement would lead to an       average cut of 39.8 percent for health care providers. The       confluence of these cuts, including the 0 percent payment       update, the reduction of the 4.5 percent Medicare conversion       factor, and the adoption of several changes to the Evaluation       and Management (E/M) Current Procedural Terminology codes,       threatens the sustainability of medical practices and will       lead to physicians closing their doors.        It is irresponsible to divert seniors' Medicare dollars to       pay subsidies to non-Medicare insurance companies, yet this       plan would do just that. The proposal will take ``savings''       from the drug price controls in the Medicare program to pay       for expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable       Care Act (ACA). This is money going to insurance companies       and their bottom line; this is not money going directly       towards care in any way. These expanded subsidies were       originally part of the inflation-creating American Rescue       Plan Act (ARPA). ARPA removed the income cap restricting       access to premium tax credits, opening the door to taxpayer-      funded subsidies for some of the wealthiest Americans. Some       families making more than $500,000 annually now have access       to expanded ACA subsidies, and they will continue to if this       proposal goes through. Robbing Medicare to enhance the profit       for insurance company shareholders and executives does       nothing to improve anyone's health. To us, this is       unconscionable.        If this plan is passed into law, millions of patients could       die waiting for new drugs and cures that will no longer be       developed in their lifetime. Government price controls have       consequences. The Congressional Budget Office has       conservatively estimated that 15 fewer drugs will be       developed over the next 30 years under this bill, Another       study found that only six out of 11 currently approved       therapies would have been brought to the market if this       framework were in place.        Any cure lost is one too many. As Members of Congress who       have been involved in patient care, we understand the real-      world impact that this will have on patients. Many of us have       treated patients with chronic and life-threatening diseases.       We've seen expensive surgeries and intensive inpatient care       be eliminated by the development of new therapies. This       development and innovation will all but go away, leaving       patients without hope for improved quality of life and long-      term savings.        We remain concerned that this proposal will also put the       government in control of Americans' medical decisions. This       is another clear example of a policy crafted by politicians       who have never seen a patient. The bill calls for a 95       percent excise tax if drug companies do not accept the price       government bureaucrats put in place. Top down, ``take it or       leave it'' government price negotiation isn't a negotiation       at all--it's government price fixing.        This reconciliation package under consideration applies       upward pressure on drug pricing. The bill subjects a company       to negotiation once its seven-year exclusivity expires. As a       result, companies could introduce drugs into the marketplace       with high list prices, causing premium increases for       healthier individuals enrolled in employer-sponsored plans.        In summary, this reconciliation package will have grave       consequences for patients and patient care:        This price setting scheme put forth in this bill will       endanger patient access to care by cutting provider       reimbursement on impacted Part B drugs by an average of forty       percent.        The bill does nothing to address other ongoing Medicare       provider payment cuts set to begin in 2023.        If this plan is passed into law, millions of patients could       die waiting for new drugs and cures that will no longer be       developed in their lifetime.        Government price controls have consequences, and one lost       cure is one too many.        This plan robs Medicare to pay subsidies to insurance       companies and other non-health related expenditures.        As medical providers in Congress, we urge you to recognize       the danger this proposal will have on patients. We can and       should work on a bipartisan basis to lower drug costs without       sacrificing the cures and treatments that will provide for a       healthier future.

Madam Speaker, this is a letter that explains how  healthcare policies included in the Inflation Reduction Act would  affect American patients. There are 21 healthcare professionals who  signed this letter.   It is remarkable that none of our concerns were considered--all were  ignored--not only as Members of the House and Senate but as healthcare  professionals, as well.   The point of the letter is that this legislation will do the exact  opposite of what the Democrats intend. Unfortunately, the legislation  will kill research and development, reduce quality of care, and  threaten patient access to lifesaving drugs.   Under this legislation, we are going to see changes to part B drug  reimbursements that will lead to an average of a 40 percent cut for  healthcare providers, doctors who provide care to Medicare patients in  their offices.   Currently, part B reimbursements for administering drugs in a  physician's office are a calculation based on the average sales price  plus 6 percent. Under this new system, part B payments to physicians  are going to be calculated off of the maximum fair price. It is an  attractive term, but no one knows what it means. It is yet to be  determined by whom? The Secretary of Health and Human Services. We have  all seen how trustworthy they have been over the past 2 years.   The current 6 percent average sales price add-on payments to  physicians, which is what doctors have come to rely on now to run their  practices, will be based on a significantly lower government-set price  versus the traditional market-priced ASP. This results in significantly  lower payments to physicians.   Now, Wednesday afternoon late, at the Committee on Rules, I offered  an amendment with Dr. Murphy to fix this problem. Unfortunately, that  was rejected on a party-line vote.   These payment cuts threaten the sustainability of medical practices  and will lead--let me say that again--will lead to physicians closing  their doors. When practices close, the patient need does not disappear.  Care will then shift to hospitals.                                time  1445    This will ultimately lead to an increase in healthcare costs and a  decrease in the quality of care provided, and it will limit access to  treatments for patients across the country.   From experience working in private practice, I can attest that there  are significant consequences of consolidation. Here is the bottom line:  Democrats are using Medicare as a piggy bank to pay for other things.  What  [[Page H7683]]  other things? Oh, like subsidies to insurance companies. They want to  reward insurance companies and punish doctors. It makes no sense.   This legislation will do the exact opposite of what Democrats intend.  It is going to kill research and development. It is going to reduce the  quality of care. It is going to threaten patient access to lifesaving  drugs.   As the most senior doctor in Congress and someone who deeply cares  about the well-being of American patients, this bill is antidoctor and  antipatient. We will live to see the consequences of this after final  passage, I promise you that.
