 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our colleague and my  good friend, chairman of the Agricultural Committee, Collin Peterson.   Mr. Speaker, Chairman Peterson has served 30 years as a Member of  Congress; so long that there was another Congressman Panetta serving in  this body when Collin was elected back in 1990. Fortunately, over that  long time came experience and wisdom that Chairman Peterson was more  than happy to use and share to help other Members of Congress, to serve  his constituents in Minnesota's 7th Congressional District, and to  further our Nation's agriculture. One thing that I have learned and one  thing that Chairman Peterson will always tell us is that more needs to  be done for our agriculture.   Mr. Speaker, now, I first met Chairman Peterson as a freshman Member  on the Agriculture Committee. I will never forget how he gathered the  freshmen Democrats, who were all excited not just to be a part of  Congress, but having the opportunity to formulate the upcoming farm  bill. But in his, let's just say, charming way, Collin quickly cooled  that enthusiasm when he warned us about the potential for issues on the  nutrition title--the largest section of that bill--in which he said it  could prevent us from getting a bill.    In fact, in his straightforward way, he actually said, ``If they  screw with SNAP, we are not getting a farm bill.''   I have to say, as the 115th went on, and with the positive hearings  we had on SNAP, I was incredulous as to that warning that Chairman  Peterson had. But that ominous warning turned into an accurate  prediction, because 2 weeks before the farm bill was dropped, we were  notified of the majority's desire to add stringent restrictions on how  one acquires SNAP benefits.   Mr. Speaker, but what I experienced after that was something I will  never forget. The way Chairman Peterson not only stood firm in his  beliefs about the importance of the benefits to low-income families and  that the fraud and error rate in those programs is among the lowest in  government, and using the passion of Congressman   David Scott,  Chairman Peterson got us all to stand together in opposition.   He then worked together with chairman and ranking member of the  Senate Agriculture Committee to push together, push forward, put  together and pass a bipartisan 2018 farm bill.   Mr. Speaker, it is not surprising that Chairman Peterson was able to  do so, because during his time, he worked on five farm bills, a bill  that has 12 titles and is complex and nuanced. So to lead the  Agriculture Committee, to lead Congress, and to unify our members on  something so diverse, it takes leadership, it takes knowledge of the  farm policy, but also an understanding and appreciation of how the farm  bill protects our food security and the people affected by our foreign  policy.   It is also a bill that demonstrates what Chairman Peterson stands for  and what Chairman Peterson made the Agriculture Committee stand for--a  platform to support farmers, ranchers, and families in America. From  the row crops and dairy producers in his rural district to the  speciality crop and organic farmers and farm workers in my district, to  the families in every district who rely on food assistance programs,  Chairman Peterson made  [[Page H6912]]  sure that all of us in Congress have a seat at the Agriculture  Committee. I believe that is a big part of why the Agriculture  Committee stands out for its bipartisanship and its commonsense  approach in protecting food security and promoting people in  agriculture.   Mr. Speaker, see, based on who he is and where he comes from,  Chairman Peterson understands the incredible contributions that rural  Americans have on our way of life. We do have the best farmers and farm  workers in the world. Rural Americans supply most of our food, our  water, and our energy. They are the reason for our food security and  our economic diversity. We don't have to pay that much for food.  Therefore, we can spend on other things in our lives and create a  diverse economy.   Mr. Speaker, rural Americans understand that every American's  obligation is to give back to this country and community that has given  us so much. Maybe that is why 30 percent of rural America makes up 30  percent of our Armed Forces. But what Chairman Peterson warns is that,  even with all that good work in rural America, they feel  underappreciated and they feel overwhelmed.   Chairman Peterson sees that firsthand with the widening divide  between rural America and urban America, a divide that has led to the  depletion of jobs, of small businesses, of people, and even  communities, which ultimately leads to a growing sense of desperation.   Don't get me wrong, people in agriculture are used to dealing with  the challenges. I call them the four Ms. They deal with Mother Nature.  They deal with the markets. They deal with the mandates. They deal with  the migration and the lack of labor. But they are always pivoting to  get over those hurdles. It is that risk-taking attitude that allows  them not just to survive, but to succeed.   Mr. Speaker, nowadays, there are other forces in play in rural  America, with large corporate firms squeezing out the family-owned  farms, with chain stores pricing out mom-and-pop stores, with the lack  of rural broadband, and the lack of healthcare options and the  shrinking number of rural hospitals.   It is no wonder why in many parts of rural America there is a sense  of desperation leading to a ridiculously high rate of suicides and  leaving a vacuum that can be filled with a vilification of certain  races, certain places, and certain political parties.   Unfortunately, this has led not just to that type of vilification,  but also to the lack of faith and how our Congress and government can  help them.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to do what Chairman Peterson has always said  we should do. It is time for us to do more for those who aren't from  rural districts to work on focusing and connecting with rural districts  by showing up, by shutting up, by listening up, and for us to put up a  strategy that is not just about doling out billions of dollars to  farmers, but actually partnering with them so they have sustainable  business and a sustainable way of life.   Mr. Speaker, if we do that, we will uphold what Chairman Peterson has  always asked us to do, and that is to work for the people and  agriculture, and we can do that and provide faith to people in rural  America and all of America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Larson, and I appreciate  all of his work and, of course, his support and friendship.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2477, the BENES Act, which includes my bill and   Tom Reed's bill, the  bipartisan HOSPICE Act.   Now, I think we can all agree that every family wants to ensure that  their loved one in hospice receives the end-of-life care that is  compassionate, that is cautious, and, of course, that is circumspect so  that they can pass with dignity and all of us are at peace.   Now, we know while most of our Nation's Medicare hospice care  providers work tirelessly to ensure their patients receive high quality  care, there are, unfortunately, bad actors. That is why we introduced  the bipartisan HOSPICE Act, so that through education, outreach, and  even liability we can safeguard care for Medicare hospice enrollees,  increase transparency and safety, and penalize those who fail to  provide the necessary care for their patients.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation to ensure that hospice care is not just about death, but it  is about death with dignity, integrity, and accountability.
