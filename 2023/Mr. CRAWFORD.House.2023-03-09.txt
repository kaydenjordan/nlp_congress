 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the Biden  administration's extreme overreach with the confusing new waters of the  United States rule published by the EPA. This rule removes protections  put in place by the previous administration that would protect farmers,  ranchers, and small business owners from potential fines and even jail  time for carrying out common practices they have done for years.   The men and women who feed America should not have to apply for  permits to simply remove debris from a ditch on their property or  change the types of crops that they grow in a field. Yet, this is what  people in my district in Arkansas and around the country will face  under the new WOTUS rule.   To top it all off, this rule is unclear, forcing landowners to hire  additional help just to ensure that they are complying with this ill- conceived rule.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up to the EPA and vote to  block this burdensome rule.
