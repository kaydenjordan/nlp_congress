 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for next week. I yield to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I know, just yesterday, one of the  Members of the House Democrat leadership team, Chairman Nadler,  introduced a bill to pack the Supreme Court.   This is a proposal that we have seen in other countries.  Unfortunately, it is in mostly socialist countries. If you look at some  of the examples, in 2004, Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez packed his  court, and the result was totalitarian dominance for his socialist  regime. Congressman Gimenez, who himself fled Cuba, fled a communist  regime, said just recently on court-packing:         Packing the courts is a tactic used by brutal dictatorships       to consolidate the socialist power, which resulted in tens of       thousands of court rulings in its favor, basically destroying       the country.    I wanted to ask the gentleman, is that court-packing bill a bill that  the majority is going to be bringing to the floor or even marking up in  committee? I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I haven't read the Constitution of  Venezuela, but I know in the Constitution of the United States, it  actually gives the Senate the advise-and-consent role, the  responsibility, as it relates to Supreme Court picks. Obviously, that  has been kept.   The borking incident was probably the most embarrassing, egregious  abuse that started this back-and-forth, where individual Supreme Court  picks became more personally scrutinized. That process has been abused  in cases like Bork.   Even the Kavanaugh hearing got out of control, where disgraceful  false allegations were made.   But in the end, the Senate's advise-and-consent role is part of the  United States Constitution. I don't know if the gentleman is suggesting  that that  [[Page H1875]]  should be changed. I don't see it. Even with a Democratic majority  right now, I wouldn't suggest changing that process that is in our  Constitution.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding back.  This is the bill. It is not even a page and a half, but the real change  in law by the Member of House Democratic leadership Chairman Nadler,  says, ``A Chief Justice of the United States and 12 Associate Justices,  any eight of whom shall constitute a quorum.'' So in essence, a hostile  takeover of the United States Supreme Court, not going through the  traditional process that has been in place for over 100 years.   And I think the gentleman knows, if you go back historically, the  President in power when the Senate was led by a different party--I  can't recall a case in generations where if in the election year there  was a vacancy in the Supreme Court it was filled.   And everybody in the country knew that that was an issue in the  election of 2016. In fact, it was probably one of the deciding issues  that helped elect President Trump, was that there was that vacancy and  the public wanted to be engaged in the direction of the country, as  well as the direction of the court. It was absolutely a heavily debated  item in the 2016 Presidential election and President Trump won that  election.   But, again, I have never heard anybody suggesting changing the  Constitution to take away the Senate's advise and consent role. But we  do see here a bill that was filed just this week by a leader in the  Democratic Party to have a hostile takeover of the Supreme Court,  similar to what has been done in socialist countries. And I think it is  important to point to who has proposed those kinds of changes in the  past, and what it has led to. And I know President Biden himself is on  the record many times criticizing heavily the idea of packing the  Supreme Court.   Now, that was before he was President. Now that it would be him that  would be able to appoint these extra judges, I don't know if his  position has changed. But it is a dangerous precedent. It is the kind  of precedent that exists in Soviet-style nations. I sure hope it is not  here.   But Mr. Nadler did just say yesterday when asked about Speaker  Pelosi's position, he said, ``Speaker Pelosi and others will come  along.'' So I was just wondering if that was something that the  gentleman was planning on bringing to the floor that would be a  divisive issue as opposed to things that we could work together on,  like infrastructure, that would be unifying.   And obviously, there is a lot of talk about infrastructure. This is  something that there is tremendous interest in on both sides of the  aisle. I know Chairman DeFazio, as well as Ranking Member Sam Graves,  have had a lot of conversations about things that we could agree on.  And I would hope that would be the approach that we take, unlike the  bill that over 90 percent of which had nothing to do with the COVID-- the $1.9 trillion spending bill, which was hyper-partisan.   Madam Speaker, I hope we approach this in a bipartisan way. Because  as I said, there are clearly Members on both sides that want to agree  on an infrastructure bill and have lots of areas of agreement if we are  talking about infrastructure. And by infrastructure, I think most  Americans--if you asked them what they thought was infrastructure, they  would say roads, bridges, ports, waterways, and broadband.   Once you get into social policy and Green New Deal-type policies or  tax hikes that would make America the highest rate above Communist  China in terms of tax policy--the National Association of Manufacturers  said that the kind of proposal that is being floated in the partisan  approach would kill over 1 million American jobs.   So I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland talking about jobs. Why  would we want to approach this in such a partisan way that we would  threaten millions of jobs, that we would make America uncompetitive  again, and Communist China would have a lower tax rate than America?  Hopefully, we do the bipartisan approach and not a partisan approach.   And I yield to the gentleman to enlighten us on what direction is  being approached right now.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Finally, I want to bring up the crisis that our Nation is facing at  our southern border. And this has been a crisis that has been brewing  for months. It is not an overnight problem, but it is an executive  order-created problem when President Biden on day one got rid of some  policies that were working incredibly well.   And every border patrol agent that I have talked--and I was on the  border last week, Thursday and Friday, in McCollum, Texas, and in  Donna, Texas, at the Donna processing facility--every border agent said  the same thing. They said getting rid of the remain in Mexico policy,  that one action alone opened up the floodgates to a surge, thousands of  people a day crossing our border illegally.   Then you couple that with the deterioration of the Northern Triangle  agreements. And, yes, it was President Trump who negotiated those  agreements with Mexico, with Honduras, with El Salvador, with  Guatemala. And maybe President Biden just doesn't like the fact that  President Trump did  [[Page H1876]]  something that was working well. Why doesn't he renegotiate those  agreements and call them his own? But they were working.   Madam Speaker, now today, it is so out of control that we have, for  example, at the Donna processing facility, a facility designed for  about a 250-person capacity--when I was visiting that facility last  Friday, there was over 4,000 people--young kids, primarily--crammed  into that facility, in those holding cells like sardines.   In fact, yesterday, we had a committee hearing with Dr. Fauci and CDC  Director Walensky. And I asked them specifically about what is going on  down at our southern border; showed them some of the pictures that have  been taken.   And if you look at the CDC guidance that is out there on how we, as  American citizens, have to conduct ourselves--if you own a restaurant,  for example, whether it is in Baltimore, New Orleans, or anywhere else,  if there is a capacity limit, and if that limit was 250 people, if  there were 4,000 people in that restaurant, it would be shut down  today. And I asked both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky: Would that facility  be in violation of CDC guidelines? And both of them said, Yes, in  testimony under oath.   And then I talked to them about what is happening at our southern  border. And I asked them: Are these conditions in compliance with CDC  guidance? Both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky said: No, this is not.   We talked about the Donna detention facility and the inhumane  treatment of these young children by the Biden administration in that  facility. And I asked Dr. Fauci: Is that facility, the conditions in  which they are treating those young kids by the Biden administration in  compliance with the CDC guidance? And Dr. Fauci said: No. And Dr.  Walensky, the CDC director, testified the exact same way, that: No,  those are not in compliance. And in fact, as we know, they are coming  across from Mexico.   Do you know that the CDC guidance designates Mexico as the most  dangerous nation right now? Along with probably a few others, but they  are the most dangerous in terms of COVID transmission.   So CDC guidance encourages American citizens not to go to Mexico, but  they say if you do come back from Mexico, you are mandated by the CDC  to show a COVID-negative test before you, as an American citizen, can  come back into the United States.   Do you know that not one of these people are being tested for COVID  when they come in illegally across the Rio Grande from Mexico? And then  many of them are being put on airplanes, without ID, being paid for  mostly by the taxpayers--put on airplanes to fly off into cities all  across the country. Border patrol agents have told us at least 15  percent of these people that crossed illegally are COVID-positive.   So I asked Dr. Walensky and I asked Dr. Fauci: Does that process by  the Biden administration violate CDC's guidance on travel from Mexico?  And they both testified that, yes, in fact, it does. That if they are  getting on an airplane, they should be testing negative for COVID. None  of them are, and in fact, some of them are known to be COVID-positive,  being put on airplanes, flying to cities all across this country.   It is going on right now. It was going on Friday. About half the  plane that I was on when I flew from McAllen back home had people with  folders that said: I do not speak English, and it had a city on it. And  it was multiple cities.   But this is what the Biden administration is doing in violation of  CDC guidance that you and I have to follow, that our constituents who  are seeing their livelihoods crushed, their restaurants closed down-- many that won't open again ever--because they have to play by the rules  that CDC and their States issue. And yet, the Biden administration is  exempting themselves from this.   Madam Speaker, now we have legislation, I would like to bring up to  the majority leader, that would fix this:   My colleague, Mrs. Miller-Meeks, requires that a COVID test be done  before someone is released from CPB custody.   Ms. Herrell wants to prohibit DHS from ceasing title 42.   There is a bipartisan bill by Mr. Katko and Mr. Cuellar, which  establishes a regular migration surge border response fund.   Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman if he would bring  those bills to the floor to address this crisis at the border that is  not only a humanitarian crisis and a national security crisis, but it  is a Biden-created crisis that is violating the very CDC guidance,  according to Dr. Fauci, that American citizens have to follow.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    As we talk about asylum, let's be clear, America has  laws on how someone can seek asylum. I haven't seen anybody suggest  that those laws are just repealed, and you just take somebody's word  that if they say they want to come to America to seek asylum, to come  in today and jump ahead of everyone else.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    I think we ought to obey America's laws on immigration  across the board. If you look at the asylum laws, there is a process to  seek asylum.   In fact, every year, people are granted that asylum if they prove  their case. That is where the law comes into play, which is being  ignored right here.   What President Trump did when there was a surge in 2019, he  confronted it, as a leader should do. He talked to people on the  ground. He talked to our Border Patrol agents, who are the ones who  have to deal with this crisis on a daily basis.   In fact, 40 percent of our Border Patrol agents tonight at midnight,  like Thursday night at midnight last week, when I was with those Border  Patrol agents, 40 percent of them were pulled off of guarding our  border, where their primary mission is to stop drug cartels from  smuggling fentanyl, cocaine, and heroin into our country, which they  are doing now at much higher levels, killing Americans all across the  country.   Forty percent of them pulled away because they are going to be  changing diapers in the Donna detention facility tonight because that  is what they are being tasked to do by the Biden administration. That  is not their job. It is not why they signed up. Their morale is  incredibly low.   Well over roughly 90 percent of people who say they are coming here  to seek asylum, those cases are rejected by the courts. Rejected. In  fact, it is kind of hard to make an asylum claim here when the parents  of many of these kids you are seeing here paid thousands of dollars to  the drug cartels to smuggle their kids and themselves into the United  States. It is hard to claim economic asylum, which is the case many of  them plead, when you paid $4,000 to try to come here illegally when  there is a legal process to come here, not just the normal legal  process where you can wait to come into America legally, where we let a  million people into our country every year, the most generous nation in  the world, America. But when they go around that system, that is where  it overwhelms our system. That is what is going on right now.    President Trump confronted it, not by saying no one can come in, but  by saying you have to follow our laws if you want to come here. If you  want to seek asylum, you have to request it like everyone else. They  allowed them to even come through South and Central American countries  but stay in Mexico. Mexico agreed with this, and there was an orderly  system. You got to hear your claim in a very expedient way.   Today, they are given a piece of paper when they come across the  border illegally, saying: Come show up maybe 5 years from now.   Good luck with that. Then, they are given a free plane ticket,  without an ID, to just be sent off to some other State. I saw manila  envelopes, and once you got below the ``I do not speak English,''  Dallas was on one, Philadelphia was on one, New Jersey was on one.   I don't know what is going to happen to them when they land in New  Jersey if they can't speak English. What school system are they going  to be placed in? Who is then going to be responsible for this breakdown  at our southern border, which was created by President Biden, which he  could fix today?   I have urged President Biden to go down to the border and see this  for himself, to see how inhumane he is treating kids, in violation of  his own CDC guidelines, which Dr. Fauci verified yesterday.   If you read the child abuse and neglect laws of the State of Texas  where this facility is, this is a violation of the child abuse and  negligent laws at the President Biden-run facility.   Again, President Trump went and negotiated with Mexico, went and  negotiated with those Northern Triangle countries to resolve the surge.  This could be resolved as well, and you don't need to reinvent the  wheel because there was a method for how to resolve it legally, using  the legal system that America has.   Sure, I would agree it needs reforms, not an amnesty reform, where  you send a magnet not only across South and Central America but around  the world that America's borders are open, because that is the message  today. As the gentleman knows, there are at least six people on the  terrorist watch list who have come across America's southern border. I  am not talking about from South and Central American countries, but  from Middle Eastern countries, from Eastern European countries. Those  are just the ones we know of that we have caught, and the Biden  administration won't share that data with the media. The Biden  administration wouldn't even let the press into this facility, which is  a national disgrace.   I could imagine what the press would have said if the Trump  administration was housing kids in a 33-person facility. There are over  400 crammed into a 33-person cell in the middle of a pandemic.   Again, Dr. Fauci said this violates every protocol there is when we  are trying to get our economy reopened. Other countries have to control  COVID, too, but in America, we are trying to control it.   Here is where the double standard and hypocrisy are driving people  nuts. If any American citizen ran their business in America like this,  they would be shut down by the Federal Government today. Yet, people  can come here illegally, and the Biden administration is running this  facility in violation of those very same guidances.   Do you know what happened to them? They are given a free airplane  ticket, put on an airplane, possibly with COVID, and sent into some  interior State of America. We don't even know where they are going. The  Biden administration won't share that.   We have asked for a meeting, by the way. Our leadership team, Leader  McCarthy and I, have asked for a meeting with President Biden to talk  about this crisis, and he refuses to meet with us about it. Just  ignoring a problem will not make it go away. If we are going to find a  solution to this--again, I listed a number of bills, including some  that are bipartisan, that would start solving this problem.   President Biden doesn't even want to go. He put Vice President Harris  in charge of this mess, and she won't even  [[Page H1878]]  go down to the border, maybe because she doesn't want to be associated  with President Biden's debacle.   She was put in charge of it. She is the Vice President of the United  States. She has a responsibility to go down there. She should have gone  there weeks ago, but she still hasn't been.   Maybe if they saw that, if they looked into the eyes of these young  kids--one of the first girls we ran into might have been 10 years old,  a girl in one of these cells, and she was crying. We asked her: Why are  you crying? And she said: I don't want to be here.    She is an orphan. The gentleman talked about orphans. All of these  kids, there are no parents with them. They don't want to be here. Many  were crying because they are jammed into these cells for 20 hours a  day, at least 15 percent with COVID, 6 inches apart, not 6 feet apart.  That is what the Biden administration is doing right now.   President Trump fixed this problem. Again, if President Biden just  doesn't like President Trump, call it his own name. We don't care. The  template, if he doesn't want to do what actually worked, then do  something else that works. But just doing this, it is not only a  national disgrace, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky said it is a violation of  the CDC protocols that every American taxpayer has to follow. And they  don't. Exempting themselves from a problem, but making everybody else  comply with it, is no way to instill confidence in the American people.   I hope the President goes down there. I hope the President resolves  this issue. He should meet with us. He said he wanted to unify the  country. He said he wanted to work with everybody. It is time he starts  following through on those promises.    Madam Speaker, these are children being thrown to the  wolves, and it is not President Trump who is doing it. It could end,  and I hope we can work together to solve this problem.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
