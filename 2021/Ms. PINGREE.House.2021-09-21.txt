 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Extending Government  Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act.   I am so grateful for the leadership of Chair DeLauro, who I know has  worked tirelessly on this critical legislation, and for the staff, who  I know haven't slept much lately.   This bill maintains current government services so that the important  work funded through the Interior bill, such as preserving our natural  and cultural resources and upholding our responsibilities to Native  Americans and Alaska Natives, can continue.   I am pleased that this bill also contains supplemental funding to  provide desperately needed relief from the devastation caused by  climate change, extreme weather events, and catastrophic wildland fire.   This bill provides $1.8 billion to agencies in the Interior bill for  expenses related to the consequences of wildfires, hurricanes, and  other natural disasters that have occurred since 2019.   Western States, as we all know, are battling more and more historic  high-intensity wildfires, so I am especially pleased that the bill  includes $230 million for hazardous fuels activities and $220 million  for post-wildfire restoration efforts at the Department of the Interior  and the Forest Service. Such activities are essential to watershed  protection, critical habitat, and burned area recovery in our Nation's  forests.   These investments are essential to meet these current needs in such a  critical time. Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this bill.
