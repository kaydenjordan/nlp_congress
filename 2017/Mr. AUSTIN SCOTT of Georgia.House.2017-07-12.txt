 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne) for his work on the National Defense  Authorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my fellow Members to support the  fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.   After nearly 13 hours of debate, my colleagues and I on the Armed  Services Committee, we came together, we passed the legislation to  provide critical resources and reforms for our Nation's military to  undertake the 21st century threats that our country and the world  faces.   Part of facing these challenges is ensuring that our military  personnel are able to combat the dangerous and illegal actions of  transnational criminal organizations, particularly those close to home  in the SOUTHCOM region.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman who spoke earlier about the  opioid epidemic. I would just remind my fellow Americans that over  5,000 Americans die every month from drug overdoses.   Just a few months ago, I, along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Veasey), had the opportunity to visit with the Joint Interagency Task  Force South and SOUTHCOM's headquarters in Florida to hear and see  firsthand the challenges that migrant and drug interdiction within the  Caribbean region pose on homeland and national security.    Included in the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act  is a provision that I authored aimed at addressing the threat these  transnational criminal organizations pose on our country and seeking to  find new ways to support SOUTHCOM in their continuing efforts to tackle  those threats head-on.   To all of the members of the SOUTHCOM team, I want to thank you for  the important work that you do in securing our coastlines, supporting  our national security, and protecting your fellow Americans.   To my colleagues, I urge your support in passage of the fiscal year  2018 NDAA to keep the U.S. military the best and most prepared fighting  force in the world.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to  this amendment to the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization  Act offered by my friend and colleague, Mr. McClintock of California,  that would strike a bipartisan provision that clarifies that the fiscal  year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act does not authorize a round  of Base Realignment and Closures, otherwise known as BRAC.   After nearly 13 hours of debate in the Armed Services Committee, my  colleagues and I came together and overwhelmingly approved language in  the final mark that prevented a BRAC for the next fiscal year. We  passed that vote by a vote of 60-1.   Many of my colleagues have argued that past BRACs eliminated excess  infrastructure in the Nation's military or streamlined defense  spending, but it is just not the case, Mr. Chair.   Earlier this year, Secretary Mattis testified to the Armed Services  Committee on the need to reassess our military's current infrastructure  resources and needs before closing or realigning any current resources.   The fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act required an  updated DOD force structure plan and an infrastructure inventory. To  date, DOD has not submitted the required infrastructure report.   Quite simply, we may not have enough capacity and infrastructure to  meet our current needs and our needs going forward as we look at the  threats coming from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and the threat of  global terrorism and transnational criminal organizations. Who knows  what threat we will face tomorrow.   If the Secretary of Defense, I hope, will work with us to reassess  our current capacity, then the need to halt realignments and closures  to give him time to do so is all the more important. With outdated  capacity information, there is simply no reason to close or realign an  installation just to repurchase or rebuild a new one just a few years  down the road. It is fiscally irresponsible in terms of defense  spending and meeting our needs moving forward.                                time  2230    I have nothing but respect for my colleague from California and have  fought many fights to get rid of waste and cut government spending with  him. This is just one that I can't support.   I hope that my colleagues will join me in voting against Mr.  McClintock's broken bucket amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of  Mr. Rogers' amendment allocating additional base funding for one of our  nation's most critical battle management command and control platforms:  the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS  fleet.   JSTARS' critical mission is enabled by leveraging its extremely  capable active radar system providing invaluable moving target  indicator (MTI) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance  targeting information to multiple users both on the ground and in  airborne attack platforms.   The demand for MTI capability within each geographic combatant  commander's area of responsibility far exceeds what JSTARS can  currently provide due to its limited legacy fleet size of 16 aircraft  and strained crew resources.   Thankfully, FY18 NDAA includes JSTARS Recapitalization funds, but the  legacy fleet of 16 aircraft still has issues and challenges that the  Air Force must successfully navigate to maintain viability until the  current fleet is replaced by the Recapitalization program beginning in  the late 2020s.   Despite these issues and challenges, we are confident that the  Secretary of the Air Force can develop a successful legacy JSTARS to  JSTARS Recapitalization transition plan that would not prematurely  retire E-8C aircraft, reassign crews or maintenance personnel, or  otherwise increase the MTI ISR capability gap from what existing levels  of aircraft are currently experiencing.   To do this, we need strong support and necessary resources. That's  why I'm here tonight in supporting additional resources for the JSTARS  legacy fleet to update and maintain their critical battle management  capabilities.   As the premiere military in the world, we cannot afford to let this  important military capability deteriorate before our eyes, putting our  warfighters and strategic campaigns at risk around the world.   One of the greatest duties we have as Members of Congress is to  provide for our nation's defense, and I urge my colleagues to support  this measure as well as other provisions supporting our warfighters and  ensuring our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to  meet the unique security needs of the 21st century.
