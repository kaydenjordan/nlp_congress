 Mr. Speaker, I guess the opportunity to serve in the  United States Congress with a little over 10,000 Members over the  decades, and for the years of service that I have been given this  privilege, and at the decision of my constituents allows me to look  over the landscape of the journey that we have taken.   I was here when medical procedures for parents who wanted nothing  more than a healthy baby were then characterized as a criminal act and  called partial-birth abortion when a mother had to make a decision with  her God, her doctor, and her family.   I remember the hearings in the Judiciary Committee where mothers were  crying because of the medical procedure that was necessary to save  their life.   We have now come full circle, and the extremists want to again  demonize parents who are desperate--desperate for a healthy child.   I have seen this before: extremist views criminalizing a medical  choice that has to be made, criminalizing abortion from east to west  and north to south. I will not have it.   I know that this is a most personal decision and one that families do  not want to make. But as a person of faith, I believe it should be that  woman, that family, that God, and that doctor.   So, unfortunately, today we will have the effort to criminalize these  actions of doctors. You see, Mr. Speaker, I come from a State where the  State legislature and Governor passed a bounty hunter bill to go after  doctors and nurses who would be giving medical care to innocent women  and to individuals who were seeking that care.   How outrageous in a constitutional democracy, Mr. Speaker, that you  want to injure people and you want to undermine doctors and undermine  nurses. What an outrage that, again, this extremist agenda continues.   Yet, in the face of a 13-year-old being shot to death in the District  of Columbia with a gun, the guns are rampaging across America, guns of  a 6-year-old who shot a teacher; mass murders are more extensive in  this last year, 2022, than ever, there is not a real effort to ensure  that guns are not proliferating in the hands of those who should not  get them, guns that should actually have penalties for those who do not  store it; penalties for manufacturers who do not indicate, label, and  insist that the guns be stored; or, in fact, the universal background  check that has not been able to be passed. These are things that could  save lives of living individuals who are now at the brunt end of gun  violence.   Yes, putting guns in the hands of people who should not have them,  having better mental health services and red flag laws. But the way the  bill was written, you have to opt in. States like Texas will not opt  into a red flag law to protect people. And all I see in my area is--not  because police are not working as hard as they can--domestic violence  with guns day after day after day and week after week because guns are  in the hands of the wrong people.   So, Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to say there is a lot of good  work we can do together, there is a lot of good work that Democrats  have done. We are seeing it in the bipartisan infrastructure bill and  dealing with climate change which is evident by the tragedy that is  happening to our friends in California.   But I am glad to stand up here today and announce something really  good that today, because of Democrats, the Social Security recipients  will have an 8.7 percent increase in their COLA. I will go home over  the weekend and over the days and into Martin Luther King celebrations  where he believed in lifting the least of those and be able to say to  those Social Security recipients: You got an 8.7 percent increase in  your COLA because of Democrats and President Biden.   We intend to do things and to be active on behalf of the American  people. We intend to cure problems and not make problems. We intend to  help our schoolchildren, help our teachers, help our nurses, help our  doctors, and help those senior citizens whom I see in the  [[Page H161]]  senior citizen community centers saying: When are we going to get the  ability to have a cost of living so that we can live because we have  been the ones who have helped build this Nation?   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues and the administration to  be unafraid of moving forward on H.R. 40.   Isn't it time that we assess the impact of slavery in this country?   Over 200 years it has never been addressed. It has never been  addressed. H.R. 40 needs to pass on the issue of studying slavery and  developing reparation proposals.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, what an important topic, limited to 1  minute, but I rise today to acknowledge Human Trafficking Awareness  Day, to acknowledge that a Texas woman just filed a lawsuit against one  of our universities for sexual abuse and the grooming by her coach to  use her over and over again.   Human trafficking is one of the greatest threats to human rights in  the United States. In 2020, over 11,000 instances of potential human  trafficking were reported to the United States National Human  Trafficking Hotline, and at least 70 percent of those were, in fact,  estimated to be sex trafficking.   I am delighted that Chairman  Mike McCaul and Congresswoman Sheila  Jackson Lee, myself, have introduced the Stop Human Trafficking in  School Zones Act because that is one of the largest sites for  trafficking.   We look forward to a bipartisan Congress supporting this legislation  that will particularly provide enhanced sentencing to those who would  dare to recruit our children at schools, and they do it all across the  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I hope that we are aware today is Human Trafficking  Day and that we recognize we must do something to stop it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this is a solemn moment. I join my  fellow colleagues, the women of the Democratic Caucus, to stand here  because we stand in the name of those who have died: 11 murders, 42  bombings, 196 arsons, 491 assaults, and thousands of incidents of  criminal activity directed at our doctors, our nurses, and our  patients.   After COVID-19, America woke up to the vitality and the necessity of  our medical professionals, but I come here today to express my concern.  I wish my friend from Louisiana had worked with my side of the aisle so  that we would acknowledge that there has been loss of life of innocent  persons who simply were providing medical care.   Dr. David Gunn was shot and killed by an opponent of abortion during  a protest. A former pastor kills a doctor and clinic volunteer. George  Tiller, twice a target, is killed.   This legislation is an extreme initiative because it is not here to  acknowledge the solemnity of which we stand, first to recognize the  constitutional right of a woman, her doctor, and her faith to be able  to make a decision without fear and intimidation.   In a State like mine, we have vigilantism because it has passed  legislation for bounty hunters to come back again from the 1800s to  intimidate doctors, nurses, and patients.   This is a day that we must stand against. If we are to work together  in this solemn moment, we must recognize all the doctors, nurses, and  patients that have been intimidated.   The National Abortion Federation, in 2021, indicated that there has  been an increase in violence. The significant increases in stalking,  600 percent; blockades, 450 percent; hoax devices/suspicious packages,  163 percent; invasions, 129 percent; and assault and battery, 128  percent.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation. Maybe  we can, in solemnity, work together on this serious issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 3, a concurrent  resolution that expresses the sense of Congress condemning the recent  attacks on pro-life facilities, groups, and churches.   It is critically important that we opposed the Republican effort to  rewrite history in a way that demonizes the victims and glorifies the  aggressors.   Each American has the right to make their own healthcare decisions  according to their own beliefs values, and conscience.   Republicans hope to strip women of their constitutional right of  autonomy over their own body and their right to make their own  healthcare decisions.   In Texas, Republicans have incentivized vigilantism and stalking by  passing a law that provides civilians a cause of action against anyone  who performs or aids an abortion and provides for a $10,000 cash reward  if successful.   This resolution ignores the long-documented history of violence  against abortion providers, their staff, and their patients and  attempts to rewrite the facts.   According to Bloomberg, a survey of 390 clinics showed that assaults  on abortion providers surged 128 percent in 2021 with reports of  kicking, slapping and being pepper sprayed.   The National Abortion Federation 2021 Violence & Disruption Report,  found a massive increase in violence and disruption against abortion  providers.   The most significant increases were in stalking (600 percent),  blockades (450 percent), hoax devices/suspicious packages (163  percent), invasions (129 percent), and assault and battery (128  percent) compared to 2020.   Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a nonprofit  that tracks political violence and demonstrations, asserts that anti- government militias and extremist groups like the Proud Boys appearance  at abortion related events spiked 160 percent in 2021, compared to the  previous year.   Further, in 2020, far-right groups appeared at only 1 percent of  demonstrations related to abortion rights; in 2022, almost one in five  events involved members of a far-right group.  [[Page H173]]    This violence, harassment, and cyberbullying against those who seek  abortions, their providers, and supporters is unconscionable.   The American public made it clear last November that they want  Congress to protect reproductive freedom.   We stand with all women, and staunchly reject the misinformation in  this bill and its attempt to cover up the attacks on basic human  dignity and constitutional rights.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose this outrageous and dangerous  resolution.    Madam Speaker, I would say: Here we go again. For  those of us who have served in the United States Congress, this is:  Here we go again.   This is legislation that is attempting to be wrapped in mercy that is  without mercy. First of all, it is without fact. It is extremely  important to know that if you were here in the United States Congress  you know the history because we have already passed the bipartisan  Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which reiterates the fact that it is  illegal to interfere with a newborn. They are protected from both  intentional harm by healthcare providers and harm from medical  negligence--plain and simple, period at the end of the sentence.   Why are we here today?   We are here today for news clips. We are here today for quotes and  condemnation of the other side of the aisle that wants to be reckless  with the life of a child.                                time  1415    I can assure you, Madam Speaker, that those of us who have given  birth and those of us who have lost in the birth process are extreme  lovers of those wonderful opportunities of life.   I refuse and reject condemnation of my personal self because I  believe these decisions are with a God--the woman's God and the  families' God--her faith, doctors, and, of course, the persons who are  a part of the medical profession.   I have article after article that talks about the tragedy of partial- birth abortion, which is the name used more than a decade ago. They  always find creative names to be able to be criminalized.   We heard from a member of the Rules Committee who said: How dare you  grab up a child, put them in an ambulance, and take them hundreds of  miles away from their family?   Or maybe the family who found out that the multiple abnormalities of  their child would not allow them to live, and they had waited 8 years  for this wonderful baby. The decisions, unfortunately, of neither life  nor death come easily for these children. There is a painful existence  marked by periods of breathing cessation and seizures when they are  born.   Because my OB was unable to get a good image of the brain until the  13th week, we understand that these are personal decisions. We  understand that these are painful decisions.   So I stand with those families, I refuse to condemn those families,  and I refuse to be merciless. I am giving mercy in voting against this  legislation. I am voting against it now.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 26, the BornAlive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would establish requirements  for the degree of care a health care practitioner must provide in the  case of a child born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion.   In the first week of the 118th Congress, extreme MAGA Republicans are  launching attacks on reproductive freedom, intruding on medical  decision-making, and keeping their promise to criminalize abortion  nationwide with no exceptions.   H.R. 26 is a clear attack on health care providers and attempts to  evoke power over the care that they provide to patients.   When the Senate attempted to pass this bill in 2019, 17 medical and  public health organizations sent a letter in strong opposition to the  bill stating that it represented ``a dangerous government intrusion  into private health care decisions''.   This bill undermines medical professionals' training and critical  judgment, minimizing their ability to determine the best medical  treatment for their patients.   Medical professionals abide by a Code of Ethics during their career.   For lawmakers to undermine the work of medical professionals and  attempt to prosecute them for doing what is right for their patients is  inappropriate and misdirected.   This bill is a direct way to compromise the health and safety of  patients.   A 2015 study published by the New England Journal of Medicine states  that a baby's viability is the determining factor in the care that they  receive.   The study states that ``active intervention for infants born before  22 weeks gestation is generally not recommended, whereas the approach  for infants born at or after 22 weeks of gestation varies.''   Seeing that there are already standards in place to determine level  of care, why should we as lawmakers intervene to override what medical  professionals agree is the most appropriate medical treatment warranted  by the circumstances.   To suggest that medical professionals would not provide equal and  adequate medical attention to all patients is thoughtless, insulting,  and uncivil.   For a party that advocated for minimal federal government  interference and big government, Republicans are attempting to increase  the federal government's jurisdiction over local governments.   Why should we as lawmakers seek to prosecute medical professionals  that are simply doing their job?   This bill would force medical professionals to worry about criminal  penalties and legislative interpretation when the appropriate medical  care is already laid out.   This bill would remove a medical professional's ability to make the  medically sound decision for their patient without government  interference and the threat of repercussions.   This bill endangers infants because it puts Republican wishes ahead  of appropriate medical care.   H.R. 26, Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, is dangerous  to both medical professionals and patients. Medical professionals would  be placed under unnecessary scrutiny, when legislation and protocols  are already in place for this situation.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill that would  establish requirements for the degree of care a health care  practitioner must provide in the case of a child born alive following  an abortion or attempted abortion.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement written by Audrey  Eisen titled: ``How The Abortion Ban Debate Became My Story.''                         [From ACLU, Feb. 2, 2009]                How the Abortion Ban Debate Became My Story                             (By Audrey Eisen)         I never thought that so-called ``partial-birth abortion''       would ever have anything to do with me. Why would it? I'm 34       years old and I desperately want children. My husband and I       have been together for eight years, married for four, and       trying to have a baby for two. Abortion was not something I       thought much about.        But earlier this year, all that changed.        In November of 2002, after fighting infertility and       experiencing the sadness of a miscarriage in July, we were       thrilled to find ourselves pregnant again. While still       apprehensive, we consciously decided to be excited--another       loss would hurt just the same, regardless of whether or not       we had allowed ourselves to be happy.        In the first few months, my endocrinologist performed       regular ultrasounds to ensure that the embryo was developing       normally. It was such a treat to be able to see our child       growing. I kept the pictures and my thoughts in a pregnancy       journal.        When it became evident that we were going to make it       through the first trimester, my endocrinologist referred me       to an obstetrician (OB). At my first appointment, the nurse       put a fetal heart monitor on my belly and, much to our       amazement, from a seemingly great distance, we heard the       characteristic ``whoosh'' of our child's heartbeat. We were       on top of the world thinking that, for sure, this one was       going to make it.        At 13 weeks, however, all this changed abruptly when,       during a routine ultrasound exam, my OB discovered our child       had  [[Page H183]]       polydactyly (more than the normal number of digits). While at       first we thought it was just the hands, we later learned that       the feet were affected as well. At the time, my husband and I       thought it was no big deal--we had both known people with an       extra finger, and we were prepared to help our child live       with the condition. However, we soon found out that an extra       toe or finger were the least of our concerns: polydactyly is       associated with over 100 syndromes, most commonly Trisomy 13.        Trisomy 13 is characterized by multiple abnormalities, many       of which are not compatible with life beyond a couple of       months. Most fetuses with Trisomy 13 die in utero; of those       who make it to birth, almost half do not survive past the       first month; roughly three-quarters die within 6 months.       Long-term survival is one year. Unfortunately, neither life       nor death come easily for these children--theirs is a painful       existence marked by periods of breathing cessation and       seizures. Because my OB was unable to get a good image of the       brain during the 13th week ultrasound, we returned at 15       weeks.        The first thing my OB examined during this visit was the       fetal brain. He didn't say a word. I could tell he was       holding something back and asked that he tell me what he saw.       He said, ``It is not normal.'' The rest of the scan was a       blur as tears ran down my cheeks and those of my mother and       husband, who had accompanied me to the doctor's office that       day. Following the scan, the doctor left us alone to compose       ourselves. I cried with my whole body, from the depths of my       soul.        Shortly thereafter, I had other tests. These confirmed that       our baby had Trisomy 13.        At this point we discussed our options with a genetic       counselor. My husband and I both felt strongly that we did       not want our child to suffer; we decided to terminate the       pregnancy as soon as possible. I had an abortion on the first       day of my 16th week of pregnancy.        Soon after I had the procedure, I began to see news stories       about a new federal ``partial birth abortion'' ban. Like many       Americans, following the press on this issue over the past       several years, I had thought, ``My God, this must be       something horrible.'' But as I mourned the loss of my much-      desired pregnancy, I came to realize that if such legislation       passed, the right to safe second-trimester abortions like the       one I had might not remain available to those women who come       after me. While proponents of this ban claim that it is aimed       at one procedure performed late in pregnancy, the reality is       that it would prohibit the safest and most common procedures       used in the second trimester, well before fetal viability.       Without access to this care, I don't know how women will       endure if after routine prenatal testing they discover, as we       did, that their fetuses suffer from grave conditions       incompatible with life; I don't know how I would have       endured.        Two weeks following my abortion, we received a letter from       the genetic counselor. Our child had numerous abnormalities:       the brain, heart, and other internal organs were not       developing properly. Our child was also a girl and we miss       her very much. In our case, abortion was the only humane       choice. This choice must be preserved for the sake of all       women and their families. The American public needs to       understand the consequences of this ban and that the human       face of so-called ``partial-birth abortion,'' my face, could       be their own.
