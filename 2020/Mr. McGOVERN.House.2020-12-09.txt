 Mr. Speaker, on Human Rights Day, we mark the adoption  of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   Mr. Speaker, 72 years ago, China was among the countries committing  itself to the principle that ``all human beings are born free and equal  in dignity and rights.'' In this spirit, I call on the Chinese  Government to release Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama.   In May of 1995, only days after Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was chosen to  serve as the 11th Panchen Lama, the Chinese Government kidnapped him  and his family. The outside world has neither seen nor heard from them  since. Chinese authorities tell the world that the Panchen Lama and his  family are safe, and they say that they are well, but they refuse to  allow anyone to visit and verify his well-being.   Mr. Speaker, the Universal Declaration enshrines the rights to  liberty and religious freedom and precludes arbitrary detention. China  should honor its international obligations by freeing the true Panchen  Lama.                            ____________________
