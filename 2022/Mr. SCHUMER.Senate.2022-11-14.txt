 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I begin the substance of my  remarks, today the people of Buffalo, NY, observe a somber remembrance:  6 months ago to the day that 10 New Yorkers were killed in a terrible  shooting at the Tops Supermarket on Jefferson Avenue. A few moments  ago, the city of Buffalo held a moment of silence to honor those killed  and those wounded, and we joined with them in prayer and remembrance.   And today, because gun violence is still all too much with us, we  hold in our hearts everyone at the University of Virginia where, last  night, three students were tragically killed in a shooting on campus.  Our condolences go out to the families of those lost, as well as to  everyone in Charlottesville who is grieving today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 449,  H.R. 8404.    Madam President, let me say a few words about the  cloture motion we will file.   In a few moments, I am going to set up the first procedural vote on  legislation that will codify marriage equality into law. Members should  expect the first vote on Wednesday.   The Respect for Marriage Act, which my colleagues Senators Baldwin,  Sinema, Collins, and others have done a great job working on, is an  extremely important and much needed bill. No American should ever, ever  be discriminated against because of whom they love, and passing this  bill would secure these much needed safeguards into Federal law.   I want to make clear that passing this bill is not a theoretical  exercise, but it is as real as it gets. When the Supreme Court  overturned Roe, Justice Thomas argued that other rights, like the right  to marriage equality enshrined in Obergefell, could come next.   Now, the Senate had a chance to bring marriage protection to the  floor for a vote back in September, but at the urging of colleagues  from both sides of the aisle, I agreed to wait because we were given an  assurance that enough votes would materialize after the election.  Because my top priority is to get things done in a bipartisan way  whenever we can, we determined that this legislation was too important  to risk failure, so we waited to give bipartisanship a chance.   I hope, for the sake of tens of millions of Americans, that at least  10 Republicans will vote with us to protect marriage equality into law  soon. The rights and dignity of millions of Americans depend on it.                                Cloture Motion     Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, November 14, be waived.    Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
