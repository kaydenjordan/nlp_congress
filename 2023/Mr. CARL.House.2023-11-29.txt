 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this important bill,  H.R. 5283, the Protecting our Communities from Failure to Secure our  Border Act of 2023.  [[Page H5964]]    In a time where the security of our Nation is at great risk because  of illegal immigrants, this bill takes huge steps to address the  challenges we face at our borders and prohibits the housing of illegal  immigrants on federally managed lands, including those under the  National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management,  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   We have got a real crisis in this country. We can't wait any longer  to address it.   Since President Biden has taken office, there are over 6.5 million  illegal crossings in the U.S. that we know of--that we know of is the  important part.   It is absolutely critical we secure our borders and enact measures  that discourage further waves of illegal immigrants. We can't keep  encouraging further waves of illegal immigrants to come here by  offering free housing on Federal lands.
