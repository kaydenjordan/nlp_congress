 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 748, the  Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019.   This important bill repeals the so-called Cadillac tax, a policy  implemented through ObamaCare that would have placed a 40 percent tax  on high-cost employer healthcare plans.   The tax was originally included as a way to help pay for the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called ObamaCare, by  targeting expensive health plans and insurance companies. However, in  practice, it would have been middle-class workers bearing the real  burden to pay for it through taxes. It would have hurt union members,  nonunion members, small businesses, and nonprofits.   In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget  Office predicted that a whopping 70 percent of the revenue collected by  the Cadillac tax would have come from higher income and payroll taxes  rather than excise taxes on insurers.   This massive tax increase would have devastated middle-class workers  and families, many of whom continue to struggle with the rising costs  of ObamaCare as it is.   I thank my colleagues for realizing the bad implications of this  failed policy and for working in a bipartisan way to repeal the  Cadillac tax.   I am hopeful that today's action will allow us to move forward to  address similar policies, like the health insurance tax and the medical  device tax.   Instead of propping up the failed Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act through higher taxes and reduced choices, we must get serious  about improving healthcare and our economy.   Madam Speaker, I believe H.R. 748 is a great first step, and I urge  my colleagues to support it.
