 Mr. Speaker, as I get myself organized here, this  evening I am going to actually try to do something that is probably a  little dangerous and a little tricky. I am going to try to do some math  from behind the microphone.   You know, we have a running joke in our office that being a Member of  Congress means you often work in a math-free zone but the math always  wins.   And, you know, to our friends over here, I guess I should--I don't  mean to jump onto this, but we just heard some of the discussion about  Ms. Slaughter. I am, obviously, from a different part of the country, a  different party, different philosophy, and she was always incredibly  kind to me and funny. Most people, I don't know, completely understood.  She had a brutal wit, and so a couple of times, when I would go in  front of the Rules Committee, sometimes the banter back and forth, you  sat there and go: Is she just playing with me? So just for my friends  that are just leaving from that.   All right. So I am going to try to do a couple of things here, Mr.  Speaker. I am going to actually sort of walk through what was in the  most recent CBO report, but also a couple of the previous CBO reports  and what is happening in our Nation's debt. At the same time, I am also  going to talk about some of the positive things that are happening, and  some of it because of the tax reform, some of the things that are  happening in our unemployment and opportunity out there.   So, first off, let's walk through a couple of baseline numbers, and  then I am going to grind through these so it tells a story of where we  are going and where we are at as a country.   When we get behind these microphones and say, ``We have an  entitlement crisis coming that we have to deal with,'' they have been  saying it behind these microphones for 30 years. Well, it is here. The  peak of the baby boom, I think, today, is about 62 years old. There are  74 million of us who are baby boomers, who will be moving into our  benefits, and we don't have the resources to cover our promises, the  way things are structured today.   Yet if you look at the Pew poll from a couple of years ago, only 15  percent of Republicans believe there is an entitlement crisis coming,  but only 5 percent of Democrats believe it. So this is one of the great  difficulties in this body where you often hear us saying: Speak truth  to power. Well, how about math to power?   Well, what about our own constituents when they don't believe us  because maybe there has been crying wolf or because it has been easier  to say things like: Well, the problem is waste and fraud. There are  problems with waste and fraud, but the numbers are tiny compared to  what is about to happen.   So, some baseline math. When I was born, 1962, there were five  workers for every one retiree. Today--and let's actually do 12 years  from now, because that is when it gets dramatic. Twelve years from now,  there will only be two. You and your spouse will be covering one  retiree. So, in just my lifetime, we have gone from five workers for  one retiree to two.   The math is brutal. So think about this. Over the last decade--so  from 2008 to 2018--if you actually look at the growth in the size of  spending in the government, 72 percent of it was just Social Security  and Medicare. So if you actually look at the growth of the Federal  spending, do understand, over the last 10 years, 72 percent of that  growth were just those two programs: Social Security and Medicare.   Over the next 10 years, just the growth will be about $1.3 trillion.  That is, functionally, just the growth in Social Security and Medicare  will be two full Defense Departments. It is important to get our head  around telling the truth, because if we are going to save these earned  entitlements, we need to have that moment of reflection that comes off  of a calculator instead of what happens so often behind these  microphones where we try to make public policy by feelings.   So, first board I have up here, this is from the latest CBO report,  which I actually have in here, which I am trying to keep from falling  off the podium here, and there is actually some good news here. And,  that is, because of what is going on the last couple of quarters, this  last year, substantially, I believe, because of what is happening  through growth-oriented policies, whether it be the tax reform, whether  it be what is happening in the regulatory environment, you are actually  seeing revenue into the trust funds go up a bit.   It is still a crisis, but if you actually look at SSDI, which is  Social Security Disability Insurance, I think it was maybe 1\1/2\, 2  years ago I got behind this microphone, and there were only like 4  years left in the trust fund, and it went to zero.   Well, we gained almost 3 additional years. Now, some of that is  because of policy, some of it is because of revenues because we have so  many more people working right now. If you actually also take a look at  some of the money going into Social Security, some of the money going  into Medicare part A, that is the trust fund portion, we are actually  picking up a couple of years--1 year here, 2 years there--in additional  actuarial soundness of the trust funds.   Think of this as an opportunity. If we are going to have to make  policy--and as I stand behind this microphone, I am looking for a  unified theory. It is not just entitlement reform because, let's face  it, that is the third rail. People go nuts. They run attack ads on you.  It is more complicated. We need to do those things in our society that  help people be employed, do tax regulatory policies, training policies,  opportunity policies, because the more of our brothers and sisters who  are working--how do we go from 63 percent labor force participation,  which is a wonderful number from where we thought we would be 10 years  ago till now, how do we get it to go further?   How do we get more of our brothers and sisters to move from being the  long-term unemployed, the discouraged workers, and get them to move  into the opportunities that are out there right now because we have,  apparently, millions of jobs that are looking for workers, but it also  does powerful things to these numbers?    We are also going to have to be honest about mechanisms within  immigration. We have a birthrate crisis in this country. The last few  years, if you actually look at the number of babies we are having, our  numbers have substantially collapsed.   Well, remember, today's child is tomorrow's worker; and if in today's  world, when you turn 65 and begin some of your benefits, the math is,  you will spend about one-third of your adult life in retirement, but we  don't have enough young people because these programs are pay-as-you-go  programs. That is really important as we sort of walk through the math.   So if you are looking for that unified theory, it even adds in things  like trade. If we are going to be a country that is very slow on our  birthrate and immigration, we have designed a talent-based immigration  system that also does some rewards for younger demographics, but we are  also going to have to have trade with countries that also have positive  demographics so we actually have customers.   There are lots of these things that all have to be thought of  together. And something I am not going to do tonight, but I have done  other evenings and we will do in a month or so, is a fixation on  technology and how technology also can provide amazing opportunity in  everything from changing the healthcare curve to actually allowing more  of our brothers and sisters to participate in the workforce, even those  with certain difficulties in life or even those who may be older but  choose to work. Instead of being scared of technology, I think it may  be our solution, depending on some of these cost curves.   So what is important here is, as you look at this chart, just take a  look at this first number here. That is the Social Security trust fund.  Now, as you know, our general fund has taken that money and borrowed  it, and then we replace it with sort of special Social Security IOUs.   Now, if I remember correctly, last year we were paying the Social  Security trust fund like 3.1 percent interest  [[Page H3392]]  for those borrowed moneys. So when you see some of the future slides  here, or boards, you will actually see, here is the trust fund balance;  but, also, here it is with some of the interest revenue that we also  pay ourselves back.   So think of this craziness. Functionally, as a society, we borrow  money to pay back the borrowed money because that cash that we took out  of those trust funds has long since been spent. But on this board, in  10 years, the Social Security trust fund is cut in half. In just a few  years, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund is empty, and if you  actually can see it, the hospital, the Medicare part A, which is the  only part really with the trust fund, in a few years, it is also down  to zero.   So just getting our heads around, this is reality, this is math, but  it is better than it was a year or so ago, but it is still a crisis.  And these, I am going to put up two of these boards that is just going  to show--do you see this sort of flat inflection here? That is actually  part of the good news because where you see--last year, it would have  been a constant curve downward that we were depleting the funds. As you  know, they have gone negative this year, meaning that the revenues  coming out of Social Security is actually greater than the revenues  coming in, except for, since the tax reform and some of the economic  expansion, all of a sudden we have hit a bit of a plateau.   CBO actually had it looking like it was going to last for a couple of  years. I am actually much more optimistic than some of their baseline  numbers, but that is that actual mathematical reprieve. You also see  the two lines there. The variance in those is what we are also paying  ourselves back as a spiff in interest.   So this one is Social Security, Old-Age Survivors Insurance Trust  Fund. But then when we actually move over to the hospital fund--and  important, you will see this in future slides. Social Security, in many  ways, isn't my crisis--isn't our crisis, because it is a defined  benefit. Fixing it, the math is actually fairly easy.                                time  1900    It is Medicare that becomes so incredibly difficult. And Medicare, as  you are going to see in a couple of future slides, is a much larger  financial issue in our near future.   So you actually just see sort of the same thing in that even the  hospital trust fund now is moving negative, meaning we are taking more  money out of it than is going in. Yet, you do see the little bit of the  plateau we are getting because of the current payroll tax.   Just a point of reference on that. If you actually looked at the Tax  Foundation's numbers when the tax reform was coming out, they actually  had, I think it was, just shy of $300 billion over the next 10 years in  new payroll tax, FICA revenues, and that actually reaches into this  area.   This is a chart that I have never seen on the floor before, but is a  really interesting one, because I think a lot of us don't really have  our head around where does the money in Medicare come from? And, I am  sorry, I know this is a little hard to see, but if you see this, this  is the entire Medicare.   This 45 percent up here, that is actually general revenue. We are  reaching into the General Fund and paying it out to hospitals and  doctors and durable medical equipment.   The 36 percent there, that is actually the tax revenue. That is the  payroll tax. That is within our FICA.   Then we also have some taxes on higher income earners and Social  Security benefits, and it comes into here. And then you see this 3  percent down there. That is actually revenue that we pay ourselves. So  we borrowed the money, gave it to the General Fund, spent it, but we  paid ourselves last year what was the 3.1 percent interest. Well, that  is what that 3 percent is down there.   So if you actually add it up, about half of this, half of what we  spend in Medicare is General Fund, half is coming in through the  payroll tax.   So if you look at part A, the hospital trust fund, okay, that is  almost all payroll taxes. But if you start looking at part B and part  D, you see the orange there, 75 and 78 percent respectively, that is  all coming out of the General Fund.   On occasion, when I have actually done some of these presentations at  home, you will get the hand that goes up and people think that it is  all paid for by the payroll taxes. That actually creates sort of this  weird misunderstanding of it is not all within the trust fund. Almost  half of what we spend in Medicare actually is coming out of the General  Fund. And there is actually where, as we see the substantial growth,  you see General Fund spending growing, and why a substantial portion of  that General Fund growing is actually part of this.   A couple of the other slides, just to understand, as we have 74  million of our brothers and sisters who are baby boomers moving into  retirement right now--what is it, about 10,000, 10,300 every single  day--it actually has a little bit of a steepening curve over the next 3  or 4 years.   Now, the headline on this is really important: Social Security,  Health Entitlements, and Interest Costs. So you have to put in the  paying interest on all of the money we have borrowed as a society.  Driving 91 percent of the 2008 to 2028 spending hikes.   Remember my number before, that if we just do Social Security and  Medicare over the last 10 years, 72 percent of the increased spending  we had as a government, in the Federal Government, was just the growth  in Social Security and Medicare. Okay. But if you add in also interest  on top of it, it goes from 72 now to 91 percent. So understand, those  are the levers that are going to squeeze out so many of the other  things that are happening, but also the greatest fragility to being  safe here.   Let's actually go onto the next board because I think it helps  actually sort of show where we are going. But what is also important  here is, as you look at these, those on the bottom, you will actually  see things like defense and discretionary spending all being fairly  flatlined, even with the most recent budget appropriations bill. If you  actually look at it over the next decade or over the next three  decades, almost all of the growth in spending comes from the two  programs and covering interest costs.   This one is really noisy, and we will put these up, or put them out.  Over the next 30 years--this one actually goes from 1960, but when you  get here, look at the growth. You are heading towards a time, 2047. It  seems like a lifetime from now, but you are in 2018 right now. So reach  out 20 years from now, reach out 30 years from now.   Defense is 2.7 percent of spending equal to the size of the economy,  so this is a per GDP slide. But the explosion, you see that red area,  in that time when I am hopefully well into my retirement, 15.6 percent  of the entire size of the economy. So we are going to reach in and  take--say the economy is this big--we are going to take 15.6 percent of  that, and that is just going to be Social Security and Medicare. And  another 6.2 percent will be covering the interest costs.   It is unsustainable, when you start to realize you will be  approaching 30 percent of the entire gross domestic product of this  country in Federal spending. It is not defense, it is not nondefense  discretionary, it is actually not even some of the other entitlements,  even though sometimes that is easier to talk about behind these  microphones. It really is where we are demographically as a society.   And look, demographics is our destiny. We can't pretend it is not  happening. We are all getting older. It is the nature of life. And  understand also, these numbers are assuming no wars, no recessions, no  disasters. These are just baseline numbers, and that should make this  really, really scary.   So how do I convince our voters and my fellow Members that we have a  little bit of reprieve right now because we are in a time of terrific  economic expansion, terrific employment, and good numbers coming in on  the FICA tax? How do we use this as a moment to actually say, let's be  adults, let's come up with something much more elegant than just  entitlement reform? But there is actually ways where we can keep our  promises to our seniors, keep our promises to those who are heading  into their retirement, but also have it so we are not all here 15 years  from now saying we have hit a deficit crisis: we can't sell our bonds,  our interest rates are exploding, everyone is going to be taking huge  cuts. Let's attack it today.  [[Page H3393]]    Because I believe if we do things that maximize economic growth,  things that actually help our Nation's demographics, if we adopt a very  aggressive adoption of technology, particularly in the healthcare  space, and also provide some options within the entitlements, it is all  stuff we should have done 10 years ago, but we have been given a little  bit of reprieve right now because of what is happening in the economic  growth.   So here is something to get our heads around. If you actually look at  the numbers, you see the first two bar charts, that is Social Security.  It turns out the average American will put in about $543,000 over their  working life. And this is someone who would be retiring right now. And  they are going to get out $616,000. So, okay, a little variance. Now,  the problem is we have obviously already spent all of that money that  was in the trust fund and we put IOUs in it, but still, it is a fair  deal.   Medicare is our crisis. Apparently, someone who is retiring today  will have put in about $140,000 in Medicare taxes. But the person who  retires today is taking out about $422,000. So $140,000 in, $422,000  out. Now multiply that by just 74 million of us who are baby boomers  and you start to understand the size and the scale of where the gap is  coming from. It is math.   I desperately wish there was a way to blind the political rage and  just say, it is math, and the math will always win. And if we would  step up and be less political and more like accountants for a moment-- and I am sorry, I know as Republicans that is often our problem, is we  sound more like accountants--but the violence, the cruelty we are going  to do to our society if we continue to avoid the reality of the math,  in a decade or decade and a half from now when the crisis is upon us,  our ability to fix it will be very, very difficult. It is going to be  difficult right now, but it is doable. There are approaches to make  these numbers work.   This is also, for those folks who are now deficit hawks or newfound  deficit hawks, a time for a moment of honesty and reality. Over the  next 30 years--and this is not inflation adjusted, so for those of you  who like to do constant dollars, you would probably reduce the number  by about a third--but this is over the next 30 years. So if you plan to  be alive for the next 30 years, this is what you are facing today: $82  trillion in cash shortfall; $78 trillion of that is just Social  Security, Medicare, and the interest on that shortfall.   So all of the other things that we talk about: Oh, it is defense  spending. No, it is not.   Oh, it is other nondefense discretionary. No, it is not.   It is other entitlement programs. A little bit, but not really.   It is the two programs that are earned entitlements that we, as  Congress, in its wisdom over the last few decades, didn't make the math  actuarially sound. And just pretending it is not there doesn't fix it.   So one more time, think about this. Over the next 30 years, the  Social Security deficit, $18.9 trillion; the Medicare deficit, $39.7  trillion; and then the interest we are going to spend on those  shortfalls is another $23.4 trillion. That is $78 trillion.   Now, if you want to use inflation adjusted, just reduce it by a  third.   This is the greatest threat to our society. Because do you see at the  very end, do you see the little blue, the rest of the budget actually  is in balance over the next 30 years. And that is actually using the  CBO scores, which I think sort of underestimate current growth. But  that is just the math. This isn't Republican or Democrat; it is math.   Yet, it is the greatest threat to our society. And yet, when I stand  in front of my constituents and we will have a meeting and we will  discuss what is the greatest threat to society, the hands go up and it  becomes all sorts of things, because this is really hard, it is really  big, it is really difficult, and it is really, really, really  important.   So as we walk through these, I need to do--and forgive my stacks of  paper, but sometimes when you are trying to do the math, this is one of  those where you lay out the Excel spreadsheet and it goes on and on and  on and on.   Think of this. In 9 years, Social Security and Medicare, without the  interest, will be 10.3 percent of the entire economy. So the United  States Government will say: Hey, the economy is today what the GDP is,  $21 trillion, $22 trillion, $23 trillion. Hopefully, 10 years from now,  it is substantially larger. But 10 years from now, it is going to be  over 10 percent is just being reached in and spent on Medicare and  Social Security. It is the math.   But actually, over the next decade, it gets up into the 12s, and then  a little while after that it goes up further. But that is of spending  equal to the entire size of the economy. That is why it becomes so  incredibly important that part of that holistic solution of how we save  these programs is also that we maximize economic expansion.   So when we get into the discussion that has happened around here a  lot lately, where we talk about the tax reform and the jobs and  opportunity it is creating, I have had this running conversation, and I  saw it on the floor here I think yesterday, where someone is pounding:  Well, tax reform is not paying for itself, tax cuts never pay for  themselves. That is partially true. Certain parts don't.                                time  1915    Certain parts are political-societal decisions to allow families to  keep more, but there was an interesting little set of numbers. This  often happens when you have your spreadsheets and everything laying out  in front of you and you are going over them.   So in December, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which, as you know,  was our scorekeeper when we did tax reform, actually said: Hey, here is  what we think the tax reform costs in the static; here is what we think  some of the dynamic growth is going to be.   But they were in two different reports.   I took the business numbers, just the business portion, to see what  it was doing growthwise. I thought you would all find this interesting,  or maybe I am the only one.   So it turns out that the business tax reform, I think the title II  portion of our reform bill from December, said, hey, businesses, $653  billion in less taxes, revenues to us as a government over the next 10  years, but the international business portion of the book, we are  actually going to take in another $324 billion.   So $653 billion, if you are here, but because we are bringing those  moneys, the repatriation of those moneys back in and actually  encouraging companies to actually come back to the United States and  work here, we actually gain $324 billion.   All right. So I am still negative $329 billion over the 10 years on  those C corps, the big corporations, but then on the next Joint Tax  report, they talked about the dynamic scoring, what they saw as the  growth estimates.   Not to bore everyone with it, but we have already seen the CBO has  actually lifted up the growth estimates from even December, so there  are good things happening there. So, hopefully, these numbers would  actually expand from that.   But if you actually put the growth back in, they were estimating $384  billion of growth in new revenues because of the bigger economy, more  business spending, more jobs, more opportunity. Now, most of that is  from what was happening in those corporations.   So it turns out the business portion on the tax reform bill, in the  Joint Tax's own numbers, actually is about $55 billion to the upside in  their own modeling over the 10 years. I partially put this up because I  was embarrassed I didn't see it in their math sooner, but that is what  it is.   So I guess, ultimately, Mr. Speaker, I have a couple messages here. I  understand we are sort of in a time of very difficult politics, but we  need to sort of grow up and deal with the reality.   We are getting older as a society. We have made lots and lots of  promises. We need to keep those promises. There are ways to do it, but  every single day we don't step up and deal with the reality of math, we  make it that much more difficult for all of us.   I am 56 years old. My wife, I probably shouldn't say this, but she is  exactly my age. We are incredibly blessed. We have a 2\1/2\-year-old  that is the best little girl ever. I have a mug that says so. She  actually was with us here on the floor of the House last week. Maybe it  is partially because of my little girl that I am going to double down  on my efforts here.   How do I get our friends on the left and our friends in the majority  and say  [[Page H3394]]  maybe it is time we do the most difficult thing any of us would ever do  in our elected career, and that is actually take on the biggest issue  of our times, and that is the unfunded liabilities and the promises we  have made?   Do we do a BRAC commission, not to close things, but to actually look  at everything because is a little bit of the solution reforming how we  deliver healthcare and Medicare?   Is a little bit of the solution a different type of immigration  system that maximizes economic expansion and benefits and demographics?   Is it everything all together? Is it maximizing economic expansion so  payroll taxes become much more robust?   Is it actually creating a path for those who have been disaffected or  are on certain types of income-based social entitlement programs that  move them back into our workforce because there is opportunity?   The answer is we need to do it all at the same time.   But how do you get this body, with all the noise that is around us  constantly, all the people banging on us constantly, the chaos that is  today's media, which is an entertainment medium, get a number of people  to pull out a calculator, pull out some great econometrics, understand  the demographics, and do what is necessary to deal with the greatest  threat to this country? And that greatest threat is not military. It is  actually debt and promises we have made.   As you have already seen on the slides, everything else is pretty  much in balance over the next 30 years. What blows us up is the  promises we have made in Social Security and Medicare. It is fixable,  but we cannot continue to wait.   The last thing I want to share, and I know I am backtracking a bit,  there continues to be more good news that comes in from the tax reform  and the positive things that are happening within the economy; but  there was a great article today about what is also happening at our  State and local levels, and this sort of fits into that unified theory  of, if you are going to start to step up and do what is difficult, do  it in a time when you have economic expansion. It turns out revenues to  our States look like they are taking quite a pop upward.   Also, another article, it turns out that the International Monetary  Fund did a calculation and fairly stepped up world growth for the next  couple years and actually gave half the credit for that growth to the  U.S. tax reform, meaning what we did here in the United States actually  made a poor family on the other side of the world's opportunities  better.   If you actually start to look at all the things that are going on  around us, even in a time of turbulent politics, we have some good  things happening.   Now let's step up and do the really hard things, because the hard  things are how we are going to be judged in our future when all of us  as elected Members leave here. Will we have saved the country from its  greatest threat, which is the debt that is going to come crashing down  on us very, very soon?    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 23 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
