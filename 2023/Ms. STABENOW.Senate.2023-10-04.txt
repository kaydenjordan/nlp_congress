 Mr. President, first let me just say ``Amen'' to my  friend and colleague from Arizona.   Mr. President, I would ask, first, unanimous consent that following  my remarks, Senator Schmitt be permitted to speak for 5 minutes and  Senator Cardin be permitted to speak for 5 minutes prior to the  scheduled vote.    Mr. President, as our dear colleague, Senator Dianne  Feinstein, is lying in state in San Francisco today, the home where her  leadership started for us and for the country, and as we prepare to  remember her tomorrow in a special celebration of her life, I rise to  pay tribute--tribute to an incredible leader and my dear friend, who  dedicated her life to serving the people of California and the Nation.   Perhaps ``leader'' isn't strong enough. It is not a strong enough  word. She wasn't just a leader. She was an American icon. She inspired  generations of women to stand up and suit up and push our way into the  halls of power that weren't particularly welcoming.   Like so many of us, she started in local government. Unlike many of  us, her rise was sparked by tragedy. As president of the San Francisco  Board of Supervisors, it was her job to announce the horrific  assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.   She was heartbroken. But she was also calm. She was determined. She  vowed that her grieving city would recover and rebuild.   She was a crucial part of that rebuilding, serving as mayor for 9  years. In 1990, she ran for Governor and lost, but she picked herself  back up and said she wasn't done serving her State.   In 1992, she ran for the Senate and won, joining five other  groundbreaking women who changed the face of this institution forever.   Keep in mind that before 1992, there were no women's restrooms  anywhere near the Senate Chamber. This is actually something we all  noticed.   Through sheer determination and a lot of hard work, she rose to  become the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee  and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.   Through her leadership, she left her mark on this institution over  and over again in so many ways. She was a fierce and courageous  advocate for commonsense gun laws, as our Presiding Officer is as well,  including the 1994 assault weapons ban signed into law by President  Clinton. That legislation alone saved so many lives from gun violence  during the 10 years that it was law. I so wish that it had been able to  be continued permanently. She stood up for American values when she led  the years-long investigation into allegations that the CIA had used  torture against terrorism suspects. Despite CIA and White House  objections, Senator Feinstein courageously chose to publicly release  what is known as the torture report. It was such a historic moment that  it was even turned into a major motion picture starring Adam Driver and  Annette Bening as Senator Feinstein.    I will never forget sitting in this Chamber behind Senator Feinstein  to show support for her courage that day. She spoke to the American  people about the horrific details outlined in this report.   Senator John McCain, who understood the horrors of torture more than  anyone, commended Senator Feinstein and her staff for the report and  added this:         Our enemies act without conscience. We must not. This       executive summary of the Committee's report makes clear that       acting without conscience isn't necessary, it isn't even       helpful, in winning this strange and long war we're fighting.       We should be grateful to have that truth affirmed.    In response to the report, Senator Feinstein and Senator McCain's  anti-torture amendment was included in the 2016 National Defense  Authorization Act. The amendment restricted interrogation techniques to  those authorized in the ``Army Field Manual'' and  [[Page S4925]]  required that the International Committee of the Red Cross have access  to detainees in U.S. Government custody--a law that stands today.   Senator Feinstein was also a tireless champion for women, including  the Violence Against Women Act, legislation to fight human trafficking,  and our freedom to make our own reproductive health decisions. She was  a leading voice for decades on behalf of our LGBTQ+ friends and  neighbors. She fought to protect California's forests and water  infrastructure.   Beyond her many, many accomplishments, she was also my friend, and I  so enjoyed hearing the stories from colleagues in the last number of  days about her.   Yes, Mr. President, I, too, have a seersucker suit, which she bought  for each of us to make sure that the women of the Senate could  participate in seersucker suit day.   Yes, I also have a piece of art. In addition to watercolors, she drew  beautiful pictures with colored pencils, and I am so honored to have  one of those hanging in my house.   Yes, Dianne also used to say: Are you staying in DC this weekend? Why  don't you come over for dinner?   I was grateful for the times I was able to join her.   Dianne was always giving people, particularly all of us as women,  items of hers that we admired. We had to be careful what we were  admiring or we would end up getting one.   One day, I got the opportunity to return the favor in a very small  way. We were on the floor, and Dianne said to me: I love your lipstick,  the color of your lipstick. Where did you get it?   And I thought, aha, this is a moment for me to give Dianne something,  as small as it was. So I came in a couple of days later with a package  with several of the lipsticks she had admired, and the smile on her  face was priceless.   She said: You don't have to do that.   I said: Yes, I do. You do so much for us every day that this is just  a small token I can give in return.   Senator Feinstein once said this:         Women have begun to see that if I go through that doorway,       I take everybody through it.    Today, I am remembering my friend for all of the barriers she broke,  the glass ceiling she shattered, the doors she held open so that so  many others could follow.   May her memory be a blessing to her family, to the people of  California, and to all of us who are feeling her loss.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today to strongly support the  nomination of Susan DeClercq, whom President Biden nominated to serve  as the U.S. District judge for the Eastern District of Michigan; and we  will be having that vote shortly.   One of the things that people consistently say about Ms. DeClercq is  how warm and personable she is. She is, in a word, kind, but don't let  that fool you. She can go toe-to-toe with anyone in the courtroom. Ms.  DeClercq is a proud graduate of the University of Michigan and Wayne  State University School of Law.   Her first job out of law school was serving as a clerk to U.S.  District Judge Avern L. Cohn. Judge Cohn was a force of nature who  spent 40 years on the Federal bench, retiring at age 95. He was a bit  gruff, but he had an open mind and an open heart--two attributes Ms.  DeClercq has carried throughout her career that spans the public and  the private sectors.   Currently, she is director and counsel for special investigations at  Ford Motor Company. Before that, she spent 18 years in the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan in a variety of  leadership roles, including as Chief of the Civil Division.   She has fought to protect people's civil rights over and over and  over again--an example: a Michigan family that was literally kicked out  of a restaurant because their children suffered from a genetic skin  disease. She successfully represented an auxiliary firefighter, a U.S.  Army reservist who was denied a promotion, which was extended to  coworkers with less experience, after he returned from Active Duty in  Afghanistan.   In all of her cases, she has won the respect of everyone in the  courtroom. As one Michigan lawyer said: If I had to lose to anybody in  litigation, I am glad it was Ms. DeClercq.   It is worth noting that, if confirmed, Susan DeClercq will be  Michigan's first Federal judge of East Asian descent. Susan DeClercq is  an outstanding nominee who received bipartisan support during her  cloture vote earlier today.   I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation.   I yield the floor, and I would ask unanimous consent that the  scheduled vote begin immediately.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
