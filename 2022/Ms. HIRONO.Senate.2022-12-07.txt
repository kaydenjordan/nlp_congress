 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the  Coral Sustainability Through Innovation Act of 2022. This no-cost bill  allows the head of any Federal Agency with a representative serving on  the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to award competitive prizes for the  purpose of stimulating innovation to advance the ability of the United  States to understand, research, or monitor coral reef ecosystems or to  develop management or adaptation options to preserve, sustain, and  restore coral reef ecosystems.   Federal Agencies with a representative serving on the U.S. Coral Reef  Task Force include the Department of Commerce, DOC; the Department of  the Interior, DOI; the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA; the  U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID; the U.S. Department  of Agriculture, USDA; the Department of Defense, DOD; the U.S. Coast  Guard, USCG; the U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ; the U.S. Department  of State, DOS; the U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT; the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; the National Aeronautic Space  Administration, NASA; and the National Science Foundation, NSF. In  addition to Federal Agencies, other members of the U.S. Coral Reef Task  Force include the States of Hawaii and Florida, the territories of  Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealths of  Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Federated  [[Page S7036]]  States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the  Republic of Palau.   Corals serve myriad ecosystem functions, which include serving as a  source of food, a place for recreation and tourism, a source for  coastal protection, and an important part of local cultural practices,  to name a few. A number of studies have been conducted to place a  monetary value on the importance of coral reef ecosystems in Hawaii. A  U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, study published in 2019 estimated the  flood protection value of coral reefs in Hawaii alone at $836 million  annually. When accounting for all U.S. coral reefs, so those in the  waters of Hawaii, Florida, Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,  the same study estimated the flood protection value to increase to $1.8  billion. Another study published by the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, in 2011 estimated the total economic  value of Hawaii coral reefs to the American people to be $33.57  billion. There is no doubt the importance of corals to our Nation.   Unfortunately, there are currently a number of variables that are  threatening the health of our Nation's coral reefs. These variables  include climate change-driven warming of ocean temperatures and ocean  acidification, unsustainable fishing, and pollution. As a result of  global bleaching events and disease outbreaks corals are projected to  decline significantly over the coming decades.   In an effort to mitigate the impacts of declining coral health, this  no-cost bill prioritizes programs that address communities,  environments, or industries that are in distress due to the decline or  degradation of coral reef ecosystems. Allowing Federal Agencies on the  U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to enter into private-public partnerships  via prize competitions, as this bill does, will allow for the  advancement of innovative research that will advance our Nation's  ability to preserve, sustain, and restore coral reef ecosystems.   Time is running out to ensure that coral reef ecosystems remain the  vibrant habitats that so many aspects of our society's functioning have  come to rely upon. Innovative solutions at no extra cost to the  American people, such as those supported by this bill, are desperately  needed to reverse the damage that our Nation's coral reef ecosystems  have experienced over the past decades to ensure that they will be  around to benefit Americans in the coming decades.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Young):   S. 5202. A bill to amend the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act  and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to strengthen adult  education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
