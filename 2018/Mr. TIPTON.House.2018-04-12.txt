 Mr. Speaker, the regulatory relief bill that passed the  Senate just a few short weeks ago was crafted to get past the 60-vote  cloture threshold. Our Senate colleagues are now asking the House to  pass that deal without amendment because they don't have an interest in  voting on the measure again.   That is not the legislative process envisioned by the Framers of the  Constitution and demonstrates a disregard for the policy work of the  people's House.   The House Financial Services Committee has worked tirelessly to pass  bipartisan bills that will provide necessary regulatory relief to Main  Street America.   Chairman Hensarling has identified 15 commonsense bills that passed  out of the Financial Services Committee with broad bipartisan support  and have the support of the ranking member. Yet some in the Senate  continue to insist that any amendment to legislation is inadmissible.   While I support the goal of providing much-needed relief to our  community banks and credit unions, I believe we should take a more  thoughtful and inclusive approach that considers the will of the people  as represented in this body.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the leadership in the House, as  well as Chairman Hensarling, for fighting for the bipartisan policy  initiatives of the Members of this Chamber in the regulatory relief  process.                            ____________________
