 Madam Speaker, well, it has been one year since President  Biden and the Democrats have had complete control of running our  country.                                time  1445    They have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency.   And what have they accomplished in this 1 year?   Inflation has gone through the roof--a 40-year high. Gas prices are  up. Grocery prices are up. The utilities costs have gone up. The border  is wide-open with sex trafficking, human trafficking, and fentanyl  flooding across our border.   COVID deaths are higher than they have ever been before.   Madam Speaker, do you know those long lines that you see of Americans  waiting in line for COVID tests?   Well, guess what, Madam Speaker?   The Biden administration diverted over $2 billion that was meant for  those testing of COVID and for medical supplies and diverted it to  house illegal immigrants.   Don't be surprised or mistaken, but it is the Democrat policies that  have caused these problems.   And what are the Democrats doing now while the country is going down  the tubes?   They are pushing election laws, election laws where they want to rig  elections to their favor and fund their own elections. This is  insanity.   I hope my Democratic colleagues will work together with us to solve  the problems that are facing Americans today.
