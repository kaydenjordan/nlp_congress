 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I am here to speak in support of the Elijah E. Cummings  Lower Drug Costs Now Act, and, in particular, I want to speak in  support of my bill which is included in the act, the Enhancing  Retirement Security for Medicare Beneficiaries Act, which would  guarantee that the disbursements of retirement savings are not counted  when determining if someone qualifies for Medicare part D's low-income  subsidy program.  [[Page H10136]]    As a young girl, I learned the importance of saving money. My first  job was running a paper route in my neighborhood in Canton, Ohio, at  the age of 8. At the end of every week, I would put aside a quarter or  two just to save up for a candy bar. It wasn't much, but it taught me  the importance that saving money is worth it.   Americans and our seniors should not be punished for saving for their  retirement, but when retirement savings are counted towards eligibility  for prescription drug assistance, we are punishing the very seniors who  have been working hard and saving money.   The fact is that no group of Nevadans relies more on prescription  drugs than our seniors, and the rising cost of living is hard enough on  older Americans. We should be making it easier for them to retire in  dignity, and that means not forcing them to choose between buying  groceries or lifesaving medication.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that my bill was included in the  underlying text of H.R. 3, and it is time that we lower prescription  drug costs not just for seniors on Medicare, but for all Americans.
