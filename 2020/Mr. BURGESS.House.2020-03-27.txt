 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the recognition.   Our country is in a war crisis unlike anything that has been seen for  over 100 years, but there are heroes. We know our first responders. We  know our doctors and nurses on the front lines, in our intensive care  units. We know what heroes they are. But, Mr. Speaker, not all heroes  wear capes.   I have a furniture manufacturer in my district, Barbara Caldwell, who  called me last weekend and said she wanted to transition her furniture  manufacturing to manufacture personal protective equipment, and she is  doing so.   I had an aircraft manufacturer that said they wanted to manufacture  ventilators, and they are changing their clean room and hiring the  engineers so that they can do that.   We do have heroes in this country. They don't always wear capes.   I also want to recognize the hard work done by the staff on the  Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee--J.P. Paluskiewicz,  Kristen Shatynski, Kristin Seum, Caleb Graff; and then on my staff,  Elizabeth Allen, Casey Patchunka, Rachel Huggins, and my chief of  staff, James Decker--who are all over in the office right now making  certain that this goes smoothly.
