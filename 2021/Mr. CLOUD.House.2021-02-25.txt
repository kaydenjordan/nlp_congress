 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a pillar of the  Victoria, Texas, community, Mrs. Verlinn Sandra Avery, who passed away  on January 30, 2021.   Resilient and devoted to caring for others, Mrs. Avery demonstrated  her passion for serving her community through her work as a child  nutrition specialist for Victoria ISD, and her leadership of Victoria's  Old Landmark Committee, which she founded.   She organized Juneteenth celebrations, multicultural ``Taste of  Soul'' events, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day festivities, and much more.   The impact she had on her community is evident in the Victoria  newspapers, which were often filled with coverage of her events and  letters to the editor thanking her for her service to the community,  and now includes tributes to her memory.   Mrs. Avery is sorely missed and will be rightfully remembered as a  community leader for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for taking this  moment to speak on this. I cannot imagine a more important topic for us  right now in this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, we are unique in history in that our Nation rests on the  understanding that our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness are not a grant from the government; they are a  gift from Almighty God. And among these enshrined in our First  Amendment is the freedom of speech, which is the most essential  freedom, along with the freedom of religion.   The peace and tranquility of our entire Republic is based on the  understanding that we have a right to have our voice heard and that we  have a right to have peaceful public discourse and dissent. That is how  we come up with good legislation. That is how to have good policy. That  is how we avoid conflict and wars on our soil.   But we have entered a most troubling time in our Nation. This cancel  culture has persisted, and it needs to stop. The unilateral march of  legislation meant not to protect our liberties, but, rather, force the  American people to conform to woke ideology in this House needs to  stop.   Then there is big tech that canceled conservatives while allowing for  liberal Members of this body to repeatedly call for unrest in our  streets and raise money to bail out violent rioters, not to mention  providing a platform for Communist China terrorist groups and the like.  This hypocrisy is not overlooked.   Recently traveling throughout my district the last couple weeks, I  came across a few immigrants in my community. I know them. They came up  to me concerned about what we are in at this point in our Nation.  Some of us who are so privileged to be born in this country where we  have inherited these wonderful liberties might not see the signs so  readily as people who have come from Ecuador, Cuba, and Iran. But these  individuals came up to me because they are very concerned. They are  concerned that they left this and now they are seeing it be rooted and  established here in our Nation.    Ironically, the one from Iran was concerned because she was talking  to me and she had liked a post about our taking out of Soleimani and  she got banned from Instagram following that. She knows firsthand what  is going on in Iran. She is a first-generation immigrant. I was  troubled, especially when she looked at me and said: We have more  freedom of speech in Iran at this moment--this is her opinion--than we  do right here right now. No one is trying to cancel people, you can  speak freely against the government there.   Now, I am not saying Iran is a wonderful place to live. I am thankful  to be here in the United States of America, but we are heading down a  troubling path.   I remember being at an event just a couple days ago. It was before  the election. Some lady was there, and she was talking to me about her  motivation for being involved in the public discourse. She came up to  me and said: I am from Ecuador. I remember escaping.   Her parents did not make it out, but she made it out. She didn't call  it ``to the United States of America.'' She called it ``to freedom  country.''   She said: We cannot lose freedom country. I am here to support this,  I am here to work, and I am here to do whatever I can because we cannot  lose freedom country.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to stand up along with our colleagues because  we cannot lose freedom country. It is extremely and essentially  important that  [[Page H705]]  we in this House and people across the United States of America stand  up in this hour at this time.   Ronald Reagan once said--and I have said this before to many people,  encouraging them how important it is to get involved in the process and  also to thank our veterans--``Freedom is never more than one generation  away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the  bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them  to do the same.''   I thought about that quote. There is another part of it that has  resonated with me even more and more in this time, and it is: ``Or one  day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our  children's children what it was once like in the United States where  men were free.''   God forbid that we continue down this path and reach that point where  we have to tell our kids and grandkids about what it was once like to  live in the beloved United States where men were free.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for setting aside this Special  Order. I cannot imagine a more important topic.    I certainly do.    Sure. You know my family, you know my wife. I have had  those comments put on me that I somehow don't like Brown people and  that I am somehow racist. They fail sometimes to look at my family  photo. My wife is an immigrant. I didn't marry her because she was an  immigrant. I married because I loved her. I met her when she was 15. I  was 17 at the time. We had a long-distance relationship. I met her back  before Al Gore invented the internet.   Mr. Speaker, I can tell you what an honor it was for her to stand  there in the U.S. courthouse, raise her hand and take the Pledge of  Allegiance for the first time and become a citizen of this great  country.   So we understand that there is a proper way to do immigration. We  want a big, beautiful gate to this country. But to say that we need to  secure our communities and keep out the cartel activity, I serve on the  Interparliamentary Group between the U.S. and Mexico, so I have had the  opportunity to talk with our colleagues in Mexico. I talk to them about  how arrogant of a notion it is for us to assume that the way we heal  the world's ills is to bring everybody to the United States. That  notion is uniquely American arrogant.   We want people to prosper everywhere. And what we know from our  unique history is that if you embrace the principles this Nation was  founded upon, you can have the same sort of prosperity. You can have  your people prosper everywhere.    When I said that thought, we got resounding applause from them  because they understand that our wanting to secure their borders, we  want their communities to thrive, we want our communities along the  border to be protected, and we want migrants not to be persecuted and  abused along the way.
