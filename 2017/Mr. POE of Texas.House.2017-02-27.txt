 Mr. Speaker, President Trump has signed an  executive order to revive the Canadian Keystone XL pipeline. If  Keystone does not go through, it is not as if Americans will stop  buying oil to meet our energy needs. No, we will just buy it from  somewhere else. That includes countries like Saudi Arabia or corrupt  Venezuela.   It seems to me that we would rather see a stable country and neighbor  like Canada get this contract than Venezuela or Middle Eastern  countries.   Keystone is also good for the United States. Keystone XL pipeline  will bring thousands of jobs to my home State of Texas. This is where  the pipeline ends at the refineries in southeast Texas.   At peak capacity, the pipeline is expected to deliver 830,000 barrels  a day to the Gulf Coast. That is as much fuel as we get from Saudi  Arabia. At peak capacity, this will be better for the United States and  energy independence.   TransCanada has reapplied for this permit, and the State Department  needs to approve it. Pipelines are the most economical and  environmentally safe way to move fuel, and it is time we make this  happen.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
