 Mr. President, I join in the minority leader's remarks  and his plan for moving forward, which is a bipartisan plan and a plea  for our colleagues to work together.   America is not like some countries where people are all of the same  ethnic background or practice the same religion. America is an idea.  America is an ideal. America is something that is grounded in our  democracy.   Way back centuries ago, our Founding Fathers were concerned about  foreign influence on our democracy. They were concerned at the time  about Great Britain. Well, now we have another concern, and that  concern is Russia. It is not just the Democrats' concern. As one of our  colleagues, Senator Rubio, has noted in the past, maybe this election  was an attack on one political candidate in one party, but next time it  will be the other party. That is why we must join together and handle  this correctly and in the spirit of our democracy and our Constitution.   I have known Director Comey for a long time. We were classmates at  the University of Chicago Law School. He was well liked in our class,  and he earned the respect of the agents he supervised and the law  enforcement he worked with. I made it clear to him that I didn't agree  with how he handled the email investigation regarding Secretary  Clinton, but nevertheless this man is a hard worker and someone of  integrity. Just because someone doesn't agree with how an investigation  is handled, even if it is in a big way, doesn't mean this person should  be fired.   FBI Directors have 10-year terms for a reason; that is because we  want them to be independent from political influence.   All Americans, including those who have criticized Director Comey for  whatever reason in the past, should be very troubled by the timing of  this firing.   Let's look at the past week. We started the week on Monday, when  Former Director Clapper testified in great detail about the Russian  threat to our democracy and the fact that the Russians feel empowered  and that he believes they will do it again and again. We also were on  the heels of the French cyber attack, where their elections were  attacked and where Russia was trying to get involved in their  elections.   Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified, and she made  very clear that she had not just given a heads-up to the administration  that their National Security Advisor was compromised by the Russians-- no. She had two formal meetings over at the White House. She outlined  in detail how she had gone over to the White House and voiced her  concerns.   When I asked both Former Director Clapper and former Acting Attorney  General Yates whether this was material for blackmail--when you have a  high-ranking official saying one thing on a tape recording that the  Russians knew he had said and then another to the Vice President of the  United States--if that was material for blackmail, they said yes,  definitively yes, that he had been compromised.   Yet, as it became clear, the White House then allowed the National  Security Advisor, General Flynn, to stay on for 18 days, including  being part of an hour-long conversation between the President of the  United States and Vladimir Putin. So that is what happened on Monday.   We know what was going to happen tomorrow, Thursday, which is that  Director Comey was going to testify in his capacity as the FBI Director  in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We know questions were  going to be asked about Russia. Of course, I commend Senators Burr and  Warner for inviting him again next week in his capacity now as a  private citizen.   Yet, when you look at what has happened here--the Yates and Clapper  testimony on Monday, the Comey testimony expected on Thursday--what is  sandwiched in between? It is the firing of the FBI Director. By the  way, this is the same FBI Director who had the audacity to tell the  truth before Congress when he was asked whether President Obama had  wiretapped the Trump Tower, as alleged by President Trump in a tweet at  6 in the morning. The FBI Director truthfully answered, no, that it did  not happen. That is also something that has happened in the past month.   Today we learned that just days before he was fired, Mr. Comey asked  senior officials at the Justice Department for more resources in order  to carry out the Russia investigation.   Now, what are my colleagues saying about this? I think it is very  important to note that the two Senators who are privy to the most  classified information--Senator McCain, as chair of the Armed Services  Committee, and Senator Burr, as chair of the Intelligence Committee-- have both expressed serious concerns about what has happened.   Senator McCain said he was disappointed, and Senator Burr, the  Republican chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said:         I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director       Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a       public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal       further confuses an already difficult investigation by the       Committee.    Senator Flake said:         I have spent the last several hours trying to find an       acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just       can't do it.    The reasoning the White House is using for Director Comey's firing is  bizarre, and that is why I believe Senator Burr said that his dismissal  further confuses an already difficult investigation.   The memo provided by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein cites old  justifications. These are quotes from letters that I remember from the  Presidential campaign, and they are used in the letter as a  justification.   If the administration found Director Comey's conduct during the  election to be so problematic, why now--right, smack in the middle of  the advancements of this Russia investigation?   The answer, I believe, is that the justification that is provided in  the memo is a pretext. The fact that President Trump's termination  letter to Director Comey strangely discusses the fact that Director  Comey informed the President that he was not under investigation in the  context of the Russia investigation sheds light on what this is really  about; that Director Comey was seeking the truth.   Senator Burr said that Director Comey has been more forthcoming with  information than any FBI Director he can recall in his tenure on the  congressional intelligence committees. In firing Comey, President Trump  has cast doubt about the independence and viability of any further  investigation into the foreign interference of our democracy.   Why was Attorney General Sessions, who had recused himself from the  investigation on Russian interference, able to influence the firing of  the man at the helm of the Russia investigation?   That is one of the questions we want answered and why, by the way, we  believe it is important to have a closed-door briefing with the Deputy  Attorney General and his predecessor.   Did Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein act on his own or at the  direction of Attorney General Sessions or the White House?   Are reports that the President had been searching for a rationale to  fire the FBI Director for more than a week true?   Was his firing influenced by any recent developments in the  investigation, like the issuance of grand jury  [[Page S2869]]  subpoenas or Director Comey's recent request for more resources for the  Russia investigation?   Why didn't the President wait for the inspector general's  investigation into Director Comey's handling of the Clinton email  investigation to conclude before making his decision to fire him?   I am a former prosecutor. I believe in facts, and I believe in  evidence. These decisions should not have been made without these facts  and without this evidence and while in the middle of a major  investigation of Russian influence in our election. Answers to these  questions are essential in getting to the truth and in ensuring that an  independent investigation at the FBI can continue.   For months, U.S. intelligence agencies--17 of them--have said that  Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to  try and undermine our democracy. Reports show it. The facts prove it.  When former Director of National Intelligence Clapper testified, he  said Russia will continue to interfere in our election system.   This is what he said exactly:         I believe [Russia is] now emboldened to continue such       activities in the future, both here and around the world, and       to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a       clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the       very foundation of our democratic political system, this       episode is it.    I was in that hearing and asked questions of Clapper when he said  this: ``Vigilance.'' That is what he said--vigilance.   How can we call it vigilance, when the FBI Director, who is  conducting the investigation, has been fired? What message does that  send to Russia? Does that make them think we are serious about this  investigation; that we want to get to the bottom of it and that we do  not want it to happen again? No. It sends the opposite message.   Aides and surrogates of the Trump administration, during the campaign  and the transition, were in contact with officials from a foreign  government that was actively working to tear our democracy apart. We  need to know why and when and how. In the first question, that is what  I really want to know--the ``why.''   This week, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, as I  mentioned, and Director Clapper reminded us that on the very day  President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its unprecedented  attacks on our democracy, a member of the Trump transition team spoke  to a senior Russian official regarding those sanctions. Michael Flynn,  the National Security Advisor--the person charged with the most  sensitive matters of U.S. national security--was not truthful with the  Vice President. He lied to the Vice President about contact with  Russian officials. In turn, the American people were misled.   After the Department of Justice warned the administration that the  National Security Advisor had lied and may be vulnerable to blackmail  by the Russian Government, what did the administration do? It continued  to allow General Flynn to handle top secret information for 18 more  days. They let him participate in an hour-long phone call between  President Trump and Vladimir Putin. In fact, decisive action was not  taken until the Washington Post revealed what was happening.   We have now seen two people resign--Trump's campaign manager and his  National Security Advisor. The one thing they have in common is Russia  and the President. We have also seen three people fired--Sally Yates,  the Acting Attorney General of the United States, who was simply doing  her job; Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in New York City; and Jim  Comey, the FBI Director. The one thing they have in common is that they  were all investigating links, and they were doing their jobs.   Think about that. Let that sink in. The independent government  officials who were or could have been charged with getting to the  truth, no matter where it led, were fired.   We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of what is  going on here. It is our job to get to the bottom of this because the  President of the United States--President Trump--cannot fire Congress.  We need to know the full extent of the Trump campaign's contact with  the Russian Government during the campaign and transition, including  what was said and what was done and who knew about it.   That is why, on January 4, I stood with Senator Cardin and with Adam  Schiff and Elijah Cummings, of the House of Representatives, and called  for an independent commission. Now, this is different than the special  prosecutor whom we need to handle the criminal investigation. This is  also different than the good work that is being done by the Senate  Intelligence Committee under the leadership of Senators Burr and  Warner.   To me, an independent commission would help us because it could get  to the bottom of what has happened, with the intent of making sure it  does not happen again, in order to protect our democracy. It could have  recommendations, just like the 9/11 Commission had, on how we could  improve our laws. It could have recommendations on what we could do if  the media gets hold of information that is the result of a cyber attack  from a foreign government. It could have recommendations of what  political parties and campaigns could do--perhaps even in agreement-- when they get access to information that is a result of a cyber attack  against the opposite party.   It was not that long ago when campaigns would come upon debate  information and other things and would simply put it in an envelope and  send it back to the other side. We can do this, but that is not going  to come out of some simple piece of legislation or from the work that  the Intelligence Committee is doing.   That is why I believe we need this independent commission as well as  a special prosecutor to look into all contacts between Trump aides and  surrogates and Russian officials during the campaign, transition, and  administration. This prosecutor must be fair and impartial and  completely unattached to either political party.   In addition to the independent commission, we also need our  congressional committees, as I mentioned, to continue to exercise their  oversight authority.   Since the election, we have heard a lot about the three branches of  government and our system of checks and balances. One of Congress's  fundamental jobs, as I told a group of students in my office today, is  to closely oversee the executive branch in order to ensure that the law  is being properly followed and enforced. This shouldn't just be things  that students learn from their Senators when they come in during school  trips or be what they learn from a textbook. This is actually our job.   This means that in addition to this independent, 9/11-style  Commission, we must make sure our congressional committees continue to  investigate Russian interference in our political system. We have  subpoena power. We need to use it.   Some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand the  importance of doing our jobs in order to get to the bottom of this. As  I mentioned, we have the Intelligence Committee investigation, but we  also have the Judiciary subcommittee, on which I serve, led by Senators  Graham and Whitehouse. They are the ones who held the hearing with  Sally Yates and Director Clapper this week.   This is an unprecedented time in our country's history. We are  witnessing a singular moment of constitutional and democratic unease.  In recent months, foundational elements of our democracy, including the  rule of law, have been questioned, challenged, and even undermined.   Several of my colleagues have compared the President's action to  President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox,  who was investigating Watergate. Even then, Mr. Cox was replaced by a  new special prosecutor. Today, we have no special prosecutor to  determine whether the President's campaign colluded with a hostile  foreign power. Some in Congress are continuing to resist any serious  investigation. For that reason, our democracy may be in even greater  peril. The night he was fired, Mr. Cox defended his decision to conduct  the Watergate investigation as he saw fit rather than to yield to the  President's order that he limit his request for tape recordings.   Cox said: ``Whether ours shall continue to be a government of laws  and not of men is now for Congress and, ultimately, the American  people.''  [[Page S2870]]    He is right. The American people deserve a thorough, independent  investigation into the extent of Russia's interference in the 2016  Presidential election.   This is not a partisan issue. Americans deserve answers now. And  where should they get those answers? They should get those answers from  this Chamber, because we, as Members of the Senate, cannot be fired.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Texas.
