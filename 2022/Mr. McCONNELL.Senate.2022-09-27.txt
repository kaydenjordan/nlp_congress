 Mr. President, last night, our Democratic colleagues  released a draft short-term government funding deal. Big parts of the  draft are unobjectionable because they were negotiated across party  lines. Both sides of the aisle want to prevent a government shutdown  that no one wants. Both sides want to keep resources flowing to  disaster-stricken communities. Both sides want to continue time- sensitive support for Ukraine.   But, unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues decided to put in  extraneous partisan language--in fact, a poison pill. This extraneous  poison pill is not related to keeping the government open. It was not  negotiated across the aisle. In fact, both the Democratic chairman of  the Appropriations Committee, Senator Leahy, and the Republican vice  chairman, Senator Shelby, have stated publicly that this poison pill  should not be in the underlying bill. The poison pill is a phony  attempt to address the important topic of permitting reform.   It is much too difficult to build things in America and unleash  American energy. Liberal regulations and redtape are a huge--huge--part  of the problem. That is why Republicans are  [[Page S5038]]  the leaders on this issue. That is why my colleague Senator Capito has  introduced a strong, robust package that would actually move the ball  forward.   What our Democratic colleagues have produced is a phony figleaf that  would actually set back the cause of real permitting reform. This is an  issue where it should be very easy to improve upon the status quo, but,  amazingly, our Democratic colleagues have managed to write language  that would actually--listen to this--make things even worse.   Senator Manchin's bill goes out of its way to avoid actually amending  the National Environmental Policy Act or any other environmental law.  It layers new bureaucracy on top of existing bureaucracy. Its new  requirements and deadlines are paper tigers with no enforcement.   The few parts of this legislation that would actually change the  status quo would take things from bad to worse. For example, yesterday,  a long list of State attorneys general wrote the Senate a panicked  letter explaining that Senator Manchin's language would ``eviscerate  states' ability to chart their own land-use and energy policies.''   ``Eviscerate states' ability to chart their own land-use and energy  policies.''   Among other problems, they explain how this legislation creates a  backdoor to sneak through an electricity grid takeover much like the  Obama administration's unconstitutional so-called ``Clean Power Plan.''   These State-level officials are also sounding the alarm about higher  costs for their citizens. They write the Manchin proposal could impose  ``potentially back-breaking costs on residents who may see no true  energy benefit whatsoever.''   Democrats' policies already have electricity costs skyrocketing at  the fastest rate in more than 40 years. The last thing that struggling  families need are more Democratic policies that raise utility bills  even higher still.   This phony figleaf is ``permitting reform'' in name only. It was  written to drain the political will for actual reform without creating  any meaningful change that liberal special interests might actually  dislike.   If tepid Democratic support for this phony figleaf is all that our  colleague from West Virginia got in return for approving yet another  taxing-and-spending spree during an inflation crisis, it is hard to  imagine a worse bargain for a Senator or for the country.   So, if the Senate votes today on proceeding to a bill that has this  partisan poison pill jammed into it, I will be voting no, and I would  urge all my colleagues to vote no as well.    This all-Democratic government has a smooth and obvious path on  government funding. The path is obvious. Drop the extraneous, partisan  language and let the bipartisan CR move forward.                             Electoral Count Act    Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this afternoon,  those of us on the Rules Committee will mark up a bipartisan package of  updates through the Electoral Count Act of 1887. I strongly support the  modest changes that our colleagues in the working group have fleshed  out after literally months of detailed discussions. I will proudly  support the legislation, provided that nothing more than technical  changes are made to its current form.   I particularly want to thank Senator Collins and Senators Capito,  Murkowski, Portman, Romney, Sasse, Tillis, and Young for their intense  work with Democratic colleagues to get this right.   Congress's process for counting the Presidential electors' votes was  written 135 years ago. The chaos that came to a head on January 6 of  last year certainly underscored the need for an update, so did  Januaries 2001, 2005, and 2017; in each of which, Democrats tried to  challenge the lawful election of a Republican President. Obviously, in  every case, our system of government won out. The Electoral Count Act  ultimately produced the right conclusion: certainty, finality, and the  transfer of power to the winning candidate. But it is clear the country  needs a more predictable path to that outcome.   This bipartisan bill does not rashly replace current law with  something untested. It keeps what has worked well and modestly updates  what has not.   The bill's sponsors debated every provision and found bipartisan  consensus. Bad ideas were left on the cutting room floor. The resulting  product--this bill, as introduced--is the only chance to get an outcome  and to actually make law.   Here is what the legislation does.   It raises the threshold for objecting to the electoral count-- preserving options if something incredibly unlikely were to happen but  ensuring claims with hardly any support can't paralyze the process. It  makes the already plain fact of the 12th Amendment even clearer: that  the Vice President has never had, and will never have, discretionary  powers over the counting.   It protects States' primacy in appointing their electors but ensures  they publicize rules actually before the election. It rejects unwise  challenges like creating new causes of action that would leave every  election up to the courts and create uncertainty. It makes modest  technical updates to other pertinent laws such as the Presidential  Transitions Act.   And Senator Collins' bill does all of those modest but important  things without capitulating to our Democratic colleagues' obsession  with a sweeping Federal takeover of all of our election law.   So I look forward to supporting the legislation as introduced in  committee.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, after 29 years as Warren County judge- executive, Mike Buchanon is retiring at the end of his current term  this January, leaving behind an impressive legacy of public service. He  has overseen explosive growth in his county over the past three  decades, developed Bowling Green into a center for art and recreation,  and left an enduring mark on the residents, businesses, and new  initiatives he championed. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Judge Buchanon on his well-deserved retirement and thanking  him for his contributions to Kentucky.   I have been proud to call Judge Buchanon both a close colleague and a  personal friend during his three-decade tenure on the job, working with  him to promote job growth, workforce training, and development in South  Central Kentucky. As a former judge-executive, I know both the  difficulties and rewards of his position intimately. Judge Buchanon  shares the passion I felt for my constituents during my time as  Jefferson County judge-executive. After all, they are not just your  voters; they are also your neighbors, family, and friends. Every  achievement on the job brings real, tangible change to the community  you call your home.   Judge Buchanon built his reputation for diligent leadership in the  face of intense crises. From almost the moment he started the job, a  major snowstorm battered Warren County, forcing Judge Buchanon to  declare an emergency and call in the National Guard. Toward the end of  his career, he faced similar disasters, first with the onset of the  COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and then with last winter's devastating  tornado outbreak. In each of these emergencies, he worked long days and  nights to ensure the security and safety of his constituents, deftly  handling communication with my office and other Federal authorities to  ensure Warren County received the assistance it required.   When not dealing with crisis situations, Judge Buchanon dedicated his  time to helping Warren County grow. That growth came from a multitude  of directions: the addition of tens of thousands of new residents  during his tenure, the arrival of major new businesses, and the  cultivation of one of Kentucky's finest art scenes and public  recreation systems, to name just a few. He fostered this development by  maintaining a consistent pro-job, pro-business mentality, persistently  pitching Warren County to private sector investors as a premier  location for expansion opportunities.   His tenure has left a physical mark on the surface of Bowling Green.  From the Kentucky Transpark industrial park, which is now home to 2  dozen companies employing some 3,000 people, to Bowling Green's  downtown revitalization, anchored by the Southern Kentucky Performing  Arts Center, to the county's large and growing public park system, his  touch is apparent all across Warren County. Judge Buchanon is a  builder, understanding long ago that, for Bowling Green to achieve the  success it has found today, its leaders needed to invest in projects  that would be attractive to the residents of the future.   Judge Buchanon has achieved success in part because of his dogged  efforts, but also in part because his long tenure enabled him to plan  and actualize projects over an extended timeframe. That would not have  been possible were it not for the support he has seen among voters,  time and time again, since his first election three decades ago. He has  cultivated a close relationship with his constituents, earning their  trust and votes seven consecutive times, a rare feat for elected  officials. No doubt, they are sad to see their foremost champion depart  after so many years of success, even as he plans to stay closely  involved in Warren County government.   But Judge Buchanon has undeniably earned his retirement. His wife  Ellen, two sons, Michael and Roy, grandchildren, and great- grandchildren have stood by his side during his long public service  career, offering support and understanding when he had to work long  nights on behalf of his community. Now, he looks forward to having  ``time to go to my grandkids' ball games and travel some with my  family.'' He certainly deserves the respite.   I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Judge Buchanon for his  decades of service to his constituents and the entire Commonwealth of  Kentucky. Warren County's future is bright because of his dedicated  work. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Judge Buchanon  on his retirement and wishing him the best as he moves on to the next  chapter of his life.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in his 8 years as Carter County judge- executive, Mike Malone has battled Mother Nature, invited new  development to his community, and tried to bring neighbors on all sides  of the political aisle together around their shared values. It hasn't  always been easy, but with dogged determination, Judge Malone has left  Carter County a safer, more beautiful, more united  [[Page S5047]]  place than he found it. Judge Malone is retiring at the end of his  current term this January, and I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring this first-rate public servant for his contributions to  Kentucky.   Judge Malone didn't start off his career in government. Rather, he  spent four decades in the private sector, building his businesses in  Carter County. He developed a keen understanding of the role of public  officials and the ways they could either help--or harm--business  growth. Realizing he could put that knowledge to work on behalf of his  family, neighbors, and friends, he threw his hat into the ring and  filed to run for judge-executive. As he says, ``The rest is history.''   Promoting businesses and jobs was always at the top of Judge Malone's  to-do list from his first days in office. But he was also forced to  deal with some of the more unexpected duties of his role. Those started  early on when, during Judge Malone's first year in office, ice storms  and flooding crippled Carter County's infrastructure. Just 2 years ago,  a winter storm hit the county again. Judge Malone worked around the  clock to reconnect his constituents to accessible roadways and the  power grid. He led an effort that removed thousands of cubic yards of  debris and helped repair millions of dollars in damage to public  utilities.   Following this most recent storm, I visited Judge Malone in Carter  County to discuss his community's recovery and help direct Federal aid  to the region. As a former judge-executive, I know the importance of  Judge Malone's work, from the financial assistance he helped residents  access, to the moral support he offered storm victims. I was impressed  by his leadership and his ability to unite community members from all  sides of the political spectrum around the common cause of helping  their neighbors. As he says, ``it's not Democrat or Republican. It's  `what's the problem and how do we fix it?' ''   Judge Malone has stood by his constituents' side in good times and  bad, twice earning their trust and votes in his election to be judge- executive. At the end of this term, though, he is taking a step back  from the political arena, opting to spend more time with his family and  enjoy his hobbies after decades of hard work. I thank Judge Malone for  his service to Carter County and the Commonwealth and wish him the best  in the next stage of his life.   Mr. President, the Daily Independent paid tribute to Judge Malone's  career in a recent article. I ask unanimous consent the article be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From the Daily Independent, Sep. 15, 2022]                  Malone Moving on From Carter Judge-Exec.         After eight years of serving as Carter County Judge-      Executive, Mike Malone is off the ballot. Opting for a       simpler life of retirement filled with fishing and his       grandchildren, Malone said, ``I did the best I could do, I'm       glad I did it, but I don't want to do it again.''        Before his current gig, Malone started out as a funeral       director and later decided to work alongside his brother at       his research business. Malone said he did compliance and       purchasing, and his experience in business adds up to about       40 years.        ``I filed to run for judge and the rest is history,''       Malone laughed.        It hasn't been an easy job for Malone by any means.        In just his first year as judge-executive, the county was       slammed by Mother Nature with crippling ice storms and       resulting flooding, leaving behind utter destruction and an       overwhelmed Malone.        ``It was hard to step into,'' he said. He had the business       background, which helped, but Malone doesn't believe anyone       is truly prepared for the responsibility the position holds.        Malone explained that the seat requires one to deal with a       ``duty dumping ground.''        ``If it doesn't fit anywhere else, it goes on the county       judge,'' he added.        Malone mentioned he was surprised to have to deal with some       of the issues he's run across as judge-executive.        ``Animal control, solid waste issues and the scope of       making sure your 911 system is functioning because people die       if it doesn't,'' he said.        When asked his favorite accomplishment, Malone stated he       brought civility back to Carter County saying, ``You gotta       work with what you've got.''        Malone said he'll miss the people he's worked with the most       and extended his gratitude to the fiscal court, magistrates,       sheriff, clerk and attorney.        ``I'm lucky to have such great people,'' Malone said.        Despite polarizing beliefs, Malone said party never played       a role.        ``We don't always agree, but there's never been a fight or       a fuss between them,'' he said. `` . . . It's not Democrat or       Republican, it's what's the problem and how do we fix it?''        In 2020, a late winter ice storm smacked the area, knocking       Carter County down for two to three weeks and causing Malone       and his team to struggle under the weight of the aid required       after such events.        Malone said during that time frame the citizens of the       county went without power, electricity and accessible       roadways.        Malone said 159,000 cubic yards of tree debris were removed       and $10 million worth of damage was done to county roads and       infrastructure.        ``Everybody stepped up,'' Malone said, referring to office       workers that headed out with chainsaws to cut timber and       deliver water.        ``It was our most trying time,'' Malone said, ``but my       office really shined.''        Malone recalled lighter memories, remembering a time he got       a call that a roadway had been blocked preventing a bus from       passing through. When Malone inquired about what was blocking       the roadway, he said a grand piano had been abandoned in the       middle of the road.        ``These sorts of things always came out of the blue,'' he       laughed.        Malone also recalled working with the late Judge Henry       Wilhoit to bring the veterans park to the lot across from the       justice center in Grayson.        A three-way battle will take place to fill Malone's seat--      Democrat Dustin Howard or Republican Brandon Burton or       Independent Duane Suttles.        ``We have good men that are honest that are running to       replace me,'' Malone said, ``They're capable of doing a great       job. Whichever gets it, I'll do what I can to create a smooth       transition.''        Malone said that although he's retiring, he wants to see       Carter County succeed and will do what he can to help it even       after he steps away from the political arena.        But for now, Malone looks forward to fishing as he said he       hasn't had much time to do it in the last eight years.
