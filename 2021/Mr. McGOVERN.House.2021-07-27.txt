 Madam Speaker, by the direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 555 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 555         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4502) making       appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human       Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal       year ending September 30, 2022, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 117-12, modified by the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective       designees; (2) the further amendments described in section 2       of this resolution; (3) the amendments en bloc described in       section 3 of this resolution; and (4) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  After debate pursuant to the first section of this       resolution, each further amendment printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules not earlier considered as       part of amendments en bloc pursuant to section 3 of this       resolution shall be considered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn       by the proponent at any time before the question is put       thereon, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time after debate       pursuant to the first section of this resolution for the       chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her designee to  [[Page H3921]]       offer amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution not earlier disposed of.       Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to this section shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for 30 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective       designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not       be subject to a demand for division of the question.        Sec. 4.  All points of order against the further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules or       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution       are waived.        Sec. 5.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 508, agreed to June       30, 2021), is amended by striking "July 30, 2021" each place       it appears and inserting (in each instance) "September 22,       2021".        Sec. 6. (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Friday, July 30, 2021, the Speaker may entertain motions       offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the House       suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV with       respect to multiple measures described in subsection (b), and       the Chair shall put the question on any such motion without       debate or intervening motion.        (b) A measure referred to in subsection (a) includes any       measure that was the object of a motion to suspend the rules       on the legislative day of July 26, 2021, or July 27, 2021, in       the form as so offered, on which the yeas and nays were       ordered and further proceedings postponed pursuant to clause       8 of rule XX.        (c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.        Sec. 7.  Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule XX, further       proceedings on a vote by the yeas and nays on the question of       adoption of a motion that the House suspend the rules offered       on the legislative day of July 26, 2021, or July 27, 2021,       may continue to be postponed through the legislative day of       September 22, 2021.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 555. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 4502, the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, Agriculture, Rural Development, Energy and Water  Development, Financial Services and General Government, Interior,  Environment, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation,  and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2022, under a  structured rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations or their designees. The rule self-executes a manager's  amendment from Chairwoman DeLauro, makes in order 229 amendments,  provides en bloc authority for the chairwoman or her designee, and  provides one motion to recommit.   The rule provides the majority leader, or his designee, the ability  through July 30 to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension  bills considered on July 26 or 27.   The rule also provides that requested roll call votes on suspension  bills considered on July 26 or 27 may be postponed through September  22, 2021.   Finally, the rule amends H. Res. 188 to provide recess instructions,  suspension authority, and same day authority through September 22,  2021.   Madam Speaker, if you care about protecting our seniors and taking  care of our veterans and military families; if you care about fighting  climate change and combating gun violence; if you care about closing  health disparities and creating good paying jobs; and if you care about  our economy not only rebounding from the COVID pandemic, but being  strengthened for years to come, then the underlying measure is a  lifeline. Because these seven appropriations measures provide landmark  funding to deal with our Nation's most pressing issues.   It turns the page on an era where the prior administration demanded  disinvestment in seemingly everything that helped all but the  wealthiest of the wealthy. And now we are working with the Biden  administration to stand up for our workers and to rebuild the middle  class.   It is no secret that the appropriations process can seem a little  arcane. But this measure is truly historic, Madam Speaker.   I want to make two points here in particular. First is what is not in  here. Finally, after more than 40 years, the Hyde amendment is nowhere  to be found. And let me say, it is about damn time. Because however we  feel about abortion, we should not deny health coverage just because  someone is working to make ends meet.   More than half of the women affected by the Hyde amendment are women  of color. Nearly one-third are Black, 27 percent are Latina, and one- fifth are Asian American and Pacific Islanders, as well as indigenous  women also covered by Medicaid.   That is what inequality looks like, Madam Speaker, and I am proud  that we are confronting it. The decision about whether to get an  abortion is a deeply personal one. We don't know the circumstances. But  I do know this: we should not defer to the politicians and special  interest groups who want to impose their values on others. We should  trust women and families to make their own decisions about what is best  for them.   It is about justice. It is about freedom. And it is about respecting  women's personal autonomy.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Appropriations Committee Chairwoman  Rosa DeLauro for leading the way on this, and I want to recognize the  many Congresswomen, in particular, who have waged a sometimes lonely  battle year after year after year to make this day a reality.   Second, Madam Speaker, I want to recognize language that is included  here, which will help combat hunger across America. This measure  expands access to healthy foods like fruits and vegetables to more than  6 million people through the WIC program. It ensures that more than 40  million people in SNAP-eligible families get benefits that they  desperately need. And it also makes key investments in child nutrition  programs, like school meals. This is incredibly important since we all  saw the COVID crisis lay bare the truth about hunger in America.   The lines outside our food banks included some of the most affluent  cars from the wealthiest neighborhoods, because no one is immune from  food insecurity.                                time  1230    It is an epidemic in every State and every congressional district in  this country. Even before the COVID pandemic hit, there were more than  35 million people who were going hungry in this country, including 10  million children.   The United States is the richest country on the face of the Earth.  That anybody--anybody--goes without food is unconscionable, Madam  Speaker.   I have often said that we have everything we need to end hunger in  America. We have the food, the know-how, and, yes, the money. The only  thing we lack is the political will. Hunger is a political condition.   I think that is finally beginning to change, Madam Speaker.   For the last several months, the Rules Committee has acted as a kind  of select committee on hunger, holding hearings, roundtables, and site  visits, all to develop a road map to eradicate hunger in this country  by 2030, as the United Nations has called for.   I am more convinced than ever that, with a holistic approach and the  full weight of the Federal Government, a hunger-free America is within  our grasp.   This rule makes in order my bipartisan amendment to provide $2.5  million for a White House conference on food, nutrition, hunger, and  health. The conference will bring together the heads of food banks,  hospitals, government agencies, educators, farmers, the faith-based  community, people with lived experiences, our business community,  anybody who has anything to do  [[Page H3922]]  with finding a solution, not to hold an event that is essentially a  press release, but to develop a real plan to tackle this, something  with benchmarks that better connects the dots between all the different  Federal programs and expands successful local and State initiatives.   The first and only time such a conference was held was the same year  we put a man on the Moon, over 52 years ago. It developed and  strengthened many programs we still rely on, like SNAP, WIC, and the  National School Lunch Program.   A hunger conference for the 21st century can finish what was started  so many decades ago by Senators George McGovern, Senator Bob Dole, and  others.   Senator Dole wrote to Ranking Member Cole and me recently, saying:  ``I remain proud of the work Senator McGovern and I did then, and I  endorse your effort to secure a second White House conference to  identify the next frontier of programs to finally end hunger in  America.''   I believe we can do big things, and I hope that we can do them in a  bipartisan way.   Madam Speaker, we can combat hunger; we can confront climate change;  we can stand up for women's reproductive rights; and we can take care  of the most vulnerable among us. This bill is proof of that.   I urge all of my colleagues to join with us in supporting this rule  and the underlying measure so that we can build a more just and  equitable future for every single American.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Morelle), I want to point out, for the record, the last time  we had a government shutdown was when we had a Republican Congress and  a Republican President, so I am not so much worried about that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a July 14 Media  Matters article entitled, ``FOX News' Obsession with Critical Race  Theory, by the Numbers.''                    [From Media Matters, July 14, 2021]       Fox News' Obsession With Critical Race Theory, by the Numbers                               (By Lis Power)         Update (7/14/21): Following the publication of this study,       Media Matters continued to track mentions of ``critical race       theory'' on Fox News. In June, there were 901 mentions on the       network, the highest number of any month and an increase from       537 mentions in May. In the past 3\1/2\ months there have       been over 1,900 mentions of critical race theory on the       network.                                Original Study         Critical race theory, to those who can actually define it,       is an academic and legal framework that examines the impact       of systemic racism on American society. For conservatives       however, it's the latest boogeyman they can use to scare       people into thinking America's children are being       ``indoctrinated'' by ``woke'' leftist teachers. And while       that is not even remotely the case, this idea is exploding on       Fox News and in Republican-run state legislatures, leading to       legislative bans in many states and skyrocketing mentions of       critical race theory on the network.        As Media Matters has previously noted, Fox News' current       obsession with ``critical race theory'' has been a year in       making. What once was a slow trickle of monthly mentions has       developed into a full blown assault. Since February, month       over month mentions of the theory have more than doubled on       Fox News as the network has begun to spin an illusion of what       it is and where it's being taught (in reality, critical race       theory is not generally taught in K-12). Coverage of the       theory sharply increased in March, with 107 mentions on the       network according to data from Kinetiq media monitoring       service. The following month, network figures and guests       mentioned it 226 times, and by May, the number had increased       to 537 mentions. Not even halfway through June, there's       already been 408 mentions on the network.        Just last week, Fox mentioned ``critical race theory'' a       record 244 times--an increase from the previous record high       of 170 mentions the week before.        Fox has admitted its reason for this souped-up coverage:       the 2022 midterm elections. And in order to drum up outrage,       the network has repeatedly amplified a lie that critical race       theory teaches that one race is ``inherently superior to       another.'' More recently, in its continued efforts to       demonize it, Fox News has promoted a pamphlet that echoes the       white nationalist ``Great Replacement'' conspiracy theory.        Fox's obsession with what it defines as ``critical race       theory'' has frequently crossed the threshold into the absurd       and overly dramatic. Fox host Tucker Carlson called it ``a       cult,'' while host Will Cain said it is ``modern-day Jim       Crow.'' Fox contributor Miranda Devine claimed that teaching       the theory would ``warp the minds of American children'' and       ``is a recipe for social upheaval and mental illness.'' Fox's       Newt Gingrich said it was being driven by ``people who want       to brainwash your child.''        By labeling everything that has to do with race ``critical       race theory,'' Fox is attempting to shut down conversations       about race and racism--which is ironic given the network's       claims that it champions free speech. And even though many       conservatives who lambast it don't have a clue what the       theory actually is, their efforts are working as 21 states       are either introducing bans or have banned what they call       ``critical race theory.'' Many educators in those states have       argued that the bills and laws would essentially ``whitewash       history'' and have criticized legislators for making it       difficult to have necessary conversations about race.                                 Methodology         Media Matters searched transcripts in the Kinetiq video       database for all original programming on Fox News Channel for       the key phrase ``critical race theory'' from June 2020       through June 13, 2021. We counted each instance of the phrase       as a single mention.        Methodology update (7/14/21): Data now includes midnight       episodes of Fox News @ Night (which recently shifted its time       slot) and all new programming from June 14 through July 11,       2021.    Madam Speaker, apparently my Republican friends and  their allies in the media need a new scare tactic because they don't  want to talk about things like the economy or how we put people back to  work or how we crushed the virus. But we are not going to debate on  whether racism exists in America because it does.   We are not going to debate whether we should teach our kids racism is  wrong. We should.   We are not going to debate whether individual States and schools can  decide what their kids learn. They can.   And we sure as hell are not going to be lectured about racism by the  party that is trying to dismantle the Voting Rights Act that Martin  Luther King and John Lewis paid for with their blood.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on  Appropriations' Subcommittee on Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, think about what we are dealing with as we gather here  on the House floor. We have a pandemic that we are trying to crush, we  have a crumbling infrastructure, and what do my friends want to talk  about? A FOX News talking point.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a July 23 ABC News article  entitled: ``Martin Luther King, Jr., the KKK, and More May Soon Be Cut  from Texas Education Requirements.''                       [From ABC News, July 23, 2021]   Martin Luther King, Jr., the KKK, and More May Soon Be Cut From Texas                           Education Requirement                            (By Kiara Alfonseca)         Some lessons on the civil rights movement, white supremacy,       the women's suffrage movement and Martin Luther King Jr. may       soon be cut from Texas' public education requirements,       according to legislation being considered in the state--one       of several bills targeting critical race theory around the       country.        The Texas Senate has passed Senate Bill 3 in a continued       effort to proscribe education on racial inequality in K-12       education. It removes several Texas Education Code lesson       requirements that were proposed by Democrats in prior       education legislation to be implemented in the upcoming       school year. It also stipulates that lessons cannot teach       that ``one race or sex is inherently superior to another race       or sex'' or make students ``feel discomfort, guilt, [or]       anguish'' about privilege or systemic racism.        The concept critical race theory, an academic discipline       that analyzes how racism is perpetuated in U.S. laws and       policies, has become a lightning rod for conservatives around       the country amid the racial reckoning spurred by George       Floyd's death.        At least 26 other states have introduced or implemented       similar legislation on race education by Republican       lawmakers, echoing concerns about racial division.        Opponents say that children should not be made to feel       responsible for past injustices based solely on the color of       their skin or be forced to accept the idea that the United       States and its institutions are not only structured racially       but perpetuate that racism.        Some teachers interviewed by ABC News have said critical       race theory isn't being taught in grades K-12 and instead is       reserved for academic institutions. Some Texas educators told       ABC they believe the fight against ``critical race theory''       is a veiled attempt to turn back the clock on racial       equality.        The new legislation, SB3, would remove several staples of       U.S. history education from state requirements, according to       Ovidia Molina, the president of the Texas State Teachers       Association.        The state currently requires teaching ``the history of       white supremacy,'' ``the institution of slavery, the eugenics       movement, and the Ku Klux Klan, and the ways in which it is       morally wrong; the Chicano movement; women's suffrage and       equal rights; the civil rights movement'' and more.        However, SB3 would cut those requirements--a move that some       teachers say signals a growing effort to remove specific       lessons from classrooms.        ``Specifically editing out that you can't teach that white       supremacy is morally wrong--that is deeply concerning,'' said       Jennifer Lee, a teacher in Killeen, Texas. ``I think the       angle here is just . . . preserving the ideals behind white       supremacy.''        Though the new legislation doesn't necessarily ban these       lessons from being taught, removing them from the list of       requirements means they may come under scrutiny due to the       vague, anticritical race theory language of this bill.        Gov. Greg Abbott already signed anti-critical race theory       into law in June with HB3979--stating that teachers are       banned from linking systemic racism to the ``authentic       founding principles of the United States.'' But teachers and       advocates say it is so vague that it could infringe on their       ability to have truthful dialogue about history and racism       with their students.        SB3 was added to the state legislature's special session       after Abbott signed HB3979 into law, saying said ``more must       be done'' on critical race theory in schools.        And SB3 has been called troubling by education groups       including the National Education Association for its       potential to censor teachers and students in the classroom.                   `Provide guardrails' against `animosity'         Defenders of the bill, including Republican state Sen.       Bryan Hughes who sponsored the bill, say that some lessons on       racial inequality blame white students for systemic racism       and creates tension between students of different       backgrounds.        ``This bill is meant only to provide guardrails against       imposing division and animosity on our students,'' Hughes       said before the July 16 Senate vote. ``Since [critical race       theory] is so prevalent in higher education and since we see       it popping up in public schools, that's why it needs to be       addressed.''        Other proponents of anti-critical race theory bills, such       as Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, have said that some lessons on       race could lead to the ``indoctrination'' of public school       students toward progressive political leanings.        Ovidia Molina, the president of the Texas State Teachers       Association, said that students have so much to gain from       education about America's racial history, including those       that would be erased by this new legislation.        ``We want to keep honesty in education,'' Molina said. ``We       want to make sure that we teach our students the truth, the       whole truth, the good, the bad, the failures, the       successes.''        Molina said teachers have spoken up at hearings and called       their local legislators to denounce the new legislation--but       said lawmakers are not listening.        ``They don't know what's happening in our public schools,''       Molina said. ``We still want to celebrate women's suffrage,       we still want to celebrate the Chicano movement, we still       want to celebrate people of color, so that our students see       themselves in the history and so they see themselves in the       future.''        The Texas Education Agency did not immediately respond to       requests for comment.        Molina said that Texas districts have yet to announce what       punishment for teaching these subjects might look like for       teachers.                Concerning shift toward `patriotic' education         Some teachers told ABC they are worried about retaliation,       termination, or other forms of punishment. But others are       more concerned about what this shift toward more       ``patriotic'' education means for their students.        ``One of the first things Hitler did was start to reform       education and impact the way that history is taught. One of       the first things Mussolini did was go through and incorporate       patriotic education,'' Lee said. ``Education has always been       that first line of defense in preserving a certain way of       thinking.''        Former President Donald Trump, among several other       conservatives, have become proponents of ``patriotic''       education in response to critical race theory and The New       York Times' 1619 project--which dissects the founding of the       United States of America and its legacy of slavery. Trump's       proposed ``1776 commission'' aims to envision U.S. history in       a positive light, instead of through a condemnatory, racial       lens.        A school bus is seen outside Condit Elementary School in       Bellaire, Texas, on Dec. 16, 2020. San Antonio teacher       Christopher Green said he believes that lessons on race,       inequality and oppression are vital to helping children       navigate the world and understand our society.        ``Rather than adding a more diverse perspective to the       teaching of history, it's eliminating things that really need       to be in there to understand the full picture of the American       story,'' Green said.        The bill will now be headed to the state House, but it will       likely be stalled due to protests from Texas Democratic       representatives. They have fled the state in protest of new       voting restrictions, meaning there won't be enough members to       conduct business according to House rules.    Madam Speaker, many of my Republican colleagues think  they can interfere with everything from what our teachers teach in  school to what happens between women and their doctors.   This is from the party who pretends to be the party of local  government.  [[Page H3926]]  One of my colleagues on the Republican side in an interview yesterday  said that we should have cameras in the classroom to monitor what  teachers do every single minute. So the party that claims to be the  party of liberty and the party of local government wants to be the  party of super-big government and control everybody's life.   Give me a break. Let me close with that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say that I think that it will be a lot easier for us to  be able to accommodate the gentleman if he could control members of his  own party from trying to disrupt and derail everything that we try to  do here.   Suspension votes, which are really pretty noncontroversial, that  usually pass overwhelmingly, we have had to impose a new rule to be  able to consider them in order to be able to overcome their objection  to every single one of them. And now they are even objecting to that;  bipartisan bills, Republican bills.   Unfortunately, there is a concerted effort on behalf of some in the  minority to try to stop all of the people's business, and we are going  to move forward and get the people's business done. That is what we are  doing here today, and we will continue to do that.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we can talk about polls. I have a poll here that just  recently came out that shows the exact opposite of that.   But rather than talk about polls, we should be talking about values,  and a majority of Americans believe that women should not be denied  reproductive healthcare because they can't afford it. They believe that  people should not be denied healthcare because, you know, they are  working hard to try to make ends meet.   So, I mean, here's a poll that just came out that shows the exact  opposite of that, an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that  Medicaid should, in fact, cover women's reproductive healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin  (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am very proud of this process. The shameful process  was when my friend's party was in control of the House and the White  House, and they shut the government down. That is what people don't  want to see happen ever again.   By the way, I mean, these bills do things like tackle hunger, they  lift up our rural communities, they rebuild health and safety  infrastructure, they invest incredibly important dollars in the  National Institutes of Health and medical research to try to find cures  for everything from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's disease, to get a better  handle on how we can deal with future pandemics. It creates and  sustains good-paying jobs, it grows opportunities through education. It  advances equal treatment for women.    There are so many important, good things in here that, by the way, I  think are bipartisan everywhere in the country but in this Chamber, and  so this is what the American people want. This is what they voted for.  I am proud of the Appropriations Committee, Chairwoman DeLauro, and all  of those who put the American people front and center on our agenda.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   People always ask: Why don't you work together? How do you work with  that? To come down here and to lecture us about deficits or about  budgets, give me a break.    When the gentleman's party was in power, when they controlled the  House, the Senate, and the White House, they gave us a $2 trillion debt  because of a tax cut that went to wealthy people, to big corporations.   When they controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House, they  shut the government down. They couldn't even agree amongst themselves.  It was the first time in history that we ended a Congress with a  government shutdown.   When they lost power, they gave Democrats a government that was shut  down. We had to clean up the mess, and we continue to do that.   In all of the years of disinvestment when they were in charge with  Donald Trump, we are now trying to put the people first. That is what  this is about.   I am proud of this bill. I am proud of the investments in medical  research, in our families, in our children, in our senior citizens, and  in our veterans. That is what this is all about. These bills are being  brought to the floor.   I hate to tell the gentleman that is what we are doing; they are  coming to the floor. He can vote ``no'' on them and go home and explain  to his constituents why he voted against their interests, but that is  what we are doing. And I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, earlier I referred to when one of my  Republican colleagues came to the floor and had a meltdown. I  commented: How do you work with that? Coming to the floor and yelling  and screaming and scolding and distorting and trying to find the worst  possible version of everything, that never accomplishes anything. It  never does.   Madam Speaker, I would never characterize my colleague from Oklahoma  that way. When we get to a final product, he will be part of the  solution because he respects this institution, and he understands the  importance of give and take. We have some very strong disagreements in  the Rules Committee but I never question his integrity, and he never  questions my integrity or anybody else's on the committee. I wish there  were more people like him, quite frankly, in this Chamber.                                time  1330    Madam Speaker, to hear some of my friends on the other side today,  you would think that the sky is falling.   What is so controversial about trusting women to make their own  healthcare decisions, free from politicians and special interest groups  trying to control them?   What is so controversial about confronting climate change, or making  America the world's clean energy superpower?   Or helping our farmers in our rural communities?   Or making sure our veterans have the support and the care that they  have earned when they return home?   Apparently, since Democrats proposed it, this minibus is a bridge too  far for some. But I have to tell you, to most Americans, what is  included here is just common sense.   I am proud that we are doing our work and keeping our government  funded, and doing so in a way that respects women's autonomy and builds  a more just and equitable future.   Madam Speaker, too many of these issues can't wait another day,  another year, another decade for us to act, so I urge all of my  colleagues to support this rule and this minibus so that we can meet  the scale of the challenges that we face today and put the building  blocks in place to grow our economy for years to come. That is what  these bills are all about.   Someone earlier described them as bills filled with hope and love.  They are. This is about putting our families first. This is about  respecting our kids, understanding that our children are 100 percent of  our future. This is about understanding that we have a climate crisis,  and we have to do something about it. This is about respecting equity  and justice and things that, quite frankly, should be shared values.   Madam Speaker, I know that there are some disagreements here. We will  all get through this, work it out, and get to a conclusion, but the  final product will be much, much better because of what we are doing on  this House floor today.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and  the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:  [[Page H3930]]                          Amendment to House Resolution 555         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 4698) to prevent the use of Federal funds to       advance discriminatory concepts, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4698.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
