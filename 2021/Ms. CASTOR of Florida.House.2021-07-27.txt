 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Castor amendment.   America's public schools, colleges, and universities are the engines  of economic opportunity, and our funding package provides historic  investments in students and schools at a time when they need it,  especially in Florida where the Governor and legislature are  intentionally undercutting our public school students and local  control.   Florida, the third largest State in the country, ranks 45th in per  pupil funding, and it diverts an enormous amount of public money to  for-profit charter schools that are not accountable and often fail to  provide the full range of educational services required by law like  those for special needs and disabled students.   When my local school board in Hillsborough County recently questioned  the quality of education provided by certain for-profit charters, the  State Commissioner of Education threatened to withhold money from  students and schools--the fifth largest district in the entire country.   Many for-profit charter corporations need oversight by the U.S.  Department of Education especially in Florida where they skirt civil  rights laws and they weaken our traditional public schools.   So I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for the  oversight measures included in this bill that will help ensure that  every child has an opportunity to learn and succeed, especially the  students in Florida who deserve better.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of my amendment.
