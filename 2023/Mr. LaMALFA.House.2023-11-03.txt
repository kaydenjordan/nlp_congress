 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to point out that, once again,  our water situation in California is extremely important to the whole  country for our food supply.   Like these products you see here, many, many crops that are grown in  California supply 90 to 99 percent of what Americans will consume;  otherwise, they would be imported.   Why is that important? Because if our water supply in California  isn't allowed to go to agriculture, instead more and more environmental  water, more and more water just allowed to flow down the streams  without being captured in water storage, we don't get these crops, we  don't have an economy, and the land turns into something much less  productive.   What we need is to continue to focus on saving water in California  and allowing it to flow to agriculture, more water storage projects,  and updating the 1960s-1970s manuals that guide how government saves  water.   Yes, we had an amazing amount of water last year, but still two of  our large reservoirs only reached 50 percent and 80 percent full, even  with all that. Water management is extremely important when we manage  it for people.                            ____________________
