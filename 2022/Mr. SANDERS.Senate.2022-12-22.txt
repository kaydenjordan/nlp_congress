 Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable  sections of that act and any other applicable budget points of order  for purposes of the pending message, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   But before that, let me be very clear. If we do not waive this budget  point of order raised by Senator Paul, it will kill the entire  appropriations bill that we are debating, not just this section dealing  with sequestration. In other words, if we do not waive this budget  point of order, the government will shut down just before Christmas-- not a particularly nice Christmas gift to give to the American people.   This bill--this omnibus bill--is not the bill that I would have  written, not the bill that anybody else here would have written, but it  includes a 30-percent increase in the Child Care and Development Block  Grant Program, nearly $1 billion more for Head Start, doubles funding  for community schools to $150 million, and does many other important  things.   I would urge my colleagues to waive this point of order, and I ask  for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to Senator  Paul's amendment.   This amendment would require 67 Senators to waive a budget point of  order instead of 60. In other words, if this amendment were passed, a  tiny minority of U.S. Senators could prevent action on a national  healthcare crisis, an economic crisis, or a natural disaster. That  would put the people of this country, in my view, in a very dangerous  position.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Paul amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6561
