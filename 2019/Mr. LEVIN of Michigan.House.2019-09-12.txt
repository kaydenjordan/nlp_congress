 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, the  gentleman from California, for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in strong support of this bill as  someone who has had the privilege of spending 2 weeks in the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge 15 years ago. It was a life-changing trip.   ANWR's beauty and majesty are almost beyond description. Paddling  down the Kongakut River and along the shore of the Beaufort Sea, my  companions and I experienced an astounding wealth of plants and animals  in a mix unique to the region, a truly iconic corner of our Earth.   Anyone who says it is an empty place or that there is nothing there  is committing a sacrilege as far as I am concerned. It is a sacred  place to me, and it is no wonder that it is a sacred place to the  Gwich'in people.   The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the United States.  Drilling in ANWR would exacerbate that regional effect as well as  hastening catastrophic warming, generally.   In short, we must prevent this administration's reckless effort to  open up ANWR to oil and gas development to prevent dangerous  biological, cultural, and climate impacts. We simply cannot allow this  to happen on our watch.   I would point out that, when I paddled down the Kongakut River, I  visited these places that are planned for drilling. We were literally  hiking along the plain and we came upon these drill pads. It would be  outrageous to drill in these places where there are nesting grounds for  birds and homes to other animals that just don't exist anywhere else.   I invite any of my colleagues who have the ability to travel on their  own power paddling and hiking to join me in going back to ANWR. I don't  think they would want to drill there if they did.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Huffman for his leadership on this,  and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
