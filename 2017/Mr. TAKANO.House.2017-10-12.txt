 Madam Speaker, Delila is a graduate student at the  University of California, Riverside, who exemplifies the American  spirit. As a young woman, she worked two and three jobs to support her  family and help her father, who was their sole provider.   Three years ago, when her father suffered a stroke, Delila stepped up  and kept the family afloat while he recovered. She went on to take a  full-time position as a sexual assault advocate in our community.  Delila says that job allowed her to help those who live in fear and  live without hope.   This year, she will graduate with a master's degree, and there is no  question that she is destined to accomplish great things. The only  question is where she will accomplish them.   Delila is a DREAMer, and her future in this country depends on  whether we pass the Dream Act. Once again, I am asking my colleagues to  do the right thing. Pass the Dream Act so people like Delila can  continue to make our communities proud.                            ____________________
