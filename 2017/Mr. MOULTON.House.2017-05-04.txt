 Mr. Speaker, there is only one reason this bill is on  the floor today: the President cares more about cutting a deal than  keeping his promises.   He promised we would lower costs. That turned out to be a lie. He  promised we would expand coverage. That turned out to be a lie. He  promised we would protect millions of Americans with preexisting  conditions. That, too, was a lie.   Back in Massachusetts at the Agawam Diner, I met a veteran named  Clif, who told me when I was on my way to Washington for the first time  to go to Washington as an American--not as a Democrat or a Republican,  but as an American.   To my Republican colleagues, heed Clif's advice today. Don't vote as  a Republican. Vote as an American. Don't throw away your credibility to  give a legislative victory to a President who will never stick his neck  out for anyone other than himself. For what? To betray the people who  trusted them?   I urge my Republican colleagues to put country before party. Vote  ``no'' on this ridiculous bill.
