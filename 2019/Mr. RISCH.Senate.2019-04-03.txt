 Mr. President, my colleagues Senator Mike Crapo and  Representative Mike Simpson join me today in recognizing the 100th  anniversary of Jerome County, ID.   Established February 8, 1919, by the Idaho Legislature, the county  was named for either Jerome Kuhn, son of William S. Kuhn, or Jerome  Hill, who was commissioned by Kuhn to find a suitable town site north  of the Snake River Canyon. With the city of Jerome as the county seat,  the small farming communities of Eden and Hazelton also make up the  eastern portion of Jerome County.   One of the early pioneers of Jerome County, I.B. Perrine, was looking  for a place to winter his cattle, and Charles Walgamott showed him a  spot with beautiful clear blue lakes bubbling up from an underground  aquifer. Mr.  [[Page S2231]]  Perrine settled this area and called it the Blue Lakes Ranch. These  blue lakes continue to provide water for irrigation, raising rainbow  trout, and pristine drinking water to the residents of this area. It  also features the beautiful Blues Lakes Country Club with one of the  most scenic 18-hole golf courses in the State.   Although not officially recognized, local historians have documented  the Hudson Bay Trail as an alternate route of the Oregon Trail, which  goes through Jerome County. The traders of the Hudson Bay Company  seemed to have preferred the trail going north of the Snake River  Canyon to make their way to Fort Boise in the West and Fort Hall in the  East.   With water, Mr. Perrine saw the magic this area produced and, with  the help of Eastern United States Financiers, created the Milner Dam  along the Snake River. The Milner Dam and subsequent irrigation system  opened the Southern Snake River Plain to farmers, ranchers, and new  communities. As a result, the communities of Jerome, Eden, Hazelton,  and Greenwood were established between 1905 and 1911.   In 1919, the Idaho Legislature took the south portion of Lincoln  County and the western portion of Minidoka County to carve out Jerome  County. As one of the youngest counties in Idaho, it is the 43rd  county, out of 44, in the 43rd State.   A notorious part of Jerome County is the Minidoka Relocation Center  north of Eden; it is one of the 10 Japanese internment camps created by  the U.S. Government during World War II. Currently, it stands as the  Minidoka National Historic Site as a memorial of the sacrifice and  suffering of the Japanese-Americans during this period of our history.   Today, Jerome County boasts a thriving economy lead by the dairy  industry, producing more than 100 million pounds of cheese, whey  protein, and other dairy products. They also produce the agricultural  commodities of alfalfa hay, silage corn, barley, winter wheat, sugar  beets, potatoes, beans, and spring wheat.   Senator Crapo, Representative Simpson, and I are proud to recognize  this landmark anniversary. We congratulate Jerome County residents on  this centennial, and we wish its communities many more years of  success.                            ____________________
