 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 900 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 900         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform       and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the       Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for       other purposes. No further amendment to the committee       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order       except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. Each such further amendment may       be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such  [[Page H4151]]       further amendments are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment pursuant to this       resolution the Committee shall rise and report the bill to       the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any       Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any       amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill       or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 900, providing for further  consideration of a very important piece of legislation for America's  farmers and ranchers: H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act,  commonly referred to as the farm bill. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 2 under a structured rule, allowing for  consideration of 31 amendments that were offered.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I traveled to every county in my  district for one reason: to listen, to hear, and to get the input and  the concerns from farmers, ranchers and producers across central  Washington State. I traveled to Pateros, where my constituents  discussed the vital need for strengthening market access and opening  new sources for exporting across the globe.   I visited with farmers from East Wenatchee in Douglas County who  discussed the importance of commodity sourcing and stressed the need  for stronger education for the public about farming and where the food  that lands on our tables comes from.   I heard from constituents in Prosser and Benton and Yakima Counties  who stressed the importance of agricultural research from producers in  Quincy, who shared their personal stories of the impacts of crop  insurance on their livelihoods, and from farmers in Othello who raised  concerns regarding regulatory burdens on the agricultural community.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to say that this farm bill  makes great strides in addressing these challenges that face America's  farmers. The rule we bring before the House provides for further  consideration of the underlying legislation, H.R. 2, the Agriculture  and Nutrition Act, a bill that is critically important to my district  in central Washington and to rural districts just like it across the  country.   As a farmer myself and as a former State agricultural director, I  know how important these farm policies are when it comes to our  agricultural economy. This farm bill strengthens the farm safety net to  help America's farmers and ranchers compete.   After 5 years of depressed prices, and a 52 percent drop in farm  income, our farmers need us--they need Congress--to reauthorize these  important programs.   Mr. Speaker, while American farmers have faced these depressed prices  and severe drops in farm income, we, luckily, have a robust safety net  in place. Due to the previous 2014 farm bill, our agriculture community  was able to hold on and continue to provide American consumers with  food in our grocery stores, in our schools, and in our food banks.   It is incumbent upon us to ensure these policies continue. We must  pass this farm bill and ensure a steady food supply will be on the  shelves and in our markets for the years to come.   The underlying legislation includes the creation of a new  international market program, which I would argue is more important  today than ever before. Programs within it, including the Market Access  Program and the Foreign Market Development Program, are incredibly  important to producers seeking to maintain and expand their export  markets for U.S. agricultural products and commodities. The Market  Access Program, on its own, is a net positive program, which for every  $1 spent, $28 is returned to the American economy.   I know these critical trade and export resources are at the top of  the minds of American farmers and producers across the country, and we  must continue to ensure their availability and access for the  agricultural industry.   This bill also maintains and strengthens the Nation's nutrition  programs to assist those who struggle to put food on the table, while  providing critical training to help people attain the skills necessary  to gain good-paying jobs, financial self-sufficiency, and better  futures for themselves and their families. It supports the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, without any cuts in funding.  Instead, this bill adds further funding and empowers States with the  flexibility on how to best administer their respective programs.   The State of Washington has done innovative work in their  administration of SNAP through the BFET and the RISE programs to help  some of the most vulnerable populations, and I am pleased that this  farm bill will allow these programs to continue if the State so  chooses.   This legislation contains employment and education provisions for  those who need a hand up due to falling on hard times.   Mr. Speaker, the farm bill contains comprehensive approaches to farm  policy, nutrition, trade, conservation, crop insurance, regulatory  reform, rural development, animal health, specialty and organic crops,  and provisions to help beginning farmers and ranchers.   This rule provides for further consideration of amendments offered by  our colleagues in the House on a great variety of these issues. I look  forward to listening to the robust debate on potential provisions to  strengthen this legislation.   As this is the first farm bill I have had the opportunity to engage  in since being in Congress, I welcome input from my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle and from every perspective. We must continue to  bring forward solutions for America's farmers, ranchers, rural  communities, and families.   Mr. Speaker, this body, the people's House, is made up of many walks  of life. We have physicians. We have attorneys. We have ordained  ministers. We have engineers, school administrators, former State and  local government officials, scientists, and law enforcement officials.  Today, I am proud to come before you as a farmer. I am not the only  one.    There are maybe about 20 farmers, ranchers, and producers in the  House, in the people's House. Among us are an almond farmer from  central California, a blueberry farmer from the State of Maine, a  rancher from South Dakota, a cattleman from Kentucky, a rice farmer  from Minnesota, and, yes, a proud hops farmer from the Yakima Valley  from the State of Washington.   I am privileged to come before you in support of this rule and the  underlying legislation, H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act. I  humbly urge my colleagues to support the rule, support the bill, and  strengthen the future for America's farmers and all of those who depend  on them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Mr.  Conaway, and I have worked together on many issues, and I know that he  recognizes that the trade promotion programs that I referenced in my  opening remarks are vital to our agricultural economy.   For decades, USDA export development programs like MAP have helped  American farmers create, expand, and maintain access to foreign  markets. Throughout their history, this successful public-private  partnership has cultivated hundreds of billions of dollars in exports  and created millions of American jobs both in the agricultural sector  and in support industries, as well as the program brings a return to  the United States economy.   In the findings of the underlying bill, it states: ``United States  export development programs significantly increase demand for United  States agricultural products . . . generating a return of $28 in added  export revenue for each invested program dollar.''   Additionally: `` . . . our global competitors provide substantially  more public support for export promotion than is provided to United  States agricultural exporters.''    We are at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to the rest of the  world when it comes to agricultural trade.   Mr. Speaker, without these private contributions and the private  sector's resolve to support our export programs, it is very likely that  the U.S. would not be the net agricultural exporter of the highest  quality products that we are today. I think it is time that we look at  our export promotion programs and take a serious look if we want to  continue our exporting success.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced a bill to grow the investment in the MAP  and FMD programs and I also offered an amendment that would have made a  smaller investment in the MAP and FMD programs, and while we are not  considering those amendments today, I am grateful that Chairman Conaway  has agreed to come and engage in this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Conaway), the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.  [[Page H4153]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Conaway for his  commitment to continue working on this important issue, and I look  forward to working with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control  that time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Russell  amendment, which, if enacted, would have a detrimental impact on  producers across our Nation, including many of my wine, grape, and hops  producers, as well as the beer and wine industry, not only in my State,  but around the country.   This amendment proposes to eliminate wine, distilled spirits, beer,  and other alcohol products from the Value Added Producer Grant program  administered by the USDA.   These industries, in my State and, quite frankly, across the Nation,  are a growing segment of our farm economy, providing thousands of jobs.   It is also important to point out the growing significance of wine  and hops exports to their industries. Last year, my State exported $28  million of wine, representing about 5 percent of our total production.   In my home valley of the Yakima Valley in the State of Washington, we  account for 75 percent of the U.S. production of hops. With the  continued boom of microbreweries and the demand for hops, we must  ensure we have available markets.   Our wine grape growers and the wine industry continue to face  challenges in export markets, such as the recent tariffs placed on our  products by China.   We are in an environment with potential changes in international  trade, and farmers are looking for more export markets.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose any efforts to limit our  farmers' ability to find markets for their products.   Mr. Chair, I include these letters of support in the Record: one from  the Wine Institute, Wine America, Distilled Spirits Council, and the  Brewers Association; and one from the Specialty Crop Farm Bill  Alliance.                                                       May 17, 2018.      Re Oppose Russell Amendment to the Farm Bill.         Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the nearly 9,000       small, family owned wineries, 6,200 small and independent       breweries and approximately 1,700 distilleries spread across       rural America to urge you to vote against the Russell       Amendment to the Farm Bill.        This amendment would unfairly target a vibrant and growing       segment of U.S. agriculture by seeking to block small       wineries, breweries and distilleries from participating in       USDA's value-added agriculture marketing grants. Combined,       the American  [[Page H4202]]       wine, brewing and spirits industries have a direct economic       impact of $287 billion on the United States economy and       support more than 5 million jobs nationwide.        Wineries, distilleries and breweries in America represent       the very epitome of value-added agriculture, bringing quality       jobs and generating much needed tourism to farming       communities across the country. This amendment would make it       harder for these communities to benefit fully from this       opportunity.        We urge you to support these small businesses and their       communities buy opposing the Russell Amendment.            Sincerely,      Robert P. Koch,        President & CEO, Wine Institute.      James Trezise,        President, WineAmerica.      Robert D. Pease,        President & CEO, Brewers Association.      Mark Gorman,        SVP Government Relations, Distilled Spirits Council.                                   ____                                                            SCFBA,                                       Washington, DC, May 16, 2018.        Dear Members of the House of Representatives: The Specialty       Crop Farm Bill Alliance representing over 120 specialty crop       organizations across the United States appreciate Chairman       Conaway's efforts on H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition       Act that initiates the formal 2018 Farm Bill process and for       his diligent efforts to complete Committee action on the       measure and get it to the floor of the House. After a       thorough review of the H.R. 2, the Alliance is also pleased       to see that the Committee has retained many of the specialty       crop provisions that were included in the 2014 Farm Bill.       Included in the House version are provisions funding key       specialty crop priorities such as:        Specialty Crop Block Grants ($85 million/year);        Specialty Crop Research Initiative ($80 million/year);        Trade Programs including MAP ($200 million/year) and TASC       ($9 Million/year);        Pest and Disease Programs ($75 million/year) and National       Clean Plant Network ($5 million/year);        Food Insecurity and Nutrition Incentive Program (FINI)       (Increased to $285 million over five years).        These funding commitments demonstrate that the House       recognizes the value of these programs and their tremendous       importance to the specialty crop industry and the Alliance is       grateful for their inclusion in the House legislation. With       debate over the next several days on a series of amendments       to H.R. 2, we would like to draw your attention to several       amendments we interested in. In particular the Specialty Crop       Farm Bill Alliance opposes the following amendments:        Amendment 50 by Rep. Russell prohibits USDA value-added       grants for wine and other products;        Amendment 71 by Reps. Brat, Blumenauer, and Titus on       Checkoff Programs;        Amendment 93 by Rep McClintock on Crop Insurance;        Amendment 97 by Rep. Faso on Plant Pests;        Amendment 100 by Rep. Rogers on multivitamin purchases       through SNAP.        Finally, we look forward to continuing to work with       Chairman Conaway and Members of the House Agriculture       Committee on further policy objectives that we believe will       strengthen this bill and assist the specialty crop industry       to compete in a domestic and global market place. These       priorities are consistent with our requests since last year       and in previous Farm Bills which include enhancing nutrition       programs, continuing to support Specialty Crop Block Grant       programs, combatting invasive pest and diseases, support       trade programs, and research funding.        We look forward to the Farm Bill being considered on the       House floor this week and that you will strongly consider our       views on the amendments mentioned above.            Thank you,      John Keeling,        Executive Vice President & CEO, National Potato Council,       SCFBA Steering Committee Co-Chair.

Mr. Chair, we should not be singling out key  agricultural industries under programs like this. We should not be  picking winners and losers among our farmers.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose the Russell  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I believe I have the right to close, so I  would reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have one speaker. I yield the balance of  my time to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentlewoman  from Wyoming for yielding me time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of amendment No. 20 offered by my  friend Ms. Cheney, and I am a proud cosponsor, as well, of this  amendment.   This amendment would provide resources for ranchers that are facing  unforeseeable events, like natural disasters.   In my district, particularly in the northern counties of north- central Washington, where catastrophic wildfires are becoming far too  common an occurrence, ranchers can be forced off of their allotments  due to wildfires causing their land to be unsuitable for grazing. When  these ranchers are forced off of these allotments due to these external  factors, they have nowhere to take their livestock.   This amendment will provide a solution to this problem by allowing  these ranchers to take their livestock to vacant allotments in the  event they face one of these unfortunate but all too common  occurrences.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to urge my colleagues to support amendment  No. 20, and I thank my colleague Ms. Cheney for her leadership on this  issue.
