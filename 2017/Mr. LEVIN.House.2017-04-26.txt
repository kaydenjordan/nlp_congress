 Mr. Speaker, we are seeing President Trump attempt to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, both breaking his own promises and  making it worse for American families.   He promised to protect Americans with preexisting conditions, but any  State could allow insurers to raise premiums for Americans with  preexisting conditions and make their insurance too expensive to  afford. Any State could jeopardize access to mental health, emergency,  maternal, and prescription drug coverage. And any State could charge  older workers an age tax that would devastate middle class families.  [[Page H2860]]    The proposals will steal $1 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid in  exchange for giveaways to the very wealthy and corporations.   The President and Republicans are turning their backs both on their  own rhetoric and the real needs and lives of American families.                            ____________________
