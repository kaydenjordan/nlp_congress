 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past few months, tensions with  Iran have escalated. There have been a series of attacks on tankers in  the Gulf region, and this morning it was reported that Iran has shot  down a U.S. drone.   These events are deeply concerning--all the more so because the Trump  administration has not explained to Congress or to the American people  how it views these events, how it plans to respond, and, most  importantly, what the broader strategy for confronting Iran is.   President Trump left the diplomatic agreement a little more than a  year ago. It was obvious to anyone who even had a cursory knowledge of  Iran that it would create consequences. With that decision, there is a  course set for conflict--conflict whose purpose or strategy has never  been articulated to the American people.   The President says on TV: It is a much better Iran than when I took  office. Well, they were not building nuclear weapons--and I opposed the  Iran agreement, as you know. But they were not building nuclear  weapons. They were proceeding along the path of the agreement, and the  President, as he seems to, just gets a bug in his head, something he  said in the campaign without thinking, and then upends foreign policy-- another example of chaos in this administration. But he has done that.  He has done that.   So now the issue is what is our strategy to deal with the  consequences? The American people have to know this. We have seen too  many conflicts in the Middle East escalate into war--escalate into a  10-year war.   The American people are not for spending a fortune and, more  importantly, lives of Americans overseas. They want us to focus here at  home, but the kind of adventurism--almost unplanned, unthought out,  and, certainly, unexplained adventurism--of the President is the wrong  way to go and could lead to severe consequences. And, I must say, even  in closed-door briefings with Senators, the administration doesn't have  a strategy.   This is not how democracy is supposed to work. This is not how the  CEO of a major Nation or even a major company should behave, with no  articulated strategy. The President needs to explain to the American  people why he is driving us toward another endless conflict in the  Middle East.                                 Saudi Arabia    Madam President, on Saudi Arabia, another matter concerning the  administration's foreign policy, today the Senate will vote on  resolutions of disapproval for arms sales to the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia and the UAE.   These 22 resolutions introduced by Senator Menendez would block  billions of dollars in military sales, including the transfer of tens  of thousands of precision-guided munitions that the Saudis have  previously used to bomb innocent civilians in Yemen.   The timing of these votes is significant. Last night the United  Nations issued a report that documented evidence that the Saudis  meticulously planned the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and  ``forensically''--their words--disposed of the evidence.   According to the report, the Saudis referred to Mr. Khashoggi as a  sacrificial animal and that dismembering the body would be easy--how  gross, how cruel, how beyond words.   Are we going to blithely go along and let the Saudis continue? They  are an ally. Everyone knows that. That doesn't mean you let allies do  the most horrible things and just treat it as if nothing happened. But  in the wake of such monstrosity, the Trump administration is proposing  another round of billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia.   Well, we should at least have a debate about whether that is the  right course of action. Leader McConnell was on the floor saying: What  are the Democrats doing here? We are debating, Mr. Leader. You have one  view; I  [[Page S4134]]  may have another. But the American people are entitled to a debate on  this important issue, and that is what the law provides, and that is  the tool we use--one of the few tools we have to actually cause debate  in this Chamber, which the leader, with his legislative graveyard, has  assiduously avoided. With his reducing the amount of time that we can  talk about and vet nominees, he has assiduously avoided that, turning  this Chamber into a graveyard that the American people despise. But  here we have an opportunity to debate, and even here the leader seems  to be decrying that fact, in my view.   The administration is claiming emergency power and trying to  circumvent congressional review of these arms sales. That premise must  be rejected. It sets a dangerous precedent for congressional oversight  of future arms sales, and it can lead to renewed conflicts. We are also  discussing that, parenthetically, in relation to Iran. Should Congress  have some say there? You will hear more from me later on that.   The very least Congress can do is to debate the merits of sending  Saudi Arabia billions of dollars in military technology it may use not  to confront Iran but to perpetrate one of the largest humanitarian  catastrophes of its generation.   Saudi Arabia, even though it be an ally, must be held accountable for  its human rights abuses in Yemen and the grotesque murder of Jamal  Khashoggi.                                Harriet Tubman    Madam President, now, on the Tubman issue, more than 3 years ago  then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that he had ordered an  accelerated redesign of the $20 bill with a new design to feature  Harriet Tubman's portrait on the face of the bill. The design was set  to be released in 2020, the 100th anniversary of women getting the  right to vote--a fitting tribute to an extraordinary American and an  extraordinary New Yorker.   There are no women or people of color on our paper currency today,  even though they make up a significant majority of our population.  There haven't been for more than a century. The plan to put Harriet  Tubman on the $20 note was a long overdue way to recognize that  disparity and rectify it.   But shortly after the Trump administration took office, all mention  of the Tubman $20 bill was deleted from the Treasury Department's  website without any explanation. Then, Secretary Mnuchin testified that  a decision had been made to delay the release of the $20 note until  2028, and Treasury refused to confirm that Harriet Tubman's image would  ever appear on it.   The official word from the White House was that the delay was  required to accommodate anti-counterfeiting measures. But if you  believe that, I have a bridge that I can sell you. It is simply not  credible that with all the resources of the Treasury Department, a  decade or more would be required to produce a $20 bill.   A century ago, New Yorkers built the Empire State building in a  little over a year. We landed a man on the Moon in what seems to be  less time. Surely the 21st century Treasury Department can redesign a  bill in a reasonable period of time. The questions as to why the White  House, the Treasury, and maybe even the President delayed this are  looming and real, given the President's attitude toward women and  minorities.   I have asked the Department of Treasury inspector general to launch  an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Treasury's  decision. The official reasons given aren't credible. The whole thing  smacks of politics. President Trump has referred to efforts to replace  Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill as pure political correctness. To  recognize more than half the people in our society, to recognize more  than 25 percent of Americans who are people of color, all of whom have  worked so hard to strive for this great country--is that political  correctness? What is wrong with this President? What is wrong with this  President, and what instincts is he appealing to? What bad instincts is  he appealing to? It seems to be his practice, his way, his MO.   So among the questions the inspector general should examine is what  role President Trump played in this apparent effort to renege on  Treasury's 2016 commitment to honor Harriet Tubman.   Whatever the President's sentiments toward Jackson are, there is no  reason to reverse the original Treasury Department decision to  recognize Harriet Tubman's historic legacy on the $20 bill, which would  still feature our seventh President on the reverse side.   I hope the inspector general will get to the bottom of this, but in  the meantime, I hope President Trump himself is asked to answer for  these delays. It would truly be a sordid state of affairs if the  President or his team, for political reasons, interfered with and  infected the process for designing American currency.                              Background Checks    Madam President, now, finally, on background checks, in the early  hours on Monday, a heavily armed man approached the Federal building in  downtown Dallas and started shooting. This was a civilian walking into  the middle of an American city with military-grade weapons, a mask, and  body armor, and he was prepared to inflict the maximum level of damage  possible.   It is to the credit of the incredible first responders that this  accident did not result in the loss of innocent life, but it is  remarkable that events like this now seem all too routine, and so the  news cycle barely covers them before moving on.   Barely a week goes by without an incident like this somewhere in  America. We are the only Nation in the developed world where these  kinds of things--these horrible things--happen with regularity.  Virginia Beach, Highland Ranch, Poway, and Aurora, IL, are all examples  of shootings that have taken place this year alone.   Later today, I will join several of my colleagues from the House and  the Senate, including our former colleague, the great Gabby Giffords,  to urge Leader McConnell to bring background check legislation to the  floor of the Senate. It has been 114 days since the House passed the  measure, which more than 90 percent of Americans support, including  more than 80 percent of Republicans and the majority of gun owners. But  it seems that Leader McConnell has set aside another plot in his  legislative graveyard for this potentially lifesaving bill.    For too long, the gun lobby has reflexively opposed gun safety  reforms, even the most obvious and noncontroversial reforms, like  closing loopholes in background checks, and, for too long, the  Republican majority has marched in lockstep with them.   The American people demand we do these rational acts. The House has  passed it overwhelmingly with a bipartisan vote. Where are Republicans?  Are they still cowering before the NRA? I remind them, the NRA is a lot  weaker today than it was a few years ago. It is time to do the right  thing and stop being scared.   Let's move this bill to the floor. Let Leader McConnell finally let  us debate an issue long overdue.                              Election Security    Madam President, finally, as we continue to debate the NDAA, I urge  Leader McConnell once again to allow and support amendments to protect  our elections from future attacks.   Election security is a national security issue of the highest  urgency. There aren't two sides to this debate. No one can defend doing  nothing as the Russians, and maybe the Chinese, the Iranians, and the  North Koreans, mess with the wellspring of our democracy--our  elections.   As we have seen time and again from reports by the FBI, intelligence  agencies, and the Mueller report, our elections came under attack from  Russia in the last Presidential election. FBI Director Wray has warned  that they are coming for us again, and he thinks it could be worse than  in 2016.   Leader McConnell will not deny that this is true. So what are we  waiting for? We know the threat is there. We know we can take steps to  minimize it. So why won't Leader McConnell let us act?   We have several options for legislative action, many of them  bipartisan. People on both sides of the aisle--Democrats and  Republicans--care about this issue and have worked on legislation  together, something not done frequently enough around here, and Leader  McConnell just sits on these bills.   Last week, Senator Warner asked unanimous consent to simply say the  FBI should be informed when a foreign power tries to influence an  election. I believe Senator Blumenthal will try  [[Page S4135]]  to do the same thing today. Is Leader McConnell going to instruct one  of his Republicans to block it again? Will he have the courage to block  it himself if he wants it blocked?   The logical solution is to let us debate the bills. If Leader  McConnell will not cooperate on this matter, Democrats are going to  stand up for our democracy on our own, if we have to. We are going to  ask unanimous consent to allow debate on these bills. We will insist on  amendments to the NDAA. Leader McConnell has suggested he wants an open  amendment process, so let's press the matter, and we will continue to  push for more election security funding as part of a deal on budget  caps.   There are not two sides on this one; there are just not. There is  only one right answer: action to safeguard our election. I urge Leader  McConnell to let us move on this issue. Stop stalling, stop  obstructing. The legislative graveyard is full enough as it is. Let's  come together, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our grand,  imperiled democracy.   I yield the floor.
