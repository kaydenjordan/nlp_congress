 Madam President, I sadly join my colleague and friend  Senator Boozman to honor the life and service of Frank Ramirez.   Every time that a police officer kisses his or her family goodbye  before their shift, every time they strap a side arm on or put on their  badge, they know that it may be the last time they see their loved  ones. These heroes accept that danger because the love of their  families, neighborhoods, and communities is greater than any fear they  may face on the job.   Our men and women in blue don't just talk about doing good, they  actually do it each and every day. Sadly, far too many of them have had  to make the ultimate sacrifice in the course of their service.   One such hero was Arkansas Sheriff's Deputy Frank Ramirez. A week  before Thanksgiving, Deputy Ramirez was working after midnight when a  call went out there was an accident. He answered the call and quickly  drove toward the scene. But it was raining hard that evening. Roadways  were slick. And as Deputy Ramirez rounded a left turn on Highway 14, he  lost control of his car, ran into a culvert, and was sadly killed in  the resulting crash.   This heartbreaking tragedy has brought countless Arkansans to their  knees in prayer. Deputy Ramirez was serving his community when he died.  There are few causes more noble, and we recognize his supreme sacrifice  and promise to remember him.   Deputy Ramirez was a husband of 5 years and a father of two young  children, a son and a daughter. He is also survived by both his parents  and several loving brothers and sisters.   My prayers, Senator Boozman's prayers, and the prayers of all  Arkansans go out to his family. They, too, have paid an unbelievable  price in the service of our State, our communities, and our safety.   Deputy Ramirez was only 29 years old. He served in the Batesville  Police Department and the Independence County Sheriff's Office. He was  in law enforcement for nearly 2\1/2\ years. In that short time and at  his young age, Deputy Ramirez sacrificed more for his communities than  many police veterans who have been on the force for much longer. I join  them in saluting his service and honoring his sacrifice.   May God bless Frank Ramirez, may God bless his family, and may God  bless all the brave men and women in law enforcement in Arkansas and  around our Nation.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor  MAJ Kevin ``Rowdy'' Murphy for his dedicated service in the U.S. Air  Force and in the Senate as part of the Legislative Defense Fellowship.  Major Murphy joined my office in January of this year, where he has  expertly served as a trusted adviser and critical member of my team. He  is one of the Air Force's finest fighter pilots, having capably flown  the F-15E Strike Eagle for the past decade and graduated from the  distinguished Air Force Weapons School.   Rowdy served with distinction while assigned to my office. He was  instrumental in bringing a partner fighter training mission to Ft.  Smith, AR, he helped establish a Defense Department aviation safety  council, and he designed legislative defenses against the threat of  fiber optic cables from China.   While Major Murphy excelled at his legislative duties, he truly  distinguished himself during the evacuation  [[Page S8827]]  of Kabul. As Afghanistan collapsed, thousands of Americans and Afghan  partners reached out to my office for assistance. Overwhelmed by a  flood of stranded civilians a world away, Rowdy snapped into action. He  quickly organized a process for triaging and assisting American  citizens, green card holders, and Afghans who had fought alongside  American forces. He created ``baseball cards'' for isolated Americans  in Kabul, which were passed along to the 10th Mountain Division and  special forces units. He helped technologically illiterate evacuees  navigate the State Department's onerous online registration for  evacuation, and in dozens of cases, he alerted the State Department to  the presence of American citizens stuck inside a collapsing country. In  conjunction with my staff in Arkansas, DC, and even one inside Kabul's  airport perimeter, Rowdy worked a long stream of 20-hour days to  exfiltrate evacuees.   It is difficult to quantify the number of lives that Major Murphy  saved. He provided direct planning support and guidance to 76 evacuees,  drawing on his expertise as a fighter pilot to design and execute  dozens of successful evacuation strategies. The evacuees ranged from a  1-month-old infant to an 83-year-old cancer patient, all of whom are  now safely free of the Taliban's grasp. During the course of these  missions, he coordinated directly with Joint Special Operations Task  Force and NATO tier-1 units. Rowdy indirectly helped countless others.  He received, logged, and relayed innumerable evacuation requests over  those 2 weeks and directly passed along the State Department's terror  warning prior to the suicide bomb attack on the airport's Abbey Gate.  At least 70 people received this notification from Rowdy and took  shelter, a testament to his organization and persistence.   Those are the statistics. The personal stories are far more profound.  There was Mikey, a brave translator who served alongside U.S. troops.  When Mikey's wife and son were shot by the Taliban, Rowdy acted as a  personal 911 dispatcher, staying on the line with Mikey's family of  four for over 5 days and exhausting countless options to safely deliver  them from the throngs outside the airport gates. After nearly a week of  constant communication, stopping only to sleep for a few hours a night,  Rowdy's direct coordination with U.S. military personnel succeeded in  delivering Mikey's family to safety and medical care. When Mikey  finally made it through the airport gates, he was crestfallen to learn  that Rowdy was in DC, and not there to greet him inside the airport.   My staff described those 2 weeks in August as relentless and  exhausting. When Rowdy would take 3 to 4 hours a night to sleep, he  would wake to dozens of new messages from people stranded in Kabul,  pleading for help. One member of my DC staff, a marine with combat  experience in Afghanistan's Helmand province, said the personal toll  from 2 weeks of helping desperate people pleading for rescue was more  profound and exacting than his wartime service. Yet throughout it all,  Rowdy stayed calm, cool, and professional. He kept a relentless focus  on his mission. When the final American troops left Afghanistan, Rowdy  was instructed to put his phone down for a few days to recover. As a  testament to his resilience, he ignored those instructions and kept  working on alternate evacuation options for those left behind.   Major Murphy was recently invited to the wedding of one of his  evacuees, as a token of deep gratitude and affection for the Air Force  major who helped deliver them to safety. His ingenuity,  resourcefulness, stamina, and composure under pressure reflect the best  that America has to offer.   I want to sincerely thank Rowdy and his wife, Laurel, for a year of  exemplary service in my office. But I am especially grateful to him for  those 2 weeks in August, when he rose to the challenge that history had  thrust upon him. It has been a privilege to watch him work, and he will  always have an open door here in my office. It is my sincere hope that  the Air Force sees fit to decorate Rowdy after his distinguished  service during those dark days. My best to the Murphy family, and  ``Banzai!''                            ____________________
