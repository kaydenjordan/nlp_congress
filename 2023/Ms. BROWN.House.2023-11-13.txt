 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jackson and Congresswoman  Cherfilus-McCormick. I thank our CBC colleagues for speaking tonight on  this important topic and for the incredible work they do on so many  issues impacting our communities.   National Diabetes Month is a call to action. It is a call to action  to invest in our people, invest in our neighborhoods, and invest in  public health and medical research. It is a call to take the simple and  direct actions that are often right in front of us.   Just a few weeks ago, President Biden declared November to be  National Diabetes Month.   While diabetes is truly a widespread problem, it is also a disease  that shows some of the deeper sickness of America's history. Roughly  one in eight Black Americans has diabetes, and nearly 40 percent of the  population that doesn't have diabetes is already prediabetic. It is not  just an older person's disease.                                time  2045    In the last two decades, the prevalence of diabetes among people  under 20 who are Black and Hispanic Americans has increased by 95  percent.   Mr. Speaker, when you add it all up, Black Americans are 60 percent  more likely than White Americans to have diabetes.   In Cuyahoga County, which I represent, the Black diabetes rate is 25  percent. For Whites, it is 7 percent. When the CDC released the Census  tract data, it showed there were neighborhoods in Cleveland where the  diabetes rate was nearly 40 percent.   We aren't just more likely to have this disease; it is also hitting  Black people much harder. Nationwide, we are two-and-one-half times  more likely to be hospitalized by diabetes than White Americans, and we  are twice as likely to die from diabetes.   There is a lot that is broken here, and it doesn't have to be this  way. Three years ago, as a member of the Cuyahoga County Council, I  helped lead the effort to pass a resolution declaring racism as a  public health crisis, and diabetes is one of the indicators we pointed  to. It has so many systemic and structural factors: the legacies of Jim  Crow and slavery, poverty and a lack of opportunity, denied access to  healthcare, and a lack of doctors and nurses from our community who can  hear us and listen to us. There are so  [[Page H5721]]  many different factors all coming together to produce a disparate  impact.   In so many ways, this is the same story we see repeated with Black  maternal health and other racial health disparities.   Unfortunately, with diabetes rates this high, it is having a cascade  effect on our overall well-being because diabetes is expensive,  chronic, and potentially deadly.   We just saw this with the pandemic. Four in 10 adults who died from  COVID-19 also had diabetes.   Nonetheless, step one is identifying the problem, and that is why we  are here this evening. Step two is action. We have real progress to  celebrate thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, which established a  $35 per month cap on insulin costs for those on Medicare. In response  to the IRA, Eli Lilly and other pharmaceutical companies also announced  price caps and price reductions for people with non-Medicare insurance.   Not a single Republican in either Chamber voted for the Inflation  Reduction Act. Nevertheless, Democrats in Congress and the Biden-Harris  administration stepped forward to deliver anyway.   Just about every week, there is another effort by House Republicans  to repeal some part of it, but the IRA is here to stay. Black Americans  are benefiting from this law. The IRA is lowering healthcare costs for  seniors across the country and saving many of our constituents hundreds  of dollars a year.   While the data around diabetes is alarming, the Inflation Reduction  Act shows that we don't have to accept the unacceptable. We have a lot  more work to do to address diabetes and public health disparities more  broadly. The stark disparities with diabetes were centuries in the  making. We can't change that past, but we can build a better future.   We need to make healthcare more affordable, from drugs and treatment  to coverage. We also need to ensure that healthcare providers look like  America and look like the communities they serve. We need to help train  the next generation of Black medical professionals. We need to invest  in SNAP and WIC so people can afford healthy food. We need to invest in  and fully fund NIH and CDC efforts to study diabetes and treat diabetes  so we can improve care.   The budget fight we have been fighting for the past 6 months shows  where each party is aligned and whose side they are on. If we cut  funding for SNAP, push more people off Medicaid, continue to cut  investments in public health, and forbid every Federal agency from even  using the words ``equity, diversity, and inclusion,'' then we know  exactly what will happen and who will suffer.   The stakes are clear, and my CBC colleagues and I are going to keep  fighting for our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, let's fight diabetes and help every American live a  healthy life.
