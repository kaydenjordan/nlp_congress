 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, every day in America--the greatest  Nation in the history of the world--children, young women, and  teenagers are sold for sex. That is not a proud fact about America, but  it is the stark reality. Every day in America, young women, children,  and teenagers are trafficked, in large part because they are advertised  now on the internet, in the open, visibly, and obviously. Even though  code words may be used and sometimes doctored photographs, they are  sold for sex because the traffickers are able to do so using the  internet. We are here to stop it. We are here today to stop the  trafficking and, most importantly, to stop the advertising.   In support of a measure, known as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers  Act, SESTA, we have a strong bipartisan coalition. This bill is about  as bipartisan as any bill is. I have worked on this legislation  together with my colleague and friend, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio,  from the very beginning. We have been joined in this effort by two  Democrats and two Republicans--Senators McCaskill, Heitkamp, Cornyn,  and McCain. We are passionate about this effort, and so are our  colleagues who have joined us, because it is about those victims--those  children, teenagers, and young women--who are sold for sex, who are  trafficked on the internet. We want to give those victims a voice and a  day in court, a right of action, a defense against this absolutely  heinous, atrocious, inhumane crime. It is a crime and it can be  prosecuted, but the victims deserve a day in court and a voice as well.  That is the fundamental, core purpose of this legislation. It is about  the victims.   We have been joined in this effort by advocates for those victims-- sex trafficking survivors themselves and a diligent, bipartisan  coalition of colleagues. In fact, more than 60 of our colleagues have  joined this as cosponsors. We are now at a critical milestone for this  bill. We have reached a point of momentum that makes this bill  unstoppable if those survivors are to be heard and heeded, and I urge  my colleagues to do exactly that. SESTA is really the product of  stakeholder consensus. It has the support of every major human  trafficking organization, of law enforcement, and of all of the major  tech companies.   In essence, SESTA would clarify that section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act was never intended to protect websites that  facilitate sex trafficking, and it would ensure that those survivors  get their day in court. It stands in stark contrast to a measure in the  House of Representatives that has been approved by the relevant  committee there, which would fail in that effort. Websites that  knowingly facilitate sex trafficking should be afforded no protection  under the Communications Decency Act. They should be given no harbor or  implicit approval, which is what the legislation now does. The House  bill, unfortunately, would fail to give those survivors and victims  their day in court and the voice that they so desperately need.   Senator Portman and I--and I am proud to be joined with him today on  the floor--have championed this cause as a result of what we have seen  and heard. In fact, in going back almost a decade, when I was attorney  general for the State of Connecticut, I saw firsthand the way that  websites can knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. I saw firsthand how  challenging it was for law enforcement to develop cases against sex  traffickers and employ anti-trafficking laws given the constraints on  their resources, especially when those sex traffickers were able to use  the internet to reach their customers. My experience in combating sex  trafficking as attorney general at the State level led me, in my  working with Senator Portman, to co-launch and co-chair the Senate  Caucus to End Human Trafficking so as to help find solutions to this  problem and others around the world whereby children and teenagers and  others are sex-trafficked and victimized.   As the State attorney general, I concluded that facilitating sex  trafficking must face repercussions. I was joined by the National  Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reported and has since  reported the numbers. For example, there has been an 846-percent  increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking from 2010 to  2015--a spike it found to be ``directly correlated to the increased use  of the internet to sell children for sex.'' We have heard of some of  those instances, of some of the histories and the stories of these  young people.   In 2012, a 15-year-old girl ran away from home. Over the next 2  years, pimps trafficked her for sex through these ads. As a result, she  was raped over 1,000 times while she was moved from one site to another  with the aid of the internet. In 2010, another 15-year-old girl ran  away from a residential program. A pimp began to traffic her for sex by  posting online ads. As a result, she was raped 900 times over the next  2 years.   These two young women and a third mustered the courage to tell their  stories and to bring a lawsuit against backpage.com, which is the  website that has profited most prominently from these online ads. These  advertisements graphically emphasized the survivors' and victims' youth  and other characteristics in trafficking them for sex. Yet the courts,  understandably and perhaps rightly, have held that backpage.com and  these internet sites generally have no legal responsibility. The First  Circuit Court of Appeals found that backpage.com was immune from civil  liability because of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.   Websites that facilitate sex trafficking unconscionably and  intolerably are now immune from legal action by survivors. That is  unacceptable in America. No matter how terrible the harm they cause, no  matter how horrific the consequences to these young people, they are  protected by a shield from moral and legal responsibility. In a sense,  these women were victimized as much by backpage.com and the internet as  they were by the pimps who more directly sold them.   Senator Portman and I, through SESTA, would implement three key  reforms: No. 1, allow victims of sex trafficking to seek justice  against websites that knowingly facilitate their victimization; No. 2,  clarify that it is illegal to knowingly facilitate a violation of the  Federal sex trafficking laws; and No. 3, enable State law enforcement  officials, not just the Federal Department of Justice, to take action  against individuals or businesses that violate Federal sex trafficking  laws.   If websites are not knowingly facilitating sex trafficking, they  should have nothing to fear from the law. If  [[Page S86]]  websites are doing their best to avoid facilitating sex trafficking,  they have no worry about their liability. Yet, if they knowingly  facilitate, they ought to face survivors and victims in court, and they  ought to acknowledge and recognize their legal and moral  responsibilities.   I want to be very blunt with my colleagues here about the House bill  because my feeling is that we owe it to those survivors and victims to  give them not just nice words and rhetoric but real rights. Congress  must not only pass an online sex trafficking law; it must pass real sex  trafficking internet protection. Unfortunately, the House Judiciary  Committee recently passed legislation that fails to accomplish that  goal.   My colleagues should not be fooled--the House bill is in no way an  adequate alternative to SESTA. It is, unfortunately, completely  insufficient in protecting survivors and victims and giving them that  day in court and that voice they now lack. The difference between the  House and Senate bills is stark and clear, like night and day. The  Senate bill gives victims of trafficking their day in court. The House  bill does not give a single survivor or victim access to justice. It  fails to open the courthouse doors; it leaves them shut. In fact, it  may even deny victims and survivors their right to file legal action.  The Senate bill has the support of every major human trafficking  organization, as well as of all of the major stakeholders. The House  bill is supported by none--zero--no major group. In fact, 47  organizations and more than a dozen survivors and family members  recently sent a letter that calls for the House bill, as it is  presently written, to be rejected.   I strongly urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan group of more  than 60 of us who are supporting SESTA to help pass this essential  legislation as soon as possible. We owe it to those survivors and  victims. We owe it to ourselves. We owe it to America.   I am proud to yield to my friend and colleague who has joined in this  effort and has been such a steadfast champion, Senator Portman.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse for his very erudite and  insightful summary of the bright, shiny toys and rabbits and rabbit  holes that a number of our colleagues have attempted to use to distract  the Judiciary Committee and this body from what should be its quest for  the truth; that is, the truth about the Russian attack on our democracy  during the last election and potential collusion in that attack-- specifically, collusion by the Trump campaign--and obstruction of  justice. Indeed, obstruction of justice is within the direct purview of  the Judiciary Committee.   I want to thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse for joining me in a  letter that we wrote to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  Senator Grassley, asking that he very simply make public the transcript  of the interview with Glenn Simpson conducted by our staff. Senator  Grassley declined. But, earlier today, Senator Feinstein released the  interview, advancing the American people's right and need to know the  full truth.   I want to applaud Senator Feinstein's leadership in using her proper  authority as the ranking member to serve this vital public interest. I  am grateful to her for her courage and strength in moving forward and  disclosing the transcript to prevent its use as a dangerous distraction  from the critical work of our committee. I want to thank at least one  of our colleagues across the aisle, Senator Cornyn, for apparently  supporting that step.   The toys and rabbits and rabbit holes are hardly new to efforts by  defenders of an administration against an investigation, and perhaps  for some amusement as well as enlightenment, I want to cite a satiric  column done by Art Buchwald in 1973.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the column be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Here Are Handy Excuses for Nixon Backers                             (By Art Buchwald)         Washington.--These are difficult times for people who are       defending the Nixon administration. No matter where they go       they are attacked by pseudo-liberals, McGovern lovers,       heterosexual constitutionalists and paranoid John Dean       believers.        As a public service, I am printing instant responses for       loyal Nixonites when they are attacked at a party. Please cut       it out and carry it in your pocket.        1--Everyone does it.        2--What about Chappaquiddick?        3--A President can't keep track of everything his staff       does.        4--The press is blowing the whole thing up.        5--Whatever Nixon did was for national security.        6--The Democrats are sore because they lost the election.        7--Are you going to believe a rat like John Dean or the       President of the United States?        8--Wait till all the facts come out.        9--What about Chappaquiddick?        10--If you impeach Nixon, you get Agnew.        11--The only thing wrong with Watergate is they got caught.        12--What about Daniel Ellsberg stealing the Pentagon       Papers?        13--It happens in Europe all the time.        14--People would be against Nixon no matter what he did.        15--I'd rather have a crook in the White House than a fool.        16--L.B.J. used to read FBI reports every night.        17--What's the big deal about finding out what your       opposition is up to?        18--The President was too busy running the country to know       what was going on.        19--What about Chappaquiddick?        20--People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.        21--McGovern would have lost anyway.        22--Maybe the Committee for the Re-Election of the       President went a little too far, but they were just a bunch       of eager kids.        23--I'm not for breaking the law, but sometimes you have to       do it to save the country.        24--Nixon made a mistake. He's only human.        25--Do you realize what Watergate is doing to the dollar       abroad?        26--What about Harry Truman and the deep freeze scandal?        27--Franklin D. Roosevelt did a lot worse things.        28--I'm sick and tired of hearing about Watergate and so is       everybody else.        29--This thing should be tried in the courts and not on       television.        30--When Nixon gives his explanation of what happened there       are going to be a lot of people in this country with egg on       their faces.        31--My country right or wrong.        32--What about Chappaquiddick?        33--I think the people who make all this fuss about       Watergate should be shot.        34--If the Democrats had the money they would have done the       same thing.        35--I never trusted Haldeman and Ehrlichman to start with.  [[Page S99]]         36--If you say one more word about Watergate I'll punch you       in the nose.        A--If the person is bigger than you: ``If you say one more       word about Watergate I'm leaving this house.''        B--If it's your own house and the person is bigger than       you: ``What about Chappaquiddick?     Mr. Buchwald wrote a satirical list of tactics  Republicans were using to keep Americans from focusing on the Watergate  scandal. The list is eerily familiar. The tactics being employed by the  Trump supporters today ring of those same tactics used in Watergate.  Buchwald suggests focusing on accusations made against prominent  Democrats or individuals who had accused Richard Nixon of wrongdoing.  He suggests attacking the media. He suggests saying: ``The Democrats  are sore because they lost.'' He suggests deflecting blame to a ``bunch  of eager kids''--perhaps sounding like the reference to ``coffee boys''  today--and saying that this investigation is ``bad for the dollar,''  much like bad for America abroad.   I am very confident--and I want to emphasize this point very  emphatically--that the special counsel will be in no way distracted  from his investigation and his team will be undeterred by these  tactics. But the American people should not be distracted or deterred  either and, equally important, the Judiciary Committee, the U.S.  Senate, and the Congress as a whole has a duty here that is, in fact,  vulnerable to that same distraction. We must persevere.   What our Republican colleagues are doing at this point is indicated  by a recent New York Times article. The article describes President  Trump's efforts to persuade congressional allies to drop their  investigations, and it says:         Another Republican Senator said Mr. Trump had not urged him       to help bring the Russia inquiry to a halt. Instead, the       Senator said, the President nudged him to begin an       investigation into Hillary Clinton's connection with the       intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS, which produced a       dossier of allegations about Mr. Trump's ties to Moscow.    The goal was to stop the investigation of Russian meddling, but the  implication in the article is that the President knew he could achieve  that goal as effectively, or at least more practically, by distracting  from those investigations, diverting resources to other issues, and  muddying the waters for the American people. That is the playbook from  1973 that is referenced by Art Buchwald in his 1973 column.   Here is the danger: Distractions are dangerous, and efforts to  discredit law enforcement are equally perilous. Those efforts have  included not only the urging for an investigation of Uranium One and  Fusion GPS but also attacks on the integrity of some members of the FBI  and the FBI as a whole and attacks on individual members of the special  counsel's team, on the team as a whole, and on Robert Mueller himself.  The effort plainly is to discredit the investigation before it reaches  a potentially incriminating conclusion and to stop the investigation,  but if not stop it, at least to demean its credibility before charges  are brought.   It is standard operating procedure. We know as prosecutors. The  distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and I served as U.S. attorneys  and then attorneys general for our States. We know going into the  courtroom that we can expect to be attacked and that our teams can be  expected to be attacked. That is what defense lawyers do. That is what  they do because they hope to demean and discredit and dismantle the  credibility of prosecutors before the jury in the courtroom. Here, the  courtroom is not a court of law but the court of public opinion. Our  Republican friends have launched that preemptive strike, methodically  and meticulously, just as the special counsel is engaging in his  investigation methodically and meticulously.   Now, I referred to Republican colleagues, and I believe strongly and  passionately that many, if not most, of our Republican colleagues share  our zeal for the rule of law and for a just outcome to this  investigation. The reason is very simple. The Russian attack on our  democracy imperils not just this administration and not just one  election. It imperils our democracy as a whole. The meddling in our  elections was perhaps done to advance the Trump candidacy in 2016, but  it can be used against the Trump candidacy in 2020. It can be used  against another Republican candidate in that year. It could be used in  2018 against other candidates for Congress or for State election.   My Republican colleagues have been as eloquent as any of us in  defining that threat because there is no doubt in the intelligence  community that it is a threat, that the Russians did interfere, and  that they sought to advance the Trump candidacy. Whether there was an  impact and what the impact was may never be known, but the effort is  clear. It involved a massive campaign of disinformation, propaganda,  cyber attack, and other means. That is what the FBI learned was  happening, not as a result of Christopher Steele but from sources  within the Trump campaign, including George Papadopoulos, and from  other intelligence sources, and that is what we must make sure is known  to the American public. We must make sure that anyone who aided the  Russians pays a price and that the Russians themselves pay a price,  because if there is no price, it will be done with impunity again.   So there should be--and I believe there is--bipartisan apprehension  about that threat to our Nation's security. That is the reason that the  Judiciary Committee's investigation, along with the special counsel, is  so important, because our purview includes obstruction of justice and  the integrity of the Department of Justice. Any interference  politically with the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling must be  prevented in the future as well. Only the Judiciary Committee can frame  and craft legislation that will help to protect the FBI.   Senator Whitehouse and I, and Senator Feinstein and others on the  committee, will be proposing such legislation based on what we know so  far. It is legislation that essentially protects the rule of law  against such efforts to obstruct justice and politically interfere.   The intelligence community's conclusions about Russian meddling did  not rely on the credibility of Glenn Simpson or Christopher Steele. The  two guilty pleas and convictions that the special counsel has already  secured do not rely on the credibility of Simpson or Steele. Without  fear of contradiction, I can predict that additional convictions and  indictments will be based on fact and law, not on the credibility of  Simpson and Steele. The conclusions reached by Simpson, Steele, or  anybody else are relevant only insofar as they are supported and backed  and proved by facts and consistent with relevant law.   Now, in fact, as we know, Christopher Steele tried to blow the  whistle on the Russians. He brought to the FBI's attention information  that he thought was relevant to protecting the United States of America  against Russian interference. As my colleague Senator Whitehouse has  outlined in detail, the FBI already knew of it and courteously heard  from Christopher Steele and later interviewed him.   The effort to undermine the credibility of the FBI by pointing to  Christopher Steele completely misses the mark. In fact, I am deeply  disappointed that the first major action by our Republican colleagues  on the Judiciary Committee was aimed at someone who reported  wrongdoing, not committed it, and it was done without any cooperation  or even consultation with Democratic colleagues. It is really a  betrayal of the spirit that I think should characterize this very  serious investigation, because it should be bipartisan.   My hope is that these distractions, dangerous as they are, will, in  fact, not divert either our committee or the special counsel. The pace  of our committee's investigation--again, to be very blunt--has been  shamefully slow. I hope that its pace will quicken and that it will  intensify and that there will be hearings in public with witnesses  under oath and subpoenas of documents. I have said it repeatedly. I  hope we will use those tools because only by relying on our powers to  investigate effectively and comprehensively will we protect the goals  of upholding integrity and justice.   As for the special counsel and our law enforcement community, I think  they should know that we support them and that we will protect the  special counsel against political interference. That is why there is  legislation I have proposed, along with my  [[Page S100]]  colleague Senator Whitehouse and others. It is bipartisan legislation.  I thank Senators Tillis and Graham, as well as Senators Coons and  Booker, for joining in this legislation. That legislation has already  had a hearing. It should be voted to the floor and passed by the  Congress so that there is no question that the special counsel will be  protected against interference or firing.   As that investigation moves closer to the Oval Office, as it tightens  its grip on members of the administration, there will be increasing  threats and efforts to intimidate. The FBI and the Department of  Justice, as well as the special counsel, have a well-earned reputation  for integrity and zeal. It is part of our rule of law that a law is  enforced. Enforcement of a law depends on thorough and independent  investigations that are pursued without fear or favor, without efforts  to distract or demean. This body, the U.S. Congress, has an obligation  to support those kinds of values. They are uniquely American values.  They are the underpinning of all of our laws, all that we hold dear,  and all that we celebrate in this body and in this country.   My hope is that we will be part of the effort to avoid politicizing  the pursuit of justice. Politicization of the pursuit of justice  diverts energy and attention away from credible criminal  investigations. It sends a message to this President and future  Presidents--and everybody who occupies any office--that there are no  repercussions for diverting and distracting and for the ploys and  rabbit holes that may be used to squander resources or undermine  credibility.   Republicans and Democrats alike should join in the effort to preserve  the rule of law. My hope is that we will and will do so without delay  because every day that passes when these kinds of false, baseless, and  biased innuendos and rumors are raised and given credence is a day that  undermines those values that we hold dear.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.
