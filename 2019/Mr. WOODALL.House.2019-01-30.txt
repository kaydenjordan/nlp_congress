 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding. I  would like to pick up where my friend from Maryland left off. They  don't deserve to be deified, but they don't deserve to be demonized  either. That doesn't just apply to our Federal workforce. That applies  to so many elements of our conversation today.   I hope you have a chance, Mr. Speaker, to go watch the Rules  Committee debate last night on this rule. You might have thought that,  with a simple two-page resolution such as this one, we might have been  up and out in about 10 minutes, making three amendments in order.   But, no, we spent the better part of almost 3 hours there talking  with the committee experts on the issue, Mr. Connolly from Virginia and  Mr. Meadows from North Carolina. You would be affected by the amount of  agreement that those two gentlemen had.                                time  0930    Now, Mr. Speaker, I don't want to say you would be surprised, because  you might know those two gentlemen as I do, you might know this issue  as I do, and you might know its bipartisan roots and its bipartisan  future as I do.   But if you don't watch that hearing, if you don't know the issue, if  all you do is see a bill that was dropped in the hopper just a couple  of days ago, has had no markup in committee, has had no hearings, has  had no witnesses, and has had no dialogue whatsoever on it, but  happened to be dropped in the middle of the week where some of the more  cynical among us expected us to still be in a government shutdown  before the President brought us out of it, this might just look like a  messaging statement to folks who view it through that lens.   It is so frustrating and disappointing to me because this is an issue  on which we agree. My friend from Oklahoma, an appropriator, happens to  be the ranking member up on the Rules Committee. In testimony last  night, we are talking about not an insignificant amount of money in  this bill; we are talking about not millions with an M, we are talking  about billions with a B of dollars going out the door.   The question is: Where do the dollars come from?   The answer is: They are just going to come from other accounts these  agencies already have.   I don't know what other account that is, and I think that is worth  having a conversation about.   If you read through this language, Mr. Speaker, you will see no  effort whatsoever to do what every single one of us knows needs to be  done, and that is to find those Federal employees who make us proud at  agencies every single day, reward that service, protect that service,  encourage that service, and make sure retention plans are in place for  those employees. There is not a line in here to target those high  performers.   Equally, look through this legislation, Mr. Speaker, to find those  folks whom I know--because I hear it from my veterans in my district  every day, and I hear it from the leadership in the VA every day--find  those folks who just do not want to show up and serve. Somehow they got  involved in Federal service. They are the exception, not the rule. They  bring their colleagues in Federal service down instead of lifting them  up. They bring the folks they are intended to serve down instead of  lifting them up. There is no effort to identify those folks and no  effort to reward the high performers while trying to train up the low  performers. In true government fashion, it says that the definition of  success is to treat absolutely everybody the same.   Mr. Speaker, there is no one else doing this work other than us. The  problem in the civil service system isn't that we protect employees.  That is laud worthy. That is a laudable goal. What the problem is in  civil service is we are the only ones who do the oversight. There is no  other board of directors. It is us.   Yet we bring a bill to the floor that we claim raises our Federal  employees up and praises our Federal employees. We didn't even give it  the dignity of a hearing or a markup. We can do better  [[Page H1291]]  than that, and candidly, I think we will.   We will never know what would have happened had we not gotten started  on the foot we got started on in January as we did. I particularly  regret that for our freshmen who are trying to figure out what the tone  and tenor is of this place. This isn't it. Apparently, Republicans got  us in bad habits in the last session of just dropping bills in the  hopper and bringing them to the floor the next day, no hearings, no  markup. It was wrong then, and it is not wise now either.   We have a lot of choices to make going forward, Mr. Speaker.   Are we poisoning the well, or are we protecting it?   Are we tilling the fields, or are we spreading salt in them?   We don't need to deify our ideological opponents, but we don't need  to demonize them either. There is more that unites this country than  divides this country, Mr. Speaker. Our Federal employees do deserve our  trust, our appreciation, and, yes, a paycheck at the end of the week  for the work they have done on our behalf.   They also deserve a way to be recognized when they go above and  beyond. They also deserve to know that folks on their team who are not  up to the task today are either going to be trained up or moved out.   We can do those things together. For reasons that are not clear to  me, we have not chosen to try. This could have been a bipartisan  effort. This could have been part of a larger package, and it wasn't. I  regret that.   I will tell my friend from Maryland I did not bring any additional  speakers with me who would have shared that very same message, so when  he is prepared to close as am I.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am always affected by the words of the gentlewoman from Texas, but  my answer is clear: No, everybody doesn't  [[Page H1292]]  deserve a pay raise all the time; it is true on my staff, it is true in  my life, it is true in every private-sector company in the country, and  it is true in the Federal Government too.   Now we won't be able to have that conversation because there was no  hearing on this bill. We won't be able to improve that circumstance  because this bill doesn't try to expand itself to that scope.   We are in a new age. I won't be able to close this debate, Mr.  Speaker. My friend from Maryland will be able to close as is the  privilege of the majority.    The other privilege of the majority is titling the bills as they are  coming to the floor. This is the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise  Fairness Act, and the definition of fairness in this case is that  civilian workers be treated the same as military workers as it relates  to a cost-of-living increase. That is worthy of debate.   I know many of my friends who represent the Washington, D.C.  metropolitan area that have so many civilian Federal workers believe in  that equity issue deeply and passionately and have worked to protect it  over a long number of years. In the State of Georgia, we have many DOD  employees, folks whose tempo changes regularly, folks who are called on  with increasing frequency, folks who ask: Where shall I go when you  send me?   That is qualitatively different service.   Should it be treated differently? Again, this is not the right place  for that conversation. This is a debate on a rule about whether or not  we will bring up a bill that the folks on the other side of the aisle  absolutely have the votes to pass if they want to pass it.   In fact, it is language in the bill that we could absolutely move in  a bipartisan way if we had it in the conversations. It is language that  could have absolutely been part of the negotiations to end the  government shutdown since this was a decision that the President made  back in December of last year not to institute the 2.1. If folks had  gone to the negotiating table, if folks had negotiated in good faith,  if folks had said that this is what we need, and this is what we think  is important, then we could have solved this long before now.   But this bill was dropped just days ago, again, with no hearing and  no markups, and here it is before us.                                time  0945    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, as well as add any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  intend to bring up a very simple amendment that would address just one  of the questions that we would have addressed if we considered this  issue important enough to have the committee of jurisdiction actually  gather and hold a hearing on it; and that is the question of those who  are delinquent in their taxes: those folks who have an outstanding tax  bill, who have not tried to enter into a negotiated settlement, those  who are not in a payment plan, but those who simply are not paying  their Federal taxes, that they not be a part of this pay increase.   My constituents work hard every day of the week. They expect us to be  doing the oversight. They expect us to be doing performance reviews.  They expect us to be looking at who is showing up and who is going the  extra mile, rewarding those folks who are going the extra mile,  training those folks up who are not, and not rewarding those folks who  are falling well below the standards that each and every one of us  expect as taxpayers and, candidly, even more so, each and every Federal  employee expects of his or her colleagues.   I want good work to be recognized with good pay, Mr. Speaker, but  what would be better than this bill is a comprehensive plan from the  Committee on Oversight and Reform to reform the civil service system so  that that is not an aspirational goal but an absolute certainty that  the American people can count on.   The best thing we can do to respect our fellow employees, Mr.  Speaker, is not to have a messaging bill come to the House of  Representatives. The best thing we can do for our Federal employees is  to make sure that the reputation that travels across the land is not  one of underperformance but is one of overperformance.   We are the only ones who can deal with the issues of bad apples  spoiling an entire barrel. We are the only ones who can do it. We owe  it to every agency in this land to be their partner in getting that  done. By defeating the previous question and including this amendment,  we will take a small step in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, unless my friend is prepared to close, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you have the benefit of being there in the chair where I  used to get to stand from time to time to preside over these  proceedings, and you know that feeling. You may be a partisan on the  weekends when you are at a Democratic rally, but when you stand in that  chair, you don't stand there as a Democrat. I didn't stand there as a  Republican. You stand there as the representative of the entire U.S.  House of Representatives to make sure we have a full, fair, and free  debate. In fact, you have got a wonderful team there in the  Parliamentarian's and the Clerk's Office to make sure that all goes  unaffected from one leadership to the next.   In fact, we go back hundreds of years in terms of trying to honor the  precedence and the practices that this Chamber has brought together. We  do that because, when you govern this institution with that mantra of  fair play, we get better results in the end: we spend less time arguing  about the process; we spend more time working together on progress; and  we get to where it is each and every one of our constituents wants us  to go.   My friend from Maryland and I, we are in a tough trap here in  January. Of all the things I thought we would be talking about down  here as it affects a Federal employee pay increase, the President's  conversations about his tax forms in a campaign 3 years ago wasn't one  of them.   But somehow, because of the nature of discourse today, if you have a  sharp stick with the President's name on it, you just kind of have to  work that in whenever the debate gives you an opportunity. It never  once brings us closer to solutions, but it apparently makes folks feel  better from time to time, makes their constituents feel better from  time to time.   We are going to have to ask ourselves sometime soon: Did we get  elected to make a point or did we get elected to make a difference? I  know what that answer is for me, and I want this, Mr. Speaker, to go  down as a missed opportunity.   This could have been a bill that we spent our time on the floor  talking through together, as Mr. Connolly and Mr. Meadows did just last  night in the Rules Committee as representatives of the committee of  jurisdiction on this issue, of all the things we have in common from  coast to coast, from north to south, as it relates to honoring our  Federal workforce and improving our Federal workforce.   And, for whatever reason, the leadership decision was made that we  wouldn't do this in a partnership way, we wouldn't do this in a  bipartisan way, we wouldn't do this in a full-throated legislative  process way, but we would just craft this bill, drop it on the floor,  and force a vote.   We can miss a couple of opportunities, Mr. Speaker, to come together.  We have already missed a few in January. We can miss a few more. But I  know my friend from Maryland shares my concern.   There is going to come a time--and it happened to Republicans, too-- where you miss one too many opportunities to work together and you  poison that partnership well for weeks or months or, in worst case  scenarios, even years to come.   America can't afford that, Mr. Speaker, and each and every one of us  is better than that. We haven't found our stride yet. If we defeat this  rule today, perhaps that will be a step in finding our stride. If we  defeat the previous question and consider my amendment, that might be a  step in finding our stride. Even in the absence of those eventualities,  we still must commit ourselves to one another to find that stride  moving forward.   It is to the disadvantage of every Federal employee in the Nation to  make this conversation about the importance of the work they do look  like an ``us'' against ``them.'' When it comes to folks who wear a flag  on their shoulder, when it comes to folks who show up in service of  their fellow man, there is no ``us'' and ``them''; there is just an  ``us.'' Any opportunity we use to either distort that understanding or  fail to recognize that understanding does violence to us all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule, a ``no'' vote on the  previous question, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
