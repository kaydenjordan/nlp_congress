 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, tomorrow will mark 1 year since President Biden's  inauguration, and Americans are left asking: Are we better off under  this administration?   Judging by his all-time low approval ratings, the answer for  Americans is a resounding no. Everywhere you look, there is a crisis  riddled with incompetence, division, and dysfunction.   At our southern border, Biden has allowed nearly 2 million illegal  immigrants to enter our Nation, creating the worst border crisis in 30  years.   In the classroom, Biden has targeted parents and their role in  education. His administration even lobbied for them to be called  domestic terrorists.                                time  1430    Madam Speaker, in our communities violent crime is at all-time highs.  Last year, the murder rate was higher than at any point since 1996.   On the economy, Biden's mishandling of our Federal Government has  created the highest inflation rate in 40 years. Bare shelves, high gas  prices, and supply chain issues continue to dog this administration.   On the world stage, Biden botched our withdrawal from Afghanistan,  surrendering to the Taliban and making America a laughingstock to our  adversaries. All of this resulted in the deaths of 13 servicemembers,  including one from my home State of Missouri.   Instead of addressing these issues, President Biden had doubled down  on his far-left socialist policies, out-of-control spending, and  incompetence. It is past time for a change. America deserves better.  They need leadership that listens and fights for hardworking families,  not against them.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to help lead the fight alongside my fellow  Republicans to reverse course by unleashing our economy, securing our  border, respecting parents, defending life and our foundational values,  and providing for the common defense.   On this one-year anniversary commemorating the misery of the Biden  administration, we commit ourselves to never stop fighting for what is  right, to work harder than ever, and to never give up. America is  depending on us.
