 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a motorsports legend  and perhaps the most famous son of my hometown, Columbus, Indiana.   From the dirt tracks to the high banks, to the Brickyard, Tony  Stewart amassed a racing career that includes nearly 50 NASCAR wins,  three NASCAR Cup titles, a USAC Triple Crown, and an IndyCar Series  championship.   Tony won his first championship at the Columbus Fairgrounds when he  was just 8 years old. He is synonymous with racing, and we are proud to  call him a Hoosier.   On behalf of the people of Columbus, the Sixth Congressional  District, and race fans across Indiana, I want to congratulate Tony  Stewart on his recent nomination to the NASCAR Hall of Fame.   I also want to thank Tony for his work in our community as part of  the Tony Stewart Foundation. Through December 2017, the foundation has  awarded over $7 million to outstanding charities serving children with  special needs, endangered animals, and injured drivers.   We honor his achievements on and off the track, and we look forward  to cheering him on in years to come.                            ____________________
