 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his  tremendous leadership.   And also, just very briefly, I want to mention to my colleague from  California on the other side, I remember the Reagan-era tax cut period  also, and there was a huge rise in homeless veterans as a result,  unfortunately.  [[Page H8245]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called budget  plan.   I know that our budget shapes our national priorities and values, but  the Republicans have put forward a budget that I think is downright  sinister. This budget is morally bankrupt. It is a Trojan horse that  steals healthcare from children and rips food from the hungry just to  fast-track $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and  corporations.   Budgets are moral documents. They should not be rigged in favor of  special interests and the wealthy few, but the cruel and crooked  Republican budget does just that. Our Nation's budget should prioritize  working families and the middle class, too many of whom are making low  wages and living below the poverty line.                                time  0930    It should assist those struggling to find a job. It should invest in  workforce training, education, job creation and job training. Instead,  this Republican budget creates tax cuts for billionaires, millionaires,  and corporations.   Our budget should expand to protect healthcare for all. Instead, this  budget steals nearly $2 trillion from lifesaving Medicaid and Medicare.   With nearly 40 million Americans living in poverty, our budget should  invest in communities of color and rural communities, which have higher  rates of poverty.   Simply put, the House Republican budget would push more people into  poverty. It slashes programs that help create good paying jobs for  struggling families. It is a shame, it is immoral, it is un-American,  and I hope we defeat it.
