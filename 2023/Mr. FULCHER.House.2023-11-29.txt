 Mr. Chair, our Nation's security is at risk. This is due  to the Biden administration's failure to secure our southern border.  Since he took office, over 6.4 million illegal immigrants have entered  our country from the South. There are at least 279 on the FBI's  terrorist watch list and that is just what we know of.   Terrorists from across the world see our southern border as an easy  way to enter the U.S. Lord only knows what other threats are coming  into our country with bad intent. My home State of Idaho is comprised  of over 62 percent Federal land, so this is beyond just concerning to  me. Idaho has also been gravely impacted by this border crisis, despite  its geographical separation from the South.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to support Protecting our Communities from  Failure to Secure the Border Act of 2023. I encourage my colleagues to  do the same.
