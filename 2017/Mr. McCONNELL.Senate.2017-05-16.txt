 Mr. President, as ObamaCare continues to collapse, a  new Gallup poll out last week showed ``Healthcare Surges as Top Problem  in US.''   It is not hard to see why so many Americans feel this way. They turn  on the TV and hear there will be even fewer options on the ObamaCare  marketplaces in State after State. They pick up the newspaper and see  that even more double-digit premium increases are being proposed for  too many of the ObamaCare plan options that still remain. They know  what these stories mean for their families: They will be left to pick  up the pieces as ObamaCare continues to crumble all across the country.  Unless we act, ObamaCare premiums will keep skyrocketing across the  Nation, pushing the financial burden of this broken law onto the backs  of more hard-working Americans.   We have seen the result of this already with last year's rate  filings, which left many States with double-digit premium increases as  even more insurance options left the market. Premium price hikes for  some ObamaCare plans reached startling levels, averaging 53 percent in  Pennsylvania, 63 percent in Tennessee, and a shocking 116 percent in  Arizona, just to name a few.   Families are again awaiting projections for this year's filings and  once again bracing for the very worst. In the coming weeks and months,  proposed rate increases under ObamaCare will roll in across the Nation,  and already ObamaCare customers in a handful of States have learned  just how high their premiums could rise in 2018.   For example, consumers in Vermont just learned that premiums on the  exchanges could increase by double digits next year. In Connecticut,  requested premium rate increases are as high as 52 percent on the  exchanges. In Maryland, one major insurer is asking for an average rate  increase of nearly 60 percent. ObamaCare's marketplaces, that insurer  warned, are in the ``early stages of a death spiral.''   Are our Democratic friends who promised to lower costs under  ObamaCare OK with what looks to be yet another year of massive  ObamaCare premium increases? This news is alarming not only for the  families on the exchanges in the States I just named but for the  thousands more across the Nation who may be hit with similar reports in  coming weeks.   As one recent AP story, titled ``More price hikes likely for  government insurance markets,'' observed: ``Early moves by insurers  suggest that another round of price hikes and limited choices will  greet insurance shoppers around the country when they start searching  for next year's coverage on the public markets established by the  Affordable Care Act.''   Moreover, as the story went on to say, over 40 percent of counties  could have just a single insurer to choose from on the exchanges next  year. It is troubling news, especially given that so many States, like  mine, have already experienced insurers fleeing the ObamaCare  marketplace leaving families with limited options.   Let's just look at the chart behind me. In Kentucky, under ObamaCare,  49  [[Page S2938]]  percent of counties have only one insurer this year in 2017. Forty-nine  percent of our counties, nearly half the counties in Kentucky, have  only one insurer to choose from, and of course having one option is  really no choice at all. It is a harsh reality facing more and more  Americans, and these ObamaCare failures have real consequences for the  men and women whom we all represent.   As one of our Democratic friends commented just last week on news  that his State will be left with only a single insurer next year under  ObamaCare, ``This will mean that more than 12,000 Delawareans will have  to find a new insurance plan and [that] our hardworking families will  have fewer options and harder choices to make about their health  insurance coverage.''   Can our Democratic colleagues who promised more choice under  ObamaCare really be OK with the continuing failures of ObamaCare?   The status quo under ObamaCare is simply unsustainable and  unacceptable. That is why the entire Senate Republican conference is  working together on the best way forward to bring much needed relief to  the families who have been left behind by ObamaCare's continuing  failures.   I hope our Democratic colleagues will join us in working on this.  They just sent me a letter last week where they acknowledged that  ObamaCare hasn't lived up to its promises and where they effectively  conceded that the status quo is unsustainable. I hope it means they are  finally ready to join us in moving away from ObamaCare and supporting  smarter healthcare policies. After years of defending a system that  isn't working for far too many Americans, it is time that Senate  Democrats finally face the reality of this flawed ObamaCare law.   The failures of ObamaCare aren't just isolated to one region of the  country either. They are affecting people from the east coast to the  west coast, from the North to the South, and things are likely to get  even worse, unless we work to finally move beyond the failures of this  law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time  from 2:15 p.m. until 5:15 p.m. today be equally divided in the usual  form; and that at 5:15 p.m., all postcloture time be expired and the  Senate vote on the Rosen nomination; that if the nomination is  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and the Senate resume consideration of the Brand nomination;  further, that notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the Brand  nomination occur at 12 noon on Wednesday, May 17; and that if cloture  is invoked, the time count as if it were invoked at 1 a.m. on  Wednesday; finally, that if cloture is invoked on the Brand nomination,  the cloture vote on the Branstad nomination occur following disposition  of the Brand nomination; and that if cloture is not invoked on the  Brand nomination, the cloture vote on the Branstad nomination occur  immediately following the failed cloture vote.
