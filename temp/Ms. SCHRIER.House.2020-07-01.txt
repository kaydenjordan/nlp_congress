 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me.   The coronavirus pandemic has taken a severe toll on our economy and  has resulted in the permanent loss of countless jobs and highlighted  the need for broadband access for workers and students.    That is why the Moving Forward Act is so critical right now. It is a  bold infrastructure package that will put America back to work, create  new jobs, expand broadband access, and invest in schools and tomorrow's  clean energy infrastructure.   I am proud to have included two important wins for Washington in this  package.   My bill to fund the Legacy Roads and Trails Program will prioritize  culvert repairs and riparian habitat in Washington's forests.   My amendment to ensure transit agencies in King and Pierce Counties  have flexibility and predictability will allow them to continue to  serve riders during this public health crisis.   Passing the Moving Forward Act now is how we shore up our  infrastructure, set the stage for a clean energy future, and restore  our economy and families' financial security.
