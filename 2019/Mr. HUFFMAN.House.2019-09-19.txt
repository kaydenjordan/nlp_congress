 Madam Speaker, from the Representative of the  northernmost district on the coast of California, I really do want to  thank my friend from southern California for yielding to me. San Diego  and Orange Counties are so well-served by his intelligent, principled  leadership, and especially on this issue, this existential crisis that  we are trying to confront of global climate change. The gentleman's  leadership on this issue has certainly been noted.   Madam Speaker, our leader, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, did a very unusual  thing in reaching out and choosing a freshman Member of Congress, and  it is because of Mr. Levin's background and clarity on these issues  that she put him on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis,  where I am proud to serve with him. So I thank the gentleman so much  for that leadership.   And, Madam Speaker, he is doing more than that. He is putting great  bills into the hopper. He is leading this debate this evening. So we  are well served with Mr. Levin's leadership in southern California.   Now, one of the previous speakers mentioned that we are gathered here  on the eve of this global climate strike tomorrow. Tens of thousands of  students all over the United States, 800 different sites, are working  in harmony with 156 other countries where young people are doing the  same thing worldwide. This is a week of action.   These are high school kids, and even younger in some cases. They  understand what is at stake here. The part of their message that I  think we really need to hear is that we don't have time.   There is an extreme urgency to confront this crisis, and they  understand that the longer we wait, the harder it is going to be to  preserve a livable future for their generation. Of course, if we wait  too long, it is game over.   They are scared, and they ought to be scared. We all ought to be  scared about the fact that we are running out of time to address this  crisis.   Yesterday, I had a chance to sit down with a few of these young  leaders. I am super grateful that four of those that Chairman Grijalva  and I met with for a couple of hours were from Sonoma County in my  district. So I want to thank Olivia, Kate, Christian, and Jonah. They  were from the National Children's Campaign and also Schools for Climate  Action. They came all the way to Washington, D.C., to make sure that  the country heard their story.   That story, of course, involves the terrible firestorm of October  2017 that the folks in the North Bay had to live through. These young  people had their lives uprooted and impacted in profound ways, and it  helped sharpen their climate activism. They brought that story to a  very important, urgent conversation that Chairman Grijalva and I were  part of yesterday.   More and more people like them are living the very real impacts that  climate change is having right now. This is not some abstract thing in  the future. It is happening now, and it is going to get worse as we go  forward, especially if we don't act.   So this message of urgency, clearly the public understands it.  Congressman Levin and I were just in the Cloakroom, and MSNBC showed a  brand-new poll that shows that 65 percent, I believe, of the American  people understand this is a crisis.   It is not just an important issue. It is a crisis.                                time  1830    The public gets it. The rest of the world gets it. In fact, on  Monday, the nations of the world will gather in New York to map out the  next steps on climate action. They will be building on the Paris  climate agreement. They will be working together to figure out how we  can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent over the next decade.   But if the American people get it and all of these young people all  over the world get it, it is fair to ask: Where is American leadership  right now? Where is this administration right now? Unfortunately, Mr.  Levin alluded to the worst of it: this fight over California's clean  car authority. They are trying to take us backward in the wrong  direction. We just don't have time for that if we are serious about  this crisis.   Mr. Levin talked about the fact that our authority under the Clean  Air Act goes back to 1967. I think it was a Governor named Ronald  Reagan, actually, who got us started on this critical authority. It has  been so successful. California has used it to protect clean air over 50  times.   Madam Speaker, I would ask Congressman Levin if he knows how many of  those times, the 50 times that we have used that Clean Air Act  authority, how many of those were revoked?  [[Page H7822]]  Zero. It has never been revoked. It has always been upheld, and it has  been wildly successful in helping California improve air quality,  reduce smog, and improve public health. We have added jobs and the  economy has continued to grow.   We have been able to do all this in a way that helped stimulate the  auto industry, to innovate, and to bring new and very desirable models  of vehicles to market that wouldn't be there if it weren't for  California's leadership on clean car standards, and, of course, more  than a dozen other States that have followed suit and joined us as  clean car States.   What President Trump is trying to do is absolutely unprecedented in  American history and it is legally dubious. He is wrong on the law and  he is wrong on the policy. It is the most serious assault on State  authority and on public health that you could imagine. And yet, with  this administration, hey, it is just another day in the Trump White  House, unfortunately.   This House, of course, the people's House, gets it. We have already  started to take action. We are working to block the Trump  administration's worst climate rollbacks.   Just last week, a bipartisan majority of this House voted to approve  my bill to protect the Arctic refuge from this crazy ``drill  everywhere'' mandate that they put into the Republican tax scam in  2017. We also passed bills to protect the Pacific, Atlantic, and  Florida Gulf Coasts from these plans to do more offshore drilling.  These are important steps in the fight to confront the climate crisis.   And, of course, there was H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, which  would block President Trump's attempt to take us out of the Paris  climate agreement.   Let's keep working together in the people's House. Let's keep working  with this energized, motivated, incredibly passionate new generation of  leaders that we are seeing all over the country and all over the world.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Levin for his leadership.
