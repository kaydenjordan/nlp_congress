 Mr. President, I rise today about a resolution to make it  harder for students--all students--to have access to school meals. I am  referring to S.J. Res. 42. We deal with a lot of complex issues here  every day. This is not a complex issue.   First, the Federal policy: the USDA memo clarifying that State  agencies and programs participating in Federal school meal programs are  required to abide by our Nation's anti-discrimination laws. This means  that they cannot deny access to kids on the basis of their gender  identity or sexual orientation. In other words, schools may not deny  lunch to LGBTQ+ kids.   Now, this isn't some strange, new interpretation of the law that USDA  came up with and announced out of the blue; this is the USDA  implementing anti-discrimination laws that apply across government, in  line with the Supreme Court's reading. This is what the Republicans  attempted to overturn with S.J. Res. 42.   Of course, S.J. Res. 42 was never really just about school lunches.  The goal was to send a message to LGBTQ+ kids that they are not  welcome, to send a message that it is OK to discriminate against these  kids because of who they are. I want to be very clear. That is wrong.  We proudly stand with LGBTQ+ kids.   Your rights matter. You are welcome at school.   The USDA guidance will help kids. It will also reduce discrimination  and bring Agency guidance in line with Supreme Court precedent.   The USDA policy will also ensure that hungry kids get the food they  need to grow and to do well in school. According to census data, LGBTQ+  individuals are almost twice as likely to live in a household that  experiences food insecurity, and trans individuals are almost three  times more likely not to have enough food to eat, as compared to  cisgender individuals.   The last thing our kids need is adults behaving like classroom  bullies and trying to justify taking away their lunches. I am glad the  Senate rejected this resolution.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to offer my  congratulations to Ms. Lydia Edwards as she becomes a Judge Advocate  General in the Massachusetts Army National Guard. Senator Edwards has  devoted her career to protecting our most vulnerable--from her time as  a public interest attorney with Greater Boston Legal Services, to her  service on the Boston City Council, to her current role as  Massachusetts State senator, Lydia Edwards never forgets who she is  fighting for. Lydia has achieved great things for people across the  Commonwealth, including passing the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights,  protecting Boston's affordable housing stock, creating the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund, passing the CROWN Act, which bans discrimination  based on hair texture or style, and reforming the budgetary process to  bring participatory budgeting to the city of Boston.   Lydia is a dedicated public servant who approaches every question  before  [[Page S5314]]  her with passion, deep intellect, and a commitment to make government  work for everyone, not just those at the top. It is a reflection of  Lydia's character and her commitment to our country that Lydia has  chosen to serve not only in the State senate but also as a member of  the Massachusetts National Guard. I congratulate Lydia on her  commissioning as a Judge Advocate General officer and am grateful for  her continued partnership and service.   I once again congratulate her on her commissioning and wish her the  best of luck in this new chapter.                            ____________________
