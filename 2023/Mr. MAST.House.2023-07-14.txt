 Mr. Chair, I am amazed at the bigoted comments I am hearing  from the other side right now, literally stating that units need to  look a certain way. There have to be people of certain colors in these  units. It is purely idiotic. It is dangerous.   War is not a game. It is always dangerous. It is very often deadly. I  damn near gave my life for this country, and I can tell you the last  thing I cared about was the color of the snipers that had my back or  the color of the medics that were putting tourniquets on each of my  legs and my left arm when I was injured on the battlefield. It didn't  matter if they were Black, White, Brown.   None of that mattered when they were recruited into the military, and  it didn't matter as they were serving. It has absolutely zero place,  and you are literally putting the lives of our servicemembers in  danger. You are concretely saying that units need to look a certain way  by color.   I just pose this quick question. I don't know how much time I have  remaining, but I will bet you all over there can't tell me what my  background is. Am I part Black? Part Brown? Part White? What am I?   I yield time to you for a colloquy if you want to answer that. What  am I?    Mr. Chair, I will bet they can't tell me. I hear silence  because you don't know what I am. You don't know that I am half  Mexican. You can't look at me and see that, but you believe that units  should be made up of something that you can't see and that you can't  ask about. It is idiotic policy and dangerous for our servicemembers,  and they deserve better from the other side.
