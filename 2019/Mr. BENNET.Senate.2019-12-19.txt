 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the President's nominees  for the Federal bench. I strongly believe that women should be in  charge of their own healthcare decisions. Family planning choices are  deeply personal, and women should be free to make the choice that is  right for them, their family, faith, personal beliefs, or medical  needs. As States like Alabama, Georgia, and others attempt to roll back  women's access to reproductive healthcare, it is more important than  ever that we work together to protect this right.   Unfortunately, too many of President Trump's nominees to the Federal  courts hold beliefs that fail to respect long-settled precedent on  women's healthcare. For example, the Senate recently voted to confirm  Sarah Pitlyk to a Federal district court. As an attorney, she defended  Iowa's unconstitutional ban on abortions at 6 weeks. Pitlyk has also  worked to defend the Trump administration's Title X gag rule, which  prohibits healthcare providers who receive this critical funding from  discussing the full range of family planning options with their  patients. And finally, she lacked any meaningful trial experience. It  is no wonder the American Bar Association found that she was  unqualified to serve on the district court.   Despite Roe v. Wade being the law of the land, too many of President  Trump's nominees have actively sought to undermine the rights of women  to control their own reproductive health choices. Their amicus briefs,  legal writings, and arguments demonstrate a hostility towards women's  rights that are incompatible with the role of a Federal judge.   I will continue to evaluate President Trump's judicial nominees based  on their stances on women's reproductive health and remain committed to  voting for nominees who have a strong record on upholding  constitutionally protected reproductive healthcare rights. Accordingly,  had I been present in the Senate, I would have voted against the  nominations of Michael Park to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Second Circuit, Dan Collins to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Ninth Circuit, Peter Phipps to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third  Circuit, Wendy Williams Berger to the U.S. District Court for the  Middle District of Florida, Brian Buescher to the U.S. District Court  for the District of Nebraska, Michael Liburdi to the U.S. District  Court for the District of Arizona, Sean Jordan to the U.S. District  Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Brantley Starr to the U.S.  District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Jeffrey Vincent  Brown to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas,  and William Shaw Stickman IV to the U.S. District Court for the Western  District of Pennsylvania, Stephen Menashi to serve on the Second  Circuit Court of Appeals and Lawrence VanDyke to serve on the Ninth  Circuit Court of Appeals.   Moving forward, it is my hope that the President will nominate  individuals who respect women's healthcare decisions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few moments to  recognize my colleague and friend, Senator Isakson from Georgia.   When I first came to the Senate in 2009--a decade ago, it surprises  me to say--I was on the Banking Committee. We were in the middle of the  worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and millions of  Americans were losing their homes each month.   We held a hearing on housing, and I remember Senator Isakson coming  to testify because, before he was in politics, he had spent several  years in the private sector working in real estate. I appreciated that  moment because, one, I had also spent some time in business before  politics, and two, because it was so refreshing to hear from someone  who actually knew what they were talking about.   Over the past 10 years, I have had the benefit of Senator Isakson's  experience, friendship, and wisdom on both the HELP and Finance  Committees.   In Johnny, so many of us have had a model for how to get things done  even in this moment of partisan division. He was a welcome throwback to  a time when people didn't come to this town just to spend every moment  on cable news but to get things done for the people they came here to  represent.   Johnny's record suggests there is nothing quaint or naive about that  approach to the work because over his 15 years in the Senate, he has  managed to secure quite a few bipartisan accomplishments, including  several things we have worked on together.   I remember Johnny really digging in and getting his hands dirty on  the SAVE Act, our bill to make Federal mortgage loan agencies consider  the returns from energy efficiency when they determine your ability to  make your monthly payments. We passed that out of the Senate, and it  was a  [[Page S7201]]  tremendous credit to Johnny's determination and focus.   We passed a bill to modernize the FDA's medical device inspections  and to strengthen patient access to rehabilitation hospitals in  Colorado and Georgia. We passed an amendment to strengthen funding for  early learning programs. And we introduced bills together to provide  tax relief for AmeriCorps members who earned Segal Awards to help pay  for college.   I could go on, and it is a credit to Johnny's broad record of  bipartisan work.   Johnny has been a particular champion for our veterans. As a former  member of the Georgia Air National Guard, Johnny has been a steady and  effective advocate for those who have served. Last year, he was  instrumental in passing a bipartisan bill to make it far easier for  veterans to take their benefits to private doctors for care, among  other long-overdue reforms. With our large population of veterans in  Colorado, we were especially grateful to Johnny for his leadership.   There is a lot more I could share, but the point is, Johnny has used  his time here well--with real results for the people of Georgia. He  didn't do it through bullying or shouting or threatening to bring the  Senate to its knees if he didn't get his way. He did it Johnny's way-- with unfailing kindness, grace, humor, and dogged persistence. It would  be easy to mistake Johnny's kindness for a lack of intensity or  determination, but behind his easy smile is a fierce devotion to  Georgia and a welcome impatience with the inaction of this town.   That approach is how Johnny leaves this body not only with a  considerable record of accomplishment but with a long list of admirers  on both sides of the aisle who are now wondering who is going to host  the annual bipartisan BBQ. We are sad to see him go, and we wish him  all the best as he returns to Georgia to focus on his health and spend  time with his wife, Diane, their three kids and eight grandkids.   Johnny, I wish you the very best. Know that the Senate will feel your  absence and cherish the example you set here.                            ____________________
