 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge  Healthy Savannah for earning one of only two 2022 REACH Lark Galloway- Gilliam Awards for Advancing Health Equity Challenge.   Healthy Savannah is a public-private partnership of more than 200  businesses, nonprofits, faith- and community-based organizations,  schools, and healthcare and government agencies.   Healthy Savannah aims to make Savannah, Georgia, a healthier place to  live with a particular focus on reducing health disparities and  increasing health equity for African Americans with lower incomes and  those disproportionately affected by chronic disease.   The CDC chose Healthy Savannah for this award because of its  outstanding work improving the health and well-being of people in the  communities in which they live. The members of the organizations within  Healthy Savannah are all to be commended for the hard work and  dedication that they have towards improving the lives of members of  their communities.   Congratulations, Healthy Savannah, and thank you for continuing to  make our community a healthier place to live.                       Honoring Fire Chief Randy Mobley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Fire  Chief Randy Mobley, an exceptional Georgian and selfless leader in his  community.   In 1982, Mr. Mobley was hired as a fireman. Chief Mobley went on to  dedicate 40 years of service to the city of Brunswick, 10 of which were  spent as the fire chief.   Over four decades of noble labor, Randy has implemented many programs  that have helped keep Brunswick citizens safe.   His safety smoke alarm program provided smoke alarms to all residents  in his community. Through this program, Brunswick was able to maintain  a class 1 ISO insurance rating, the highest protection rating you can  receive.   What an inspiration it is to go to work every day and put your own  life on the line to save others. Individuals like Chief Randy Mobley  make me proud to represent the First Congressional District of Georgia.                   75th Anniversary of Indian Independence     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  75th anniversary of India's independence from the British Empire.   On August 15, 1947, the Parliament passed the Indian Independence  Act, officially establishing India as a sovereign nation after nearly  90 years under the Raj. This act of Parliament marked the creation of  the largest democracy in history, responsible for governing a nation  over a billion strong.   Though it may not seem like it at first glance, the United States and  India share much in common. Our national identities were both forged  from a rejection of British rule by crown or company. We both recognize  the vital importance of autonomy, of independence, and freedom from  foreign rulers.   India's commitment to democracy and self-government has been  unwavering in the past decades, and its future today is brighter than  ever before.   I am excited for America's relationship with India to continue  flourishing, as it has for the past 75 years, and I am proud to call  the people of India our friends.                     Remembering Patricia ``Pat'' Bohler     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Patricia ``Pat'' Bohler, a woman who was a staple within the Garden  City community for over 50 years.    After being born in Texas, Pat moved to Georgia, where she attended  Armstrong State University, earning a degree in education before  earning her master's degree at Georgia Southern University.   As a teacher with the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System,  she touched the lives of countless elementary-aged children. Her work  as a title I reading teacher will shape generations to come.   In a display of her true desire to serve the community around her,  she spent considerable time teaching adult education classes.   Pat faithfully attended and served at Garden City United Methodist  Church, where she was a member for 57 years. She taught Sunday school  and was the president of the United Methodist Women. Outside of this,  she was active as a Girl Scout leader and softball coach.   She raised four daughters with poise and taught them the values of  education, service, and community.   She will be deeply missed and remembered by the innumerable lives she  shaped.   I extend my sincere condolences to Pat's family, friends, and  community.                            ____________________
