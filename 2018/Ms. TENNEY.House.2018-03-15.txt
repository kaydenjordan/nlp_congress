 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bipartisan legislation, H.R.  4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement Act, introduced by my colleague  from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur).   Congratulations to Mr. MacArthur and the chairman for bringing this  great legislation to the floor.   This legislation would increase, from $50 million to $75 million, the  offering exemption amount that companies can offer under the Securities  and Exchange Commission's, the SEC, Tier 2 of Regulation A, an  amendment to the 2012 JOBS Act.   As the owner of a small business, I understand firsthand the vital  importance of making our Nation's business climate competitive at all  levels. Small businesses create nearly 70 percent of the new jobs in  our country. Yet small businesses are only starting to see a resurgence  from the struggling ecosystem created in the last Presidential era.  Thanks to the recent tax cuts and regulatory changes, we have seen  continued growth.   H.R. 4263 would be the next step toward helping small companies raise  necessary equity capital to enable them to grow and compete in a  changing and dynamic marketplace. This will result in more jobs and  more opportunities for our communities.   This bill would expand the SEC's Regulation A+ from $50 million to  $75 million, and it would allow companies to consider mini IPOs or mini  initial public offerings at a less costly alternative to raising  capital.   In my district, it is difficult to raise capital and secure a steady  line of credit for developing and sustaining small businesses. I have  experienced this very difficulty and struggle with clients I have  represented in my own legal practice.   This bill would help tremendously in improving access to capital for  small companies that ultimately are the drivers of job growth in New  York and across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Mr. MacArthur and the bipartisan  group of cosponsors for their hard work, and I urge my colleagues to  support this great legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exciting spring  tradition in upstate New York and, particularly, the 22nd Congressional  District.   Vernon-Verona-Sherrill School District, or VVS, is holding its Maple  Weekend this coming weekend. Maple Weekend is run for two weekends each  year by the Future Farmers of America, also known as FFA. This FFA  organization has approximately 125 members, and its success has been  recognized both on the State and national levels.   Despite the two nor'easters that New York has received in March  alone, VVS' FFA organization has worked tirelessly to prepare for the  upcoming maple season. This weekend, VVS will join 170 other local  organizations across New York to prepare demonstrations on how to  harvest and produce maple syrup products, host pancake breakfasts which  feature our award-winning syrup, and provide tours of the mouthwatering  ``sugar shack,'' where maple products are created.   Last year, VVS' Maple Weekend extravaganza drew more than 2,000  visitors. I am thrilled to attend each year and to take part in this  educational and delicious local event that is expertly organized each  year by high school students from FFA.   These same FFA members from VVS travel throughout New York State,  from Buffalo to New York City, using their Maple Syrup Trailer to  educate other high school students across our State, teaching them how  to produce maple syrup and to produce maple candies and other delicious  maple products.   New York State still produces the very best maple syrup in the world  and is continually winning the award for the best maple syrup.   I would like to congratulate these outstanding VVS and FFA students  on their hard work, and I wish them and the hundreds of other maple  producers across the State the best of luck during this very difficult  season for maple production.                            ____________________
