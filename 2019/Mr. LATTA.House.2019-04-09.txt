 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1644, the government  takeover of the internet act.   This is not about net neutrality. If this was about net neutrality,  we would be operating under the longstanding bipartisan premise that  net neutrality would be achieved without title II.   Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I agree that  Congress needed to codify basic internet protection principles, such as  no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization. The net  neutrality bill I introduced is based directly upon the proposal from  former Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman, which would prevent  internet service providers from engaging in much of the discriminatory  behavior the majority is concerned about. It would do so under title I.   Both former Republican and Democratic Federal Communications  Commission Chairmen have also recognized that net neutrality can be  resolved without vastly expanding the FCC's power under title II.   It is important to recognize the difference between title I and title  II. The internet is currently regulated under title I, which means it  is considered an information service. Besides the 2 years the FCC's  2015 order was in effect, the internet has always operated under title  I, since its infancy.   Chairman Wheeler put the internet under title II rules that classify  broadband as a telecommunication service. These rules were created in  the 1930s for the monopoly telephone systems and, obviously, do not fit  on an innovative engine that has thrived on minimal government  involvement.   Although the exact framework of net neutrality has been a bipartisan  issue these past 10 years, we are at a point where Republicans and  Democrats are aligned on bright-line principles to preserve a free and  open internet. Rather than push through purely partisan legislation  drafted by a group of unelected bureaucrats, I encourage my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1644, so we can engage in a truly bipartisan  process on net neutrality and resolve this issue once and for all.   There is a menu of legislative options on the table. Each of these  net neutrality bills would ensure that the FCC is a cop on the beat to  keep the internet free and open from discriminatory conduct by ISPs.   As acknowledged by H.R. 1644's sponsor, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, the bill does not preserve all aspects of a free and open  internet because it does not address blocking and prioritization done  by edge providers.   It also isn't clear if the bill addresses ambiguous definitions from  the 2015 order for specialized services or recognizes the unintended  consequences in innovations like advanced network slicing capabilities  in 5G.   The bill also does not protect small businesses. With over 3,000 ISPs  in our country, most of which are small or very small, we should make  it a priority to shield these businesses from onerous regulations.   I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee that would do just  that. It would have allowed small ISPs to focus better on expanding  their networks and serving their customers. This amendment was based on  a bipartisan compromise made in the 114th Congress and the 115th  Congress that unanimously passed the House and afforded small and often  rural ISPs predictability.   My Democratic colleagues supported the 5-year exemption and 250,000- subscriber limit last Congress but seem to have forgotten their  statements about the need to allow small ISPs to provide broadband  access rather than being bogged down with these regulations.                                time  1545    We have seen broadband investment and innovation decline during the  time the internet was regulated under the framework that H.R. 1644  would establish. This has been verified through studies, but also in a  recent Energy and Commerce Committee hearing when a witness who owns a  small ISP in Oregon testified on the hampering effects the 2015 order  had on his own business. While we can't quantify lost investment, we do  not know the advancements in technology we have missed out on due to  limited resources directed toward innovation.   On the point of not knowing, we still do not know the 700-plus  regulations that H.R. 1644 would permanently forbear from either.  Before we permanently lock in anything, I believe Congress should know  exactly what we are locking in. We have pressed the majority for the  list multiple times and have not received it. That is why I filed an  amendment that would have required the Federal Communications  Commission to produce this list if the bill does become law.   I support net neutrality, but I cannot and do not support H.R. 1644.  We should be providing the American people with a real net neutrality  solution rather than pushing forward an agenda that does not have the  capability to become law and won't protect the internet.   I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Chairman.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington State (Mrs. Rodgers).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close if the gentleman is. I  have no more speakers.   Madam Chair, how much time do I have?    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In this debate today, we have heard both sides, but I really believe  that, on our side, the American people don't want to have a takeover of  the internet. As we have spoken on our side, we all believe in the same  things. We don't want throttling; we don't blocking; and we don't want  paid prioritization out there.   As has been stated already earlier today, we have had three bills  that were introduced, one being my piece of legislation that had been  introduced by the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee  that set forth those policies and also stating that it should not have  title II in it because, again, you do not want to have the heavy hand  of government coming in on this.   We had the Republican leader of the full committee with his  legislation, taking what the FCC has done and putting in legislation to  make sure, again, we don't have the blocking and the throttling.   The gentlewoman from Washington State, when you look at her  legislation, again, it came from a Democratic legislature, signed by a  Democratic Governor, which stated the same things: You don't want to  have the throttling, blocking, or paid prioritization.   The American people want to make sure that the internet is out there,  that it is working, and that you don't have that heavy hand.   I think it is also important, as has been noted during the debate-- what are we looking at here? We have had past FCC Chairmen all saying  the same thing, except for Chairman Wheeler when he changed and went  with the 2015 order. But Republicans and Democrats have all said the  same thing, that this is an information service, not a  telecommunications service that would be coming under the draconian  laws of the 1930s that were really to take care of the Ma Bells out  there.   We also have seen that this bill does not cover the edge providers,  and a lot of people would be surprised about that. The question is  raised: Why aren't they included in this piece of legislation? Because  if you want to make sure that everyone is included, you should have  been looking at it in this piece of legislation, because when you are  looking at the Facebook and the Twitters out there, what is happening  with them?   I also want to point out that I know there is some concern when this  was going on back in 2015 and what happened when the current FCC  rescinded the order. You know, the internet did not end. I did not get  calls the next day saying I was not able to go online. I wasn't unable  to do our work or do anything like that. I never received a call. So I  think it is important we note that.   At the same time, what we have also discussed here today, and also in  committee, is that we would like to see the 700 rules and the regs out  there that the FCC forbore on. We still don't have those. I have asked,  through my amendment, that we get those because I think it is important  we know what that is, because how do you know what they are doing if  you don't see it?   I think that it is very important that these facts are considered. I  think it is important that we have had this debate today. But I think  it is also important that we don't want to have a takeover by the  government of the internet because we want to make sure that it does  what it has always done. It is something that was formed out there that  had what they called a light touch to let it go forward, so I think it  is important that we do that.   For those reasons, Madam Chair, I would recommend a ``no'' vote on  H.R. 1644, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 2.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment that would  require the Federal Communications Commission to provide a list of the  700 rules and regulations it claims it forbore from in the 2015 Open  Internet Order.   This list will be provided to the Energy and Commerce Committee and  the Senate Commerce Committee within 3 days of enactment of H.R. 1644.   The need for this amendment arises out of the majority's claim that  H.R. 1644 would lock in all provisions of law and regulations that the  FCC forbore from applying to internet service providers in 2015.   At that time, the FCC claimed it forbore from applying over 700  regulations, but never made clear what 700 rules it was exempting ISPs  from under title II.   For broadband providers to know what regulations actually apply to  them, they need to know what provisions of law the FCC forbore from.   For the FCC to arrive at the number of over 700, it seems they must  have analyzed the Code of Federal Regulations to determine which rules  were applicable to broadband and which were not, but the FCC never made  that list public.   We have asked the majority on multiple occasions for help tracking  down that list. Instead of helping locate it, the majority has doubled  down on the public statements made by the Obama FCC quantifying that  number.   Now that H.R. 1644 might be passed by the House of Representatives,  it is time to make it clear which rules of the road will not apply to  broadband providers.   H.R. 1644 already imposes enough uncertainty on broadband providers,  because it would give the FCC broad authority under title II to  regulate the internet beyond even the bright-line rules.   If we cannot clear up that uncertainty before this bill gets passed,  we should do all we can to let the public know what the bill does after  it would become law.   Unless we require the FCC to produce that list, we will never know  what is in the bill.   We must do better for the American public and provide more  transparency to support broadband employment, investment, and growth.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the Republican leader of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I appreciate my colleague, the gentlewoman's  concern for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups and the possible impact  of the 2015 Open Internet Order on their ability to get connected  online and have access to all the economic and social opportunities the  internet has made possible. These are all very important questions to  consider, and so I will not oppose this amendment.   However, I hope my colleagues will consider just as much the  possibility that throwing the internet into title II and all of the  heavy-handed government regulation that it represents may not be the  best way to address the concerns of these populations.   We completely agree with the transformative impact of the internet on  minorities, rural populations, individuals with disabilities, the  elderly, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. In many ways, the  internet is even more important to these populations than to anyone  else.   So what would really help to bridge the digital divide and get more  of these folks connected? I would argue what is most critical in this  problem we are all trying to solve is, number one, to encourage  investment.   But you have heard me say it before, and I will say it again: Title  II is a devastating investment killer. We saw those numbers take a dip  after the FCC diverged from the longstanding bipartisan path of light- touch regulation into the 1930s era monopoly regulation of title II.   So what impact would the title II reclassification have on the  disadvantaged and vulnerable populations we are talking about with this  amendment? How will it impact future deployment that could connect  them? Maybe we should also have the GAO looking into that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I appreciate my colleague's interest, the  gentleman's interest in stand-alone broadband. As he knows, this is a  really important issue, especially in rural America, and one that the  FCC has spent considerable time on, in fact, one that I have spent  considerable time on as one of the co-chairs of the Rural Broadband  Caucus.   So I do not oppose this amendment, but I want to observe here that  this amendment will not do anything to relieve the smallest ISPs found  in the most rural areas from some of the worst excesses of this bill.   So I must say, I am disappointed that our friends in the majority  refuse to give us a vote on my amendment, which would have included the  language on small businesses that was passed unanimously by the House  in the last two Congresses.   This amendment was exactly the same as the one that the Democrats  have agreed--twice--to tie to the original 2015 order. It would have  extended the exemption for small ISPs from the Obama FCC's enhanced  transparency rule for 5 years and expanded the exemption to include  businesses with 250,000 subscribers or fewer.   I am supportive of protecting the consumers of small ISPs, but these  enhanced disclosures placed an unnecessary regulatory burden on small  businesses and distracted them from working to bring broadband internet  access to customers across the country, especially those in rural  America.   My colleagues in the majority seem supportive of the plight of the  small, rural ISPs but could not support this amendment at  subcommittee--even though they had voted to support it twice before.  Instead, they asked us to find yet another bipartisan agreement on an  issue that we have already spent hours negotiating and have already  found common ground.   We held up our end of the bargain, even as we walked away from the  deal that they agreed to twice before and proceeded to dig in on terms  of the FCC's 2015 order instead.   Although time has passed since the Small Business Broadband  Deployment Act, H.R. 4596, passed the House unanimously in the 114th  Congress with a vote of 411-0 and was reintroduced in the 115th  Congress and passed on voice vote as H.R. 288, the need still exists to  promote the continued deployment of broadband and prevent small ISPs  from becoming burdened with additional requirements that make it more  difficult to do what they are in business to do. In fact, based on our  hearings in the past Congress and some of the statements on the floor  today, I think it is safe to say there is bipartisan consensus on the  need to support rural broadband for consumers.   As a reminder, my amendment would not have let small ISPs skirt  transparency. Instead, they would follow the less onerous transparency  rules adopted by the FCC in 2010. So consumers would still have access  to the information needed to make informed decisions about their  internet service, and ISPs could focus on providing service rather than  cumbersome regulatory requirements.   I believe my friends across the aisle when they say they care about  expanding broadband in rural America and closing the digital divide.  Although, if they truly cared as much as they claim to, I would have  expected my amendment to be made in order and to be adopted unanimously  as it has been by the House in the past.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we do not oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I agree with the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Porter), my colleague, that FCC enforcement is important in any  area that the agency regulates, and that is why we will not oppose this  amendment.   That is also why we in the majority have asked, at several hearings,  when we were going to have our first FCC oversight hearing this  Congress. We are 4 months into this Congress, and the majority has yet  to bring the FCC before the committee to answer questions relating to  its past enforcement efforts on ISPs, the impact of this legislation,  and other topics pending at the FCC.   This is an issue that could have gained by having the FCC before the  committee rather than the topic being delegated to a report that does  not pertain to the base bill.   This is also an issue that could have gained from bipartisan  negotiations. All three Republican net neutrality bills would have the  FCC oversee ISP practices and enforce net neutrality to keep a free and  open internet.   There is more agreement here than the majority would have you  believe. There is also a role for the FCC to have in overseeing net  neutrality and maintaining a free and open internet, and there should  be clear net neutrality rules on the book.   Where we disagree is on giving the FCC unchecked powers to regulate  the internet and determine on its own what is just and reasonable. That  is not net neutrality.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I am pleased to see the Democrats bring so  many ideas today as it comes to rural broadband, and because of that,  we will not oppose this amendment.   The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson) on our committee has been a  strong advocate of improving the 477 data at the FCC and how to have  the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the  NTIA, more engaged in mapping by aggregating resources across the  Federal Government. He was part of an effort  [[Page H3185]]  last fall that shared a draft reauthorization of NTIA with the  Democrats that would have helped get more granular information.  Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle put down  their pens on this effort.   In our markup last week, Mr. Johnson offered an amendment that was  voted down by the majority that would have eased the title II albatross  from small rural carriers. Sadly, this was rejected. Coincidentally, we  saw a number of the Democratic amendments made in order to study the  problems of rural broadband deployment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
