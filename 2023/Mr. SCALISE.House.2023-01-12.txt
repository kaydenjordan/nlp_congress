 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. Rodgers), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and my  dear friend, for yielding and for bringing this legislation, H.R. 22,  to the floor. It is such an important piece of legislation to start  standing up for America's national security.   If you think about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, just think of the  first word in that name, ``strategic.'' It is there for America's  national security.   First of all, raiding SPR, as it is referred to, President Biden has  done over and over again, depleting 40 percent of our national security  strategic reserve, not to move world oil prices.   As you can see, Mr. Speaker, multiple times, starting in November  2021, President Biden has raided SPR because he has attacked American  energy. As he attacked American energy, starting on his first day in  office, the price of oil and gasoline at the pump subsequently has  risen dramatically, crushing middle-class families. So, he started  feeling the heat.   His answer should have been to reverse the failed policies that are  dramatically increasing gas prices by crushing American energy. That is  not what President Biden did because the extremists on the left don't  want that. They won't allow him to do it.   Then, he turned to SPR, and he said, well, maybe we can just try to  trick the American people by raiding SPR. So, he did. When he raided  it, what happened? You got a sugar high for about a week, and, boom,  the price started going back up again because the world markets  recognized President Biden has taken American energy off the market.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, we are the only country in the world that  can produce massive quantities of oil that is a free-market country.  The rest of the countries that have an abundant supply are cartels:  OPEC, Russia, Iran, Venezuela. They want a high price. The only check- and-balance to high prices of oil is a free-market, producing America.   By the way, if you want to hide behind the Green New Deal and global  warming and whatever other names they attach to it, climate change-- they change the name every couple of years because the American people  figure out that all it is is an attack on American energy.   The price keeps going up because we are shutting off the cleanest  producing country in the world.   Do you want to lower carbon emissions in the world? Produce more oil  in America. It is not just about creating more jobs. It is not just  about our national security, Mr. Speaker. It is about actually reducing  global emissions.   This bill addresses President Biden selling our strategic reserves to  China. China is building about a new coal plant every week,  dramatically increasing carbon emissions, while President Biden shuts  down American manufacturing and production, shuts down oil, which, by  the way, we were reducing emissions during those times when we were  producing energy.   Over and over again, raided SPR, raided SPR, raided SPR. The price  kept going up. What went down is America's national security. That is  what we are getting to the heart of here, 40 percent of our reserves.   We have two different ways to get energy. We can actually produce it.  As the moniker right above the Speaker's rostrum says, let us develop  our natural resources. We have natural resources. We have the best  technology in the world. We can produce it cleaner than anybody else in  the world. As long as we are producing energy, it actually can lower  the cost.   We don't just produce enough for ourselves because, by the way, if we  weren't allowed to export energy, then you would see a decrease in  production. You would see a decrease in exploration. It is like a  farmer. If a farmer can only produce and sell in America, they are  going to plant a lot less because they can't have access to world  markets.    You want to have access to world markets, but you want to also have a  reserve in case--not in case you have a failed policy, as is what we  are seeing with President Biden. You want to reserve in case there is a  natural disaster. If a hurricane hits the Gulf of Mexico, as we have  seen, it actually spikes the price, so you have a brief disruption, and  you want a reserve to fill that need. If you have some kind of national  security emergency, like they did in the 1970s--by the way, that is  when SPR was created.   That is when we created this reserve for our country, when cartels  controlled world oil markets, because we didn't have the technology to  access like we do today. We didn't have fracking technology. We didn't  have the ability to go 5,000 feet in the deep waters of the Gulf of  Mexico to find billion-barrel reserves like we do today.   The cartels controlled everything. There were lines at the pump. You  had to have an even-numbered license plate to get gasoline on a certain  day. That was the 1970s. So, Congress created SPR for our national  security.   I understand a little history lesson might help people recognize how  we got here. It is not by accident that we got here. We should want, as  Congress, to be able to work together to fix this problem, to address  the fact that prices have gone up not just for gasoline at the pump but  also when people are heating their homes in a cold winter. The price  shouldn't be that high.   By the way, we were also, by exporting energy, helping our friends  around the world so we don't have to be dependent on oil or natural gas  from other places.   As was the case in the buildup to Afghanistan, Putin was making about  $700 million a day, Mr. Speaker, selling his oil to America and Europe  because President Biden shut off the American supply. No reason that  should have happened, but that is what got us here.   What can get us out? First, let me remind you what else got us here  because they are trying to blame everybody else under the Sun. It is  Putin's fault. It is the oil companies' fault. It is the weather's  fault.   It is President Biden's fault. Day one, he started mountains of rules  and regulations. These aren't laws passed by Congress, by the way.  These are rules and regulations that have come out of the Biden  administration just in the last 2 years attacking American energy, not  foreign countries. President Biden was okay with pipelines from Russia  to Europe, but he said ``no'' on day one to a pipeline from Canada to  America.   All of these actions had a cost. The cost is dramatic prices at the  pump for hardworking families, crushing the lowest income families  amongst us.   What agencies, by the way, are represented here? The Department of  Energy went after American energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission, through woke  policies, went after American energy. The Department of Agriculture,  yes, went after American energy in these rules and regs. The Council on  Environmental Quality, the Department of State--that gets to the  Keystone pipeline. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Department  of Justice,  [[Page H216]]  and, yes, the Department of the Interior all represented right here in  rules and regulations that crushed American energy, making us more  dependent on foreign countries and leading to President Biden raiding  our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 40 percent, making our country less  safe.   This foolishness has to end. We can solve this problem.                                time  1015    Now, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers in her committee, they actually have real  ideas about how to solve this problem. The good news is, Mr. Speaker,  under this majority we are going to be bringing bills through committee  to the floor to fix this problem.   Now, on the other side today you hear them talking about this magic  bill. They have got a bill. Boy, if we just killed this bill--because  they want to keep selling our strategic reserves to China; 950,000  barrels already that President Biden has sold to China--they have some  magic answer.   My question would be: Where was that magic answer 2 years ago, 2  months ago, 2 weeks ago when they were in the majority?   They had the House, Senate, and White House, and, I guess, in the  last 2 weeks they finally figured out the answer because they surely  didn't pass that to the President 2 weeks ago, 2 months ago, or 2 years  ago.   What they did do is they brought mountains and mountains of  regulations to crush American energy. Then Biden gets on a plane called  Air Force One. We have checked it, there are no solar panels on the  wings of Air Force One. It actually uses jet fuel.   He flies to Saudi Arabia and begs Saudi princes to produce more  energy because he shut down America's energy production. No leases, no  pipelines, no permits. He has done all those things, and it led to  higher prices. He didn't have to get on Air Force One and fly thousands  of miles back and forth.   Who knows what the carbon footprint of that is?   I would love to see the press dig into that because they love talking  about carbon footprints for other things.   He didn't have to get on Air Force One at all. He could have picked  up the phone and called Port Fourchon in Louisiana and said: Will you  produce more energy in America? It is cleaner, more efficient, and  there are better jobs than anywhere else in the world. He didn't do  that.   It is time we get smart policies. It is time we have some common  sense in our energy policy, so we stop crushing those middle-class  families.   To sell our oil to China?   Not just our oil, our reserves. This is our piggy bank in case there  is a disaster. He has depleted 40 percent of it, and he keeps reducing  it to mask his failed policies.   Let's get the policy right and start fighting for those hardworking  families who are suffering because of this.   Let's pass this legislation. Let's keep going to work for those  families.
