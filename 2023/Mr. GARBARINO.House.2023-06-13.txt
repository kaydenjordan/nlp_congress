 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding the  Presidential veto of H.J. Res. 42, disapproving the action of the  District of Columbia Council and approving the Comprehensive Policing  and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022.   Democrat politicians in cities like New York and D.C. have  continuously fed antipolice sentiment that endangers our officers and  makes it harder for them to do their jobs.   Policies like those in D.C.'s deeply misguided police reform law only  empower criminals at the expense of our men and women in blue. In fact,  since these policies were enacted, more than 1,000 officers have left  the D.C.'s police force.   Dedicated public servants are resigning in record numbers due to the  current policing environment with very few willing to take their place.  That means fewer officers to combat rising crime. This has become a  public safety crisis.   I was proud to join with Congressman Clyde to offer our joint  resolution to disapprove the D.C. law, which went on to gain a majority  of support in both the House and Senate--bipartisan majorities in both  the House and Senate.   Congress sent a clear message that enough is enough. We will not  stand by while our law enforcement officers are vilified and handcuffed  by pro-criminal/anti-cop legislation.   With this veto, President Biden showed his disregard not only for law  enforcement but also for the American people whose duly elected  Representatives voted to block this harmful D.C. legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  in favor of the override to show our brave men and women in law  enforcement that we have their backs and to reject the President's  attempt to undermine the will of Congress and the people we represent.
