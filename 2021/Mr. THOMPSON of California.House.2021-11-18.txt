 Mr. Speaker, this is historic  legislation, one of the most impactful investments in American workers,  families, and communities during my time in Congress.   This bill includes the most sweeping and ambitious climate policy  ever passed by Congress--the GREEN Act, legislation I was proud to lead  with my Democratic colleagues on the Committee on Ways and Means. It  provides 4 weeks of paid family leave and funds universal pre-K. It  extends the child tax credit, a tax cut for working families that has  dramatically reduced child poverty since it was signed into law.   This bill makes healthcare premiums more affordable, provides tax  incentives to improve disaster resiliency, and funds the VA so our  veterans get the services they earned. And this bill is paid for.   The investments in this bill are too many to list; but it is just  that, an investment. This bill will pay dividends for generations, and  I urge everyone to pass the Build Back Better Act.
