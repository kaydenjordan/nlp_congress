 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment  at New Jersey Transit.   New Jersey Transit promised the public that the Atlantic City project  will be finished by early 2019, but recently, it announced that the  Atlantic City Rail Line would be closed up to more than 5 months. That  is not an inconvenience; that is a disaster.   My constituents want service to be restored immediately, and they  want, most importantly, the truth. That is why a majority of my New  Jersey colleagues and I are sending a letter of admonishment to New  Jersey Transit.  [[Page H1432]]    Mr. Speaker, this is the time for New Jersey Transit to do the right  thing for the sake of our commuters, to do the right thing for the sake  of our workers, and to do the right thing for the State of New Jersey.  People's livelihoods and the quality of their lives depend on the  Atlantic City Rail Line.                            ____________________
