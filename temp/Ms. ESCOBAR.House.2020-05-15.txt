 Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle don't hear the suffering happening in our  communities, communities like El Paso, vulnerable communities that need  more testing, more tracing.   This bill does that. It provides that necessary step to safely  reopening our economies. It also provides $1 billion for my community  of El Paso, Texas, $35 billion for the State of Texas. For this and  many other reasons, we need to look at this as one step in a long  journey, a painful journey, but one that we are in together.                                time  1700
