 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to  commend my friend and colleague from Maine (Mr. Poliquin) for his  leadership on this important issue. H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress  Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, would help nonbanks not currently  under supervision of the Federal Reserve from stress testing  requirements.   In addition to alleviating burdensome requirements, the bill allows  the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission to issue regulations requiring financial companies  with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets to conduct a periodic  analysis of their  [[Page H1716]]  financial condition, including their liquidity.   This legislation would properly tailor Dodd-Frank's stress test  requirements in a way that is appropriately focused. This bill retains  the SEC's ability to issue stress testing as it believes appropriate.  The bill does not limit the Financial Stability Oversight Council's  authority to request the SEC to adopt suitable requirements for  advisers and funds.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the gentleman from Maine for his  commitment to this important piece of legislation. I encourage all of  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill on the  floor.   In God We Trust.
