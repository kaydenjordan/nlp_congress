 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment No. 156.   Over the past 25 years, infant adoptions have decreased, and only  about 1 percent of pregnant women choose adoption. While there are  approximately 2 million couples waiting to adopt in the United States,  there were only 18,329 domestic infant adoptions in 2014.   Unfortunately, too many women who have encountered unplanned  pregnancies report not receiving adequate information about adoption.  Everyone facing an unplanned pregnancy should have access to timely,  accurate, and noncoercive information about adoption that helps them  make their own fully informed decision.   In 2000, Congress authorized the Infant Adoption Awareness Training  Program. This program awards grants to adoption organizations to train  healthcare workers who offer health services to expectant mothers and  are trained to provide adoption information and referral.   In the year 2000, the program annually delivered training to an  estimated 10,000 healthcare workers nationwide. This program was phased  out in 2010.   This bill funds adoption awareness programs at $39.1 million. My  amendment designates $5 million of that funding to restart the Infant  Adoption Awareness Training Program with the goal of ensuring that  expectant mothers have access to timely, accurate information about  adoptions.   I also support the administration's effort to fund activities to  improve hospital-based adoption support services for our expectant  mothers. I urge them to continue this hospital-based program to ensure  that mothers who wish to make an adoption have access to comprehensive  support throughout the entire adoption process.   Adoption is a bipartisan issue, and it is vital that individuals who  are providing health services to expectant mothers are trained to  properly provide adoption information and referral.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma.    I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. I  do share her concern. That is why we are asking for $5 million of the  $39.1 million be used to give expectant mothers the opportunity to  learn fully and make a decision based on what they want to do. It is  about education. It is about making them fully aware.  [[Page H7291]]    But this is about adoption. This is not about anything else. This is  not about taking anything away from anybody. This is about giving them  the opportunity to understand the options that they do have in an  unplanned pregnancy.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the  gentlewoman's comments. What this is really about is 2 million couples  willing to adopt children in the United States. It is hard for me to  stand here today and say that it would be a much different world if  people were really given the opportunity to understand what their  options are and be able to fulfill the wishes of over 2 million couples  in the United States who are looking to adopt a child. I think that is  incredibly important, and I don't understand why we couldn't look at  something like that and say this is about adoption. That is all it is  about.   Now, this is fully endorsed, by the way, by the National Council for  Adoption.   At this time, I would also offer my condolences to Ms. DeLauro for  the loss of her mother. She is a fine lady, and I am sure that, no  matter what, she will look back on the years she spent with her mother  and cherish every one of those.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
