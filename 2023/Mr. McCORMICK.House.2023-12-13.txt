 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. G.B. Espy,  obstetrician, gynecologist, world traveler, entrepreneur, man of God,  and one of the finest men I have ever known.   On January 8, Dr. Espy will turn 88 years old.   Mr. Speaker, Dr. Espy has delivered over 65,000 babies; has performed  at least as many surgeries; has run 40 consecutive New York marathons,  including the last one at the age of 80; and he has contributed to  countless scholarships, missions, and supported friends all over the  world.   Congratulations on a life well lived. God bless you. We love you.  Semper Fidelis.                            ____________________
