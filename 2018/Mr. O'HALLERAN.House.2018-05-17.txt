 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as a former law  enforcement officer and a member of the House Law Enforcement Caucus to  honor the brave men and women in uniform who have paid the ultimate  sacrifice to protect, and to thank those officers who are putting their  lives on the line every day to protect our communities.   We owe a great debt of gratitude to these men and women and their  families, who make their own sacrifices as they see their loved ones  off every day.   I remember when I went off every day and said good-bye to my wife and  my children. I usually worked nighttime. I remember afterwards coming  home, and on some nights when an officer had been killed or shot, and  they would mention it on TV, but they wouldn't give the name out until  the family was notified. Those times for all the families in a large  major police department or a small one are traumatic.   After a while, my son, who was very young at the time, would sit on  the stairway going up to the second floor and the bedrooms late in the  evening until I came home.   I have lost friends and partners in the line of duty; one, Erwin  Jackson, after he saved my life on a robbery arrest, within a year, he  was shot dead on a call.   I have grieved with their families, and during the most difficult  times, I have experienced firsthand the real sacrifices they make.   This week, my wife, Pat, and I pause to remember our friends, reflect  on their service.   Mr. Speaker, last year, 129 officers died in the line of duty across  this country.                                time  1045    And so far this year, preliminary reports show 54 officers have died.   Arizona has lost one brave officer so far this year. The family of  Nogales Police Officer Jesus Cordova and the entire community continue  to mourn his death after he was shot and killed by a carjacking suspect  last month. He was the first Nogales officer to be shot and killed in  130 years.   These law enforcement officers served and protected their communities  admirably, and while we can never repay the debt we owe them and their  families, we will forever remember their service.   This week, 360 officers were memorialized on the National Law  Enforcement Memorial here in Washington, D.C.   Three brave Arizonans were honored: Paul Lazinsky of the El Mirage  Police Department, whose watch ended last year; Alfred Moore of the  Arizona Department of Liquor Control, whose watch ended in 1965; and  Rupert Hopkins of the Pima County Sheriff's Office, whose watch ended  in 1950.   The memorial also includes Navajo Nation Officer Houston Largo, who  died last year while responding to a domestic violence call in New  Mexico.   As we look to the future, it is important to highlight the work being  done at the local, county, and State levels to improve the relationship  between police officers and their communities.   I have seen firsthand how community policing practices benefit both  the communities and the officers on patrol. It improves safety,  increases trust, and it reduces violence. Communities across Arizona  are leading the way in developing strong relationships between these  two groups, and I applaud their hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the support I have seen this week for  our law enforcement community.   I addressed how my family felt. I have spent a lot of time at  funerals with the families of those that have fallen, too much time.  And I have spent too many times at bedsides with seriously wounded  officers. I was a homicide detective, and I investigated their  shootings. Please remember in your prayers not only the officers that  have fallen but their loved ones.                            ____________________
