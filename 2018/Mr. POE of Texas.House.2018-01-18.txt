 Mr. Speaker, Rebecca grew up in a small town in  southern Oregon. She was on the honor roll, and she played varsity  sports. She graduated high school early and immediately enrolled in  Oregon State University. However, when her daughter was born, she had  to withdraw to find a job.   Like many single moms, Rebecca struggled to make ends meet. But when  she met a man she described as ``Prince Charming,'' she thought things  were finally turning around for her. He was kind, and caring, and  offered to take care of her and her baby daughter. With expensive gifts  and trips, he treated her to a lifestyle that she had never dreamed of.  So when he asked her and her daughter to move in with him, Rebecca  thought she had hit the jackpot. But her dream quickly became another  nightmare.   When she arrived in Las Vegas at his home, she found several other  women and children already living there. This man then told her that  now she would be forced to have sex with men for money. When she  refused, he beat her up, hitting her over and over again.   Fearing for her life and the life of her child, Rebecca complied. So  for the next 6 years, Rebecca was forced to have sex with countless  strangers many times a day. Any time she stepped out of line, he beat  her up. She had her face broken in five different places. Her  trafficker even went so far as to tattoo his name on her back. Yes,  branded her like cattle. She was nothing but a piece of property to  him.   After her fourth attempt to escape, her trafficker told her that he  would start selling her young daughter for sex if she didn't comply and  submit. Feeling utterly hopeless, Rebecca tried to commit suicide two  times. She thought that ending her life was preferable to living in the  hell that she had to endure every day.   Finally, Federal agents raided her home and captured the trafficker.  But, Mr. Speaker, he eventually took a plea deal and only served 1 year  in prison for slavery. Meanwhile, Rebecca was left to deal with a  lifetime of pain and trauma. As a former judge, Mr. Speaker, I believe  the sentence was too light for a slave trader. No human being should  ever have to endure what Rebecca and other trafficking victims like her  have gone through.   Despite the system failing to provide justice against her trafficker,  Rebecca has found a way to turn her darkness into light. Since becoming  a survivor, she started the Rebecca Bender Initiative. This program  provides training for those who have the opportunity to be intercepted  and intervene with victims who are often being trafficked.   In this Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I want to commend Rebecca  on her resilience and focus on providing support and compassion to the  victims of trafficking. As co-chair of the Congressional Victims'  Rights Caucus, along with my friend Jim Costa from California, we are  dedicated to ensuring that victims and survivors know that we as a  nation will stand with them.   Traffickers, buyers, and sellers must be prosecuted and sent to the  jailhouse. And with the help of local, State, and Federal law  enforcement, we are going to stop the sale of our children and our  adult women on the marketplace of sex slavery.   Mr. Speaker, the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the United  States, but it is still taking place, and it is time that we defeat  this scourge on our community. Justice demands this, and justice is  what we do.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Peace Corps volunteers represent what  is best about America. They are our angels abroad. They give years of  their lives to help other people. They build goodwill across the globe  for the United States. But many Peace Corps volunteers don't receive  the care that they need both in-country and when they get home.   Peace Corps volunteers struggle to access quality medical treatment  when they are abroad in remote areas of the world. When they return to  America, they face a red tape bureaucratic nightmare.   Congressman Kennedy and I have sponsored the Sam Farr Peace Corps  Enhancement Act. This act will improve and strengthen the health,  safety, and well-being of current and returning Peace Corps volunteers.  It requires that Peace Corps volunteers have access to a qualified  Peace Corps medical officer overseas. It extends their Peace Corps  medical coverage when they return home to America.   America must protect our Peace Corps ambassadors abroad. They are  some of America's best.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  appreciate the gentleman holding the Special Order on China.   It is important that Americans know who the Chinese are, what they  are up to, and what their plans are in the future.   We will start with North Korea. No question about it: China could  rein in North Korea and little Kim if China wanted to. They don't want  to. That is why he is a menace to not only that region, but to the rest  of the world. But China could rein in little Kim. They are storing  millions--maybe billions--of dollars in assets in China. They could  freeze those assets. They could cut off trade with North Korea.    China must understand that it is in their interest that North Korea  not get nuclear weapons; not necessarily our interest, but their  interest. When they come to that realization--which I think it is in  their interest that North Korea be reined in to make sure that they  don't use nuclear weapons or continue to develop nuclear weapons or use  weapons against any of their neighbors--then North Korea will cease its  belligerent activities.   The key lies with Beijing. If they make that decision, the world will  be safer. If they don't make that decision, the world and Beijing will  not be safer either.   Also, I want to point out kind of their philosophy, why they act the  way they do.   Beijing has, first of all, little regard for the lives of the  millions of Chinese citizens. China's communist regime shares more  values with the communist North Korea than it does the U.S.   For decades, Beijing's human rights record has been among the worst  in the whole world. It has persecuted not thousands, but millions of  people who are not followers of communism and Maoism.   Mr. Speaker, remember, communism--because China is a communist  nation, although it is not really politically correct to say that much  anymore, they are a communist nation that teaches against God, and  their God is the state and tells the people you have to worship the  state.   So when you have an atheistic regime in charge, you can see why they  persecute their own people and torture not only Christians and Muslims,  but Tibetans and other people who don't agree with their atheistic  philosophy.   We need to be sure, as a country built on religious freedom, that we  call China out for its abuse and persecution of its own people. I know  we trade with the Chinese. They are a big trading partner. I don't  think trade and money ought to get in the way of calling China out for  abusing the people who live in China and abusing their rights of  religious freedom. We can't turn a blind eye to that merely because we  trade with them as a major trading partner.   We have learned through history that regimes that oppress their own  people just seem to have ambitions beyond their own borders and  subjugate those people as well.                                time  2030    The South China Sea, most Americans probably don't even know where  that is. South China Sea is an area, it is a trading lane, navigation  lane. It has been a trading area.
